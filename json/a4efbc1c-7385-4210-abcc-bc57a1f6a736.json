I like my life enough to want to see it through.</p> <p>I\u2019m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the moment after letting go and the second before they make impact, there has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they look at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, \u201cWell, crap. This was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, I think not.</p><p>I think about death a lot. Particularly today, considering I just\u2014twelve hours earlier\u2014gave one of the most epic eulogies the people of Plethora, Maine, have ever witnessed. Okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t the most epic. It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. My mother, who probably won\u2019t speak to me for a solid year after today.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; the eulogy I delivered wasn\u2019t profound enough to make history, like the one Brooke Shields delivered at Michael Jackson\u2019s funeral. Or the one delivered by Steve Jobs\u2019s sister. Or Pat Tillman\u2019s brother. But it was epic in its own way.</p><p>I was nervous at first. It was the funeral of the prodigious Andrew Bloom, after all. Adored mayor of my hometown of Plethora, Maine. Owner of the most successful real-estate agency within city limits. Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom, the most revered teaching assistant in all of Plethora. And father of Lily Bloom\u2014that strange girl with the erratic red hair who once fell in love with a homeless guy and brought great shame upon her entire family.</p> <p>That would be me. I\u2019m Lily Bloom, and Andrew was my father.</p><p>As soon as I finished delivering his eulogy today, I caught a flight straight back to Boston and hijacked the first roof I could find. Again, not because I\u2019m suicidal. I have no plans to scale off this roof. I just really needed fresh air and silence, and dammit if I can\u2019t get that from my third floor apartment with absolutely no rooftop access and a roommate who likes to hear herself sing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t account for how cold it would be up here, though. It\u2019s not unbearable, but it\u2019s not comfortable, either. At least I can see the stars. Dead fathers and exasperating roommates and questionable eulogies don\u2019t feel so awful when the night sky is clear enough to literally feel the grandeur of the universe.</p><p>I love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant.</p><p>I like tonight.</p><p>Well . . . let me rephrase this so that it more appropriately reflects my feelings in past tense.</p> <p>I liked tonight.</p><p>But unfortunately for me, the door was just shoved open so hard, I expect the stairwell to spit a human out onto the rooftop. The door slams shut again and footsteps move swiftly across the deck. I don\u2019t even bother looking up. Whoever it is more than likely won\u2019t even notice me back here straddling the ledge to the left of the door. They came out here in such a hurry, it isn\u2019t my fault if they assume they\u2019re alone.</p><p>I sigh quietly, close my eyes and lean my head against the stucco wall behind me, cursing the universe for ripping this peaceful, introspective moment out from under me. The least the universe could do for me today is ensure that it\u2019s a woman and not a man. If I\u2019m going to have company, I\u2019d rather it be a female. I\u2019m tough for my size and can probably hold my own in most cases, but I\u2019m too comfortable right now to be on a rooftop alone with a strange man in the middle of the night. I might fear for my safety and feel the need to leave, and I really don\u2019t want to leave. As I said before . . . I\u2019m comfortable.</p><p>I finally allow my eyes to make the journey to the silhouette leaning over the ledge. As luck would have it, he\u2019s definitely male. Even leaning over the rail, I can tell he\u2019s tall. Broad shoulders create a strong contrast to the fragile way he\u2019s holding his head in his hands. I can barely make out the heavy rise and fall of his back as he drags in deep breaths and forces them back out when he\u2019s done with them.</p><p>He appears to be on the verge of a breakdown. I contemplate speaking up to let him know he has company, or clearing my throat, but between thinking it and actually doing it, he spins around and kicks one of the patio chairs behind him.</p><p>I flinch as it screeches across the deck, but being as though he isn\u2019t even aware he has an audience, the guy doesn\u2019t stop with just one kick. He kicks the chair repeatedly, over and over. Rather than give way beneath the blunt force of his foot, all the chair does is scoot farther and farther away from him.</p><p>That chair must be made from marine-grade polymer.</p><p>I once watched my father back over an outdoor patio table made of marine-grade polymer, and it practically laughed at him. Dented his bumper, but didn\u2019t even put a scratch on the table.</p> <p>This guy must realize he\u2019s no match for such a high-quality material, because he finally stops kicking the chair. He\u2019s now standing over it, his hands clenched in fists at his sides. To be honest, I\u2019m a little envious. Here this guy is, taking his aggression out on patio furniture like a champ. He\u2019s obviously had a shitty day, as have I, but whereas I keep my aggression pent up until it manifests in the form of passive-aggressiveness, this guy actually has an outlet.</p><p>My outlet used to be gardening. Any time I was stressed, I\u2019d just go out to the backyard and pull every single weed I could find. But since the day I moved to Boston two years ago, I haven\u2019t had a backyard. Or a patio. I don\u2019t even have weeds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe I need to invest in a marine-grade polymer patio chair.</p><p>I stare at the guy a moment longer, wondering if he\u2019s ever going to move. He\u2019s just standing there, staring down at the chair. His hands aren\u2019t in fists anymore. They\u2019re resting on his hips, and I notice for the first time how his shirt doesn\u2019t fit him very well around his biceps. It fits him everywhere else, but his arms are huge. He begins fishing around in his pockets until he finds what he\u2019s looking for and\u2014in what I\u2019m sure is probably an effort to release even more of his aggression\u2014he lights up a joint.</p><p>I\u2019m twenty-three, I\u2019ve been through college and have done this very same recreational drug a time or two. I\u2019m not going to judge this guy for feeling the need to toke up in private. But that\u2019s the thing\u2014he\u2019s not in private. He just doesn\u2019t know that yet.</p><p>He takes in a long drag of his joint and starts to turn back toward the ledge. He notices me on the exhale. He stops walking the second our eyes meet. His expression holds no shock, nor does it hold amusement when he sees me. He\u2019s about ten feet away, but there\u2019s enough light from the stars that I can see his eyes as they slowly drag over my body without revealing a single thought. This guy holds his cards well. His gaze is narrow and his mouth is drawn tight, like a male version of the Mona Lisa.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I feel his voice in my stomach. That\u2019s not good. Voices should stop at the ears, but sometimes\u2014not very often at all, actually\u2014a voice will penetrate past my ears and reverberate straight down through my body. He has one of those voices. Deep, confident, and a little bit like butter.</p><p>When I don\u2019t answer him, he brings the joint back to his mouth and takes another hit.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d I finally say. I hate my voice. It sounds too weak to even reach his ears from here, much less reverberate inside his body.</p><p>He lifts his chin a little and nudges his head toward me. \u201cWill you please get down from there, Lily?\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t until he says this that I notice his posture. He\u2019s standing straight up now, rigid even. Almost as if he\u2019s nervous I\u2019m going to fall. I\u2019m not. This ledge is at least a foot wide, and I\u2019m mostly on the roof side. I could easily catch myself before I fell, not to mention I\u2019ve got the wind in my favor.</p><p>I glance down at my legs and then back up at him. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.\u201d</p><p>He turns a little, like he can\u2019t look straight at me. \u201cPlease get down.\u201d It\u2019s more of a demand now, despite his use of the word please. \u201cThere are seven empty chairs up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six,\u201d I correct, reminding him that he just tried to murder one of them. He doesn\u2019t find the humor in my response. When I fail to follow his orders, he takes a couple of steps closer.</p><p>\u201cYou are a mere three inches from falling to your death. I\u2019ve been around enough of that for one day.\u201d He motions for me to get down again. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous. Not to mention ruining my high.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and swing my legs over. \u201cHeaven forbid a joint go to waste.\u201d I hop down and wipe my hands across my jeans. \u201cBetter?\u201d I say as I walk toward him.</p> <p>He lets out a rush of air, as if seeing me on the ledge actually had him holding his breath. I pass him to head for the side of the roof with the better view, and as I do, I can\u2019t help but notice how unfortunately cute he is.</p><p>No. Cute is an insult.</p><p>This guy is beautiful. Well-manicured, smells like money, looks to be several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they follow me, and his lips seem to frown, even when they aren\u2019t. When I reach the side of the building that overlooks the street, I lean forward and stare down at the cars below, trying not to appear impressed by him. I can tell by his haircut alone that he\u2019s the kind of man people are easily impressed by, and I refuse to feed into his ego. Not that he\u2019s done anything to make me think he even has one. But he is wearing a casual Burberry shirt, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been on the radar of someone who could casually afford one.</p><p>I hear footsteps approaching from behind, and then he leans against the railing next to me. Out of the corner of my eye, I watch as he takes another hit of his joint. When he\u2019s finished, he offers it to me, but I wave it off. The last thing I need is to be under the influence around this guy. His voice is a drug in itself. I kind of want to hear it again, so I throw a question in his direction.</p><p>\u201cSo what did that chair do to make you so angry?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. Like really looks at me. His eyes meet mine and he just stares, hard, like all my secrets are right there on my face. I\u2019ve never seen eyes as dark as his. Maybe I have, but they seem darker when they\u2019re attached to such an intimidating presence. He doesn\u2019t answer my question, but my curiosity isn\u2019t easily put to rest. If he\u2019s going to force me down from a very peaceful, comfortable ledge, then I expect him to entertain me with answers to my nosy questions.</p><p>\u201cWas it a woman?\u201d I inquire. \u201cDid she break your heart?\u201d</p><p>He laughs a little with that question. \u201cIf only my issues were as trivial as matters of the heart.\u201d He leans into the wall so that he can face me. \u201cWhat floor do you live on?\u201d He licks his fingers and pinches the end of his joint, then puts it back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve never noticed you before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t live here.\u201d I point in the direction of my apartment. \u201cSee that insurance building?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squints as he looks in the direction I\u2019m pointing. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in the building next to it. It\u2019s too short to see from here. It\u2019s only three stories tall.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s facing me again, resting his elbow on the ledge. \u201cIf you live over there, why are you here? Your boyfriend live here or something?\u201d</p><p>His comment somehow makes me feel cheap. It was too easy\u2014an amateurish pickup line. From the looks of this guy, I know he has better skills than that. It makes me think he saves the more difficult pickup lines for the women he deems worthy.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a nice roof,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He lifts an eyebrow, waiting for more of an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI wanted fresh air. Somewhere to think. I pulled up Google Earth and found the closest apartment complex with a decent rooftop patio.\u201d</p><p>He regards me with a smile. \u201cAt least you\u2019re economical,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a good quality to have.\u201d</p><p>At least?</p> <p>I nod, because I am economical. And it is a good quality to have.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you need fresh air?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Because I buried my father today and gave an epically disastrous eulogy and now I feel like I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>I face forward again and slowly exhale. \u201cCan we just not talk for a little while?\u201d</p><p>He seems a bit relieved that I asked for silence. He leans over the ledge and lets an arm dangle as he stares down at the street. He stays like this for a while, and I stare at him the entire time. He probably knows I\u2019m staring, but he doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cA guy fell off this roof last month,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I would be annoyed at his lack of respect for my request for silence, but I\u2019m kind of intrigued.</p><p>\u201cWas it an accident?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNo one knows. It happened late in the evening. His wife said she was cooking dinner and he told her he was coming up here to take some pictures of the sunset. He was a photographer. They think he was leaning over the ledge to get a shot of the skyline, and he slipped.\u201d</p><p>I look over the ledge, wondering how someone could possibly put themselves in a situation where they could fall by accident. But then I remember I was just straddling the ledge on the other side of the roof a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cWhen my sister told me what happened, the only thing I could think about was whether or not he got the shot. I was hoping his camera didn\u2019t fall with him, because that would have been a real waste, you know? To die because of your love of photography, but you didn\u2019t even get the final shot that cost you your life?\u201d</p><p>His thought makes me laugh. Although I\u2019m not sure I should have laughed at that. \u201cDo you always say exactly what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNot to most people.\u201d</p><p>This makes me smile. I like that he doesn\u2019t even know me, but for whatever reason, I\u2019m not considered most people to him.</p> <p>He rests his back against the ledge and folds his arms over his chest. \u201cWere you born here?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Moved here from Maine after I graduated college.\u201d</p><p>He scrunches up his nose, and it\u2019s kind of hot. Watching this guy\u2014dressed in his Burberry shirt with his two-hundred-dollar haircut\u2014making silly faces.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re in Boston purgatory, huh? That\u2019s gotta suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>The corner of his mouth curls up. \u201cThe tourists treat you like a local; the locals treat you like a tourist.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWow. That\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here two months. I\u2019m not even in purgatory yet, so you\u2019re doing better than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you to Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy residency. And my sister lives here.\u201d He taps his foot and says, \u201cRight beneath us, actually. Married a tech-savvy Bostonian and they bought the entire top floor.\u201d</p><p>I look down. \u201cThe entire top floor?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cLucky bastard works from home. Doesn\u2019t even have to change out of his pajamas and makes seven figures a year.\u201d</p><p>Lucky bastard, indeed.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of residency? Are you a doctor?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cNeurosurgeon. Less than a year left of my residency and then it\u2019s official.\u201d</p><p>Stylish, well spoken, and smart. And smokes pot. If this were an SAT question, I would ask which one didn\u2019t belong. \u201cShould doctors be smoking weed?\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cProbably not. But if we didn\u2019t indulge on occasion, there would be a lot more of us taking the leap over these ledges, I can promise you that.\u201d He\u2019s facing forward again with his chin resting on his arms. His eyes are closed now, like he\u2019s enjoying the wind against his face. He doesn\u2019t look as intimidating like this.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know something that only the locals know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, bringing his attention back to me.</p><p>I point to the east. \u201cSee that building? The one with the green roof?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a building behind it on Melcher. There\u2019s a house on top of the building. Like a legit house, built right on the rooftop. You can\u2019t see it from the street, and the building is so tall that not many people even know about it.\u201d</p><p>He looks impressed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI saw it when I was searching Google Earth, so I looked it up. Apparently a permit was granted for the construction in 1982. How cool would that be? To live in a house on top of a building?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d get the whole roof to yourself,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that.

It\u2019s one of the great mysteries of Boston.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and then looks at me inquisitively. \u201cWhat\u2019s another great mystery of Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name.\u201d As soon as I say it, I slap my hand against my forehead. It sounded so much like a cheesy pickup line; the only thing I can do is laugh at myself.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s Ryle,\u201d he says. \u201cRyle Kincaid.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, sinking into myself. \u201cThat\u2019s a really great name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound sad about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, I\u2019d give anything for a great name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the name Lily?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head and cock an eyebrow. \u201cMy last name . . . is Bloom.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet. I can feel him trying to hold back his pity.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s the name of a two-year-old little girl, not a twenty-three-year-old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA two-year-old girl will have the same name no matter how old she gets. Names aren\u2019t something we eventually grow out of, Lily Bloom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately for me,\u201d I say. \u201cBut what makes it even worse is that I absolutely love gardening. I love flowers. Plants. Growing things. It\u2019s my passion. It\u2019s always been my dream to open a florist shop, but I\u2019m afraid if I did, people wouldn\u2019t think my desire was authentic. They would think I was trying to capitalize off my name and that being a florist isn\u2019t really my dream job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what\u2019s that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, I suppose.\u201d I catch myself whispering, \u201cLily Bloom\u2019s\u201d quietly. I can see him smiling a little bit. \u201cIt really is a great name for a florist. But I have a master\u2019s degree in business. I\u2019d be downgrading, don\u2019t you think? I work for the biggest marketing firm in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwning your own business isn\u2019t downgrading,\u201d he says.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cUnless it flops.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement. \u201cUnless it flops,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what\u2019s your middle name, Lily Bloom?\u201d</p><p>I groan, which makes him perk up.</p><p>\u201cYou mean it gets worse?\u201d</p> <p>I drop my head in my hands and nod.</p><p>\u201cRose?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d I cringe and then mutter, \u201cBlossom.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence. \u201cGoddamn,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Blossom is my mother\u2019s maiden name and my parents thought it was fate that their last names were synonyms. So of course when they had me, a flower was their first choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents must be real assholes.\u201d</p><p>One of them is. Was. \u201cMy father died this week.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me. \u201cNice try. I\u2019m not falling for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. That\u2019s why I came up here tonight. I think I just needed a good cry.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me suspiciously for a moment to make sure I\u2019m not pulling his leg. He doesn\u2019t apologize for the blunder. Instead, his eyes grow a little more curious, like his intrigue is actually authentic. \u201cWere you close?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a hard question. I rest my chin on my arms and look down at the street again. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say with a shrug. \u201cAs his daughter, I loved him. But as a human, I hated him.\u201d</p><p>I can feel him watching me for a moment, and then he says, \u201cI like that. Your honesty.\u201d</p><p>He likes my honesty. I think I might be blushing.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet again for a while, and then he says, \u201cDo you ever wish people were more transparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>He picks at a piece of chipped stucco with his thumb until it breaks loose. He flicks it over the ledge. \u201cI feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we\u2019re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.\u201d</p><p>Either his high is setting in, or he\u2019s just very introspective. Either way, I\u2019m okay with it. My favorite conversations are the ones with no real answers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think being a little guarded is a negative thing,\u201d I say. \u201cNaked truths aren\u2019t always pretty.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a moment. \u201cNaked truths,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI like that.\u201d He turns around and walks to the middle of the rooftop. He adjusts the back on one of the patio loungers behind me and lowers himself onto it. It\u2019s the kind you lie on, so he pulls his hands behind his head and looks up at the sky. I claim the one next to him and adjust it until I\u2019m in the same position as him.</p><p>\u201cTell me a naked truth, Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPertaining to what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something you aren\u2019t proud of. Something that will make me feel a little less screwed up on the inside.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring up at the sky, waiting on me to answer. My eyes follow the line of his jaw, the curve of his cheeks, the outline of his lips. His eyebrows are drawn together in contemplation. I don\u2019t understand why, but he seems to need conversation right now. I think about his question and try to find an honest answer. When I come up with one, I look away from him and back up to the sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father was abusive. Not to me\u2014to my mother. He would get so angry when they fought that sometimes he would hit her. When that happened, he would spend the next week or two making up for it. He would do things like buy her flowers or take us out to a nice dinner. Sometimes he would buy me stuff because he knew I hated it when they fought. When I was a kid, I found myself looking forward to the nights they would fight. Because I knew if he hit her, the two weeks that followed would be great.\u201d I pause. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever admitted that to myself. \u201cOf course if I could, I would have made it to where he never touched her. But the abuse was inevitable with their marriage, and it became our norm. When I got older, I realized that not doing something about it made me just as guilty. I spent most of my life hating him for being such a bad person, but I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m much better. Maybe we\u2019re both bad people.\u201d</p><p>Ryle looks over at me with a thoughtful expression. \u201cLily,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cThere is no such thing as bad people. We\u2019re all just people who sometimes do bad things.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to respond, but his words strike me silent. We\u2019re all just people who sometimes do bad things. I guess that\u2019s true in a way. No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I tell him.</p> <p>Based on his reaction, I think he might not want to play his own game. He sighs heavily and runs a hand through his hair. He opens his mouth to speak, but then clamps it shut again. He thinks for a bit, and then finally speaks. \u201cI watched a little boy die tonight.\u201d His voice is despondent. \u201cHe was only five years old. He and his little brother found a gun in his parents\u2019 bedroom. The younger brother was holding it and it went off by accident.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flips. I think this may be a little too much truth for me.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing that could be done by the time he made it to the operating table. Everyone around\u2014nurses, other doctors\u2014they all felt so sorry for the family. \u2018Those poor parents,\u2019 they said. But when I had to walk into the waiting room and tell those parents that their child didn\u2019t make it, I didn\u2019t feel an ounce of sorrow for them. I wanted them to suffer. I wanted them to feel the weight of their ignorance for keeping a loaded gun within access of two innocent children. I wanted them to know that not only did they just lose a child, they just ruined the entire life of the one who accidentally pulled the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. I wasn\u2019t prepared for something so heavy.</p><p>I can\u2019t even conceive how a family moves past that. \u201cThat poor boy\u2019s brother,\u201d I say. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s going to do to him\u2014seeing something like that.\u201d</p> <p>Ryle flicks something off the knee of his jeans. \u201cIt\u2019ll destroy him for life, that\u2019s what it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my side to face him, lifting my head up onto my hand. \u201cIs it hard? Seeing things like that every day?\u201d</p><p>He gives his head a slight shake. \u201cIt should be a lot harder, but the more I\u2019m around death, the more it just becomes a part of life. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.\u201d He makes eye contact with me again. \u201cGive me another one,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like mine was a little more twisted than yours.\u201d</p><p>I disagree, but I tell him about the twisted thing I did a mere twelve hours ago.</p><p>\u201cMy mother asked me two days ago if I would deliver the eulogy at my father\u2019s funeral today. I told her I didn\u2019t feel comfortable\u2014that I might be crying too hard to speak in front of a crowd\u2014but that was a lie. I just didn\u2019t want to do it because I feel like eulogies should be delivered by those who respected the deceased. And I didn\u2019t much respect my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cYeah. This morning.\u201d I sit up and pull my legs beneath me as I face him. \u201cYou want to hear it?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I fold my hands in my lap and inhale a breath. \u201cI had no idea what to say. About an hour before the funeral, I told my mother I didn\u2019t want to do it. She said it was simple and that my father would have wanted me to do it. She said all I had to do was walk up to the podium and say five great things about my father. So . . . that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d</p><p>Ryle lifts up onto his elbow, appearing even more interested. He can tell by the look on my face that it gets worse. \u201cOh, no, Lily. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Let me just reenact it for you.\u201d I stand up and walk around to the other side of my chair. I stand tall and act like I\u2019m looking out over the same crowded room I was met with this morning. I clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cHello. My name is Lily Bloom, daughter of the late Andrew Bloom. Thank you all for joining us today as we mourn his loss. I wanted to take a moment to honor his life by sharing with you five great things about my father. The first thing . . .\u201d</p><p>I look down at Ryle and shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>He sits up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>I take a seat on my lounge chair and lie back down. \u201cI stood up there for two solid minutes without saying another word. There wasn\u2019t one great thing I could say about that man\u2014so I just stared silently at the crowd until my mother realized what I was doing and had my uncle remove me from the podium.\u201d</p><p>Ryle tilts his head. \u201cAre you kidding me? You gave the anti-eulogy at your own father\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. I don\u2019t think. I mean, if I had my way, he would have been a much better person and I would have stood up there and talked for an hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryle lies back down. \u201cWow,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of my hero. You just roasted a dead guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s tacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Naked truth hurts.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t top that,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can come close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYes you can. Don\u2019t make me feel like the worst person out of the two of us. Tell me the most recent thought you\u2019ve had that most people wouldn\u2019t say out loud.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his hands up behind his head and looks me straight in the eye. \u201cI want to fuck you.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth falls open. Then I clamp it shut again.</p><p>I think I might be speechless.</p><p>He shoots me a look of innocence. \u201cYou asked for the most recent thought, so I gave it to you. You\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m a guy. If you were into one-night stands, I would take you downstairs to my bedroom and I would fuck you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even look at him. His statement makes me feel a multitude of things all at once.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not into one-night stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much,\u201d he says. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s so nonchalant; he acts as if he didn\u2019t just stun me into silence.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute to regroup after that one,\u201d I say with a laugh. I try to think of something with a little shock value, but I can\u2019t get over the fact that he just said that. Out loud. Maybe because he\u2019s a neurosurgeon and I never pictured someone so educated throwing around the word fuck so casually.</p><p>I gather myself . . . somewhat . . . and then say, \u201cOkay. Since we\u2019re on the subject . . . the first guy I ever had sex with was homeless.\u201d</p><p>He perks up and faces me. \u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna need more of this story.\u201d</p><p>I stretch my arm out and rest my head on it. \u201cI grew up in Maine. We lived in a fairly decent neighborhood, but the street behind our house wasn\u2019t in the best condition. Our backyard butted up to a condemned house adjacent to two abandoned lots. I became friends with a guy named Atlas who stayed in the condemned house. No one knew he was living there other than me. I used to take him food and clothes and stuff. Until my father found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>My jaw tightens. I don\u2019t know why I brought this up when I still force myself not to think about it on a daily basis. \u201cHe beat him up.\u201d That\u2019s as naked as I want to get about that subject. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He regards me silently for a moment, as if he knows there\u2019s more to that story. But then he breaks eye contact. \u201cThe thought of marriage repulses me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m almost thirty years old and I have no desire for a wife. I especially don\u2019t want children. The only thing I want out of life is success. Lots of it. But if I admit that out loud to anyone, it makes me sound arrogant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProfessional success? Or social status?\u201d</p><p>He says, \u201cBoth. Anyone can have children. Anyone can get married. But not everyone can be a neurosurgeon. I get a lot of pride out of that. And I don\u2019t just want to be a great neurosurgeon. I want to be the best in my field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It does make you sound arrogant.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cMy mother fears I\u2019m wasting my life away because all I do is work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a neurosurgeon and your mother is disappointed in you?\u201d I laugh. \u201cGood lord, that\u2019s insane. Are parents ever really happy with their children? Will they ever be good enough?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cMy children wouldn\u2019t be. Not many people have the drive I do, so I\u2019d only be setting them up for failure. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll never have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think that\u2019s respectable, Ryle. A lot of people refuse to admit they might be too selfish to have children.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cOh, I\u2019m way too selfish to have children. And I\u2019m definitely way too selfish to be in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do you avoid it? You just don\u2019t date?\u201d</p><p>He cuts his eyes to me, and there\u2019s a slight grin affixed to his face. \u201cWhen I have time, there are girls who satisfy those needs. I don\u2019t lack for anything in that department, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. But love has never appealed to me. It\u2019s always been more of a burden than anything.\u201d</p><p>I wish I looked at love like that. It would make my life a hell of a lot easier. \u201cI envy you. I have this idea that there\u2019s a perfect man out there for me. I tend to become jaded easily, because no one ever meets my standards. I feel like I\u2019m on an infinite search for the Holy Grail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try my method,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-night stands.\u201d He raises an eyebrow, like it\u2019s an invitation.</p><p>I\u2019m glad it\u2019s dark, because my face is on fire. \u201cI could never sleep with someone if I didn\u2019t see it going anywhere.\u201d I say this out loud, but my words lack conviction when I say it to him.</p><p>He drags in a long, slow breath, and then rolls onto his back. \u201cNot that kind of girl, huh?\u201d He says this with a trace of disappointment in his voice.</p><p>I match his disappointment. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d even want to turn him down if he made a move, but I might have just thwarted that possibility.</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t sleep with someone you just met . . .\u201d His eyes meet mine again. \u201cExactly how far would you go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t have an answer for that. I roll onto my back because the way he\u2019s looking at me makes me want to rethink one-night stands. I\u2019m not necessarily against them, I suppose. I\u2019ve just never been propositioned for one by someone I would consider it with.</p><p>Until now. I think. Is he even propositioning me? I\u2019ve always been terrible at flirting.</p><p>He reaches out and grabs the edge of my lounge chair. In one swift movement and with very minimal effort, he drags my chair closer to him until it bumps his.</p><p>My whole body stiffens. He\u2019s so close now, I can feel the warmth of his breath cutting through the cold air. If I were to look at him, his face would be mere inches from mine. I refuse to look at him, because he\u2019d probably kiss me and I know absolutely nothing about this guy, other than a couple of naked truths. But that doesn\u2019t weigh on my conscience at all when he rests a heavy hand on my stomach.</p> <p>\u201cHow far would you go, Lily?\u201d His voice is decadent. Smooth. It travels straight to my toes. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>His fingers begin to crawl toward the hem of my shirt. He begins to slowly inch it upward until a slither of my stomach is showing. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d I whisper, feeling the warmth from his hand as he slides it up my stomach.</p><p>Against my better judgment, I face him again and the look in his eyes completely captivates me. He looks hopeful and hungry and completely confident. He sinks his teeth into his bottom lip as his hand begins to tease its way up my shirt. I know he can feel my heart thrashing around in my chest. Hell, he can probably hear it.</p><p>\u201cIs this too far?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where this side of me is coming from, but I shake my head and say, \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p> <p>With a grin, his fingers brush the underneath of my bra, lightly trickling over my skin that is now covered in chills. As soon as my eyelids fall shut, the piercing of a ring rips through the air. His hand stiffens when we both realize it\u2019s a phone. His phone.</p><p>He drops his forehead to my shoulder. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>I frown when his hand slips out from beneath my shirt. He fumbles in his pocket for his phone, standing up and walking several feet away from me to take the call.</p><p>\u201cDr. Kincaid,\u201d he says. He listens intently, his hand gripping the back of his neck. \u201cWhat about Roberts? I\u2019m not even supposed to be on call right now.\u201d More silence is followed with, \u201cYeah, give me ten minutes. On my way.\u201d</p><p>He ends the call and slides his phone back in his pocket. When he turns to face me, he looks a little disappointed. He points to the door that leads to the stairwell. \u201cI have to . . .\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>He considers me for a moment, and then holds up a finger. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he says, reaching for his phone again. He walks closer and holds it up as if he\u2019s about to snap a picture of me. I almost object, but I don\u2019t even know why. I\u2019m fully clothed. It just doesn\u2019t feel that way for some reason.</p><p>He snaps a picture of me lying in the lounge chair, my arms relaxed above my head. I have no idea what he plans to do with that picture, but I like that he took it. I like that he had the urge to remember what I look like, even though he knows he\u2019ll never see me again.</p><p>He stares at the photo on his screen for a few seconds and smiles. I\u2019m half-tempted to take a picture of him in return, but I\u2019m not sure I want a reminder of someone I\u2019ll never see again. The thought of that is a little depressing.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Lily Bloom. I hope you defy the odds of most dreams and actually accomplish yours.\u201d</p><p>I smile, equally saddened and confused by this guy. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever spent time with someone like him before\u2014someone of a completely different lifestyle and tax bracket. I probably never will again. But I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to see that we aren\u2019t all that different.</p><p>Misconception confirmed.</p><p>He looks down at his feet for a moment as he stands in somewhat of an unsure pose. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s suspended between the desire to say something else to me and the need to leave. He glances at me one last time\u2014this time without so much of a poker face. I can see the disappointment in the set of his mouth before he turns and walks in the other direction. He opens the door and I can hear his footsteps fade as he rushes down the stairwell. I\u2019m alone on the rooftop once again, but to my surprise, I\u2019m a little saddened by that now.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Lucy\u2014the roommate who loves to hear herself sing\u2014is rushing around the living room, gathering keys, shoes, a pair of sunglasses. I\u2019m seated on the couch, opening up shoeboxes stuffed with some of my old things from when I lived at home. I grabbed them when I was home for my father\u2019s funeral this week.</p><p>\u201cYou work today?\u201d Lucy asks.</p><p>\u201cNope. I have bereavement leave until Monday.\u201d</p><p>She stops in her tracks. \u201cMonday?\u201d She scoffs. \u201cLucky bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lucy. I\u2019m so lucky my father died.\u201d I say it sarcastically, of course, but I cringe when I realize it\u2019s not actually very sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she mutters. She grabs her purse as she balances on one foot while sliding her shoe onto the other. \u201cI\u2019m not coming home tonight. Staying over at Alex\u2019s house.\u201d The door slams behind her.</p><p>We have a lot in common on the surface, but beyond wearing the same size clothes, being the same age, and both having four-letter names that start with an L and end with a Y, there\u2019s not much else there that makes us more than just roommates. I\u2019m okay with that, though. Other than the incessant singing, she\u2019s pretty tolerable. She\u2019s clean and she\u2019s gone a lot. Two of the most important qualities in a roommate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m pulling the lid off the top of one of the shoeboxes when my cell phone rings. I reach across the couch and grab it. When I see that it\u2019s my mother, I press my face into the couch and fake-cry into a throw pillow.</p><p>I bring the phone to my ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s three seconds of silence, and then\u2014\u201cHello, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and sit back up on the couch. \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d I\u2019m really surprised she\u2019s speaking to me. It\u2019s only been one day since the funeral. That\u2019s 364 days sooner than I expected to hear from her.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She sighs dramatically. \u201cFine,\u201d she says. \u201cYour aunt and uncle went back to Nebraska this morning. It\u2019ll be my first night alone since . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Mom,\u201d I say, trying to sound confident.</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for too long, and then she says, \u201cLily. I just want you to know that you shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about what happened yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I pause. I wasn\u2019t. Not even the slightest bit.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone freezes up once in a while. I shouldn\u2019t have put that kind of pressure on you, knowing how hard the day was on you already. I should have just had your uncle do it.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. Here she goes again. Covering up what she doesn\u2019t want to see. Taking blame that isn\u2019t even hers to take. Of course she convinced herself that I froze up yesterday, and that\u2019s why I refused to speak. Of course she did. I have half a mind to tell her it wasn\u2019t a mistake. I didn\u2019t freeze up. I just had nothing great to say about the unremarkable man she chose to be my father.</p><p>But part of me does feel guilty for what I did\u2014specifically because it\u2019s not something I should have done in the presence of my mother\u2014so I just accept what she\u2019s doing and go along with it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom. Sorry I choked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Lily. I need to go, I have to run to the insurance office. We have a meeting about your father\u2019s policies. Call me tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I tell her. \u201cLove you, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>I end the call and toss the phone across the couch. I open the shoebox on my lap and pull out the contents. On the very top is a small wooden, hollow heart. I run my fingers over it and remember the night I was given this heart. As soon as the memory begins to sink in, I set it aside. Nostalgia is a funny thing.</p><p>I move a few old letters and newspaper clippings aside. Beneath all of it, I find what I was hoping was inside these boxes. And also sort of hoping wasn\u2019t.</p><p>My Ellen Diaries.</p><p>I run my hands over them. There are three of them in this box, but I\u2019d say there are probably eight or nine total. I haven\u2019t read any of these since the last time I wrote in them.</p><p>I refused to admit that I kept a diary when I was younger because that was so clich\u00e9. Instead, I convinced myself that what I was doing was cool, because it wasn\u2019t technically a diary. I addressed each of my entries to Ellen DeGeneres, because I began watching her show the first day it aired in 2003 when I was just a little girl. I watched it every day after school and was convinced Ellen would love me if she got to know me. I wrote letters to her regularly until I turned sixteen, but I wrote them like one would write entries in a diary. Of course I knew the last thing Ellen DeGeneres probably wanted was a random girl\u2019s journal entries. Luckily, I never actually sent any in. But I still liked addressing all the entries to her, so I continued to do that until I stopped writing in them altogether.</p><p>I open another shoebox and find more of them. I sort through them until I grab the one from when I was fifteen years old. I flip it open, searching for the day I met Atlas. There wasn\u2019t much that happened in my life worth writing about before he entered it, but somehow I filled six journals full before he ever came into the picture.</p><p>I swore I\u2019d never read these again, but with the passing of my father, I\u2019ve been thinking about my childhood a lot. Maybe if I read through these journals I\u2019ll somehow find a little strength for forgiveness. Although I fear I\u2019m running the risk of building up even more resentment.</p><p>I lie back on the couch and I begin reading.</p> <p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Before I tell you what happened today, I have a really good idea for a new segment on your show. It\u2019s called, \u201cEllen at home.\u201d</p><p>I think lots of people would like to see you outside of work. I always wonder what you\u2019re like at your home when it\u2019s just you and Portia and the cameras aren\u2019t around. Maybe the producers can give her a camera and sometimes she can just sneak up on you and film you doing normal things, like watching TV or cooking or gardening. She could film you for a few seconds without you knowing and then she could scream, \u201cEllen at home!\u201d and scare you. It\u2019s only fair, since you love pranks.</p><p>Okay, now that I told you that (I keep meaning to and have been forgetting) I\u2019ll tell you about my day yesterday. It was interesting. Probably my most interesting day to write about yet, if you don\u2019t count the day Abigail Ivory slapped Mr. Carson for looking at her cleavage.</p><p>You remember a while back when I told you about Mrs. Burleson who lived behind us? She died the night of that big snowstorm? My dad said she owed so much in taxes that her daughter wasn\u2019t able to take ownership of the house. Which is fine by her, I\u2019m sure, because the house was starting to fall apart anyway. It probably would have been more of a burden than anything.</p><p>The house has been empty since Mrs. Burleson died, which has been about two years. I know it\u2019s been empty because my bedroom window looks out over the backyard, and there hasn\u2019t been a single soul that goes in or out of that house since I can remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until last night.</p><p>I was in bed shuffling cards. I know that sounds weird, but it\u2019s just something I do. I don\u2019t even know how to play cards. But when my parents get into fights, shuffling cards just calms me down sometimes and gives me something to focus on.</p><p>Anyway, it was dark outside, so I noticed the light right away. It wasn\u2019t bright, but it was coming from that old house. It looked more like candlelight than anything, so I went to the back porch and found Dad\u2019s binoculars. I tried to see what was going on over there, but I couldn\u2019t see anything. It was way too dark. Then after a little while, the light went out.</p><p>This morning, when I was getting ready for school, I saw something moving behind that house. I crouched down at my bedroom window and saw someone sneaking out the back door. It was a guy and he had a backpack. He looked around like he was making sure no one saw him, and then he walked between our house and the neighbor\u2019s house and went and stood at the bus stop.</p> <p>I\u2019d never seen him before. It was the first time he rode my bus. He sat in the back and I sat in the middle, so I didn\u2019t talk to him. But when he got off the bus at school, I saw him walk into the school, so he must go there.</p><p>I have no idea why he was sleeping in that house. There\u2019s probably no electricity or running water. I thought maybe he did it as a dare, but today he got off the bus at the same stop as me. He walked down the street like he was going somewhere else, but I ran straight to my room and watched out the window. Sure enough, a few minutes later, I saw him sneaking back inside that empty house.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I should say something to my mother. I hate to be nosy, because it\u2019s none of my business. But if that guy doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go, I feel like my mother would know how to help him since she works at a school.</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I might wait a couple days before I say something and see if he goes back home. He might just need a break from his parents. Same as I wish I could have sometimes.</p><p>That\u2019s all. I\u2019ll let you know what happens tomorrow.</p> <p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I fast-forward through all your dancing when I watch your show. I used to watch the beginning when you danced through the audience, but I get a little bored with it now and would rather just hear you talk. I hope that doesn\u2019t make you mad.</p><p>Okay, so I found out who the guy is, and yes, he\u2019s still going over there. It\u2019s been two days now and I still haven\u2019t told anyone.</p><p>His name is Atlas Corrigan and he\u2019s a senior, but that\u2019s all I know. I asked Katie who he was when she sat next to me on the bus. She rolled her eyes and told me his name. But then she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else about him, but he smells.\u201d She scrunched up her nose like it grossed her out. I wanted to yell at her and tell her he can\u2019t help it, that he doesn\u2019t have any running water. But instead, I just looked back at him. I might have stared a little too much, because he caught me looking at him.</p><p>When I got home I went to the backyard to do some gardening. My radishes were ready to be pulled, so I was out there pulling them. The radishes are the only thing left in my garden. It\u2019s starting to get cold so there\u2019s not much else I can plant right now. I probably could have waited a few more days to pull them, but I was also outside because I was being nosy.</p> <p>I noticed as I was pulling them that some were missing. It looked like they had just been dug up. I know I didn\u2019t pull them and my parents never mess with my garden.</p><p>That\u2019s when I thought about Atlas, and how it was more than likely him. I hadn\u2019t thought about how\u2014if he doesn\u2019t have access to a shower\u2014he probably doesn\u2019t have food, either.</p><p>I went inside my house and made a couple of sandwiches. I grabbed two sodas out of the fridge and a bag of chips. I put them in a lunch bag and I ran it over to the abandoned house and set it on the back porch by the door. I wasn\u2019t sure if he saw me, so I knocked real hard and then ran back to my house and went straight to my room. By the time I got to the window to see if he was going to come outside, the bag was already gone.</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew he\u2019d been watching me. I\u2019m kind of nervous now that he knows I know he\u2019s staying there. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say to him if he tries to talk to me tomorrow.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I saw your interview with the presidential candidate Barack Obama today. Does that make you nervous? Interviewing people who could potentially run the country? I don\u2019t know a lot about politics, but I don\u2019t think I could be funny under that kind of pressure.</p><p>Man. So much has happened to both of us. You just interviewed someone who might be our next president and I\u2019m feeding a homeless boy.</p> <p>This morning when I got to the bus stop, Atlas was already there. It was just the two of us at first, and I\u2019m not gonna lie, it was awkward. I could see the bus coming around the corner and I was wishing it would drive a little faster. Right when it pulled up, he took a step closer to me and, without looking up, he said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened on the bus and he let me walk on first. I didn\u2019t say You\u2019re welcome because I was kind of shocked by my reaction. His voice gave me chills, Ellen.</p><p>Has a boy\u2019s voice ever done that to you?</p><p>Oh, wait. Sorry. Has a girl\u2019s voice ever done that to you?</p><p>He didn\u2019t sit by me or anything on the way there, but on the way back from school, he was the last one getting on. There weren\u2019t any empty seats, but I could tell by the way he scanned all the people on the bus that he wasn\u2019t looking for an empty seat. He was looking for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When his eyes met mine, I looked down at my lap real quick. I hate that I\u2019m not very confident around guys. Maybe that\u2019s something I\u2019ll grow into when I finally turn sixteen.</p><p>He sat down next to me and dropped his backpack between his legs. That\u2019s when I noticed what Katie was talking about. He did kind of smell, but I didn\u2019t judge him for that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything at first, but he was fidgeting with a hole in his jeans. It wasn\u2019t the kind of hole that was there to make jeans look stylish. I could tell it was there because it was a genuine hole, due to his pants being old. They actually looked a little too small for him, because his ankles were showing. But he was skinny enough that they fit him just fine everywhere else.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d he asked me.</p> <p>I looked at him when he spoke, and he was looking right back at me like he was worried. It was the first time I had actually gotten a good look at him. His hair was dark brown, but I thought maybe if he washed it, it wouldn\u2019t be as dark as it looked right then. His eyes were bright, unlike the rest of him. Real blue eyes, like the kind you see on a Siberian husky. I shouldn\u2019t compare his eyes to a dog, but that\u2019s the first thing I thought when I saw them.</p><p>I shook my head and looked back out the window. I thought he might get up and find another seat at that point, since I said I didn\u2019t tell anyone, but he didn\u2019t. The bus made a few stops, and the fact that he was still sitting by me gave me a little courage, so I made my voice a whisper. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you live at home with your parents?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a few seconds, like he was trying to decide if he wanted to trust me or not. Then he said, \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he got up. I thought I\u2019d made him mad, but then I realized he got up because we were at our stop. I grabbed my stuff and followed him off the bus. He didn\u2019t try to hide where he was heading today like he usually does. Normally, he walks down the street and goes around the block so I don\u2019t see him cut through my backyard. But today he started to walk toward my yard with me.</p><p>When we got to where I would normally turn to go inside and he would keep walking, we both stopped. He kicked at the dirt with his foot and looked behind me at my house.</p> <p>\u201cWhat time do your parents get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround five,\u201d I said. It was 3:45.</p><p>He nodded and looked like he was about to say something else, but he didn\u2019t. He just nodded again and started walking toward that house with no food or electricity or water.</p><p>Now, Ellen, I know what I did next was stupid, so you don\u2019t have to tell me. I called out his name, and when he stopped and turned around I said, \u201cIf you hurry, you can take a shower before they get home.\u201d</p><p>My heart was beating so fast, because I knew how much trouble I could get into if my parents came home and found a homeless guy in our shower. I\u2019d probably very well die. But I just couldn\u2019t watch him walk back to his house without offering him something.</p><p>He looked down at the ground again, and I felt his embarrassment in my own stomach. He didn\u2019t even nod. He just followed me inside my house and never said a word.</p> <p>The whole time he was in the shower, I was panicking. I kept looking out the window and checking for either of my parents\u2019 cars, even though I knew it would be a good hour before they got home. I was nervous one of the neighbors might have seen him come inside, but they didn\u2019t really know me well enough to think having a visitor would be abnormal.</p><p>I had given Atlas a change of clothes, and knew he not only needed to be out of the house when my parents got home, but he needed to be far away from our house. I\u2019m sure my father would recognize his own clothes on some random teenager in the neighborhood.</p><p>In between looking out the window and checking the clock, I was filling up one of my old backpacks with stuff. Food that didn\u2019t need refrigerating, a couple of my father\u2019s T-shirts, a pair of jeans that were probably going to be two sizes too big for him, and a change of socks.</p><p>I was zipping up the backpack when he emerged from the hallway.</p><p>I was right. Even wet, I could tell his hair was lighter than it looked earlier. It made his eyes look even bluer.</p><p>He must have shaved while he was in there because he looked younger than he did before he got in the shower. I swallowed and looked back down at the backpack, because I was shocked at how different he looked. I was scared he might see my thoughts written across my face.</p><p>I looked out the window one more time and handed him the backpack. \u201cYou might want to go out the back door so no one sees you.\u201d</p><p>He took the backpack from me and stared at my face for a minute. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he said as he slung the pack over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cLily.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was the first time he\u2019d smiled at me and I had an awful, shallow thought in that moment. I wondered how someone with such a great smile could have such shitty parents. I immediately hated myself for thinking it, because of course parents should love their kids no matter how cute or ugly or skinny or fat or smart or stupid they are. But sometimes you can\u2019t control where your mind goes. You just have to train it not to go there anymore.</p><p>He held out his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m Atlas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, without shaking his hand. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t shake his hand. It wasn\u2019t because I was scared to touch him. I mean, I was scared to touch him. But not because I thought I was better than him. He just made me so nervous.</p><p>He put his hand down and nodded once, then said, \u201cI guess I better go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stepped aside so he could walk around me. He pointed past the kitchen, silently asking if that was the way to the back door. I nodded and walked behind him as he made his way down the hall. When he reached the back door, I saw him pause for a second when he saw my bedroom.</p><p>I was suddenly embarrassed that he was seeing my bedroom. No one ever sees my bedroom, so I\u2019ve never felt the need to give it a more mature look. I still have the same pink bedspread and curtains I\u2019ve had since I was twelve. For the first time ever I felt like ripping down my poster of Adam Brody.</p><p>Atlas didn\u2019t seem to care how my room was decorated. He looked straight at my window\u2014the one that looks out over the backyard\u2014then he glanced back at me. Right before he walked out the back door he said, \u201cThank you for not being disparaging, Lily.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone.</p> <p>Of course I\u2019ve heard the term disparaging before, but it was weird hearing a teenage guy use it. What\u2019s even weirder is how everything about Atlas seems so contradictory. How does a guy who is obviously humble, well-mannered, and uses words like disparaging end up homeless? How does any teenager end up homeless?</p><p>I need to find out, Ellen.</p><p>I\u2019m going to find out what happened to him. You just wait and see.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>I\u2019m about to open another entry when my phone rings. I crawl across the couch for it and I\u2019m not the least bit surprised to see it\u2019s my mother again. Now that my father has passed and she\u2019s alone, she\u2019ll probably call me twice as much as she did before.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about my moving to Boston?\u201d she blurts out.</p><p>I grab the throw pillow next to me and shove my face into it, muffling a scream. \u201cUm. Wow,\u201d I say. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet, and then, \u201cIt was just a thought. We can discuss it tomorrow. I\u2019m almost to my meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bye.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, I want to move out of Massachusetts. She can\u2019t move here. She doesn\u2019t know anyone here. She\u2019d expect me to entertain her every day. I love my mother, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I moved to Boston to be on my own, and having her in the same city would make me feel less independent.</p><p>My father was diagnosed with cancer three years ago while I was still in college. If Ryle Kincaid were here right now, I\u2019d tell him the naked truth that I was a little bit relieved when my father became too ill to physically hurt my mother. It completely changed the dynamic of their relationship and I no longer felt obligated to stay in Plethora to make sure she was okay.</p><p>Now that my father is gone and I never have to worry about my mother again, I was looking forward to spreading my wings, so to speak.</p><p>But now she\u2019s moving to Boston?</p><p>It feels like my wings were just clipped.</p><p>Where is a marine-grade polymer chair when I need one?!</p><p>I\u2019m seriously stressing out and I have no idea what I\u2019d do if my mother moves to Boston. I don\u2019t have a garden, or a yard, or a patio, or weeds.</p><p>I have to find another outlet.</p> <p>I decide to clean. I place all of my old shoeboxes full of journals and notes in my bedroom closet. Then I organize my entire closet. My jewelry, my shoes, my clothes . . .</p><p>She cannot move to Boston.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Six months later</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all she says.</p><p>My mother turns and assesses the building, running a finger over the windowsill next to her. She picks up a layer of dust and wipes it between her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs a lot of work, I know,\u201d I interrupt. I point at the windows behind her. \u201cBut look at the storefront. It has potential.\u201d</p><p>She scrolls over the windows, nodding. There\u2019s this sound she makes in the back of her throat sometimes, where she agrees with a little hum but her lips remain tight. It means she doesn\u2019t actually agree. And she makes that sound. Twice.</p><p>I drop my arms in defeat. \u201cYou think this was stupid?\u201d</p><p>She gives her head a slight shake. \u201cThat all depends on how it turns out, Lily,\u201d she says. The building used to house a restaurant and it\u2019s still full of old tables and chairs. My mother walks over to a nearby table and pulls out one of the chairs, taking a seat. \u201cIf things work out, and your floral shop is successful, then people will say it was a brave, bold, smart business decision. But if it fails and you lose your entire inheritance . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen people will say it was a stupid business decision.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it works. You majored in business, you know that.\u201d She glances around the room, slowly, as if she\u2019s seeing it the way it will look a month from now. \u201cJust make sure it\u2019s brave and bold, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I smile. I can accept that. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I bought it without asking you first,\u201d I say, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s your right,\u201d she says, but I can hear a trace of disappointment. I think she feels even lonelier now that I need her less and less. It\u2019s been six months since my father died, and even though he wasn\u2019t good company, it has to be weird for her, being alone. She got a job at one of the elementary schools, so she did end up moving here. She chose a small suburb on the outskirts of Boston. She bought a cute two-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac, with a huge backyard. I dream of planting a garden there, but that would require daily care. My limit is once-a-week visits. Sometimes twice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with all this junk?\u201d she asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s right.

I certainly hope this works out in your favor.\u201d</p><p>We both begin to stand when the front door opens. There are shelves in the way of the door, so I careen my head around them and see a woman walk in. Her eyes briefly scan the room until she sees me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says with a wave. She\u2019s cute. She\u2019s dressed well, but she\u2019s wearing white capris. A disaster waiting to happen in this dust bowl.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>She tucks her purse beneath her arm and walks toward me, holding out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Allysa,\u201d she says. I shake her hand.</p><p>\u201cLily.\u201d</p><p>She tosses a thumb over her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s a help wanted sign out front?\u201d</p><p>I look over her shoulder and raise an eyebrow. \u201cThere is?\u201d I didn\u2019t put up a help wanted sign.</p><p>She nods, and then shrugs. \u201cIt looks old, though,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably been there a while. I was just out for a walk and saw the sign. Was curious, is all.\u201d</p><p>I like her almost immediately. Her voice is pleasant and her smile seems genuine.</p><p>My mother\u2019s hand falls down on my shoulder and she leans in and kisses me on the cheek. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she says. \u201cOpen house tonight.\u201d I tell her goodbye and watch her walk outside, then turn my attention back to Allysa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hiring yet,\u201d I say. I wave my hand around the room. \u201cI\u2019m opening up a floral shop, but it\u2019ll be a couple of months, at least.\u201d I should know better than to hold preconceived judgments, but she doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019d be satisfied with a minimum wage job. Her purse probably cost more than this building.</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cReally? I love flowers!\u201d She spins around in a circle and says, \u201cThis place has a ton of potential. What color are you painting it?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arm over my chest and grab my elbow. Rocking back on my heels, I say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just got the keys to the building an hour ago, so I haven\u2019t really come up with a design plan yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend I have a degree in design, but it\u2019s my absolute favorite thing. If you need any help, I\u2019d do it for free.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head. \u201cYou\u2019d work for free?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI don\u2019t really need a job, I just saw the sign and thought, \u2018What the heck?\u2019 But I do get bored sometimes. I\u2019d be happy to help you with whatever you need. Cleaning, decorating, picking out paint colors. I\u2019m a Pinterest whore.\u201d Something behind me catches her eye and she points. \u201cI could take that broken door and make it magnificent. All this stuff, really. There\u2019s a use for almost everything, you know.\u201d</p><p>I look around at the room, knowing full well I\u2019m not going to be able to tackle this by myself. I probably can\u2019t even lift half this stuff alone. I\u2019ll eventually have to hire someone anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you work for free. But I could do $10 an hour if you\u2019re really serious.\u201d</p> <p>She starts clapping, and if she weren\u2019t in heels, she might have jumped up and down. \u201cWhen can I start?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at her white capris. \u201cWill tomorrow work? You\u2019ll probably want to show up in disposable clothes.\u201d</p><p>She waves me off and drops her Herm\u00e8s bag on a dusty table next to her. \u201cNonsense,\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband is watching the Bruins play at a bar down the street. If it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just hang with you and get started right now.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two hours later, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ve met my new best friend. And she really is a Pinterest whore.</p><p>We write \u201cKeep\u201d and \u201cToss\u201d on sticky notes, and slap them on everything in the room. She\u2019s a fellow believer in upcycling, so we come up with ideas for at least 75 percent of the stuff left in the building. The rest she says her husband can throw out when he has free time. Once we know what we\u2019re going to do with all the stuff, I grab a notebook and a pen and we sit at one of the tables to write down design ideas.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, leaning back in her chair. I want to laugh, because her white capris are covered in dirt now, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cDo you have a goal for this place?\u201d she asks, glancing around.</p><p>\u201cI have one,\u201d I say. \u201cSucceed.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI have no doubt you\u2019ll succeed. But you do need a vision.\u201d</p><p>I think about what my mother said. \u201cJust make sure it\u2019s brave and bold, Lily.\u201d I smile and sit up straighter in my chair. \u201cBrave and bold,\u201d I say. \u201cI want this place to be different. I want to take risks.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes as she chews on the tip of the pen. \u201cBut you\u2019re just selling flowers,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can you be brave and bold with flowers?\u201d</p><p>I look around the room and try to envision what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m just getting itchy and restless, like I\u2019m on the verge of a brilliant idea. \u201cWhat are some words that come to mind when you think of flowers?\u201d I ask her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re sweet, I guess? They\u2019re alive, so they make me think of life. And maybe the color pink. And spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, life, pink, spring,\u201d I repeat. And then, \u201cAllysa, you\u2019re brilliant!\u201d I stand up and begin pacing the floor. \u201cWe\u2019ll take everything everyone loves about flowers, and we\u2019ll do the complete opposite!\u201d</p><p>She makes a face to let me know she isn\u2019t following.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if, instead of showcasing the sweet side of flowers, we showcased the villainous side? Instead of pink accents, we use darker colors, like a deep purple or even black. And instead of just spring and life, we also celebrate winter and death.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa\u2019s eyes are wide. \u201cBut . . . what if someone wants pink flowers, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll still give them what they want, of course. But we\u2019ll also give them what they don\u2019t know they want.\u201d</p><p>She scratches her cheek. \u201cSo you\u2019re thinking black flowers?\u201d She looks concerned, and I don\u2019t blame her. She\u2019s only seeing the darkest side of my vision. I take a seat at the table again and try to get her on board.</p><p>\u201cSomeone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people. We\u2019re all just people who sometimes do bad things. That stuck with me, because it\u2019s so true. We\u2019ve all got a little bit of good and evil in us. I want to make that our theme. Instead of painting the walls a putrid sweet color, we paint them dark purple with black accents. And instead of only putting out the usual pastel displays of flowers in boring crystal vases that make people think of life, we go edgy. Brave and bold. We put out displays of darker flowers wrapped in things like leather or silver chains. And rather than put them in crystal vases, we\u2019ll stick them in black onyx or . . . I don\u2019t know . . . purple velvet vases lined with silver studs. The ideas are endless.\u201d I stand up again. \u201cThere are floral shops on every corner for people who love flowers. But what floral shop caters to all the people who hate flowers?\u201d</p><p>Allysa shakes her head. \u201cNone of them,\u201d she whispers.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. None of them.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other for a moment, and then I can\u2019t take it another second. I\u2019m bursting with excitement and I just start laughing like a giddy child. Allysa starts laughing, too, and she jumps up and hugs me. \u201cLily, it\u2019s so twisted, it\u2019s brilliant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I\u2019m full of renewed energy. \u201cI need a desk so I can sit down and make a business plan! But my future office is full of old vegetable crates!\u201d</p><p>She walks toward the back of the store. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get them out of there and go buy you a desk!\u201d</p><p>We squeeze into the office and begin moving crates out one by one and into a back room. I stand on the chair to make the piles taller so we\u2019ll have more room to move around.</p><p>\u201cThese are perfect for the window displays I have in mind.\u201d She hands me two more crates and walks away, and as I\u2019m reaching on my tiptoes to stack them at the very top, the pile begins to tumble. I try to find something to grab hold of for balance, but the crates knock me off the chair. When I land on the floor, I can feel my foot bend in the wrong direction. It\u2019s followed by a rush of pain straight up my leg and down to my toes.</p> <p>Allysa comes rushing back into the room and has to move two of the crates from on top of me. \u201cLily!\u201d she says. \u201cOh my God, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I pull myself up to a sitting position, but don\u2019t even try to put weight on my ankle. I shake my head. \u201cMy ankle.\u201d</p><p>She immediately removes my shoe and then pulls her phone out of her pocket. She begins dialing a number and then looks up at me. \u201cI know this is a stupid question, but do you happen to have a refrigerator here with ice in it?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d she says. She puts the phone on speaker and sets it on the floor as she begins to roll up my pant leg. I wince, but not so much from the pain. I just can\u2019t believe I did something so stupid. If I broke it, I\u2019m screwed. I just spent my entire inheritance on a building that I won\u2019t even be able to renovate for months.</p><p>\u201cHeeey, Issa,\u201d a voice croons through her phone. \u201cWhere you at? The game\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Allysa picks up her phone and brings it closer to her mouth. \u201cAt work. Listen, I need . . .\u201d</p><p>The guy cuts her off and says, \u201cAt work? Babe, you don\u2019t even have a job.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa shakes her head and says, \u201cMarshall, listen. It\u2019s an emergency. I think my boss broke her ankle. I need you to bring some ice to . . .\u201d</p><p>He cuts her off with a laugh. \u201cYour boss? Babe, you don\u2019t even have a job,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>Allysa rolls her eyes. \u201cMarshall, are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s onesie day,\u201d he slurs into the phone. \u201cYou knew that when you dropped us off, Issa. Free beer until . . .\u201d</p><p>She groans. \u201cPut my brother on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Marshall mumbles. There\u2019s a rustling sound that comes from the phone, and then, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Allysa spits out our location into the phone. \u201cGet here right now. Please. And bring a bag of ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he says. The brother sounds like he may be a little drunk, too. There\u2019s laughter, and then one of the guys says, \u201cShe\u2019s in a bad mood,\u201d and then the line goes dead.</p><p>Allysa puts her phone back in her pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll go wait outside for them, they\u2019re just down the street. Will you be okay here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod and reach for the chair. \u201cMaybe I should just try to walk on it.\u201d</p><p>Allysa pushes my shoulders back until I\u2019m leaning against the wall again. \u201cNo, don\u2019t move. Wait until they get here, okay?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what two drunken guys are going to be able to do for me, but I nod. My new employee feels more like my boss right now and I\u2019m kind of scared of her at the moment.</p><p>I wait in the back for about ten minutes when I finally hear the front door to the building open. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d a man\u2019s voice says. \u201cWhy are you all alone in this creepy building?\u201d</p> <p>I hear Allysa say, \u201cShe\u2019s back here.\u201d She walks in, followed by a guy wearing a onesie. He\u2019s tall, a little bit on the thin side, but boyishly handsome with big, honest eyes and a head full of dark, messy, way-past-due-for-a-haircut hair. He\u2019s holding a bag of ice.</p><p>Did I mention he was wearing a onesie?</p><p>I\u2019m talking a legit, full-grown man in a SpongeBob onesie.</p><p>\u201cThis is your husband?\u201d I ask her, cocking an eyebrow.</p><p>Allysa rolls her eyes. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she says, glancing back at him. Another guy (also in a onesie) walks in behind them, but my attention is on Allysa as she explains why they\u2019re wearing pajamas on a random Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThere\u2019s a bar down the street that gives out free beer to anyone who shows up in a onesie during a Bruins game.\u201d She makes her way over to me and motions for the guys to follow her. \u201cShe fell off the chair and hurt her ankle,\u201d she says to the other guy. He steps around Marshall and the first thing I notice are his arms.</p> <p>Holy shit. I know those arms.</p><p>Those are the arms of a neurosurgeon.</p><p>Allysa is his sister? The sister that owns the entire top floor, with the husband who works in pajamas and brings in seven figures a year?</p><p>As soon as my eyes lock with Ryle\u2019s, his whole face morphs into a smile. I haven\u2019t seen him in\u2014God, how long ago was that\u2014six months? I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t thought about him during the past six months, because I\u2019ve thought about him quite a few times. But I never actually thought I\u2019d see him again.</p><p>\u201cRyle, this is Lily. Lily, my brother, Ryle,\u201d she says, motioning toward him. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my husband, Marshall.\u201d</p><p>Ryle walks over to me and kneels down. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, regarding me with a smile. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious he remembers me\u2014I can see it in his knowing smile. But like me, he\u2019s pretending this is the first time we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in the mood to explain how we already know each other.</p><p>Ryle touches my ankle and inspects it. \u201cCan you move it?\u201d</p><p>I try to move it, but a sharp pain shoots all the way up my leg. I suck in air through my teeth and shake my head. \u201cNot yet. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>Ryle motions to Marshall. \u201cFind something to put the ice in.\u201d</p><p>Allysa follows Marshall out of the room. When they\u2019re both gone, Ryle looks at me and his mouth turns up into a grin. \u201cI won\u2019t charge you for this, but only because I\u2019m slightly inebriated,\u201d he says with a wink.</p><p>I tilt my head. \u201cThe first time I met you, you were high. Now you\u2019re drunk. I\u2019m beginning to worry you aren\u2019t going to make a very qualified neurosurgeon.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cIt would appear that way,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I promise you, I rarely ever get high and this is my first day off in over a month, so I really needed a beer. Or five.\u201d</p><p>Marshall comes back with an old rag wrapped around some ice. He hands it to Ryle, who presses it against my ankle. \u201cI\u2019ll need that first aid kit out of your trunk,\u201d Ryle says to Allysa. She nods and grabs Marshall\u2019s hand, pulling him out of the room again.</p> <p>Ryle presses his palm against the bottom of my foot. \u201cPush against my hand,\u201d he says.</p><p>I push down with my ankle. It hurts, but I\u2019m able to move his hand. \u201cIs it broken?\u201d</p><p>He moves my foot from side to side, and then says, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Let\u2019s give it a couple of minutes and I\u2019ll see if you can put any weight on it.\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch as he adjusts himself across from me. He sits cross-legged and pulls my foot onto his lap. He looks around the room and then directs his attention back at me. \u201cSo what is this place?\u201d</p><p>I smile a little too big. \u201cLily Bloom\u2019s. It\u2019ll be a floral shop in about two months\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>I swear, his whole face lights up with pride. \u201cNo way,\u201d he says. \u201cYou did it? You\u2019re actually opening up your own business?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep. I figured I might as well try it while I\u2019m still young enough to bounce back from failure.\u201d</p><p>One of his hands is holding the ice against my ankle, but the other one is wrapped around my bare foot. He\u2019s brushing his thumb back and forth, like it\u2019s no big deal that he\u2019s touching me. But his hand on my foot is way more noticeable than the pain in my ankle.</p><p>\u201cI look ridiculous, huh?\u201d he asks, staring down at his solid red onesie.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cAt least you went with a non-character choice. It gives it a bit more maturity than the SpongeBob option.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and then his smile disappears as he leans his head into the door beside him. He stares at me appreciatively. \u201cYou\u2019re even prettier in the daytime.\u201d</p><p>Moments like these are why I absolutely hate having red hair and fair skin. The embarrassment doesn\u2019t only show up in my cheeks\u2014my whole face, arms, and neck grow flushed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rest my head against the wall behind me and stare at him just like he\u2019s staring at me. \u201cYou want to hear a naked truth?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to go back to your roof on more than one occasion since that night. But I was too scared you\u2019d be there. You make me kind of nervous.\u201d</p><p>His fingers pause their strokes against my foot. \u201cMy turn?\u201d</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>His eyes narrow as his hand moves to the underneath of my foot. He slowly traces his fingers from the tops of my toes, down to my heel. \u201cI still very much want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Someone gasps, and it isn\u2019t me.</p><p>Ryle and I both look at the doorway and Allysa is standing there, wide-eyed. Her mouth is open as she points down at Ryle. \u201cDid you just . . .\u201d She looks at me and says, \u201cI am so sorry about him, Lily.\u201d And then she looks back at Ryle with venom in her eyes. \u201cDid you just tell my boss you want to fuck her?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear.</p> <p>Ryle pulls his bottom lip in and chews on it for a second. Marshall walks in behind Allysa and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Allysa looks at Marshall and points at Ryle again. \u201cHe just told Lily he wants to fuck her!\u201d</p><p>Marshall looks from Ryle to me. I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or crawl under the table and hide. \u201cYou did?\u201d he says, looking back at Ryle.</p><p>Ryle shrugs. \u201cIt appears that way,\u201d he says.</p><p>Allysa puts her head in her hands, \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d she says, looking at me. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk. They\u2019re both drunk. Please don\u2019t judge me because my brother is an asshole.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her and wave it off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Allysa. Lots of people want to fuck me.\u201d I glance back at Ryle and he\u2019s still casually stroking my foot. \u201cAt least your brother speaks his mind. Not a lot of people have the courage to say what they\u2019re actually thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Ryle winks at me and then carefully moves my ankle off his lap. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can put any weight on it,\u201d he says.</p><p>He and Marshall help me to my feet. Ryle points to a table a few feet away that\u2019s pushed up against a wall. \u201cLet\u2019s try to make it to the table so I can wrap it.\u201d</p><p>His arm is secured around my waist, and he\u2019s gripping my arm tightly to make sure I don\u2019t fall. Marshall is more or less just standing next to me for support. I put a little weight on my ankle and it hurts, but it\u2019s not excruciating. I\u2019m able to hop all the way to the table with a lot of assistance from Ryle. He helps me pull myself up until I\u2019m seated on top of it, leaning against the wall with my leg stretched out in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWell, the good news is that it isn\u2019t broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He opens the first aid kit and says, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to stay off of it for a few days. Maybe even a week or more, depending on how it heals.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and lean my head against the wall behind me. \u201cBut I have so much to do,\u201d I whine.</p><p>He carefully begins to wrap my ankle. Allysa is standing behind him, watching him wrap it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cAnybody want something to drink? There\u2019s a CVS across the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Ryle says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a water,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSprite,\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>Marshall grabs her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with.\u201d</p><p>Allysa pulls her hand from his and crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cMy brother can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllysa, it\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe was making a joke.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me silently for a moment, and then says, \u201cOkay. But you can\u2019t fire me if he pulls more stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t fire you.\u201d</p><p>With that, she grabs Marshall\u2019s hand again and leaves the room. Ryle is still wrapping my foot when he says, \u201cMy sister works for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Hired her a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>He reaches into the first aid kit and pulls out tape. \u201cYou do realize she\u2019s never had a job in her entire life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already warned me,\u201d I say. His jaw is tight and he doesn\u2019t look as relaxed as he did earlier. Then it hits me that he might think I hired her as a way to get closer to him. \u201cI had no idea she was your sister until you walked in. I swear.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me, and then back down at my foot. \u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting you knew.\u201d He begins to tape over the ACE bandage.</p><p>\u201cI know you weren\u2019t. I just didn\u2019t want you to think I was trying to trap you somehow. We want two different things from life, remember?\u201d</p><p>He nods, and carefully sets my foot back on the table. \u201cThat is correct,\u201d he says. \u201cI specialize in one-night stands and you\u2019re on the quest for your Holy Grail.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou have a good memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. A languid smile stretches across his mouth. \u201cBut you\u2019re also hard to forget.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. He has to stop saying things like that. I press my palms into the table and pull my leg down. \u201cNaked truth coming.\u201d</p><p>He leans against the table next to me and says, \u201cAll ears.\u201d</p><p>I hold nothing back. \u201cI\u2019m very attracted to you,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s not much about you I don\u2019t like. And being as though you and I both want different things, if we\u2019re ever around each other again, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could stop saying things that make me dizzy. It\u2019s not really fair to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods once, and then says, \u201cMy turn.\u201d He places his hand on the table next to me and leans in a little. \u201cI\u2019m very attracted to you, too. There\u2019s not much about you I don\u2019t like. But I kind of hope we\u2019re never around each other again, because I don\u2019t like how much I think about you. Which isn\u2019t all that much\u2014but it\u2019s more than I\u2019d like. So if you still aren\u2019t going to agree to a one-night stand, then I think it\u2019s best if we do what we can to avoid each other. Because it won\u2019t do either of us any favors.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how he ended up this close to me, but he\u2019s only about a foot away. His proximity makes it hard to pay attention to words that come out of his mouth. His gaze drops briefly to my mouth, but as soon as we hear the front door open, he\u2019s halfway across the room. By the time Allysa and Marshall make it to us, Ryle is busy restacking all the crates that fell. Allysa looks down at my ankle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I push my bottom lip out. \u201cYour doctor brother says I have to stay off of it for a few days.\u201d</p> <p>She hands me my water. \u201cGood thing you have me. I can work and do what I can to clean up while you rest.\u201d</p><p>I take a drink of the water and then wipe my mouth. \u201cAllysa, I\u2019m declaring you employee of the month.\u201d</p><p>She grins and then turns to Marshall. \u201cDid you hear that? I\u2019m the best employee she has!\u201d</p><p>He puts his arm around her and kisses the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Issa.\u201d</p><p>I like that he calls her Issa, which I\u2019m assuming is short for Allysa. I think about my own name and if I\u2019ll ever find a guy who could shorten it into a sickeningly cute nickname. Illy.</p> <p>Nope. Not the same.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting home?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hop down and test my foot. \u201cMaybe just to my car. It\u2019s my left foot, so I can probably drive just fine.\u201d</p><p>She walks over and puts her arm around me. \u201cIf you want to leave the keys with me, I\u2019ll lock up and come back tomorrow and start cleaning.\u201d</p><p>The three of them walk me to my car, but Ryle allows Allysa to do most of the work. He seems almost scared to touch me now for some reason. When I\u2019m in the driver\u2019s seat, Allysa puts my purse and other things in the floorboard and sits in the passenger seat. She takes my phone out and begins programming her number into it.</p><p>Ryle leans into the window. \u201cMake sure to keep ice on it as much as you can for the next few days. Baths help, too.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cThanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>Allysa leans over and says, \u201cRyle? Maybe you should drive her home and take a cab back to the apartment, just to be safe.\u201d</p><p>Ryle looks down at me and then shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve had a few beers, probably shouldn\u2019t be driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could at least help her home,\u201d Allysa suggests.</p><p>Ryle shakes his head and then pats the roof of the car as he turns and walks away.</p><p>I\u2019m still watching him when Allysa hands me back my phone and says, \u201cSeriously. I\u2019m really sorry about him. First he hits on you, then he\u2019s a selfish asshole.\u201d She climbs out of the car and closes the door, then leans through the window. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019ll be single for the rest of his life.\u201d She points to my phone. \u201cText me when you get home. And call me if you need anything. I won\u2019t count favors as work-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Allysa.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cNo, thank you. I haven\u2019t been this excited about my life since that Paolo Nutini concert I went to last year.\u201d She waves goodbye and walks toward where Marshall and Ryle are standing.</p> <p>They begin walking down the street and I watch them in my rearview mirror. As they turn the corner, I see Ryle glance over his shoulder and look back in my direction.</p><p>I close my eyes and exhale.</p><p>The two times I\u2019ve spent with Ryle were on days I\u2019d probably rather forget. My father\u2019s funeral and spraining my ankle. But somehow, him being present made them feel like less of the disasters they were.</p><p>I hate that he\u2019s Allysa\u2019s brother. I have a feeling this isn\u2019t the last time I\u2019ll be seeing him.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>It takes me half an hour to make it from my car to my apartment. I called Lucy twice to see if she could help me, but she didn\u2019t answer her phone. When I make it inside my apartment, I\u2019m a little irritated to see her lying on the couch with the phone to her ear.</p><p>I slam our front door behind me and she glances up. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I use the wall for support as I hop toward the hallway. \u201cSprained my ankle.\u201d</p><p>When I make it to my bedroom door, she yells, \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t answer the phone! I\u2019m talking to Alex! I was gonna call you back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d I holler back at her, and then slam my bedroom door shut. I go to the bathroom and find some old pain pills I had stuffed into a cabinet. I swallow two of them and then fall onto my bed and stare up at the ceiling.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be stuck in this apartment for an entire week. I grab my phone and text my mother.</p><p>Sprained my ankle. I\u2019m fine, but can I send you a list of things to grab for me at the store?</p><p>I drop my phone onto my bed, and for the first time since she moved here, I\u2019m thankful my mother lives fairly close to me. It actually hasn\u2019t been that bad. I think I like her more now that my father has passed away. I know it\u2019s because I held a lot of resentment toward her for never leaving him. Even though a lot of that resentment has faded when it comes to my mother, I still have the same feelings when I think of my father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It can\u2019t be good, still holding on to so much bitterness toward my father. But dammit, he was awful. To my mother, to me, to Atlas.</p><p>Atlas.</p><p>I\u2019ve been so busy with my mother\u2019s move and secretly searching for a new building between work hours, I haven\u2019t had time to finish reading the journals I started reading all those months ago.</p><p>I hop pathetically to my closet, only tripping once. Luckily, I catch myself on my dresser. Once I have the journal in hand, I hop back to the bed and get comfortable.</p> <p>I have nothing better to do for the next week now that I can\u2019t work. I might as well commiserate over my past while I\u2019m forced to commiserate in the present.</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>You hosting the Oscars was the greatest thing to happen to TV last year. I don\u2019t think I ever told you that. The vacuuming skit made me piss my pants.</p><p>Oh, and I recruited a new Ellen follower today in Atlas. Before you start judging me for allowing him inside my house again, let me explain how that came about.</p><p>After I let him take a shower here yesterday, I didn\u2019t see him again last night. But this morning, he sat by me on the bus again. He seemed a little happier than the day before, because he slid into the seat and actually smiled at me.</p> <p>I\u2019m not gonna lie, it was a little weird seeing him in my dad\u2019s clothes. But the pants fit him a lot better than I thought they were going to.</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d he said. He leaned forward and unzipped his backpack.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a bag and handed it to me. \u201cI found these in the garage. I tried to clean them up for you because they were covered in old dirt, but I can\u2019t do much without water.\u201d</p><p>I held the bag and stared at him suspiciously. It\u2019s the most I\u2019d ever heard him say at once. I finally looked down at the bag and opened it. It looked like a bunch of old gardening tools.</p><p>\u201cI saw you digging with that shovel the other day. I wasn\u2019t sure if you had any actual gardening tools, and no one was using these, so . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I was kind of in shock. I used to have a trowel, but the plastic broke off the handle and it started giving me blisters. I asked my mother for gardening tools for my birthday last year and when she bought me a full-sized shovel and a hoe, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her it\u2019s not what I needed.</p><p>Atlas cleared his throat and then, in a much quieter voice, he said, \u201cI know it\u2019s not like a real gift. I didn\u2019t buy it or anything. But . . . I wanted to give you something. You know . . . for . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish his sentence, so I nodded and tied the bag back up. \u201cDo you think you can hold them for me until after school? I don\u2019t have any room in my backpack.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the bag from me and then brought his backpack up to his lap and put the bag inside of it. He wrapped his arms around his backpack. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes made him seem a little bit sad about my age, but I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in tenth grade?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but honestly couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to him. I haven\u2019t really had much interaction with a lot of guys. Especially seniors. When I\u2019m nervous, I kind of just clam up.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be staying at that place,\u201d he said, bringing his voice down again. \u201cBut if you ever need help with gardening or anything after school, it\u2019s not like I have much going on there. Being as though I have no electricity.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and then wondered if I should have laughed at his self-deprecating comment.</p><p>We spent the rest of the bus ride talking about you, Ellen. When he made that comment about being bored, I asked him if he ever watched your show. He said he\u2019d like to because he thinks you\u2019re funny, but a TV would require electricity. Another comment I wasn\u2019t sure if I should have laughed at.</p><p>I told him he could watch your show with me after school. I always record it on the DVR and watch it while I do my chores. I figured I could just keep the front door dead bolted, and if my parents got home early, I\u2019d just have Atlas run out the back door.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see him again until the ride home today. He didn\u2019t sit by me this time because Katie got on the bus before him and sat next to me. I wanted to ask her to move, but then she\u2019d think I had a crush on Atlas. Katie would have a field day with that one, so I just let her stay in my seat.</p><p>Atlas was at the front of the bus, so he got off before I did. He just kind of awkwardly stood there at the bus stop and waited for me to get off. When I did, he opened his backpack and handed me the bag of tools. He didn\u2019t say anything about my invitation to watch TV from earlier this morning, so I just acted like it was a given.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told him. He followed me inside and I locked the dead bolt. \u201cIf my parents come home early, run out the back door and don\u2019t let them see you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will,\u201d he said, with kind of a laugh.</p><p>I asked him if he wanted anything to drink and he said sure. I made us a snack and brought our drinks to the living room. I sat down on the couch and he sat down in my dad\u2019s chair. I turned on your show and that\u2019s about all that happened. We didn\u2019t talk much, because I fast-forwarded through all the commercials. But I did notice he laughed at all the right times. I think good comedic timing is one of the most important things about a person\u2019s personality. Every time he laughed at your jokes, it made me feel better about sneaking him into my house. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe because if he\u2019s actually someone I could be friends with, it\u2019d make me feel less guilty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He left right after your show was over. I wanted to ask him if he needed to use our shower again, but that would have cut it real close to time for my parents getting home. The last thing I wanted was for him to have to run out of the shower and across my backyard naked.</p><p>Then again, that\u2019d be kind of hilarious and awesome.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Come on, woman. Reruns? A full week of reruns? I get that you need time off, but let me make a suggestion. Instead of recording one show a day, you should record two. That way you\u2019ll get twice as much done in half the time, and we\u2019d never have to sit through reruns.</p><p>I say \u201cwe\u201d because I\u2019m referring to Atlas and me. He\u2019s become my regular Ellen-watching partner. I think he might love you as much as I do, but I\u2019ll never tell him I write to you on a daily basis. That might seem a little too fan-girl.</p><p>He\u2019s been living in that house for two weeks now. He\u2019s taken a few more showers at my house and I give him food every time he visits. I even wash his clothes for him while he\u2019s here after school. He keeps apologizing to me, like he\u2019s a burden. But honestly, I love it. He keeps my mind off things and I actually look forward to spending time with him after school every day.</p><p>Dad got home late tonight, which means he went to the bar after work. Which means he\u2019s probably going to instigate a fight with my mother. Which means he\u2019ll probably do something stupid again.</p><p>I swear, sometimes I get so mad at her for staying with him. I know I\u2019m only fifteen and probably don\u2019t understand all the reasons she chooses to stay, but I refuse to let her use me as her excuse. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s too poor to leave him and we\u2019d have to move into a crappy apartment and eat ramen noodles until I graduate. That would be better than this.</p><p>I can hear him yelling at her right now. Sometimes when he gets like this, I walk into the living room, hoping it\u2019ll calm him down. He doesn\u2019t like to hit her when I\u2019m in the room. Maybe I should go try that.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>If I had access to a gun or knife right now, I\u2019d kill him.</p><p>As soon as I walked into the living room, I saw him push her down. They were standing in the kitchen and she\u2019d grabbed his arm, trying to calm him down, and he backhanded her and knocked her straight to the floor. I\u2019m pretty sure he was about to kick her, but he saw me walk into the living room and he stopped. He muttered something under his breath to her and then walked to their bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>I rushed to the kitchen and tried to help her, but she never wants me to see her like this. She waved me away and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Lily. I\u2019m fine, we just got into a stupid fight.\u201d</p><p>She was crying and I could already see the redness on her cheek from where he hit her. When I walked closer to her, wanting to make sure she was okay, she turned her back to me and gripped the counter. \u201cI said I\u2019m fine, Lily. Go back to your room.\u201d</p><p>I ran back down the hallway, but I didn\u2019t go back to my room. I ran straight out the back door and across the backyard. I was so mad at her for being short with me. I didn\u2019t even want to be in the same house as either of them, and even thought it was dark already, I went over to the house Atlas was staying in and I knocked on the door.</p><p>I could hear him moving inside, like he accidentally knocked something over. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Lily,\u201d I whispered. A few seconds later the back door opened and he looked behind me, then to the left and right of me. It wasn\u2019t until he looked at my face that he saw I was crying.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, stepping outside. I used my shirt to wipe away my tears, and noticed he came outside instead of inviting me in. I sat down on the porch step and he sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just mad. Sometimes I cry when I get mad.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and tucked my hair behind my ear. I liked it when he did that and I suddenly wasn\u2019t nearly as mad anymore. Then he put his arm around me and pulled me to him so that my head was resting on his shoulder. I don\u2019t know how he calmed me down without even talking, but he did. Some people just have a calming presence about them and he\u2019s one of those people. Completely opposite of my father.</p><p>We sat like that for a while, until I saw my bedroom light turn on.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d he whispered. We could both see my mom standing in my bedroom looking for me. It wasn\u2019t until that moment that I realized what a perfect view he has of my bedroom.</p> <p>As I walked back home, I tried to think about the entire time Atlas has been in that house. I tried to recall if I\u2019d walked around after dark with the light on at night, because all I normally wear in my room at night is a T-shirt.</p><p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s crazy about that, Ellen: I was kind of hoping I had.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>I close the journal when the pain pills start to kick in. I\u2019ll read more tomorrow. Maybe. Reading about the things my dad used to do to my mom kind of puts me in a bad mood.</p><p>Reading about Atlas kind of puts me in a sad mood.</p><p>I try to fall asleep and think about Ryle, but the whole situation with him kind of makes me mad and sad.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll just think about Allysa, and how happy I am that she showed up today. I could use a friend\u2014not to mention help\u2014during these next few months. I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be more stressful than I bargained for.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Ryle was correct. It only took a few days for my ankle to feel good enough that I could walk on it again. I waited a full week before attempting to leave my apartment, though. The last thing I need is to reinjure it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course the first place I went was to my floral shop. Allysa was there when I arrived today, and to say I was shocked when I walked through the front doors is an understatement. It looked like a totally different building than the one I bought. There\u2019s still a ton of work that needs to be done, but she and Marshall had gotten rid of all the stuff we marked as trash. Everything else had been organized into piles. The windows had been washed, the floors had been mopped. She even had the area where I plan to put an office cleaned out.</p><p>I helped her for a few hours today, but she wouldn\u2019t let me do much that required walking at first, so I mostly drew out plans for the store. We picked out paint colors and set a goal date to open the store that\u2019s approximately fifty-four days from now. After she left, I spent the next few hours doing all the stuff she wouldn\u2019t let me do while she was there. It felt good to be back. But Jesus Christ, I\u2019m tired.</p><p>Which is why I\u2019m debating on whether or not to get up from the couch and answer the knock at my front door. Lucy is at Alex\u2019s again tonight and I just spoke to my mother five minutes ago on the phone, so I know it isn\u2019t either of them.</p><p>I walk to the door and check the peephole before opening it. I don\u2019t recognize him at first, because his head is down, but then he looks up and to the right and my heart freaks the hell out!</p> <p>What is he doing here?</p><p>Ryle knocks again, and I try to brush my hair out of my face and smooth it down with my hands, but it\u2019s a lost cause. I worked my ass off today and I look like shit, so unless I have half an hour to take a shower, put on makeup, and throw on clothes before I open the door, he\u2019ll pretty much have to deal with me as is.</p><p>I open the door and his immediate reaction confuses me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says, dropping his head against my door frame. He\u2019s panting like he\u2019s been working out, and that\u2019s when I notice that he doesn\u2019t look to be any more rested or clean than I am. He\u2019s got a couple of days\u2019 worth of stubble on his face\u2014something I\u2019ve never seen on him before\u2014and his hair isn\u2019t styled like it usually is. It\u2019s a little erratic, like the look in his eye. \u201cDo you have any idea how many doors I\u2019ve knocked on to find you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, because I don\u2019t. But now that he mentions it\u2014how in the hell does he know where I live?</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-nine,\u201d he says. Then he holds up his hands and repeats the numbers with his fingers while he whispers, \u201cTwo . . . nine.\u201d</p><p>I let my gaze drop down to his clothes. He\u2019s in scrubs, and I absolutely hate that he\u2019s in scrubs right now. Holy hell. So much better than the onesie and way better than the Burberry.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you knock on twenty-nine doors?\u201d I ask with a tilt of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me which apartment was yours,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. \u201cYou said you lived in this building, but I couldn\u2019t remember if you even said which floor. And for the record, I almost started with the third floor. I would have been here an hour ago if I went with my gut instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He runs his hands down his face and then points over my shoulder. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p> <p>I glance over my shoulder and then open the door farther. \u201cI guess. If you tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>He walks inside and I close the door behind us. He glances around, wearing his stupid hot scrubs, and puts his hands on his hips as he faces me. He looks a little disappointed, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s in me or himself.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a really big naked truth coming, okay?\u201d he says. \u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest and watch as he inhales a breath, preparing to speak.</p><p>\u201cThese next couple of months are the most important months in my entire career. I have to be focused. I\u2019m closing in on the end of my residency, and then I\u2019ll have to sit for my exams.\u201d He\u2019s pacing my living room, talking frantically with his hands. \u201cBut for the past week, I haven\u2019t been able to get you out of my head. I don\u2019t know why. At work, at home. All I can think about is how crazy it feels when I\u2019m near you, and I need you to make it stop, Lily.\u201d He stops pacing and faces me. \u201cPlease make it stop. Just once\u2014that\u2019s all it\u2019ll take. I swear.\u201d</p><p>My fingers are digging into the skin of my arms as I watch him. He\u2019s still panting a little, and his eyes are still frantic, but he\u2019s looking at me pleadingly.</p><p>\u201cWhen is the last time you\u2019ve had sleep?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He rolls his eyes like he\u2019s frustrated that I\u2019m not getting it. \u201cI just got off a forty-eight-hour shift,\u201d he says dismissively. \u201cFocus, Lily.\u201d</p> <p>I nod and replay his words in my head. If I didn\u2019t know better . . . I\u2019d almost think he was . . .</p><p>I inhale a calming breath. \u201cRyle,\u201d I say carefully. \u201cDid you seriously just knock on twenty-nine doors so you could tell me that the thought of me is making your life hell and I should have sex with you so that you\u2019ll never have to think of me again? Are you kidding me right now?\u201d</p><p>He folds his lips together and, after about five seconds of thought, he slowly nods his head. \u201cWell . . . yeah, but . . . it sounds way worse when you say it.\u201d</p><p>I release an exasperated laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s ridiculous, Ryle.\u201d</p><p>He bites his bottom lip and looks around the room, like he suddenly wants to escape. I open the door and motion for him to walk out. He doesn\u2019t. His eyes fall to my foot. \u201cYour ankle looks good,\u201d he says. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I roll my eyes. \u201cBetter. I was able to help Allysa at the store for the first time today.\u201d</p><p>He nods and then makes like he\u2019s walking toward the door to leave. But as soon as he reaches me, he spins toward me and slaps his palms against the door on either side of my head. I gasp at both his proximity and his persistence. \u201cPlease?\u201d he says.</p><p>I shake my head, even though my body is starting to trade sides and beg my mind to cave to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really good at it, Lily,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll barely even have to do any work.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh, but his determination is as endearing as it is annoying. \u201cGoodnight, Ryle.\u201d</p><p>His head drops between his shoulders and he shakes it back and forth. He pushes off the door and stands up straight. He half-turns, heading for the hallway, but then suddenly drops to his knees in front of me. He wraps his arms around my waist. \u201cPlease, Lily,\u201d he says through self-deprecating laughter. \u201cPlease have sex with me.\u201d He\u2019s looking up at me with puppy dog eyes and a pathetic, hopeful grin. \u201cI want you so, so bad and I swear, once you have sex with me you\u2019ll never hear from me again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s something about a neurosurgeon literally on his knees begging for sex that does me in. That\u2019s pretty pathetic.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d I say, pushing his arms away from me. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\u201d</p><p>He slowly stands up, dragging his hands up the door on either side of me until he has me caged in between his arms. \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d His chest is barely touching mine and I hate how good it feels to be wanted this much. I should be turned off by it, but I can hardly breathe when I look at him. Especially when he has this suggestive smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel sexy right now, Ryle. I worked all day, I\u2019m exhausted, I smell like sweat and probably taste like dust. If you give me a little while to shower first, I might feel sexy enough to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s nodding feverishly before I\u2019m even finished speaking. \u201cShower. Take all the time you need. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>I push him away from me and close the front door. He follows me to the bedroom and I tell him to wait on the bed for me.</p><p>Luckily, I cleaned my bedroom last night. Normally I have clothes lying around everywhere, books piled up on my nightstand, shoes and bras that don\u2019t quite make it to my closet. But tonight it\u2019s clean. My bed is even made up, complete with the ugly, quilted throw pillows my grandmother passed down to every person in our family.</p><p>I make a quick glance around the room, just to make sure nothing embarrassing will catch his eye. He takes a seat on my bed and I watch as he scans the room. I stand in the doorway to my bathroom and try to give him one last out.</p><p>\u201cYou say this will make it stop, but I\u2019m warning you right now, Ryle. I\u2019m like a drug. If you have sex with me tonight, it\u2019s only going to make things worse for you. But once is all you\u2019re getting. I refuse to become one of the many girls you use to\u2014how did you word it that night? Satisfy your needs?\u201d</p><p>He leans back on his elbows. \u201cYou aren\u2019t that kind of girl, Lily. And I\u2019m not the kind of guy who needs someone more than once. We have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>I close the door behind me, wondering how in the hell this guy talked me into this.</p><p>It\u2019s the scrubs. The scrubs are my weakness. It has nothing to do with him.</p><p>I wonder if there\u2019s a way he could leave them on during the sex?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I\u2019ve never taken more than half an hour to get ready, but it\u2019s almost an hour before I\u2019m finished in the bathroom. I shaved more parts of me than was probably necessary, and then spent a good twenty minutes having a freak-out, and had to talk myself out of opening the door and telling him to leave. But now that my hair is dry and I\u2019m cleaner than I\u2019ve ever been, I think I might be able to do this. I can totally have a one-night stand. I\u2019m twenty-three years old.</p><p>I open the door and he\u2019s still there on my bed. I\u2019m a little disappointed to see that his scrub top is on the floor, but I don\u2019t see his pants, so he must still be wearing them. He\u2019s under the covers, though, so I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>I close the door behind me and wait for him to roll over and look at me, but he doesn\u2019t. I take a few steps closer, and that\u2019s when I notice he\u2019s snoring.</p> <p>Not just a light\u2014oh I just fell asleep\u2014snore. It\u2019s a middle of REM sleep kind of snore.</p><p>\u201cRyle?\u201d I whisper. He doesn\u2019t even budge when I shake him.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>I drop down onto the bed, not even caring if I wake him. I just spent an entire hour getting ready for him after busting my ass today, and this is how he treats this night?</p><p>I can\u2019t be mad at him, though, especially seeing how peaceful he looks. I can\u2019t imagine working a forty-eight-hour shift. Plus, my bed is really comfortable. It\u2019s so comfortable, it could make a person fall right back to sleep after a full night of rest. I should have warned him about that.</p><p>I check the time on my phone and it\u2019s almost 10:30 p.m. I put the phone on silent and then lie down next to him. His phone is on the pillow next to his head, so I grab it and swipe up the camera option. I hold his phone above us and make sure my cleavage looks good and pushed together. I snap a picture so he\u2019ll at least see what he missed out on.</p><p>I turn off the light and laugh to myself, because I\u2019m falling asleep next to a half-naked man that I\u2019ve never even kissed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I can feel his fingers trailing up my arm before I even open my eyes. I force back a tired smile and pretend I\u2019m still sleeping. His fingers trail over my shoulder and stop at my collarbone, just before they reach my neck. I have a small tattoo there that I got in college. It\u2019s a simple outline of a heart that\u2019s slightly open at the top. I can feel his fingers circle around the tattoo, and then he leans forward and presses his lips against it. I squeeze my eyes shut even tighter.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he whispers, wrapping an arm around my waist. I moan a little, trying to wake up, and then roll onto my back so that I can look up at him. When I open my eyes, he\u2019s staring down at me. I can tell by the way the sunlight shines through my windows and across his face that it\u2019s not even seven a.m. yet.</p><p>\u201cI am the most despicable man you\u2019ve ever met. Am I right?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh, and nod a little. \u201cPretty damn close.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and then brushes my hair off my face. He leans forward and presses his lips to my forehead, and I hate that he just did that. Now I\u2019ll be the one plagued with sleepless nights, because I want to put this memory on repeat.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really late. But one\u2014I\u2019m sorry. Two\u2014I\u2019ll never do this again. This is the last you\u2019ll hear from me, I promise. And three\u2014I\u2019m really sorry. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile, but I want to frown because I absolutely hated his number two. I actually don\u2019t mind if he tries this again, but then I remind myself that we want two different things from life. And it\u2019s good that he fell asleep and we never even kissed, because if I would have had sex with him while he was wearing scrubs, I would have been the one showing up at his door on my knees, begging for more.</p><p>This is good. Rip the Band-Aid off and let him leave.</p> <p>\u201cHave a nice life, Ryle. I wish you all the success in the world.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond to my goodbye. He silently stares down at me with somewhat of a frown, and then says, \u201cYeah. You too, Lily.\u201d</p><p>Then he rolls away from me and stands up. I can\u2019t even look at him right now, so I roll onto my side so that my back is to him. I listen as he puts his shoes on and then reaches for his phone. There\u2019s a long pause before he moves again, and I know it\u2019s because he was staring at me. I squeeze my eyes shut until I hear the slam of the front door.</p><p>My face immediately grows warm, and I refuse to allow myself to mope. I force myself off the bed. I have work to do. I can\u2019t be upset that I\u2019m not enough to make a guy want to remap all of his life goals.</p><p>Besides, I have my own life goals to worry about now. And I\u2019m really excited about them. So much so, that I really don\u2019t have time for a guy in my life, anyway.</p><p>No time.</p> <p>Nope.</p><p>Busy girl, here.</p><p>I am a brave and bold businesswoman with zero fucks to give for men in scrubs.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>It\u2019s been fifty-three days since Ryle walked out of my apartment that morning. Which means it\u2019s been fifty-three days since I\u2019ve heard from him.</p><p>But that\u2019s okay, because for the last fifty-three days, I\u2019ve been too busy to really give him much thought as I prepared for this moment.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>I nod, and she flips the sign to Open and we both hug and squeal like little kids.</p> <p>We rush around the counter and wait for our first customer. It\u2019s a soft opening, so I haven\u2019t really done a marketing push yet, but we just want to make sure there aren\u2019t any kinks before our grand opening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty in here,\u201d Allysa says, admiring our hard work. I look around us, bursting with pride. Of course I want to succeed, but at this point I\u2019m not even sure if that matters. I had a dream and I busted my ass to make it come true. Whatever happens after today is just icing on the cake.</p><p>\u201cIt smells so good in here,\u201d I say. \u201cI love this smell.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get any customers today, but we\u2019re both acting like this is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to us, so I don\u2019t think that matters. Besides, Marshall will come in at some point today and my mother will come in after she gets off work. That\u2019s two customers for sure. That\u2019s plenty.</p><p>Allysa squeezes my arm when the front door begins to open. I suddenly grow a little panicked, because what if something goes wrong?</p><p>And then I do panic, because something just went wrong. Terribly wrong. My very first customer is none other than Ryle Kincaid.</p><p>He stops when the door closes behind him and he looks around in awe. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says, turning in a circle. \u201cHow in the . . . ?\u201d He looks over at me and Allysa. \u201cThis is incredible. It doesn\u2019t even look like the same building!\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe I\u2019m fine with him being the first customer.</p><p>It takes him a few minutes to actually make it to the counter because he can\u2019t stop touching things and looking at things. When he finally does reach us, Allysa runs around the counter and hugs him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d she says. She waves her hand in my direction. \u201cIt was all her idea. All of it. I just helped with the dirty work.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs. \u201cI find it hard to believe that your Pinterest skills didn\u2019t play a little part.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cShe\u2019s being modest. Her skills were half of what brought this vision to life.\u201d</p><p>Ryle smiles at me and it might as well have been a knife to the chest, because ouch.</p><p>He slaps his hands on the counter and says, \u201cAm I the first official customer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allysa hands him one of our flyers. \u201cYou have to actually buy something to be considered a customer.\u201d</p><p>Ryle glances over the flyer and then sets it back down on the counter. He walks to one of the displays and grabs a vase full of purple lilies. \u201cI want these,\u201d he says, setting them on the counter.</p><p>I smile, wondering if he realizes he just picked lilies. Kind of ironic.</p><p>\u201cDo you want us to deliver them somewhere?\u201d Allysa says.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllysa and I don\u2019t,\u201d I reply. \u201cWe have a delivery driver on standby. We weren\u2019t sure if we\u2019d actually need him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you actually buying these for a girl?\u201d Allysa asks. She\u2019s just prying into her brother\u2019s love life like a sister would naturally do, but I catch myself stepping closer to her so I can hear his answer better.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he says. His eyes meet mine and he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think about her very much, though. Hardly ever.\u201d</p><p>Allysa grabs a card and slides it to him. \u201cPoor girl,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are such a dick.\u201d She taps her finger on the card. \u201cWrite your message to her on the front and the address you want them delivered to on the back.\u201d</p> <p>I watch him as he bends over the card and writes on both sides. I know I don\u2019t have a right, but I\u2019m brimming with jealousy.</p><p>\u201cAre you bringing this girl to my birthday party Friday?\u201d Allysa asks him.</p><p>I watch his reaction closely. He just shakes his head and without looking up he says, \u201cNo. Are you going, Lily?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell by his voice alone if he\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll be there or hoping I won\u2019t. Considering the stress I seem to cause him, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the latter.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Allysa says, answering for me. She looks at me and narrows her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to my party whether you like it or not. If you don\u2019t show up, I\u2019ll quit.\u201d</p> <p>When Ryle is finished writing, he tucks the card into the envelope attached to the flowers. Allysa rings up his total and he pays in cash. He looks at me while he\u2019s counting out his money. \u201cLily, do you know that it\u2019s custom for a new business to frame the first dollar they make?\u201d</p><p>I nod. Of course I know that. He knows I know that. He\u2019s just rubbing it in my face that his dollar will be the one framed on my wall for the life of this store. I almost encourage Allysa to give him a refund, but this is business. I have to leave my wounded pride out of it.</p><p>Once he has his receipt in hand, he taps his fist on the counter to get my attention. He dips his head a little and, with a genuine smile, he says, \u201cCongratulations, Lily.\u201d</p><p>He turns and walks out of the store. As soon as the door closes behind him, Allysa is grabbing for the envelope. \u201cWho in the hell is he sending flowers to?\u201d she says as she pulls the card out. \u201cRyle doesn\u2019t send flowers.\u201d</p><p>She reads the front of the card out loud. \u201cMake it stop.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>She stares at it for a moment, repeating the phrase. \u201cMake it stop? What in the hell does that even mean?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I can\u2019t take it another second. I grab the card from her and flip it over. She leans over and reads the back of it with me.</p> <p>\u201cHe is such an idiot,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cHe wrote the address to our floral shop on the back.\u201d She takes the card out of my hands.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Ryle just bought me flowers. Not just any flower. He bought me a bouquet of lilies.</p><p>Allysa picks up her phone. \u201cI\u2019ll text him and tell him he screwed up.\u201d She shoots him a text and then laughs as she stares at the flowers. \u201cHow can a neurosurgeon be such an idiot?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop grinning. I\u2019m relieved she\u2019s staring at the flowers and not at me or she may put two and two together. \u201cI\u2019ll keep them in my office until we figure out where he intended for them to go.\u201d I scoop up the vase and whisk away my flowers.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cStop fidgeting,\u201d Devin says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fidgeting.\u201d</p><p>He loops his arm through mine as he walks me toward the elevator. \u201cYes, you are. And if you pull that top up over your cleavage one more time, it\u2019ll defeat the whole purpose of your little black dress.\u201d He grabs my top and yanks it back down, and then proceeds to reach inside to adjust my bra.</p><p>\u201cDevin!\u201d I slap his hand away and he laughs.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Lily. I\u2019ve touched way better boobs than yours and I\u2019m still gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I bet those boobs were attached to people you probably hang out with more than once every six months.\u201d</p><p>Devin laughs. \u201cTrue, but that\u2019s half your fault. You\u2019re the one who left us high and dry to play with flowers.\u201d</p><p>Devin was one of my favorite people at the marketing firm I worked at, but we weren\u2019t close enough to where we actively became friends outside of work. He stopped by the floral shop this afternoon and Allysa took to him almost immediately. She begged him to come to the party with me and since I didn\u2019t really want to show up alone, I ended up begging him to come, too.</p><p>I smooth my hands over my hair and try to catch a glimpse of my reflection in the elevator walls.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous. I just hate showing up to places where I don\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>Devin smirks knowingly and then says, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I release a pent-up breath.

Please have sex with me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Devin raises an eyebrow. \u201cHe begged?\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as pathetic as it sounds. He\u2019s usually more composed.\u201d</p><p>The elevator dings and the doors begin to open. I can hear music pouring from down the hallway. Devin takes both of my hands in his and says, \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan? Do I need to make this guy jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d But . . . Ryle does make it a point every time he sees me to tell me he hopes he never sees me again. \u201cMaybe just a little?\u201d I say, scrunching up my nose. \u201cA smidge?\u201d</p><p>Devin pops his jaw and says, \u201cConsider it done.\u201d He puts his hand on my lower back as he walks me out of the elevator. There\u2019s only one visible door in the hallway, so we make our way over and ring the doorbell.</p><p>\u201cWhy is there only one door?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cShe owns the whole top floor.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cAnd she works for you? Damn, your life just keeps getting more and more interesting.\u201d</p><p>The door begins to open, and I\u2019m extremely relieved to see Allysa standing in front of me. There\u2019s music and laughter pouring out of the apartment behind her. She\u2019s holding a champagne glass in one hand and a riding crop in the other. She sees me staring at the riding crop with a confused look on my face, so she tosses it over her shoulder and grabs my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d</p><p>She pulls me in and I squeeze Devin\u2019s hand and drag him behind me. She continues pulling us through a crowd of people until we reach the other side of the living room. \u201cHey!\u201d she says, tugging on Marshall\u2019s arm. He turns around and smiles at me, then pulls me in for a hug. I glance behind him, and around us, but there\u2019s no sign of Ryle. Maybe I got lucky and he got called in to work tonight.</p><p>Marshall reaches out for Devin\u2019s hand and shakes it. \u201cHey, man! Good to meet you!\u201d</p><p>Devin wraps an arm around my waist. \u201cI\u2019m Devin!\u201d he yells over the music. \u201cI\u2019m Lily\u2019s sexual partner!\u201d</p> <p>I laugh and elbow him, then lean in to his ear. \u201cThat\u2019s Marshall. Wrong guy, but nice effort.\u201d</p><p>Allysa grabs my arm and starts to pull me away from Devin. Marshall begins speaking to him, and my hand is reaching out behind me as I\u2019m being pulled in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Devin yells.</p><p>I follow Allysa into the kitchen, where she shoves a glass of champagne in my hand. \u201cDrink,\u201d she says. \u201cYou deserve it!\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of the champagne, but I can\u2019t even appreciate it now that I\u2019m getting a look at her industrial-sized kitchen with two full stovetops and a fridge bigger than my apartment. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou actually live here?\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd to think, I didn\u2019t even have to marry him for money. Marshall had seven bucks and drove a Ford Pinto when I fell in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he still drive a Ford Pinto?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cYeah, but we have a lot of good memories in that car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>She wiggles her eyebrows. \u201cSo . . . Devin is cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd probably more into Marshall than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, man,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a bummer. I thought I was playing matchmaker when I invited him to the party tonight.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen door opens and Devin walks in. \u201cYour husband is looking for you,\u201d he says to Allysa. She twirls her way out of the kitchen, giggling the whole time. \u201cI really like her,\u201d Devin says.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great, huh?\u201d</p><p>He leans against the island and says, \u201cSo. I think I just met The Beggar.\u201d</p><p>My heart flutters down my chest. I think The Neurosurgeon has a better ring to it. I take another sip of my champagne. \u201cHow do you know it was him? Did he introduce himself?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNah, but he overheard Marshall introducing me to someone as \u2018Lily\u2019s date.\u2019 I thought the look he gave me was going to set me on fire. That\u2019s why I came in here. I like you, but I\u2019m not willing to die for you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure that death glare he gave you was really his smile. They\u2019re superimposed most of the time.\u201d</p><p>The door swings open again and I immediately stiffen, but it\u2019s only a caterer. I sigh with relief. Devin says, \u201cLily,\u201d like my name is a disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to puke,\u201d he says, accusingly. \u201cYou really like him.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. But then I let my shoulders drop and I fake cry. \u201cI do, Devin. I do, I just don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He takes my glass of champagne and downs the remainder of it, then locks his arm in mine again. \u201cLet\u2019s go mingle,\u201d he says, pulling me out of the kitchen against my will.</p><p>The room is even more crowded now. There have to be more than a hundred people here. I\u2019m not even sure I know that many people.</p><p>We walk around and work the room. I stand back while Devin does most of the talking. He knows someone in common with every person he\u2019s met so far, and after about half an hour of following him around, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made it a personal game to find someone in common with everyone here. The whole time I mingle with him, my attention is half on him and half on the room, searching for traces of Ryle. I don\u2019t see him anywhere and I begin to wonder if the guy Devin saw was even Ryle to begin with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s odd,\u201d a woman says. \u201cWhat do you suppose it is?\u201d</p><p>I look up and see that she\u2019s staring at a piece of art on the wall. It looks like a photograph blown up on canvas. I tilt my head to inspect it. The woman turns her nose up and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would bother turning that photograph into wall art. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s so blurry, you can\u2019t even tell what it is.\u201d She walks away in a huff, and I\u2019m relieved. I mean . . . it\u2019s a bit weird, but who am I to judge Allysa\u2019s taste?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>His voice is low, deep, and right behind me. I close my eyes briefly and inhale a steadying breath before quietly exhaling, hoping he doesn\u2019t notice his voice has any effect on me whatsoever. \u201cI like it. I\u2019m not quite sure what it is, but it\u2019s interesting. Your sister has good taste.\u201d</p> <p>He steps around me so that he\u2019s at my side, facing me. He takes a step closer until he\u2019s so close, he brushes my arm. \u201cYou brought a date?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s asking it like it\u2019s a casual question, but I know it isn\u2019t. When I fail to respond, he leans in until he\u2019s whispering in my ear. He repeats himself, but this time it isn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou brought a date.\u201d</p><p>I find the courage to look over at him and instantly wish I hadn\u2019t. He\u2019s in a black suit that makes the scrubs look like child\u2019s play. First I swallow the unexpected lump in my throat and then I say, \u201cIs it a problem that I brought a date?\u201d I look away from him and back at the photograph hanging on the wall. \u201cI was trying to make things easier on you. You know. Just trying to make it stop.\u201d</p><p>He smirks and then downs the rest of his wine. \u201cHow thoughtful of you, Lily.\u201d He tosses his empty wineglass toward a trash can in the corner of the room. He makes the shot, but the glass shatters when it hits the bottom of the empty container. I glance around me, but no one saw what just happened. When I look back at Ryle, he\u2019s halfway down a hallway. He disappears into a room and I stand here, looking at the picture again.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see it.</p> <p>The picture is blurred, so it was hard to make out at first. But I can recognize that hair from anywhere. That\u2019s my hair. It\u2019s hard to miss, along with the marine-grade polymer lounge chair I\u2019m lying on. This is the picture he took on the rooftop the first night we met. He must have had it blown up and distorted so no one would notice what it was. I bring my hand to my neck, because my blood feels like it\u2019s bubbling. It\u2019s really warm in here.</p><p>Allysa appears at my side. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, huh?\u201d she says, looking at the picture.</p><p>I scratch at my chest. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot in here,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She glances around the room. \u201cIs it? I hadn\u2019t noticed, but I\u2019m a little drunk. I\u2019ll tell Marshall to turn on the air.\u201d</p><p>She disappears again, and the more I stare at the picture, the angrier I get. The man has a picture of me hanging in the apartment. He bought me flowers. He\u2019s giving me attitude because I brought a date to his sister\u2019s party. He\u2019s acting like there\u2019s actually something between us, and we\u2019ve never even kissed!</p><p>It all hits me at once. The anger . . . the irritation . . . the half glass of champagne I had in the kitchen. I\u2019m so mad, I can\u2019t even think straight. If the guy wants to have sex with me so bad . . . he shouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep! If he doesn\u2019t want me to swoon, he shouldn\u2019t buy me flowers! He shouldn\u2019t hang cryptic pictures of me where he lives!</p> <p>All I want is fresh air. I need fresh air. Luckily, I know just where to find it.</p><p>Moments later, I burst through the door to the rooftop. There are stragglers from the party up here. Three of them, seated on the patio furniture. I ignore them and walk to the ledge with the good view and lean over it. I suck in several deep breaths and try to calm myself down. I want to go downstairs and tell him to make up his damn mind, but I know I need to have a clear head before I do that.</p><p>The air is cold, and for some reason, I blame that on Ryle. Everything is his fault tonight. All of it. Wars, famine, gun violence\u2014it all somehow links back to Ryle.</p><p>\u201cCan we have a few minutes alone?\u201d</p><p>I spin around, and Ryle is standing near the other guests. Immediately, all three of them nod and begin to stand up to give us privacy. I hold up my hands and say, \u201cWait,\u201d but none of them look at me. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. Really, you don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d</p><p>Ryle stands stoically with his hands in his pockets while one of the guests mutters, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we don\u2019t mind.\u201d They begin to file back down the stairwell. I roll my eyes and spin back toward the ledge once I\u2019m alone with him.</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone always do what you say?\u201d I ask, irritated.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond. His footsteps are slow and deliberate as he closes in on me. My heart begins to beat like it\u2019s on a speed-date, and I start scratching at my chest again.</p> <p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says from behind me.</p><p>I turn around and grip the ledge behind me with both hands. His eyes journey down to my cleavage. As soon as they do, I yank at the top of my dress so he can\u2019t see it, and then I grip the ledge again. He laughs and takes another step closer. We\u2019re almost touching now, and my brain is mush. It\u2019s pathetic. I\u2019m pathetic.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you have a lot to say,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to give you the opportunity to speak your naked truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHah!\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>He nods, so I prepare to let him have it. I push against his chest and make my way around him so that he\u2019s the one leaning against the ledge now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell what you want, Ryle! And every time I get to the point where I start to not give a shit, you show up again out of the blue! You show up at my work, you show up at my apartment door, you show up at parties, you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here,\u201d he says, excusing the last one. That pisses me off even more. I clench my fists.</p> <p>\u201cUgh! You\u2019re driving me crazy! Do you want me or do you not?\u201d</p><p>He stands up straight and takes a step toward me. \u201cOh, I want you, Lily. Make no mistake about that. I just don\u2019t want to want you.\u201d</p><p>My whole body sighs at that comment. Partly out of frustration and partly because everything he says makes me shiver and I hate that I allow him to make me feel like this.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d I say, softening my voice. I feel too defeated right now to keep yelling at him. \u201cI like you, Ryle. And knowing that you only want me for one night makes me really, really sad. And maybe if this were a few months ago, we could have had sex and it would have been fine. You would have walked away and I could have easily moved on with my life. But it\u2019s not a few months ago. You waited too long, and too many pieces of me are invested in you now, so please. Stop flirting with me. Stop hanging pictures of me in your apartment. And stop sending me flowers. Because when you do those things, it doesn\u2019t feel good, Ryle. It actually kind of hurts.\u201d</p><p>I feel deflated and exhausted and I\u2019m ready to leave. He regards me silently, and I respectfully give him time to make his rebuttal. But he doesn\u2019t. He just turns around, leans over the ledge, and stares down at the street like he didn\u2019t hear a single word I said.</p> <p>I walk across the roof and open the door, half expecting him to call out my name or ask me not to leave. I get all the way back to the apartment before I finally lose all hope of that happening. I push through the crowd and make it through three different rooms before I spot Devin. When he sees the look on my face, he just nods and begins to make his way across the room toward me.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asks, looping his arm through mine.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes. So ready.\u201d</p><p>We find Allysa in the main living room. I tell her and Marshall goodnight, using the excuse that I\u2019m just exhausted from opening week and I\u2019d like to get some sleep before work tomorrow. Allysa gives me a hug and walks us to the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back on Monday,\u201d she says to me, kissing me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d I say to her. Devin opens the door, but right before we step into the hallway, I hear someone yell my name.</p> <p>I turn around and Ryle is pushing through the crowd on the other side of the room. \u201cLily, wait!\u201d he yells, still trying to make his way over to me. My heart is erratic. He\u2019s walking quickly, stepping around people, growing more frustrated with every person in his way. He finally reaches a break in the crowd and makes eye contact with me again. He holds my gaze as he marches toward me. He doesn\u2019t slow down. Allysa has to step out of his way as he walks straight up to me. At first, I think he might kiss me, or at least give a rebuttal to everything I said to him upstairs. But instead, he does something I\u2019m not at all prepared for. He scoops me up into his arms.</p><p>\u201cRyle!\u201d I yell, gripping him around the neck, afraid he might drop me. \u201cPut me down!\u201d He has an arm wrapped under my legs and one under my back.</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow Lily for the night,\u201d he says to Devin. \u201cThat okay?\u201d</p><p>I look at Devin and shake my head, wide-eyed. Devin just smirks and says, \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>Traitor!</p><p>Ryle starts to turn and walk back toward the living room. I look at Allysa as I pass her. Her eyes are wide with confusion. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill your brother!\u201d I yell at her.</p><p>Everyone in the entire room is staring now. I\u2019m so embarrassed, I just press my face against Ryle\u2019s chest as he walks me down the hallway and into his bedroom. Once the door is shut behind us, he slowly lowers my feet back to the f loor. I immediately start to yell at him and try to push him out of the way of the bedroom door, but he spins me and shoves me against the door, grabbing both of my wrists. He presses them against the wall above my head and says, \u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me so intently, I stop trying to fight him off of me and I hold my breath. His chest is pressing against mine, my back is pressed to the door. And then his mouth is on mine. Warm pressure against my lips.</p> <p>Despite the strength behind them, his lips are like silk. I\u2019m shocked at the moan that rushes through me, and even more shocked when I part my lips and want more. His tongue slides against mine and he releases my wrists to grab my face. His kiss grows deeper and I grasp at his hair, pulling him closer, feeling the kiss in my entire body.</p><p>Both of us become a medley of moans and gasps as the kiss brings us over the edge, our bodies wanting more than our mouths can deliver. I feel his hands as he reaches down and grabs my legs, lifting me up and hooking them around his waist.</p><p>My God, this man can kiss. It\u2019s as if he takes kissing as seriously as he takes his profession. He begins to pull me away from the door when I\u2019m hit with the realization that yes, his mouth is capable of a lot. But what his mouth has failed to do is respond to everything I told him upstairs.</p><p>For all I know, I\u2019ve just given in. I\u2019m giving him what he wants: a one-night stand. And that\u2019s the last thing he deserves right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull my mouth from his and push on his shoulders. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>He keeps walking toward his bed, so I say it again. \u201cRyle, put me down right now.\u201d</p><p>He stops walking and lowers me to the floor. I have to back away and face the other direction to gather my thoughts. Looking at him while I still feel his lips on mine is more than I can deal with right now.</p><p>I feel his arms go around my waist, and he rests his head on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers. He turns me around and brings a hand up to my face and brushes his thumb across my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now, okay?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t respond to his touch. I keep my arms folded across my chest and wait to hear what he has to say before I allow myself to respond to his touch.</p><p>\u201cI had that picture made the day after I took it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been in my apartment for months now, because you were the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen and I wanted to look at it every single day.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>\u201cAnd that night I showed up at your door? I went searching for you because no one in the history of my life has ever crawled under my skin and refused to leave like you did. I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. And the reason I sent you flowers this week is because I am really, really proud of you for following your dream. But if I sent you flowers every time I\u2019ve had the urge to send you flowers, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to fit inside your apartment. Because that\u2019s how much I think about you. And yes, Lily. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m hurting you, but I\u2019m hurting, too. And until tonight . . . I didn\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea how I even possibly find the strength to speak after that. \u201cWhy are you hurting?\u201d</p> <p>He drops his forehead to mine and says, \u201cBecause. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. You make me want to be a different person, but what if I don\u2019t know how to be what you need? This is all new to me and I want to prove to you that I want you for so much more than just one night.\u201d</p><p>He looks so vulnerable right now. I want to believe the genuine look in his eye, but he\u2019s been so adamant since the day that I met him that he wants the exact opposite of what I want. And it terrifies me that I\u2019ll give in to him and he\u2019ll walk away.</p><p>\u201cHow do I prove myself to you, Lily? Tell me and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I barely know the guy. I know him enough to know that sex with him won\u2019t be enough for me, though. But how do I know sex won\u2019t be the only thing he wants?</p><p>My eyes instantly lock with his. \u201cDon\u2019t have sex with me.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a moment, completely unreadable. But then he starts to nod his head like he\u2019s finally getting it. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, still nodding. \u201cOkay. I will not have sex with you, Lily Bloom.\u201d</p> <p>He walks around me to his bedroom door and he locks it. He flips off the light, leaving only a lamp on, and then takes off his shirt as he walks toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He tosses his shirt on a chair and then slips off his shoes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I glance at his bed. Then at him. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>He nods and walks over to me. In one swift movement, he lifts my dress up and over my head, until I\u2019m standing in the middle of his bedroom floor in my bra and panties. I cover myself, but he doesn\u2019t even look twice. He pulls me toward the bed and lifts the covers for me to crawl in. As he\u2019s walking over to his side of the bed he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t slept together before without having sex. Piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. He reaches his dresser and plugs his phone in to a charger. I take a moment to skim his bedroom. This certainly isn\u2019t the type of spare bedroom I\u2019m used to. Three of my bedrooms could fit in here. There\u2019s a couch against the other wall, a chair facing a television and a full office off the bedroom that looks complete with a floor-to-ceiling library. I\u2019m still trying to see everything around me when the lamp goes off.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is really rich,\u201d I say as I feel him pull the covers over both of us. \u201cWhat the hell does she do with the ten bucks an hour I pay her? Wipe her ass with it?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and grabs my hand, sliding his fingers through mine. \u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t even cash the checks,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you ever checked?\u201d</p> <p>I haven\u2019t. Now I\u2019m curious.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Lily,\u201d he says.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop smiling, because this is kind of ridiculous.</p><p>And so great.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Ryle.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I think I might be lost.</p><p>Everything is so white and so clean, it\u2019s blinding. I shuffle through one of the living rooms and try to find my way to the kitchen. I have no idea where my dress ended up last night, so I pulled on one of Ryle\u2019s shirts. It falls past my knees, and I wonder if he has to buy shirts that are too big for him just so they\u2019ll fit his arms.</p><p>There are too many windows and way too much sun, so I\u2019m forced to shield my eyes as I go in search of coffee.</p><p>I push through the kitchen doors and find a coffeemaker.</p><p>Thank you, Jesus.</p><p>I set it to brew and then go in search for a mug when the kitchen door opens behind me. I spin around and I\u2019m relieved to see that Allysa isn\u2019t always a perfect concoction of makeup and jewelry. Her hair is in a messy topknot and mascara is smeared down her cheeks. She points at the coffeemaker. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need me some of that,\u201d she says. She pulls herself up on the island and then slouches forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d I say.</p><p>She barely has the energy to nod.</p><p>I wave my hand around the kitchen. \u201cHow did this happen? How in the hell did your entire house become spotless between the party last night and me waking up just now? Did you stay up and clean?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWe have people for that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYep. There are people for everything,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Think of something. Anything. We probably have people for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGroceries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cChristmas d\u00e9cor?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cPeople for that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about birthday gifts? Like for family members?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cYep. People. Everyone in my family receives a gift and a card for every occasion and I never have to lift a finger.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWow. How long have you been this rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years,\u201d she says. \u201cMarshall sold a few apps he developed to Apple for a lot of money. Every six months, he creates updates and sells those, too.\u201d</p><p>The coffee transitions into a slow drip, so I grab a mug and fill it up. \u201cYou want anything in yours?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr do you have people for that?\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cYes. I have you, and I\u2019d like sugar, please.\u201d I stir some sugar into her cup and walk it over to her, then pour myself a cup. It grows quiet for a while as I mix in creamer, waiting for her to say something about me and Ryle. The conversation is inevitable.</p><p>\u201cCan we just get the awkwardness out of the way?\u201d she says.</p><p>I sigh, relieved. \u201cPlease. I hate this.\u201d I face her and take a sip of my coffee. She sets hers down beside her and then grips the countertop.</p><p>\u201cHow did that even happen?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying my best not to smile like I\u2019m love-struck. I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m weak, or a fool for giving in to him. \u201cWe met before I knew you.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head. \u201cWait,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore we got to know each other better or before we knew each other at all?\u201d \u201cAt all,\u201d I say. \u201cWe had a moment one night, about six months before I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moment?\u201d she says. \u201cAs in . . . a one-night stand?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNo, we never even kissed until last night. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t explain it. We just had this sort of flirtation thing going on for a really long time and it finally came to a head last night. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She picks up her coffee again and takes a slow drink from it. She stares down at the floor for a while and I can\u2019t help but notice she looks a little sad.</p> <p>\u201cAllysa? You\u2019re not mad at me, are you?\u201d</p><p>She immediately shakes her head. \u201cNo, Lily. I just . . .\u201d She sets down her coffee cup again. \u201cI just know my brother. And I love him. I really do. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Allysa and I both look in the direction of the voice. Ryle is standing in the doorway with his arms folded across his chest. He\u2019s wearing a pair of gray jogging pants that are barely hanging on to his hips. No shirt. I\u2019ll be adding this outfit to all the other ones I\u2019ve catalogued in my head.</p><p>Ryle pushes off the door and makes his way into the kitchen. He walks over to me and takes my cup of coffee out of my hands. He leans in and kisses me on the forehead, then takes a drink as he leans against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d he says to Allysa. \u201cBy all means, continue your conversation.\u201d</p><p>Allysa rolls her eyes and says, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He hands me back my cup of coffee and turns around to grab his own mug. He begins to pour from the pot. \u201cIt sounded to me like you were about to give Lily a warning. I\u2019m just curious as to what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Allysa hops off the counter and carries her mug to the sink. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Ryle. You don\u2019t have the best track record when it comes to relationships.\u201d She washes out the mug and then leans her hip into the sink, facing us. \u201cAs her friend, I have the right to give her my opinion when it comes to the guys she dates. That\u2019s what friends do.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly feeling uncomfortable as the tension grows thicker between the two of them. Ryle doesn\u2019t even take a drink of his coffee. He walks toward Allysa and pours it out in the sink. He\u2019s standing right in front of her, but she won\u2019t even look at him. \u201cWell, as your brother, I would hope you had a little more faith in me than you do. That\u2019s what siblings do.\u201d</p><p>He walks out of the kitchen, shoving the door open. When he\u2019s gone, Allysa takes a deep breath. She shakes her head and pulls her hands up to her face. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d she says, forcing a smile. \u201cI need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have people for that?\u201d</p><p>She laughs as she exits the kitchen. I wash my mug in the sink and head back to Ryle\u2019s bedroom. When I open the door, he\u2019s sitting on the couch, scrolling through his phone. He doesn\u2019t look up at me when I walk in and for a second, I think he might be mad at me, too. But then he tosses his phone aside and leans back into the couch.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says.</p><p>He grabs my hand and pulls me down on top of him so that I\u2019m straddling him. He brings my mouth to his and kisses me so hard, it makes me wonder if he\u2019s trying to prove his sister wrong.</p><p>Ryle pulls away from my mouth and slowly rakes his eyes down my body. \u201cI like you in my clothes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile. \u201cWell I have to get to work, so unfortunately, I can\u2019t keep them on.\u201d</p><p>He brushes the hair from my face and says, \u201cI have a really important surgery coming up that I need to prepare for. Which means I probably won\u2019t see you for a few days.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide my disappointment, but I have to get used to it if he really wants to try and make something work between us. He\u2019s already warned me that he works too much. \u201cI\u2019m busy, too. Grand opening is on Friday.\u201d</p><p>He says, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll see you before Friday. Promise.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t hide my grin this time. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me again, this time for a solid minute. He starts to lower me to the couch, but then he shoves away from me and says. \u201cNope. I like you too much to make out with you.\u201d</p><p>I lie down on the couch and watch him get dressed for work.</p><p>To my enjoyment, he puts on scrubs.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Lucy says.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting on the couch, mascara streaked down her cheeks.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>I drop my purse and rush over to her. As soon as I sit down next to her, she starts crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did Alex break up with you?\u201d</p><p>She starts shaking her head and then I really start freaking out. Please don\u2019t say cancer. I grab her hand, and that\u2019s when I see it. \u201cLucy! You\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know we still have six months left on the lease, but he wants me to move in with him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a minute. Is that why she\u2019s crying? Because she wants out of her lease? She reaches for a tissue and starts dabbing at her eyes. \u201cI feel awful, Lily. You\u2019re going to be all alone. I\u2019m moving and you won\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p><p>What the . . .</p><p>\u201cLucy? Um . . . I\u2019ll be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me with hope in her expression. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Why in the world does she have this impression of me? I nod again. \u201cYes. I\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>She throws her arms around me and hugs me. \u201cOh, thank you, Lily!\u201d She starts giggling in between bouts of tears. When she releases me, she jumps up and says, \u201cI have to go tell Alex! He was so worried you wouldn\u2019t let me out of my lease!\u201d She grabs her purse and shoes and disappears out the front door.</p><p>I lie back on the couch and stare up at the ceiling. Did she just play me?</p> <p>I start laughing, because until this moment, I had no idea how much I\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen. The whole place to myself!</p><p>What\u2019s even better, is when I do decide to have sex with Ryle, we can have it over here all the time and not have to worry about being quiet.</p><p>The last time I spoke to Ryle was when I left his apartment on Saturday. We agreed on a trial run. No commitments yet. Just a relationship feeler to see if it\u2019s something we both want. It\u2019s now Monday night and I\u2019m a little disappointed I haven\u2019t heard from him. I gave him my phone number before we parted Saturday, but I don\u2019t really know texting etiquette, especially for trial runs.</p><p>Regardless, I\u2019m not texting him first.</p><p>I decide to occupy my time with teenage angst and Ellen DeGeneres, instead. I\u2019m not about to wait around to be beckoned by a guy I\u2019m not even having sex with. But I don\u2019t know why I assume that reading about the first guy I had sex with will somehow get my mind off the guy I\u2019m not having sex with.</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>My great-grandfather\u2019s name is Ellis. My entire life, I thought that was a really cool name for such an old guy. After he died, I was reading the obituary. Would you believe that Ellis wasn\u2019t even his real name? His real name was Levi Sampson and I had no idea.</p><p>I asked my grandmother where the name Ellis came from. She said his initials were L.S. and everyone called him by his initials for so long, they just started sounding them out over the years.</p><p>Which is why they referred to him as Ellis.</p><p>I was looking at your name just now and it made me think of that. Ellen. Is that even your real name? You could be just like my great-grandfather and using your initials as a disguise.</p><p>L.N.</p><p>I\u2019m onto you, \u201cEllen.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of names, do you think Atlas is a weird name? It is, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Yesterday while I was watching your show with him, I asked him where he got his name from. He said he didn\u2019t know. Without even thinking, I told him he should ask his mother why she named him that. He just looked over at me for a second and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little too late for that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what he meant by that. I don\u2019t know if his mom died, or if she gave him up for adoption. We\u2019ve been friends for a few weeks now and I still don\u2019t really know anything about him or why he doesn\u2019t have a place to live. I would just ask him, but I\u2019m not sure if he really trusts me yet. He seems to have trust issues and I guess I can\u2019t blame him.</p><p>I\u2019m worried about him. It started getting really cold this week and it\u2019s supposed to be even colder next week. If he doesn\u2019t have electricity, that means he doesn\u2019t have a heater. I hope he at least has blankets. Do you know how awful I would feel if he froze to death? Pretty freaking awful, Ellen.</p><p>I\u2019ll find some blankets this week and give them to him.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>It\u2019s going to start snowing soon so I decided to harvest my garden today. I had already pulled the radishes so I just wanted to put some mulch and compost down, which wouldn\u2019t have taken me long, but Atlas insisted on helping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He asked me a lot of questions about gardening and I liked that he seemed interested in my interests. I showed him how to lay the compost and mulch to cover the ground so that the snow wouldn\u2019t do too much damage. My garden is small compared to most gardens. Maybe ten feet by twelve feet. But it\u2019s all my dad will let me use of the backyard.</p><p>Atlas covered the whole thing while I sat cross-legged in the grass and watched him. I wasn\u2019t being lazy, he just took over and wanted to do it so I let him. I can tell he\u2019s a hard worker. I wonder if maybe keeping himself busy takes his mind off of things and that\u2019s why he always wants to help me so much.</p><p>When he was finished, he walked over and dropped down When he was finished, he walked over and dropped down next to me on the grass.next to me on the grass.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you want to grow things?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I glanced over at him and he was sitting cross-legged, looking at me curiously. I realized in that moment that he\u2019s probably the best friend I\u2019ve ever had, and we barely know anything about each other. I have friends at school, but they\u2019re never allowed to come over to my house for obvious reasons. My mother is always worried something might happen with my father and word might get out about his temper. I also never really get to go to other people\u2019s houses but I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe my father doesn\u2019t want me staying over at friends\u2019 houses because I might witness how a good husband is supposed to treat his wife. He probably wants me to believe the way he treats my mother is normal.</p><p>Atlas is the first friend I\u2019ve ever had that\u2019s ever been inside my house. He\u2019s also the first friend to know how much I like to garden. And now he\u2019s the first friend to ever ask me why I garden.</p><p>I reached down and pulled at a weed and started tearing it into little pieces while I thought about his question.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was ten, my mother got me a subscription to a website called Seeds Anonymous,\u201d I said. \u201cEvery month I would get an unmarked package of seeds in the mail with instructions on how to plant them and care for them. I wouldn\u2019t know what I was growing until it came up out of the ground. Every day after school I\u2019d run straight to the backyard to see the progress. It gave me something to look forward to. Growing things felt like a reward.\u201d</p><p>I could feel Atlas staring at me when he asked, \u201cA reward for what?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cFor loving my plants the right way. Plants reward you based on the amount of love you show them. If you\u2019re cruel to them or neglect them, they give you nothing. But if you care for them and love them the right way, they reward you with gifts in the form of vegetables or fruits or flowers.\u201d I looked down at the weed I was tearing apart in my hands and there was barely an inch left of it. I wadded it up between my fingers and flicked it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to look over at Atlas because I could still feel him staring, so instead, I just stared out over my mulch-covered garden.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just alike,\u201d he said.</p><p>My eyes flicked to his. \u201cMe and you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Plants and humans. Plants need to be loved the right way in order to survive. So do humans. We rely on our parents from birth to love us enough to keep us alive. And if our parents show us the right kind of love, we turn out as better humans overall. But if we\u2019re neglected . . .\u201d</p><p>His voice grew quiet. Almost sad. He wiped his hands on his knees, trying to get some of the dirt off. \u201cIf we\u2019re neglected, we end up homeless and incapable of anything meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>His words made my heart feel like the mulch he had just laid out. I didn\u2019t even know what to say to that. Does he really think that about himself?</p><p>He acted like he was about to get up, but before he did I said his name.</p><p>He sat back down in the grass. I pointed at the row of trees that lined the fence to the left of the yard. \u201cYou see that tree over there?\u201d In the middle of the row of trees was an oak tree that stood taller than all the rest of the trees.</p><p>Atlas glanced over at it and dragged his eyes all the way up to the top of the tree.</p><p>\u201cIt grew on its own,\u201d I said. \u201cMost plants do need a lot of care to survive. But some things, like trees, are strong enough to do it by just relying on themselves and nobody else.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea if he knew what I was trying to say without me coming out and saying it. But I just wanted him to know that I thought he was strong enough to survive whatever was going on in his life. I didn\u2019t know him well, but I could tell he was resilient. Way more than I would ever be if I were in his situation.</p><p>His eyes were glued to the tree. It was a long time before he even blinked. When he finally did, he just nodded a little and looked down at the grass. I thought with the way his mouth twitched that he was about to frown, but instead he actually smiled a little.</p><p>Seeing that smile made my heart feel like I had just startled it right out of a dead sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just alike,\u201d he said, repeating himself from earlier.</p><p>\u201cPlants and humans?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Me and you.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, Ellen. I hope he didn\u2019t notice, but I definitely sucked in a rush of air. Because what the heck was I supposed to say to that?</p><p>I just sat there, really awkward and quiet until he stood up. He turned like he was about to walk home.</p><p>\u201cAtlas, wait.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back down at me. I pointed at his hands and said, \u201cYou might want to take a quick shower before you go back. Compost is made from cow manure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted his hands and looked down at them and then he looked down at his compost-covered clothes.</p><p>\u201cCow manure? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>I grinned and nodded. He laughed a little and then before I knew it, he was on the ground next to me, wiping his hands all over me. We were both laughing as he reached to the bag next to us and stuck his hand inside, then smeared it down my arms.</p><p>Ellen, I am confident that the next sentence I am about to write has never been written or spoken aloud before.</p> <p>When he was wiping that cow shit on me, it was quite possibly the most turned-on I have ever been.</p><p>After a few minutes, we were both lying on the ground, breathing hard, still laughing. He finally stood up and pulled me to my feet, knowing he couldn\u2019t waste minutes if he wanted a shower before my parents came home.</p><p>Once he was in the shower, I washed my hands in the sink and just stood there, wondering what he meant earlier when he said we were just alike.</p><p>Was it a compliment? It sure felt like one. Was he saying that he thought I was strong, too? Because I certainly didn\u2019t feel strong most of the time. In that moment, just thinking about him made me feel weak. I wondered what I was going to do about the way I was starting to feel when I was around him.</p><p>I also wondered how long I can keep hiding him from my parents. And how long he\u2019ll be staying at that house. Winters in Maine are unbearably cold and he won\u2019t survive without a heater.</p> <p>Or blankets.</p><p>I gathered myself and went in search of all the spare blankets I could find. I was going to give them to him when he got out of the shower, but it was already five and he left in a hurry.</p><p>I\u2019ll give them to him tomorrow.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Harry Connick Jr. is freaking hilarious. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever had him on your show, because I hate to admit I\u2019ve probably missed an episode or two since you\u2019ve been on the air, but if you\u2019ve never had him, you should. Actually, have you ever watched Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien? He has this guy named Andy who sits on the couch for every episode. I wish Harry could sit on your couch for every episode. He just has the best one-liners, and the two of you toget.her would be epic.</p> <p>I just want to say thank you. I know that you don\u2019t have a show on TV for the sole purpose of making me laugh, but sometimes it feels that way. Sometimes my life just makes me feel like I\u2019ve lost the ability to laugh or smile, but then I turn on your show and no matter what mood I\u2019m in when I turn on the TV, I always feel better by the time your show is over.</p><p>So yeah. Thanks for that.</p><p>I know you probably want an update on Atlas, and I\u2019ll give you one in a second. But first I need to tell you about what happened yesterday.</p><p>My mother is a teaching assistant over at Brimer Elementary. It\u2019s a bit of a drive and that\u2019s why she never gets home until around five o\u2019clock. My dad works two miles from here, so he\u2019s always home right after five.</p><p>We have a garage, but only one car can fit in it because of all my dad\u2019s stuff. My dad keeps his car in the garage and my mom keeps her car in the driveway.</p><p>Well, yesterday my mom got home a little bit early. Atlas was still at the house and we were almost finished watching your show when I heard the garage door start to open. He ran out the back door and I rushed around the living room cleaning up our soda cans and snacks.</p><p>It had started snowing really hard around lunchtime yesterday and my mother had a lot of stuff to carry in, so she pulled up in the garage so she could bring it all in through the kitchen door. It was work stuff and a few groceries. I was helping her bring everything inside when my dad pulled up in the driveway. He started honking his horn because he was mad that my mom was parked in the garage. I guess he didn\u2019t want to have to get out of his car in the snow. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of that would make him want her to move her car right then and there, instead of just waiting until she was finished unloading it. Come to think of it, why does my father always get the garage? You would think a man wouldn\u2019t want the woman he loves to get the shittier parking spot.</p><p>Anyway, my mother got that real scared look in her eye when he started honking and she told me to take all her stuff to the table while she moved her car out.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what happened when she went back outside. I heard a crash, and then I heard her scream, so I ran to the garage thinking maybe she had slipped on ice.</p><p>Ellen . . . I don\u2019t even want to describe what happened next. I\u2019m still a little shocked by the whole thing.</p><p>I opened the garage door and didn\u2019t see my mom. I just saw my dad behind the car doing something. I took a step closer and realized why I couldn\u2019t see my mom. He had her pushed down on the hood with his hands around her throat.</p><p>He was choking her, Ellen!</p><p>I might cry just thinking about it. He was yelling at her, staring down at her with so much hatred. Something about not having respect for how hard he works. I don\u2019t know why he was mad, really, because all I could hear was her silence while she struggled to breathe. The next few minutes are a blur, but I know I started screaming at him. I jumped on his back and I was hitting him on the side of his head.</p><p>Then I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know what happened, but I\u2019m guessing he threw me off of him. I just remembered one second I was on his back and the next second I was on the ground and my forehead hurt like you wouldn\u2019t believe. My mom was sitting next to me, holding my head and telling me she was sorry. I looked around for my dad, but he wasn\u2019t there. He\u2019d gotten into his car and drove off after I hit my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mom gave me a rag and told me to hold it to my head because it was bleeding and then she helped me to her car and drove me to the hospital. On the way there she only said one thing to me.</p><p>\u201cWhen they ask you what happened, tell them you slipped on the ice.\u201d</p><p>When she said that, I just looked out my window and started crying. Because I thought for sure this was the final straw. That she would leave him now that he had hurt me. That was the moment I realized that she\u2019d never leave him. I felt so defeated, but I was too scared to say anything to her about it.</p><p>I had to get nine stitches in my forehead. I\u2019m still not sure what I hit my head on, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. The fact is, my father was the reason I was hurt and he didn\u2019t even stay and check on me. He just left us both there on the floor of the garage and left.</p> <p>I got home really late last night and fell right to sleep because they had given me some kind of pain pill.</p><p>This morning when I walked to the bus, I tried not to look directly at Atlas so he wouldn\u2019t see my forehead. I had fixed my hair so that you couldn\u2019t really see it and he didn\u2019t notice right away. When we sat down next to each other on the bus, our hands touched when we were putting our stuff on the floor.</p><p>His hands were like ice, Ellen. Ice.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized that I forgot to give him the blankets I had pulled out for him yesterday because my mother got home sooner than I expected. The incident in the garage sort of took over all my thoughts and I completely forgot about him. It had snowed and iced all night and he had been over there at that house in the dark all by himself. And now he was so cold, I didn\u2019t know how he was even functioning.</p><p>I grabbed both of his hands in mine and said, \u201cAtlas. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything. I just started rubbing his hands in mine to warm them up. I laid my head on his shoulder and then I did the most embarrassing thing. I just started to cry. I don\u2019t cry very much, but I was still so upset by what happened yesterday and then I was feeling so guilty that I forgot to take him blankets and it all hit me right there on the ride to school. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just pulled his hands from mine so I\u2019d stop rubbing them and then he laid his hands on top of mine. We just sat there like that the whole ride to school with our heads leaned together and his hands on top of mine.</p><p>I might have thought it was sweet if it wasn\u2019t so sad. On the ride home from school is when he finally noticed my head.</p><p>Honestly, I had forgotten about it. No one at school even asked me about it and when he sat down next to me on the bus, I wasn\u2019t even trying to hide it with my hair. He looked right at me and said, \u201cWhat happened to your head?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to him. I just touched it with my fingers and then looked out the window. I\u2019ve been trying to get him to trust me more in hopes he would tell me why he doesn\u2019t have a place to live, so I didn\u2019t want to lie to him. I just didn\u2019t want to tell him the truth, either.</p><p>When the bus started moving, he said, \u201cYesterday after I left your house, I heard something going on over there. I heard yelling. I heard you scream, and then I saw your father leave. I was going to come check on you to make sure everything was okay, but as I was walking over I saw you leaving in the car with your mother.\u201d</p><p>He must have heard the fight in the garage and saw her leaving to take me to get the stitches. I couldn\u2019t believe he came over to our house. Do you know what my dad would do to him if he saw him wearing his clothes? I got so worried for him because I don\u2019t think he knows what my father is capable of.</p> <p>I looked at him and said, \u201cAtlas, you can\u2019t do that! You can\u2019t come to my house when my parents are home!\u201d</p><p>Atlas got real quiet and then said, \u201cI heard you scream, Lily.\u201d He said it like me being in danger trumped anything else.</p><p>I felt bad because I know he was just trying to help, but that would have made things so much worse.</p><p>\u201cI fell,\u201d I said to him. As soon as I said it, I felt bad for lying. And to be honest, he looked a little disappointed in me, because I think we both knew in that moment that it wasn\u2019t as simple as a fall.</p><p>Then he pulled up the sleeve of his shirt and held out his arm.</p><p>Ellen, my stomach dropped. It was so bad. All over his arm he had these small scars. Some of the scars looked just like someone had stuck a cigarette to his arm and held it there.</p><p>He twisted his arm around so I could see that it was on the other side, too. \u201cI used to fall a lot, too, Lily.\u201d Then he pulled his shirtsleeve down and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>For a second I wanted to tell him it wasn\u2019t like that\u2014that my dad never hurts me and that he was just trying to get me off of him. But then I realized I\u2019d be using the same excuses my mom uses.</p> <p>I felt a little embarrassed that he knows what goes on at my house. I spent the whole rest of the bus ride looking out the window because I didn\u2019t know what to say to him.</p><p>When we got home, my mom\u2019s car was there. In the driveway, of course. Not the garage.</p><p>That meant Atlas couldn\u2019t come over and watch your show with me. I was gonna tell him I would bring him blankets later, but when he got off the bus he didn\u2019t even tell me bye. He just started walking down the street like he was mad.</p><p>It\u2019s dark now and I\u2019m waiting on my parents to go to sleep. But in a little while I\u2019m gonna take him some blankets.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I\u2019m in way over my head.</p><p>Do you ever do things you know are wrong, but are somehow also right? I don\u2019t know how to put it in simpler terms than that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mean, I\u2019m only fifteen and I certainly shouldn\u2019t have boys spending the night in my bedroom. But if a person knows someone needs a place to stay, isn\u2019t it that person\u2019s responsibility as a human to help them?</p><p>Last night after my parents went to sleep, I snuck out the back door to take Atlas those blankets. I took a flashlight with me because it was dark. It was still snowing really hard, so by the time I made it to that house, I was freezing. I beat on the back door and as soon as he opened it, I pushed past him to get out of the cold.</p><p>Only . . . I didn\u2019t get out of the cold. Somehow, it felt even colder inside that old house. I still had my flashlight on and I shined it around the living room and kitchen. There wasn\u2019t anything in there, Ellen!</p><p>No couch, no chair, no mattress. I handed the blankets off to him and kept looking around me. There was a big hole in the roof over the kitchen and wind and snow were just pouring in. When I shined my light around the living room, I saw his stuff in one of the corners. His backpack, plus the backpack I\u2019d given him. There was a little pile of other stuff I\u2019d given him, like some of my dad\u2019s clothes. And then there were two towels on the floor. One I guess he laid on and one he covered up with.</p> <p>I put my hand over my mouth because I was so horrified. He\u2019d been there living like that for weeks!</p><p>Atlas put his hand on my back and tried to walk me back out the door. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be over here, Lily,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I grabbed his hand and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here, either.\u201d I started to pull him out the front door with me, but he yanked his hand back. That\u2019s when I said, \u201cYou can sleep on my floor tonight. I\u2019ll keep my bedroom door locked. You can\u2019t sleep here, Atlas. It\u2019s too cold and you\u2019ll get pneumonia and die.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m sure the thought of being caught in my bedroom was just as scary as getting pneumonia and dying. He looked back at his spot in the living room and then he just nodded his head once and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>So you tell me, Ellen. Was I wrong letting him sleep in my room</p> <p>last night? It doesn\u2019t feel wrong. It felt like the right thing to do. But I sure would get in a lot of trouble if we had been caught. He slept on the floor, so it\u2019s not like it was anything more than me just giving him somewhere warm to sleep.</p><p>I did learn a little more about him last night. After I snuck him in the back door and to my room, I locked my door and made a pallet for him on the floor next to my bed. I set the alarm for 6 a.m. and told him he\u2019d have to get up and leave before my parents woke up, since sometimes my mom wakes me up in the mornings.</p><p>I crawled in my bed and scooted over to the edge of it so I could look down at him while we talked for a little while. I asked him how long he thought he might stay there and he said he didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s when I asked him how he ended up there. My lamp was still on, and we were whispering, but he got real quiet when I said that. He just stared up at me with his hands behind his head for a moment. Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know my real dad. He never had anything to do with me. It\u2019s always just been me and my mom, but she got remarried about five years ago to a guy who never really liked me much. We fought a lot. When I turned eighteen a few months ago, we got in a big fight and he kicked me out of the house.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath like he didn\u2019t want to tell me any more. But then he started talking again. \u201cI\u2019ve been staying with a friend of mine and his family since then, but his dad got a transfer to Colorado and they moved. They couldn\u2019t take me with them, of course. His parents were just being nice by letting me stay with them and I knew that, so I told them I talked to my mom and that I was moving back home. The day they left, I didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. So I went back home and told my mom I\u2019d like to move back in until I graduated. She wouldn\u2019t let me. Said it would upset my stepfather.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and looked at the wall. \u201cSo I just wandered around for a few days until I saw that house. Figured I would just stay there until something better came along or until I graduated. I\u2019m signed up to go to the Marines come May, so I\u2019m just trying to hang on until then.\u201d</p><p>May is six months away, Ellen. Six.</p> <p>I had tears in my eyes when he finished telling me all that. I asked him why he didn\u2019t just ask someone if they could help him. He said he tried, but it\u2019s harder for an adult than a kid, and he\u2019s already eighteen. He said someone gave him a number for some shelters who might help him. There were three shelters in a twenty-mile radius of our town, but two of them were for battered women. The other one was a homeless shelter, but they only had a few beds and it was too far away for him to walk there if he wanted to go to school every day. Plus, you have to wait in a long line to try and get a bed. He said he tried it once, but he feels safer in that old house than he did at the shelter.</p><p>Like the na\u00efve girl I am when it comes to situations like his, I said, \u201cBut aren\u2019t there other options? Can\u2019t you just tell the school counselor what your mom did?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and said he\u2019s too old for foster care. He\u2019s eighteen, so his mother can\u2019t get in trouble for not allowing him to go back home. He said he called about getting food stamps last week, but he didn\u2019t have a ride or money to get to his appointment. Not to mention he doesn\u2019t have a car, so he can\u2019t very well find a job. He said he\u2019s been looking, though. After he leaves my house in the afternoons he goes and applies at places, but he doesn\u2019t have an address or a phone number to put down on the applications so that makes it harder for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swear, Ellen, every question I threw at him, he had an answer for. It\u2019s like he\u2019s tried everything not to be stuck in the situation he\u2019s in, but there isn\u2019t enough help out there for people like him. I got so mad at his whole situation, I told him he was crazy for wanting to go into the military. I wasn\u2019t so much whispering when I said, \u201cWhy in the heck would you want to serve a country that has allowed you to end up in this kind of situation?\u201d</p><p>You know what he said next, Ellen? His eyes grew sad and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not this country\u2019s fault my mother doesn\u2019t give a shit about me.\u201d Then he reached up and turned off my lamp. \u201cGoodnight, Lily,\u201d he said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep much after that. I was too mad. I\u2019m not even sure who I\u2019m mad at. I just kept thinking about our country and the whole world and how screwed up it is that people don\u2019t do more for each other. I don\u2019t know when humans started only looking out for themselves. Maybe it\u2019s always been this way. It made me wonder how many people out there were just like Atlas. It made me wonder if there were other kids at our school who might be homeless.</p><p>I go to school every day and internally complain about it most of the time, but I\u2019ve never once thought that school might be the only home some kids have. It\u2019s the only place Atlas can go and know he\u2019ll have food.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never be able to respect rich people now, knowing they willingly choose to spend their money on materialistic things rather than using it to help other people.</p><p>No offense, Ellen. I know you\u2019re rich, but I guess I\u2019m not referring to people like you. I\u2019ve seen all the stuff you\u2019ve done for others on your show and all the charities you support. But I know there are a lot of rich people out there who are selfish. Hell, there are even selfish poor people. And selfish middle-class people. Look at my parents. We aren\u2019t rich, but we certainly aren\u2019t too poor to help other people. Yet, I don\u2019t think my dad has ever done anything for a charity.</p><p>I remember one time we were walking into a grocery store and an old man was ringing a bell for the Salvation Army. I asked my dad if we could give him some money and he told me no, that he works hard for his money and he wasn\u2019t about to let me give it away. He said it isn\u2019t his fault that other people don\u2019t want to work. He spent the whole time we were in the grocery store telling me about how people take advantage of the government and until the government stops helping those people by giving them handouts, the problem won\u2019t ever go away.</p><p>Ellen, I believed him. That was three years ago and all this time I thought homeless people were homeless because they were lazy or drug addicts or just didn\u2019t want to work like other people. But now I know that\u2019s not true. Sure, some of what he said was true to an extent, but he was using the worst-case scenarios. Not everyone is homeless because they choose to be. They\u2019re homeless because there isn\u2019t enough help to go around.</p><p>And people like my father are the problem. Instead of helping others, people use the worst-case scenarios to excuse their own selfishness and greed.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never be like that. I swear to you, when I grow up, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help other people. I\u2019ll be like you, Ellen. Just probably not as rich.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I drop the journal on my chest. I\u2019m surprised to feel tears running down my cheeks. Every time I pick up this journal I think I\u2019ll be fine\u2014that it all happened so long ago and I won\u2019t still feel what I felt back then.</p><p>I\u2019m such a sap. It gives me this longing to hug so many people from my past. Especially my mother because for the past year, I haven\u2019t really thought about everything she had to go through before my father died. I know it probably still hurts her.</p><p>I grab my phone to call her and look at the screen. There are four missed texts from Ryle. My heart immediately skips. I can\u2019t believe I had it on silent! Then I roll my eyes, annoyed with myself, because I should not be this excited.</p> <p>Ryle: Are you asleep?</p><p>Ryle: I guess so.</p><p>Ryle: Lily . . .</p><p>Ryle. : (</p><p>The sad face was sent ten minutes ago. I hit Reply and type, \u201cNope. Not asleep.\u201d About ten seconds later, I get another text.</p><p>Ryle: Good. I\u2019m walking up your stairs right now. Be there in twenty seconds.</p><p>I grin and jump out of bed. I go to the bathroom and check my face. Good enough. I run to the front door and open it as soon as Ryle makes it up the stairwell. He practically drags himself up the top step, and then stops to rest when he finally reaches my door. He looks so tired. His eyes are red and there are dark circles under them. His arms slip around my waist and he pulls me to him, burying his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I pull him inside the apartment. \u201cAre you hungry? I can make you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he wrestles out of his jacket, so I skip the kitchen and head for the bedroom. He follows me, and then throws his jacket over the back of the chair. He kicks off his shoes and pushes them against the wall.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing scrubs.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d I say.</p><p>He smiles and puts his hands on my hips. \u201cI am. I just assisted in an eighteen-hour surgery.\u201d He bends down and kisses the heart tattoo on my collarbone.</p><p>No wonder he\u2019s exhausted. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d I say. \u201cEighteen hours?\u201d</p><p>He nods and then walks me to the side of the bed where he pulls me down next to him. We adjust ourselves until we\u2019re facing each other, sharing a pillow. \u201cYeah, but it was amazing. Groundbreaking. They\u2019ll write about it in medical journals, and I got to be there, so I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m just really tired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean in and give him a peck on the mouth. He brings his hand to the side of my head and pulls back. \u201cI know you\u2019re probably ready to have hot, sweaty sex, but I don\u2019t have the energy tonight. I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019ve missed you and for some reason I sleep better when I sleep next to you. Is it okay that I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIt\u2019s more than okay.\u201d</p><p>He leans in and kisses my forehead. He grabs my hand and then holds it between us on the pillow. His eyes close, but I keep mine open and stare at him. He has the type of face that people shy away from, because you could get lost in it. And to think, I get to look at this face all the time. I don\u2019t have to be modest and look away, because he\u2019s mine.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>This is a trial run. I have to remember that.</p><p>After a minute, he releases my hand and begins to flex his fingers. I look down at his hand and wonder what that must be like . . . to have to stand for so long and use your fine motor skills for eighteen hours straight. I can\u2019t think of much else that would match that level of exhaustion.</p><p>I slide out of the bed and retrieve some lotion out of my bathroom. I go back to the bed and sit cross-legged next to him. I squirt some lotion on my hand and then pull his arm to my lap. He opens his eyes and looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cShh. Go back to sleep,\u201d I say. I press my thumbs into the palm of his hand and rotate them upward and then out. His eyes fall shut and he groans into the pillow. I continue massaging his hand for about five minutes before switching to his other hand. He keeps his eyes closed the whole time. When I\u2019m finished with his hands, I roll him onto his stomach and straddle his back. He assists me in pulling off his shirt, but his arms are like noodles.</p><p>I massage his shoulders and his neck and his back and his arms. When I\u2019m finished, I roll off of him and lie down beside him.</p><p>I\u2019m running my fingers through his hair and massaging his scalp when he opens his eyes. \u201cLily?\u201d he whispers, looking at me sincerely. \u201cYou just might be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Those words wrap around me like a warm blanket. I don\u2019t know what to say in response. He lifts a hand and gently cups my cheek, and I feel his stare deep in my stomach. Slowly, he leans forward and presses his lips to mine. I expect a peck, but he doesn\u2019t pull back. The tip of his tongue slides across my lips, parting them softly. His mouth is so warm, I moan as his kiss grows deeper.</p><p>He rolls me onto my back and then drags his hand down my body, straight to my hip. He moves closer, sliding his hand down my thigh. He pushes against me and a surge of heat shoots inside me. I grab a fistful of his hair and whisper against his mouth. \u201cI think we\u2019ve waited long enough. I would very much like for you to fuck me now.\u201d</p><p>He practically growls with a renewed sense of energy and begins to pull my shirt off. It becomes an interlude of hands and moans and tongues and sweat. I feel like this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been touched by a man. The few who came before him were all boys\u2014nervous hands and timid mouths. But Ryle is all confidence. He knows exactly where to touch me and exactly how to kiss me.</p><p>The only time he\u2019s not giving my body his undivided attention is when he reaches to the floor and fishes a condom out of his wallet. Once he\u2019s back under the covers and the condom is in place, he doesn\u2019t even hesitate. He takes me brazenly in one swift thrust and I gasp into his mouth, every muscle in me tensing.</p><p>His mouth is fierce and needy, kissing me everywhere he can reach. I grow so dizzy, I can do nothing but succumb to him. He\u2019s unapologetic in the way he fucks me. His hand comes between my headboard and the top of my head as he pushes harder and harder, the bed crashing against the wall with every push.</p><p>My fingernails dig into the skin of his back as he buries his face against my neck.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cRyle!\u201d I scream.</p><p>And then I bite down on his shoulder to muffle every sound that comes after it. My whole body feels it\u2014from my head to my toes and back up again.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid I might literally pass out for a moment, so I tighten my legs around him and he tenses. \u201cJesus, Lily.\u201d His body ripples with tremors, and he shoves against me one last time. He groans, stilling himself on top of me. His body jerks with his release and my head falls back against the pillow.</p><p>It\u2019s a full minute before either of us is able to move. And even then, we choose not to. He presses his face into the pillow and lets out a deep sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t . . .\u201d He pulls back and looks down at me. His eyes are full of something . . . I don\u2019t know what. He presses his lips to mine and then says, \u201cYou were so right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>He slowly pulls out of me, coming down on his forearms. \u201cYou warned me. You said one time with you wouldn\u2019t be enough. You said you were like a drug. But you failed to tell me you were the most addictive kind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a personal question?\u201d</p><p>Allysa nods as she perfects a bouquet of flowers about to go out for delivery. We\u2019re three days away from our grand opening, and it just keeps getting busier by the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Allysa asks, facing me. She leans into the counter and starts picking at her fingernails.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer it if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I warn. \u201cWell I can\u2019t answer it if you don\u2019t ask it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a good point. \u201cDo you and Marshall donate to charity?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Confusion crosses her face and she says, \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI was just curious. I wouldn\u2019t judge you or anything. I\u2019ve just been thinking lately about how I might like to start a charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of charity?\u201d she asks. \u201cWe donate to a few different ones now that we have money, but my favorite is this one we got involved with last year. They build schools in other countries. We\u2019ve funded three new constructions in the past year alone.\u201d</p><p>I knew I liked her for a reason.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money, obviously, but I\u2019d like to do something. I just don\u2019t know what yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get through this grand opening first and then you can start thinking about philanthropy. One dream at a time, Lily.\u201d She walks around the counter and grabs the trash can. I watch as she pulls the full bag out of it and ties it in a knot. It makes me wonder why\u2014if she has people for everything\u2014she would even want a job where she had to take out the trash and get her hands dirty.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you work here?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She glances up at me and smiles. \u201cBecause I like you,\u201d she says. But then I notice the smile completely leave her eyes right before she turns and walks toward the back to throw out the trash. When she comes back, I\u2019m still watching her curiously. I say it again.</p><p>\u201cAllysa? Why do you work here?\u201d</p> <p>She stops what she\u2019s doing and takes in a slow breath like maybe she\u2019s contemplating being honest with me. She walks back to the counter and leans against it, crossing her feet at her ankles.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she says, looking down at her feet. \u201cI can\u2019t get pregnant. We\u2019ve been trying for two years but nothing has worked. I was tired of sitting at home crying all the time, so I decided I should find something to keep my mind busy.\u201d She stands up straight and wipes her hands across her jeans. \u201cAnd you, Lily Bloom, are keeping me very busy.\u201d She turns and starts messing with the same bouquet of flowers again. She\u2019s been perfecting them for half an hour. She picks up a card and stuffs it in the flowers, and then turns around and hands me the vase. \u201cThese are for you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious Allysa wants to change the subject, so I take the flowers from her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and waves me off to my office. \u201cIt\u2019s on the card. Go read it.\u201d</p><p>I can tell by her annoyed reaction that they\u2019re from Ryle. I grin and run to my office. I take a seat at my desk and pull out the card.</p><p>Lily,</p> <p>I\u2019m having serious withdrawals.</p><p>\u2014Ryle</p><p>I smile and put the card back in the envelope. I grab my phone and snap a picture of me holding the flowers with my tongue sticking out. I text it to Ryle.</p><p>Me: I tried to warn you.</p><p>He immediately starts texting me back. I watch anxiously as the dots on my phone move back and forth.</p><p>Ryle: I need my next fix. I\u2019ll be finished here in about thirty minutes. Can I take you to dinner?</p><p>Me: Can\u2019t. Mom wants me to try a new restaurant with her tonight. She\u2019s an obnoxious foodie. : (</p><p>Ryle: I like food. I eat food. Where are you taking her?</p> <p>Me: A place called Bib\u2019s on Marketson.</p><p>Ryle: Is there room for one more?</p><p>I stare at his text for a moment. He wants to meet my mother? We aren\u2019t even officially dating. I mean . . . I don\u2019t care if he meets my mother. She would love him. But he went from not wanting anything to do with relationships, to possibly agreeing to test-drive one, to meeting the parents, all within five days? Good God. I really am a drug.</p><p>Me: Sure. Meet us there in half an hour.</p><p>I walk out of my office and straight up to Allysa. I hold my phone in front of her face. \u201cHe wants to meet my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother?\u201d she says, looking as shocked as I feel. I nod. \u201cYour brother. My mother.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my phone and looks at the texts. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s so weird.\u201d</p><p>I take my phone from her hands. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and says, \u201cYou know what I mean. It\u2019s Ryle we\u2019re talking about here. He\u2019s never, in the history of being Ryle Kincaid, met a girl\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>Of course hearing her say that makes me smile, but then I wonder if maybe he\u2019s doing this just to please me. If maybe he\u2019s doing things he doesn\u2019t really want to do just because he knows I want a relationship.</p><p>And then I smile even bigger, because isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s all about? Sacrificing for the person you like so that you can see them happy?</p><p>\u201cYour brother must really like me,\u201d I say teasingly. I look back up at Allysa, expecting her to laugh, but there\u2019s a solemn look on her face.</p><p>She nods and says, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m afraid he does.\u201d She grabs her purse from beneath the counter and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna head out now. Let me know how it goes, okay?\u201d She moves past me and I watch her as she makes her way out the door, and then I just stare at the door for a long time.</p><p>It bothers me that she doesn\u2019t seem excited about the prospect of me dating Ryle. It makes me wonder if that has more to do with her feelings toward me or her feelings toward him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I flip the sign to closed. Just a few more days. I lock the door and walk to my car, but stop short when I see someone leaning against it. It takes me a moment to recognize him. He\u2019s facing the other direction, talking on his cell phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought he was meeting me at the restaurant, but okay.</p><p>The horn beeps on my car when I hit the Unlock button, and Ryle spins around. He grins when he sees me. \u201cYes, I agree,\u201d he says into the phone. He wraps an arm around my shoulder and pulls me against him, pressing a kiss to the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething really important just came up.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up the phone and slides it into his pocket, then he kisses me. It\u2019s not a hello kiss. It\u2019s an I\u2019ve-been-thinking-about-you-nonstop kiss. He wraps both arms around me and spins me until I\u2019m backed up against my car, where he continues to kiss me until I start to feel dizzy again. When he pulls back, he\u2019s looking down at me appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cYou know which part of you drives me the craziest?\u201d He brings his fingers to my mouth and traces my smile. \u201cThese,\u201d he says. \u201cYour lips. I love how they\u2019re as red as your hair and you don\u2019t even have to wear lipstick.\u201d</p> <p>I grin and kiss his fingers. \u201cI better watch you around my mom, then, because everyone says we have the same mouth.\u201d</p><p>He pauses his fingers against my lips and he stops smiling. \u201cLily. Just . . . no.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and open my door. \u201cAre we taking separate cars?\u201d</p><p>He pulls the door open for me the rest of the way and says, \u201cI took an Uber here from work. We\u2019ll ride together.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>My mother is already seated at a table when we arrive. Her back is to the door as I lead the way.</p><p>I\u2019m instantly impressed by the restaurant. My eyes are drawn to the warm, neutral colors painted on the walls and the almost full-sized tree in the middle of the restaurant. It looks like it\u2019s growing straight out of the floor, almost as if the entire restaurant was designed around the tree. Ryle follows closely behind me with his hand on my lower back. Once we reach the table, I begin to pull off my jacket. \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She looks up from her phone and says, \u201cOh, hey, honey.\u201d She drops her phone in her purse and waves her hand around the restaurant. \u201cI already love it. Look at the lighting,\u201d she says, pointing up. \u201cThe fixtures look like something you\u2019d grow in one of your gardens.\u201d That\u2019s when she notices Ryle, who is standing patiently next to me as I slide into the booth. My mother smiles at him and says, \u201cWe\u2019ll take two waters for now, please.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart to Ryle and then back to my mother. \u201cMom. He\u2019s with me. He\u2019s not the waiter.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at Ryle again with confusion. He just smiles and reaches out his hand. \u201cHonest mistake, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m Ryle Kincaid.\u201d</p><p>She returns the handshake, looking back and forth between us. He releases her hand and slides into the booth. She looks a little flustered when she finally says, \u201cJenny Bloom. Nice to meet you.\u201d She places her attention back on me and raises an eyebrow. \u201cA friend of yours, Lily?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not better prepared for this moment. What in the heck do I introduce him as? My trial run? I can\u2019t say boyfriend, but I can\u2019t very well say friend. Prospect seems a little dated.</p><p>Ryle notices my pause, so he puts his hand on my knee and squeezes reassuringly. \u201cMy sister works for Lily,\u201d he says.\u201cHave you met her? Allysa?\u201d</p><p>My mother leans forward in her booth and says, \u201cOh! Yes! Of course. You two look so much alike now that you mention it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the eyes, I think. And the mouth.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cWe both favor our mother.\u201d</p><p>My mother smiles at me. \u201cPeople always say they think Lily favors me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIdentical mouths. Uncanny.\u201d Ryle squeezes my knee under the table again while I try and suppress my laughter. \u201cLadies, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to head to the gentlemen\u2019s room.\u201d He leans in and kisses me on the side of the head before standing. \u201cIf the waiter comes, I\u2019ll just take water.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes follow Ryle as he walks away, and then she slowly turns back to me. She points at me and then to his empty seat. \u201cHow come I haven\u2019t heard about this guy?\u201d</p><p>I smile a little. \u201cThings are kind of . . . it\u2019s not really . . .\u201d I have no idea how to explain our situation to my mother. \u201cHe works a lot, so we haven\u2019t really spent that much time together. At all. This is actually the first time we\u2019ve been to dinner together.\u201d</p> <p>My mother raises an eyebrow. \u201cReally?\u201d she says, leaning back in her seat. \u201cHe sure doesn\u2019t treat it like that. I mean\u2014he seems comfortably affectionate with you. Not normal behavior with someone you\u2019ve just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t just meet,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost a year since the first time I met him. And we\u2019ve spent time together, just not on a date. He works a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does he work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassachusetts General Hospital.\u201d</p><p>My mother leans forward and her eyes practically bulge from her head. \u201cLily!\u201d she hisses. \u201cHe\u2019s a doctor?\u201d</p><p>I nod, suppressing my grin. \u201cA neurosurgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you ladies something to drink?\u201d a waiter asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll take three . . .\u201d</p><p>And then I clamp my mouth shut.</p><p>I stare at the waiter and the waiter stares back at me. My heart is in my throat. I can\u2019t remember how to speak.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d my mother says. She flicks her hand toward the waiter. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for your drink order.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head and begin to stutter. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . um . . .\u201d \u201cThree waters,\u201d my mother says, interrupting my fumbled words. The waiter snaps out of his trance long enough to tap his pencil on his pad of paper.</p><p>\u201cThree waters,\u201d he says. \u201cGot it.\u201d He turns and walks away, but I watch as he glances back at me before pushing through the doors to the kitchen.</p><p>My mother leans forward and says, \u201cWhat in the world is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I point over my shoulder. \u201cThe waiter,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cHe looked exactly like . . .\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to say, \u201cAtlas Corrigan,\u201d when Ryle walks up and slides back into the seat.</p><p>He glances back and forth between us. \u201cWhat\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, shaking my head. Surely that wasn\u2019t really Atlas. But those eyes\u2014his mouth. I know it\u2019s been years since I saw him, but I\u2019ll never forget what he looked like. It had to be him. I know it was and I know he recognized me, too, because the second our eyes met . . . it looked like he\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d Ryle says, squeezing my hand. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod and force a smile, then clear my throat. \u201cYep. We were just talking about you,\u201d I say, glancing back at my mother. \u201cRyle assisted in an eighteen-hour surgery this week.\u201d</p> <p>My mother leans forward with interest. Ryle begins to tell her all about the surgery. Our water arrives, but it\u2019s a different waiter this time. He asks if we\u2019ve had a chance to go over the menu and then tells us the chef \u2019s specials. The three of us order our food and I\u2019m doing everything I can to focus, but my attention is all over the restaurant looking for Atlas. I need to regroup. After a few minutes, I lean over to Ryle. \u201cI need to run to the restroom.\u201d</p><p>He stands up to let me out and my eyes are scanning the face of every waiter as I make my way across the room. I push through the door to the hallway that leads to the restrooms. As soon as I\u2019m alone, my back meets the wall of the hallway. I lean forward and release a huge breath. I decide to take a moment and regain my composure before heading back out there. I bring my hands up to my forehead and close my eyes.</p><p>For nine years I\u2019ve wondered what happened to him. Years.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>I glance up and suck in a breath. He\u2019s standing at the end of the hallway like a ghost straight out of the past. My eyes travel to his feet to make sure he\u2019s not suspended in the air.</p><p>He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s real, and he\u2019s standing right in front of me.</p> <p>I stay pressed against the wall, not sure what to say to him. \u201cAtlas?\u201d</p><p>As soon as I say his name, he blows out a quick breath of relief and then takes three huge steps forward. I catch myself doing the same. We meet in the middle and throw our arms around each other. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he says, holding me in a tight embrace.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. Holy shit.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands on my shoulders and takes a step back to look at me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth with my hand, still in shock, and give him the once-over. His face looks the same, but he\u2019s no longer the scrawny teenager I remember. \u201cI can\u2019t say the same for you.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at himself and laughs. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cEight years in the military will do that to ya.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both in shock, so nothing is said right after that. We just keep shaking our heads in disbelief. He laughs and then I laugh. Finally, he releases my shoulders and folds his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat brings you to Boston?\u201d he asks.</p><p>He says it so casually, and I\u2019m thankful for that. Maybe he doesn\u2019t remember our conversation all those years ago about Boston, which would save me a lot of embarrassment.</p> <p>\u201cI live here,\u201d I say, forcing my answer to sound as casual as his question. \u201cI own a flower shop over on Park Plaza.\u201d</p><p>He smiles knowingly, like it doesn\u2019t at all surprise him. I glance toward the door, knowing I should get back out there. He notices and then takes another step back. He holds my gaze for a moment and it gets really quiet. Way too quiet. There\u2019s so much to say but neither of us even knows where to start. The smile leaves his eyes for a moment and then he motions toward the door. \u201cYou should probably get back to your company,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll look you up sometime. You said Park Plaza, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod. He nods.</p><p>The door swings open and a woman walks in holding a toddler. She moves between us, which puts even more distance between us. I take a step toward the door, but he remains in the same spot. Before I walk out, I turn back to him and smile. \u201cIt was really good to see you, Atlas.\u201d</p><p>He smiles a little, but it doesn\u2019t touch his eyes. \u201cYeah. You too, Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I\u2019m mostly quiet for the rest of the meal. I\u2019m not sure Ryle or my mother even notice, though, because she\u2019s having no issue firing question after question at him. He takes it like a champ. He\u2019s very charming with my mother in all the right ways.</p><p>Unexpectedly running into Atlas tonight put such a wrinkle in my emotions, but by the end of dinner, Ryle has smoothed them back out again.</p><p>My mother takes her napkin and wipes her mouth, then points at me. \u201cNew favorite restaurant,\u201d she says. \u201cIncredible.\u201d</p><p>Ryle nods. \u201cI agree. I need to bring Allysa here. She loves trying new restaurants.\u201d</p><p>The food really is good, but the last thing I need is for either of these two to want to come back here. \u201cIt was okay,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pays for our meals, of course, and then insists we walk my mother to her car.

He wraps his arms around me and kisses my neck first, and then my cheek. \u201cI would invite myself over, but I have an early surgery tomorrow and I\u2019m sure my patient would appreciate it if I didn\u2019t spend the majority of the night inside you.\u201d</p> <p>I kiss him back, both disappointed and relieved he\u2019s not coming over. \u201cI have a grand opening in a few days. I should probably sleep, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your next day off?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNever. When\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWe\u2019re doomed. There\u2019s just too much drive and success between the two of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means the honeymoon phase will last until we\u2019re eighty,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll come to your grand opening Friday and then the four of us will go out and celebrate.\u201d A car pulls up beside us and he wraps his hand in my hair and kisses me goodbye. \u201cYour mother is wonderful, by the way. Thank you for letting me come to dinner.\u201d</p><p>He backs away and climbs inside the car. I watch as it pulls out of the parking lot.</p><p>I have a really good feeling about that man.</p><p>I smile and turn toward my car, but throw a hand up to my chest and gasp when I see him.</p><p>Atlas is standing at the rear of my car.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Wasn\u2019t trying to scare you.\u201d</p> <p>I blow out a breath. \u201cWell, you did.\u201d I lean against the car and Atlas stays where he is, three feet away from me. He looks out at the street. \u201cSo? Who\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . .\u201d My voice falters. This is all so weird. My chest is still constricted and my stomach is flipping, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s leftover nerves from kissing Ryle or if it\u2019s the presence of Atlas. \u201cHis name is Ryle. We met about a year ago.\u201d</p><p>I instantly regret saying we met that long ago. It makes it sound like Ryle and I have been dating that long and we aren\u2019t even officially dating. \u201cWhat about you? Married? Have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m asking to extend the conversation he started, or if I\u2019m genuinely curious.</p><p>\u201cI do, actually. Her name is Cassie. We\u2019ve been together almost a year now.\u201d</p><p>Heartburn. I think I have heartburn. A year? I place my hand on my chest and nod. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You seem happy.\u201d</p><p>Does he seem happy? I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well . . . I\u2019m really glad I got to see you, Lily.\u201d He turns around to walk away, but then spins and faces me again, his hands shoved in his back pockets. \u201cI will say . . . I kind of wish this could have happened a year ago.\u201d</p> <p>I wince at his words, trying not to let them penetrate. He turns and walks back toward the restaurant.</p><p>I fumble with my keys and hit the button to unlock the car. I slide in and pull the door shut, gripping the steering wheel. For whatever reason, a huge tear falls down my cheek. A huge, pathetic, what-the-hell-is-this-wetness tear. I swipe at it and push the button to start my car.</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect to feel this much hurt after seeing him.</p><p>But it\u2019s good. This happened for a reason. My heart needed closure so I can give it to Ryle, but maybe I couldn\u2019t do that until this happened.</p><p>This is good.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m crying.</p><p>But it\u2019ll feel better. This is just human nature, healing an old wound to prepare for a fresh new layer.</p><p>That\u2019s all.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I curl up in my bed and stare at it.</p><p>I\u2019m almost finished with it. There aren\u2019t very many more entries.</p><p>I pick up the journal and place it on the pillow beside me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to read you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Although, if I read what\u2019s left, I\u2019ll be finished. Having seen Atlas tonight and knowing he has a girlfriend and a job and more than likely a home is enough closure I need on that chapter. And if I just finish the damn journal, I can put it back in the shoebox and never have to open it again.</p><p>I finally pick it up and roll onto my back. \u201cEllen DeGeneres, you are such a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>\u201cJust keep swimming.\u201d</p><p>Recognize that quote, Ellen? It\u2019s what Dory says to Marlin in Finding Nemo.</p><p>\u201cJust keep swimming, swimming, swimming.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not a huge fan of cartoons, but I\u2019ll give you props for that one. I like cartoons that can make you laugh, but also make you feel something. After today, I think that\u2019s my favorite cartoon. Because I\u2019ve been feeling like drowning lately, and sometimes people need a reminder that they just need to keep swimming.</p><p>Atlas got sick. Like really sick.</p><p>He\u2019s been crawling through my window and sleeping on the floor for a few nights in a row now, but last night, I knew something was wrong as soon as I looked at him. It was a Sunday, so I hadn\u2019t seen him since the night before, but he looked awful. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin was pale, and even though it was cold, his hair was sweaty. I didn\u2019t even ask if he was feeling okay, I already knew he wasn\u2019t. I put my hand on his forehead and he was so hot, I almost yelled for my mother.</p><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Lily,\u201d and then he started to make his pallet on the floor. I told him to wait there and then I went to the kitchen and poured him a glass of water. I found some medicine in the cabinet. It was flu medicine and I wasn\u2019t even sure if that\u2019s what was wrong with him, but I made him take some anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laid there on the floor, curled up into a ball, when, about half an hour later he said, \u201cLily? I think I\u2019m gonna need a trash can.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and grabbed the trash can from under my desk and knelt down in front of him. As soon as I set it down, he hunched over it and started throwing up.</p><p>God, I felt bad for him. Being so sick and not having a bathroom or a bed or a house or a mother. All he had was me and I didn\u2019t even know what to do for him.</p><p>When he was finished, I made him drink some water and then I told him to get on the bed. He refused, but I wasn\u2019t having it. I put the trash can on the floor next to the bed and made him move to the bed.</p> <p>He was so hot and shaking so bad I was just scared to leave him on the floor. I laid down next to him and every hour for the next six hours he continued getting sick. I kept having to take the trash can to the bathroom to empty it out. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it was gross. The grossest night I\u2019ve ever had, but what else could I do? He needed me to help him and I was all he had.</p><p>When it came time for him to leave my room this morning, I told him to go back to his house and I\u2019d be over to check on him before school. I\u2019m surprised he even had the energy to crawl out of my window. I left the trash can next to my bed and waited for my mom to come wake me up. When she did, she saw the trash can and immediately held her hand to my forehead. \u201cLily, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I groaned and shook my head. \u201cNo. I was up all night sick. I think it\u2019s over now, but I haven\u2019t slept.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the trash can and told me to stay in bed, that she\u2019d call the school and let them know I wasn\u2019t coming. After she left for work, I went and got Atlas and told him he could stay with me at the house all day. He was still getting sick, so I let him use my room to sleep. I\u2019d check on him every half hour or so and finally around lunch he stopped throwing up. He went and took a shower and then I made him some soup.</p><p>He was too tired to even eat it. I got a blanket and we both sat down on the couch and covered up together. I don\u2019t know when I started feeling comfortable enough to snuggle up to him, but it just felt right. A few minutes later, he leaned over a little and pressed his lips against my collarbone, right between my shoulder and my neck. It was a quick kiss and I don\u2019t think he meant for it to be romantic. It was more like a thank-you gesture, without using actual words. But it made me feel all kinds of things. It\u2019s been a few hours now and I keep touching that spot with my fingers because I can still feel it.</p> <p>I know it was probably the worst day of his life, Ellen. But it was one of my favorites.</p><p>I feel really bad about that.</p><p>We watched Finding Nemo and when that part came up where Marlin was looking for Nemo and he was feeling really defeated, Dory said to him, \u201cWhen life gets you down do you wanna know what you\u2019ve gotta do? . . . Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.\u201d</p><p>Atlas grabbed my hand when Dory said that. He didn\u2019t hold it like a boyfriend holds his girlfriend\u2019s hand. He squeezed it, like he was saying that was us. He was Marlin and I was Dory, and I was helping him swim.</p><p>\u201cJust keep swimming,\u201d I whispered to him.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p> <p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I\u2019m scared. So scared.</p><p>I like him a lot. He\u2019s all I think about when we\u2019re together and I feel worried sick about him when we\u2019re not. My life is beginning to revolve around him and that\u2019s not good, I know. But I can\u2019t help it and I don\u2019t know what to do about it, and now he might leave.</p><p>He left after we finished watching Finding Nemo yesterday and then when my parents went to bed, he crawled in my window last night. He had slept in my bed the night before because he was sick, and I know I shouldn\u2019t have done it, but I put his blankets in the washing machine right before I went to bed. He asked where his pallet was and I told him he\u2019d have to sleep on the bed again because I wanted to wash his blankets and make sure they were clean so he wouldn\u2019t get sick again.</p><p>For a minute, it looked like he was going to go back out the window. But then he shut it and took off his shoes and crawled in the bed with me.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sick anymore, but when he laid down I thought maybe I had gotten sick because my stomach felt queasy. But I wasn\u2019t sick. I just always feel queasy when he\u2019s that close to me.</p><p>We were facing each other on the bed when he said, \u201cWhen do you turn sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo more months,\u201d I whispered. We just kept staring at each other, and my heart was beating faster and faster. \u201cWhen do you turn nineteen?\u201d I asked, just trying to make conversation so he couldn\u2019t hear how hard I was breathing.</p> <p>\u201cNot until October,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded. I wondered why he was curious about my age and it made me wonder what he thought about fifteen-year-olds. Did he look at me like I was just a little kid? Like a little sister? I was almost sixteen, and two and a half years apart in age isn\u2019t that bad. Maybe when two people are fifteen and eighteen, it might seem a little too far apart. But once I turn sixteen, I bet no one would even think twice about a two-and-a-half-year age difference.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d he said.</p><p>I held my breath, not knowing what he was going to say.</p><p>\u201cI got in touch with my uncle today. My mom and I used to live with him in Boston. He told me once he gets back from his work trip I can stay with him.\u201d</p><p>I should have been so happy for him in that moment. I should have smiled and told him congratulations. But I felt all of the immaturity of my age when I closed my eyes and felt sorry for myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wanted to talk to you about it first.\u201d</p><p>He was so close to me on the bed, I could feel the warmth of his breath. I also noticed he smelled like mint, and it made me wonder if he uses bottled water to brush his teeth before he comes over here. I always send him home every day with lots of water.</p><p>I brought my hand up to the pillow and started pulling at a feather sticking out of it. When I got it all the way out, I twisted it between my fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Atlas. I\u2019m happy you have a place to stay. But what about school?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could finish down there,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded. It sounded like he already made up his mind. \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>I wondered how far away Boston is. It\u2019s probably a few hours, but that\u2019s a whole world away when you don\u2019t own a car.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure that I am.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the feather back onto the pillow and brought my hand to my side. \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you? Your uncle is offering you a place to stay. That\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p> <p>He tightened his lips together and nodded. Then he picked up the feather I\u2019d been playing with and he started twisting it between his fingers. He laid it back down on the pillow and then he did something I wasn\u2019t expecting. He moved his fingers to my lips and he touched them.</p><p>God, Ellen. I thought I was gonna die right then and there. It was the most I\u2019d ever felt inside my body at one time. He kept his fingers there for a few seconds, and he said, \u201cThank you, Lily. For everything.\u201d He moved his fingers up and through my hair, and then he leaned forward and planted a kiss on my forehead. I was breathing so hard, I had to open my mouth to catch more air. I could see his chest moving just as hard as mine was. He looked down at me and I watched as his eyes went right to my mouth. \u201cHave you ever been kissed, Lily?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head no and tilted my face up to his because I needed him to change that right then and there or I wasn\u2019t gonna be able to breathe.</p><p>Then\u2014almost as if I were made of eggshells\u2014he lowered his mouth to mine and just rested it there. I didn\u2019t know what to do next, but I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care if we just stayed like that all night and never even moved our mouths, it was everything.</p><p>His lips closed over mine and I could kind of feel his hand shaking. I did what he was doing and started to move my lips like he was. I felt the tip of his tongue brush across my lips once and I thought my eyes were about to roll back in my head. He did it again, and then a third time, so I finally did it, too. When our tongues touched for the first time, I kind of smiled a little, because I\u2019d thought about my first kiss a lot. Where it would be, who it would be with. Never in a million years did I imagine it would feel like this.</p><p>He pushed me on my back and pressed his hand against my cheek and kept kissing me. It just got better and better as I grew more comfortable. My favorite moment was when he pulled back for a second and looked down at me, then came back even harder.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how long we kissed. A long time. So long, my mouth started to hurt and my eyes couldn\u2019t stay open. When we fell asleep, I\u2019m pretty sure his mouth was still touching mine.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk about Boston again.</p><p>I still don\u2019t know if he\u2019s leaving.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I need to apologize to you.</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since I\u2019ve written to you and a week since I\u2019ve watched your show. Don\u2019t worry, I still record it so you\u2019ll get the ratings, but every day we get off the bus, Atlas takes a quick shower and then we make out.</p> <p>Every day.</p><p>It\u2019s awesome.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is about him, but I feel so comfortable with him. He\u2019s so sweet and thoughtful. He never does anything I don\u2019t feel comfortable with, but so far he hasn\u2019t tried anything I don\u2019t feel comfortable with.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how much I should divulge here, since you and I have never met in person. But let me just say that if he\u2019s ever wondered what my boobs feel like . . .</p><p>Now he knows.</p><p>I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out how people function from day to day when they like someone this much. If it were up to me, we would kiss all day and all night and do nothing in between except maybe talk a little. He tells funny stories. I love it when he\u2019s in a talkative mood because it doesn\u2019t happen very often, but he uses his hands a lot. He smiles a lot, too, and I love his smile even more than I love his kiss. And sometimes I just tell him to shut up and stop smiling or kissing or talking so I can stare at him. I like looking at his eyes. They\u2019re so blue that he could be standing across a room and a person could tell how blue his eyes were. The only thing I don\u2019t like about kissing him sometimes is when he closes his eyes.</p><p>And no. We still haven\u2019t talked about Boston.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Yesterday afternoon when we were riding the bus, Atlas kissed me. It wasn\u2019t anything new to us because we had kissed a lot by this point, but it\u2019s the first time he ever did it in public. When we\u2019re together everything else just seems to fade away, so I don\u2019t think he even thought about other people noticing. But Katie noticed. She was sitting in the seat behind us and I heard her say, \u201cGross,\u201d as soon as he leaned over and kissed me.</p><p>She was talking to the girl next to her when she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Lily lets him touch her. He wears the same clothes almost every day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellen, I was so mad. I also felt awful for Atlas. He pulled away from me and I could tell what she said bothered him. I started to turn around to yell at her for judging someone she doesn\u2019t even know, but he grabbed my hand and shook his head no.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Lily,\u201d he said.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t.</p><p>But for the rest of the bus ride, I was so angry. I was angry that Katie would say something so ignorant just to hurt someone she thought was beneath her. I was also hurt that Atlas appeared to be used to comments like that.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want him to think I was embarrassed that anyone saw him kiss me. I know Atlas better than any of them do, and I know what a good person he is, no matter what his clothes look like or that he used to smell before he started using my shower.</p><p>I leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and then rested my head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I said to him.</p><p>He slid his fingers through mine and squeezed my hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite person.\u201d</p> <p>I felt him laugh a little and it made me smile.</p><p>\u201cOut of how many people?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite person, too, Lily. By a long shot.\u201d</p><p>When the bus came to a stop on my street, he didn\u2019t let go of my hand when we started to walk off. He was in front of me in the aisle and I was walking behind him, so he didn\u2019t see it when I turned around and flipped off Katie.</p><p>I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, but the look on her face made it worth it.</p> <p>When we got to my house, he took the house key out of my hand and unlocked my front door. It was weird, seeing how comfortable he is at my house now. He walked in and locked the door behind us. That\u2019s when we noticed the electricity in the house wasn\u2019t working. I looked out the window and saw a utility truck down the street working on the power lines, so that meant we couldn\u2019t watch your show. I wasn\u2019t too upset because it meant we would probably just make out for an hour and a half.</p><p>\u201cDoes your oven run off gas or electricity?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGas,\u201d I said, a little confused that he was asking about our oven.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes (which were really just a pair of my father\u2019s old shoes) and he started walking toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to cook?\u201d</p><p>He opened the refrigerator and started moving things around. \u201cYep. I probably love to cook as much as you love to grow things.\u201d He took a few things out of the refrigerator and preheated the oven. I leaned against the counter and watched him. He wasn\u2019t even looking at a recipe. He was just pouring things into bowls and mixing them without even using a measuring cup.</p><p>I had never seen my father lift a finger in the kitchen. I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t even know how to preheat our oven. I kind of thought most men were like that, but watching Atlas work his way around my kitchen proved me wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d I asked him. I pushed my hands on the island and hoisted myself onto it.</p> <p>\u201cCookies,\u201d he said. He walked the bowl over to me and stuck a spoon in the mixture. He brought the spoon up to my mouth and I tasted it. One of my weaknesses is cookie dough, and this was the best I\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d I said, licking my lips.</p><p>He set the bowl down beside me and then leaned in and kissed me. Cookie dough and Atlas\u2019s mouth mixed together is like heaven, in case you\u2019re wondering. I made a noise deep in my throat that let him know how much I liked the combination, and it made him laugh. But he didn\u2019t stop kissing me. He just laughed through the kiss and it completely melted my heart. A happy Atlas was near mind-blowing. It made me want to uncover every single thing about this world that he likes and give it all to him.</p><p>When he was kissing me, I wondered if I loved him. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend before and have nothing to compare my feelings to. In fact, I\u2019ve never really wanted a boyfriend or a relationship until Atlas. I\u2019m not growing up in a household with a great example of how a man should treat someone he loves, so I\u2019ve always held on to an unhealthy amount of distrust when it comes to relationships and other people.</p><p>There have been times I\u2019ve wondered if I could ever allow myself to trust a guy. For the most part, I hate men because the only example I have is my father. But spending all this time with Atlas is changing me. Not in a huge way, I don\u2019t think. I still distrust most people. But Atlas is changing me enough to believe that maybe he\u2019s an exception to the norm.</p><p>He stopped kissing me and picked up the bowl again. He walked it over to the opposite counter and started spooning dough onto two cookie sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know a trick to cooking with a gas oven?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I really ever cared about cooking before, but he somehow made me want to know everything he knew. It might have been how happy he looked when he talked about it.</p><p>\u201cGas ovens have hot spots,\u201d he said as he opened the oven door and put the cookie sheets inside. \u201cYou have to be sure and rotate the pans so they\u2019ll cook evenly.\u201d He closed the door and pulled the oven mitt off his hand. He tossed it on the counter. \u201cA pizza stone helps, too. If you just keep it in the oven, even when you aren\u2019t baking pizza, it helps eliminate the hot spots.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me and placed his hands on either side of me. The electricity kicked on right as he was pulling down the collar of my shirt. He kissed the spot on my shoulder he always loves kissing and slowly slid his hands up my back. I swear, sometimes when he\u2019s not even here I can still feel his lips on my collarbone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was about to kiss me on the mouth when we heard a car pull into the driveway and the garage door start to open. I jumped off the island, looking around the kitchen frantically. His hands went up to my cheeks and he made me look at him.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on the cookies. They\u2019ll be finished in about twenty minutes.\u201d He pressed his lips to mine and then released me, rushing to the living room to grab his backpack. He made it out the back door right when I heard the engine to my father\u2019s car shut off.</p><p>I started gathering all the ingredients together when my father walked into the kitchen from the garage. He looked around and then saw the light on in the oven.</p><p>\u201cAre you cooking?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I nodded because my heart was beating so fast, I was scared he\u2019d hear the trembling in my voice if I responded out loud. I scrubbed for a moment at a spot on the counter that was perfectly clean. I cleared my throat and said, \u201cCookies. I\u2019m baking cookies.\u201d</p><p>He set his briefcase down on the kitchen table and then walked to the refrigerator and pulled out a beer.</p><p>\u201cThe electricity has been out,\u201d I said. \u201cI was bored so I decided to bake while I waited for it to come back on.\u201d</p><p>My father sat down at the table and spent the next ten minutes asking me questions about school and if I\u2019d thought about going to college. Occasionally when it was just the two of us, I saw glimpses of a how a normal relationship with a father could be. Sitting at the kitchen table with him discussing colleges and career choices and high school. As much as I hated him most of the time, I still longed for more of these moments with him. If he could just always be the guy he was capable of being in these moments, things would be so much different. For all of us.</p><p>I rotated the cookies like Atlas had said to do and when they were finished, I pulled them out of the oven. I took one off the cookie sheet and handed it to my father. I hated that I was being nice to him. It almost felt like I was wasting one of Atlas\u2019s cookies.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d my father said. \u201cThese are great, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I forced a thank-you, even though I didn\u2019t make them. I couldn\u2019t very well tell him that, though.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for school so you can only have one,\u201d I lied. I waited until the rest of them cooled and then I put them in a Tupperware container and took them to my room. I didn\u2019t even want to try one without Atlas, so I waited until later last night when he came over.</p><p>\u201cYou should have tried one when they were hot,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat them without you,\u201d I said. We sat on the bed with our backs against the wall and proceeded to eat half the bowl of cookies. I told him they were delicious, but failed to tell him they were by far the greatest cookies I\u2019d ever eaten. I didn\u2019t want to inflate his ego. I kind of liked how humble he was.</p><p>I tried to grab at another one, but he pulled the bowl away and put the lid back on it. \u201cIf you eat too many you\u2019ll make yourself sick and you won\u2019t like my cookies anymore.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>He took a drink of water and then stood up, facing the bed. \u201cI made you something,\u201d he said, reaching into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cMore cookies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head, then held out a fist. I lifted my hand and he dropped something hard in the palm of my hand. It was a small, flat outline of a heart, about two inches long, carved out of wood.</p><p>I rubbed my thumb over it, trying not to smile too big. It wasn\u2019t an anatomically correct heart, but it also didn\u2019t look like the hand-drawn hearts. It was uneven and hollow in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYou made this?\u201d I asked, looking up at him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI carved it with an old whittling knife I found at the house.\u201d</p><p>The ends of the heart weren\u2019t connected. They just curved in a little, leaving a little space at the top of the heart. I didn\u2019t even know what to say. I felt him sit back down on the bed but I couldn\u2019t stop looking at it long enough to even thank him.</p> <p>\u201cI carved it out of a branch,\u201d he said, whispering. \u201cFrom the oak tree in your backyard.\u201d</p><p>I swear, Ellen. I never thought I could love something so much. Or maybe what I was feeling wasn\u2019t for the gift, but for him. I closed my fist around the heart and then leaned over and kissed him so hard, he fell back onto the bed. I threw my leg over him and straddled him and he grabbed my waist and grinned against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna carve you a damn house out of that oak tree if this is the reward I get,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou have to stop being so perfect,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re already my favorite person but now you\u2019re making it really unfair to all the other humans because no one will ever be able to catch up to you.\u201d</p><p>He brought his hand to the back of my head and rolled me until I was on my back and he was the one on top. \u201cThen my plan is working,\u201d he said, right before kissing me again.</p><p>I held on to the heart while we kissed, wanting to believe it was a gift for no reason at all. But part of me was scared it was a gift to remember him by when he leaves for Boston.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to remember him. If I had to remember him, it would mean he wasn\u2019t a part of my life anymore.</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to move to Boston, Ellen. I know that\u2019s selfish of me because he can\u2019t keep living in that house. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m more afraid might happen. Watching him leave or selfishly begging him not to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know we need to talk about it. I\u2019ll ask him about Boston tonight when he comes over. I just didn\u2019t want to ask him last night because it was a really perfect day.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming.</p> <p>He\u2019s moving to Boston.</p><p>I don\u2019t really feel like talking about it.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>This is going to be a big one for my mother to hide.</p> <p>My father is usually pretty cognizant of hitting her where it won\u2019t leave a visible bruise. The last thing he probably wants is for people in the town to know what he does to her. I\u2019ve seen him kick her a few times, choke her, hit her on the back and the stomach, pull her hair. The few times he\u2019s hit her on the face, it\u2019s always just been a slap, so the marks wouldn\u2019t stay for long.</p><p>But never have I seen him do what he did last night.</p><p>It was really late when they got home. It was a weekend, so he and my mom went to some community function. My father has a real estate company and he\u2019s also the town mayor, so they have to do things in the public a lot like go to charity dinners. Which is ironic, since my father hates charities. But I guess he has to save face.</p><p>Atlas was already in my room when they got home. I could hear them fighting as soon as they walked through the front door. A lot of the conversation was muffled, but for the most part, it sounded like my father was accusing her of flirting with some man.</p><p>Now I know my mother, Ellen. She would never do something like that. If anything, a guy probably looked at her and it made my father jealous. My mother is really beautiful.</p><p>I heard him call her a whore and then I heard the first blow. I started to climb out of my bed but Atlas pulled me back and told me not to go in there, that I might get hurt. I told him it actually helps sometimes. That when I go in there, my father backs off.</p> <p>Atlas tried to talk me out of it, but finally I got up and went out into the living room.</p><p>Ellen.</p><p>I just . . .</p><p>He was on top of her.</p><p>They were on the couch and he had his hand around her throat, but his other hand was pulling up her dress. She was trying to fight him off and I just stood there, frozen. She kept begging him to get off her and then he hit her right across the face and told her to shut up. I\u2019ll never forget his words when he said, \u201cYou want attention? I\u2019ll give you some fucking attention.\u201d And that\u2019s when she got real still and stopped fighting him. I heard her crying, and then she said, \u201cPlease be quiet. Lily is here.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cPlease be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Please be quiet while you rape me, dear.</p><p>Ellen, I didn\u2019t know one human was capable of feeling so much hate inside one heart. And I\u2019m not even talking about my father. I\u2019m talking about me.</p> <p>I walked straight to the kitchen and I opened a drawer. I grabbed the biggest knife I could find and . . . I don\u2019t know how to explain it. It was like I wasn\u2019t even in my own body. I could see myself walking across the kitchen with the knife in my hand, and I knew I wasn\u2019t going to use it. I just wanted something bigger than myself that could scare him away from her. But right before I made it out of the kitchen, two arms went around my waist and picked me up from behind. I dropped the knife, and my father didn\u2019t hear it but my mother did. We locked eyes as Atlas carried me back to my bedroom. When we were back inside my room, I just started hitting him in the chest, trying to get back out there to her. I was crying and doing everything I could to get him out of my way, but he wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>He just wrapped his arms around me and said, \u201cLily, calm down.\u201d He kept saying it over and over, and he held me there for a long time until I accepted that he wasn\u2019t gonna let me go back out there. He wasn\u2019t gonna let me have that knife.</p><p>He walked over to the bed and grabbed his jacket and started putting on his shoes. \u201cWe\u2019ll go next door,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>The police.</p><p>My mother had warned me not to call the police in the past. She said it could jeopardize my father\u2019s career. But in all honesty, I didn\u2019t care at that point. I didn\u2019t care that he was the mayor or that everyone who loved him didn\u2019t know the awful side of him. The only thing I cared about was helping my mother, so I pulled on my jacket and went to the closet for a pair of shoes. When I stepped out of my closet, Atlas was staring at my bedroom door.</p><p>It was opening.</p><p>My mother stepped inside and quickly shut it, locking it behind her. I\u2019ll never forget what she looked like. She had blood coming down from her lip. Her eye was already starting to swell, and she had a clump of hair just resting on her shoulder. She looked at Atlas and then me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even take a moment to feel scared that she caught me in my room with a boy. I didn\u2019t care about that. I was just worried about her. I walked over to her and grabbed her hands and walked her to my bed. I brushed the hair off her shoulder and then from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna go call the police, Mom. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew real wide and she started shaking her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. She looked over at Atlas and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t. No.\u201d</p><p>He was already at the window about to leave, so he stopped and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s drunk, Lily,\u201d she said. \u201cHe heard your door shut, so he went to our bedroom. He stopped. If you call the police, it\u2019ll just make it worse, believe me. Just let him sleep it off, it\u2019ll be better tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and could feel the tears stinging my eyes. \u201cMom, he was trying to rape you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ducked her head and winced when I said that. She shook her head again and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Lily. We\u2019re married, and sometimes marriage is just . . . you\u2019re too young to understand it.\u201d</p><p>It got really quiet for a minute, and then I said. \u201cI hope to hell I never do.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when she started to cry. She just held her head in her hands and she started to sob and all I could do was wrap my arms around her and cry with her. I\u2019d never seen her this upset. Or this hurt. Or this scared. It broke my heart, Ellen.</p><p>It broke me.</p> <p>When she was finished crying, I looked around the room and Atlas had left. We went to the kitchen and I helped her clean up her lip and her eye. She never did say anything about him being there. Not one thing. I waited for her to tell me I was grounded, but she never did. I realized that maybe she didn\u2019t acknowledge it because that\u2019s what she does. Things that hurt her just get swept under the rug, never to be brought up again.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>I think I\u2019m ready to talk about Boston now.</p><p>He left today.</p> <p>I\u2019ve shuffled my deck of cards so many times, my hands hurt. I\u2019m scared if I don\u2019t get out how I feel on paper, I\u2019ll go crazy holding it all in.</p><p>Our last night didn\u2019t go over so well. We kissed a lot at first, but we were both too sad to really care about it. For the second time in two days, he told me he changed his mind and that he wasn\u2019t leaving. He didn\u2019t want to leave me alone in this house. But I\u2019ve lived with these parents for almost sixteen years. It was silly of him to turn down a home in favor of being homeless, just because of me. We both knew that, but it still hurt.</p><p>I tried to not be so sad about it, so when we were lying there, I asked him to tell me about Boston. I told him maybe one day when I got out of school, I could go there.</p><p>He got this look in his eye when he started talking about it. A look I\u2019d never seen. Sort of like he was talking about heaven. He told me about how everyone has the greatest accents there. Instead of car, they say cah. He must not realize that he sometimes says his r\u2019s like that, too. He said he lived there from the ages of nine until he was fourteen, so I guess maybe he picked up a little bit of the accent.</p><p>He told me about how his uncle lives in an apartment building with the coolest rooftop deck.</p><p>\u201cA lot of apartments have them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome even have pools.\u201d</p> <p>Plethora, Maine, probably didn\u2019t even have a building that was tall enough for a rooftop deck. I wondered what it would feel like to be that high up. I asked him if he ever went up there and he said yes. That when he was younger, sometimes he would go to the roof and just sit up there and think while he looked out over the city.</p><p>He told me about the food. I already knew he liked to cook but I had no idea how much passion he had for it. I guess because he doesn\u2019t have a stove or a kitchen, so other than the cookies he baked me, he\u2019s never really talked about cooking before.</p><p>He told me about the harbor and how, before his mother remarried, she used to take him fishing out there. \u201cI mean, Boston isn\u2019t any different from any other big city, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot that makes it stand out. It\u2019s just . . . I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a vibe. A really good energy. When people say they live in Boston, they\u2019re proud of it. I miss that sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers through his hair and said, \u201cWell, you make it sound like the best place in the world. Like everything is better in Boston.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and his eyes were sad when he said. \u201cEverything is almost better in Boston. Except the girls. Boston doesn\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>That made me blush. He kissed me real sweet and then I said to him, \u201cBoston doesn\u2019t have me yet. Someday I\u2019ll move there and I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>He made me promise. Said if I moved to Boston, everything really would be better there and it would be the best city in the world.</p><p>We kissed some more. And did other things that I won\u2019t bore you with. Although, that\u2019s not to say they were boring.</p> <p>They were not.</p><p>But then this morning I had to tell him goodbye. And he held me and kissed me so much, I thought I might die if he let go.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t die. Because he let go and here I am. Still living. Still breathing.</p><p>Just barely.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>I flip to the next page, but then slam the book shut. There\u2019s only one more entry and I don\u2019t know that I really feel like reading it right now. Or ever. I put the journal back in my closet, knowing that my chapter with Atlas is over. He\u2019s happy now.</p><p>I\u2019m happy now.</p><p>Time can definitely heal all wounds.</p><p>Or at least most of them.</p><p>I turn off my lamp and then pick up my phone to plug it in. I have two missed text messages from Ryle and one from my mother.</p><p>Ryle: Hey. Naked Truth commencing in 3 . . . 2 . . .</p><p>Ryle: I was worried that being in a relationship would add to my responsibilities. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve avoided them my whole life. I already have enough on my plate, and seeing the stress my parents\u2019 marriage seemed to cause them, and the failed marriages of some of my friends, I wanted no part in something like that. But after tonight, I realized that maybe a lot of people are just doing it wrong. Because what\u2019s happening between us doesn\u2019t feel like a responsibility. It feels like a reward. And I\u2019ll fall asleep wondering what I did to deserve it.</p><p>I pull my phone to my chest and smile. Then I screen-shot the text because I\u2019m keeping it forever. I open up the third text message. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom: A doctor, Lily?

At least . . . I hope she\u2019s looking at it with admiration. It turned out better than I thought it would. I used florist dip dye to turn some white roses a deep purple. Then I decorated the stems with different steampunk elements, like tiny metal washers and gears, and even super-glued a small clock to the brown leather strap that\u2019s holding the bouquet together.</p><p>\u201cSteampunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trend. Kind of a subgenre of fiction, but it\u2019s catching on in other areas. Art. Music.\u201d I turn around and smile, holding up the bouquet. \u201cAnd now . . . flowers.\u201d</p><p>Allysa takes the flowers from me and holds them up in front of her. \u201cThey\u2019re so . . . weird. I love them so much.\u201d She hugs them. \u201cCan I have them?\u201d</p> <p>I pull them away from her. \u201cNo, they\u2019re our grand opening display. Not for sale.\u201d I take the flowers from her and grab the vase I made yesterday. I found a pair of old button-up women\u2019s boots at a flea market last week. They reminded me of the steampunk style, and the boots are actually where I got the idea for the flowers. I washed the boots last week, dried them, and then super-glued pieces of metal to them. Once I brushed them with Mod Podge, I was able to line the inside with a vase to hold water for the flowers.</p><p>\u201cAllysa?\u201d I place the flowers on the center display table. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this is exactly what I was supposed to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteampunk?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh and spin around. \u201cCreate!\u201d I say. And then I flip the sign to open, fifteen minutes early.</p><p>We both spend the day busier than we thought we\u2019d be. Between phone orders, Internet orders, and walk-ins, neither of us even has time to take a lunch break.</p><p>\u201cYou need more employees,\u201d Allysa says as she passes me, holding two bouquets of flowers. That is at one o\u2019clock.</p> <p>\u201cYou need more employees,\u201d she says to me at two o\u2019clock, holding the phone to her ear and writing down an order while ringing someone up at the register.</p><p>Marshall stops by after three o\u2019clock and asks how it\u2019s going. Allysa says, \u201cShe needs more employees.\u201d</p><p>I help a woman take a bouquet to her car at four o\u2019clock, and as I\u2019m walking back inside, Allysa is walking out, holding another bouquet. \u201cYou need more employees,\u201d she says, exasperated.</p><p>At six o\u2019clock, she locks the door and flips the sign. She falls against the door and slides to the floor, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI need more employees.\u201d</p><p>She just nods.</p><p>And then we laugh. I walk over to where she\u2019s seated and I sit next to her. We lean our heads together and look at the store. The steampunk flowers are front and center, and although I refused to sell this particular bouquet, we had eight preorders for more of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Lily,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I smile. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you, Issa.\u201d</p><p>We sit there for several minutes, enjoying the rest we\u2019re finally giving our feet. This was honestly one of the best days I\u2019ve ever had, but I can\u2019t help but feel a nagging sadness that Ryle never stopped by. He also never texted.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from your brother today?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just busy.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I know he\u2019s busy.</p><p>We both look up when someone knocks on the door. I smile when I see him cupping his hands around his eyes with his face pressed to the window. He finally looks down and sees us sitting on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>I jump up and unlock the door to let him in. As soon as I open it, he\u2019s pushing his way inside. \u201cI missed it? I did. I missed it.\u201d He hugs me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I tried to get here as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>I hug him back and say, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019re here. It was perfect.\u201d I\u2019m giddy with excitement that he made it at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he says, kissing me.</p><p>Allysa brushes past us. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d she mimics. \u201cHey Ryle, guess what?\u201d</p><p>Ryle releases me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Allysa grabs the trash can and drops it on the counter. \u201cLily needs to hire more employees.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her constant repetition. Ryle squeezes my hand and says, \u201cSounds like business was good.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t complain. I mean . . . I\u2019m no brain surgeon, but I\u2019m pretty good at what I do.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs. \u201cYou guys need any help cleaning up?\u201d</p><p>Allysa and I put him to work, helping us clean up after the big day. We get everything finished and prepped for tomorrow, and then Marshall arrives just as we\u2019re finishing up. He\u2019s carrying a bag when he walks inside and drops it on the counter. He begins to pull out huge lumps of some kind of material and tosses them at each of us. I catch mine and unfold it.</p><p>It\u2019s a onesie.</p><p>With kittens all over it.</p><p>\u201cBruins game. Free beer. Suit up, team!\u201d</p><p>Allysa groans and says, \u201cMarshall, you made six million dollars this year. Do we really need free beer?\u201d</p><p>He shoves a finger against her lips, pushing them in opposite directions. \u201cShh! Don\u2019t speak like a rich girl, Issa. Blasphemy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs and Marshall grabs the onesie out of her hand. He unzips it and helps her into it. Once we\u2019re all suited up, we lock the door and head to the bar.</p><p>I\u2019ve never in my life seen so many men in onesies. Allysa and I are the only women wearing them, but I kind of like that. It\u2019s loud. So loud, and each time the Bruins make a good play, Allysa and I have to cover our ears from the screams. After about half an hour, a booth on the top floor opens up and we all run upstairs to claim it.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Allysa says as we slide in. It\u2019s much quieter up here, although still loud compared to normal standards.</p><p>A waitress comes over to take our drink order. I order red wine, and as soon as I do, Marshall practically jumps out of his seat. \u201cWine?\u201d he yells. \u201cYou\u2019re in a onesie! You don\u2019t get free wine with a onesie!\u201d</p> <p>He tells the waitress to bring me a beer, instead. Ryle tells her to bring me wine. Allysa wants water, and this upsets Marshall even more. He tells the waitress to bring four bottles of beer and then Ryle says, \u201cTwo beers, red wine, and a water.\u201d The waitress is very confused by the time she leaves our table.</p><p>Marshall throws his arm around Allysa and kisses her. \u201cHow am I supposed to try and knock you up tonight if you aren\u2019t a little wasted?\u201d</p><p>The look on Allysa\u2019s face changes, and I feel instantly bad for her. I know Marshall only said that in fun, but it has to bother her. She was just telling me a few days ago how depressed she is that she can\u2019t get pregnant.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have beer, Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drink wine, at least. You like me more when you\u2019re tipsy.\u201d He laughs at himself, but Allysa doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t have wine, either. I can\u2019t have any alcohol, actually.\u201d</p><p>Marshall stops laughing.</p><p>My heart does a flip-flop.</p><p>Marshall turns in the booth and grabs her shoulders, making her face him straight-on. \u201cAllysa?\u201d</p><p>She just starts nodding and I don\u2019t know who starts crying first. Me or Marshall or Allysa. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a dad?\u201d he yells.</p><p>She\u2019s still nodding, and I\u2019m just bawling like an idiot. Marshall jumps up in the booth and yells, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a dad!\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t even explain what this moment is like. A grown man in a onesie, standing up in a booth at a bar, yelling to whoever will listen that he\u2019s gonna be a dad. He pulls her up and they\u2019re both standing in the booth now. He kisses her and it\u2019s the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Until I look at Ryle and catch him chewing on his bottom lip like he\u2019s trying to blink back a potential tear. He glances at me and sees me staring, so he looks away. \u201cShut up,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>I smile and lean over and kiss him on the cheek. \u201cCongratulations, Uncle Ryle.\u201d</p><p>Once the parents-to-be stop making out in the booth, Ryle and I both stand up and congratulate them. Allysa said she\u2019s been feeling sick for a while, but just took a test this morning before our grand opening. She was going to wait and tell Marshall tonight when they got home, but she couldn\u2019t hold it in for another second.</p><p>Our drinks come and we order food. Once the waitress walks away, I look at Marshall. \u201cHow did you two meet?\u201d</p><p>He says, \u201cAllysa tells the story better than I do.\u201d</p><p>Allysa perks up and leans forward. \u201cI hated him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was Ryle\u2019s best friend and he was always at the house. I thought he was so annoying. He had just moved to Ohio from Boston and he had that Boston accent. He thought it made him so cool but I just wanted to slap him every time he spoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Marshall says, sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cYou were an idiot,\u201d Allysa replies, rolling her eyes. \u201cAnyway, one day Ryle and I had a few friends over. Nothing big, but our parents were out of town, so of course we had a little get-together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were thirty people there,\u201d Ryle says. \u201cIt was a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, a party,\u201d Allysa says. \u201cI walked into the kitchen and Marshall was standing there pressed up against some floozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a floozy,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was a nice girl. Tasted like Cheetos, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Allysa glares at him so he shuts up. She turns back to me. \u201cI lost it,\u201d she says. \u201cI started yelling at him to take his whores to his own house. The girl was literally so terrified of me, she ran for the door and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCock blocker,\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>Allysa punches him in the shoulder. \u201cAnyway. After I cock blocked him, I ran to my room, embarrassed that I did that. It was out of pure jealousy, and I didn\u2019t even realize I liked him that way until I saw his hands on some other girl\u2019s ass. I threw myself on my bed and started crying. A few minutes later, he walked into my room and asked me if I was okay. I rolled over and yelled, \u2018I like you, you stupid fuck-face!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest is history . . .\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAwe. Stupid fuck-face. How sweet.\u201d</p><p>Ryle holds up a finger and says, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving out the best part.\u201d</p><p>Allysa shrugs. \u201cOh yeah. So Marshall walked over to me, pulled me off the bed, kissed me with the same mouth he was just kissing the floozy with, and we made out for half an hour. Ryle walked in on us and started screaming at Marshall. Then Marshall pushed Ryle out of my bedroom, locked the door, and made out with me for another hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryle is shaking his head. \u201cBetrayed by my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Marshall pulls Allysa to him. \u201cI like her, you stupid fuck-face.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, but Ryle turns to me with a serious look on his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him for an entire month, I was so mad. I eventually got over it. We were eighteen, she was seventeen. Wasn\u2019t much I could do in the way of keeping them apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say. \u201cI sometimes forget how close in age you two are.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa smiles and says, \u201cThree kids in three years. I feel so sorry for my parents.\u201d</p><p>The table grows quiet. I see an apologetic look pass from Allysa to Ryle.</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou have another sibling?\u201d</p><p>Ryle straightens up and takes a sip of his beer. He sets it back down on the table and says, \u201cWe had an older brother. He passed away when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>Such a great night, ruined by a simple question. Luckily, Marshall redirects the conversation like a pro.</p> <p>I spend the rest of the evening listening to stories about them growing up. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever laughed as hard as I have tonight.</p><p>When the game is over, we all walk back to the shop to retrieve our cars. Ryle said he caught an Uber over earlier, so he\u2019ll just ride with me. Before Allysa and Marshall leave, I tell her to hold on. I run inside the store and grab the steampunk flowers and run them back to their car. Her face lights up when I hand them to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re pregnant but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m giving you these flowers. I just want you to have them. Because you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Allysa squeezes me and whispers in my ear. \u201cI hope he marries you someday. We\u2019ll be even better sisters.\u201d</p><p>She climbs inside the car and they leave, and I just stand there watching them because I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever had a friend like her in my whole life. Maybe it\u2019s the wine. I don\u2019t know, but I love today. Everything about it. I especially love how Ryle looks, leaning against my car, watching me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really beautiful when you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p> <p>Ugh! This day! Perfect!</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We\u2019re making our way up the stairs to my apartment when Ryle grabs my waist and pushes me against the wall. He just starts kissing me, right there in the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cImpatient,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>He laughs and cups my ass with both of his hands. \u201cNope. It\u2019s this onesie. You really should consider making this your business attire.\u201d He kisses me again and doesn\u2019t stop kissing me until someone passes us, heading down the stairs.</p><p>The guy mumbles, \u201cNice onesies,\u201d as he squeezes past us. \u201cDid the Bruins win?\u201d</p><p>Ryle nods. \u201cThree to one,\u201d he responds, without looking up at the guy.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d the guy says.</p> <p>Once he\u2019s gone, I step away from Ryle. \u201cWhat is this onesie thing? Does every male in Boston know about this?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and says, \u201cFree beer, Lily. It\u2019s free beer.\u201d He pulls me up the stairs, and when we walk in the door, Lucy is standing at the kitchen table taping up a box of her stuff. There\u2019s another box she hasn\u2019t taped up yet and I could swear I see a bowl that I bought at HomeGoods sticking out of the top. She said she\u2019d have all her stuff out by next week, but I have a feeling she\u2019ll conveniently have some of my stuff out, too.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks, looking Ryle up and down.</p><p>\u201cRyle Kincaid. I\u2019m Lily\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s boyfriend.</p><p>Did you hear that?</p><p>Boyfriend.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s confirmed it, and he said it so confidently. \u201cMy boyfriend, huh?\u201d I walk into the kitchen and grab a bottle of wine and two wineglasses.</p><p>Ryle comes up behind me as I\u2019m pouring the wine and snakes his arms around my waist. \u201cYep. Your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I hand him a glass of wine and say, \u201cSo I\u2019m a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He holds up his glass and clinks it against mine. \u201cTo the end of trial runs and the beginning of sure things.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both smiling as we take a drink of our wine.</p><p>Lucy stacks the boxes together and walks toward the front door. \u201cLooks like I got out right in time,\u201d she says.</p><p>The door closes behind her and Ryle raises an eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t think your roommate likes me very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. I didn\u2019t think she liked me, either, but yesterday she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I think she\u2019s just hoping for free flowers, though. She\u2019s very opportunistic.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs and leans against the refrigerator. His eyes fall to a magnet that says \u201cBoston\u201d on it. He pulls it off the refrigerator and raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get out of Boston purgatory if you keep souvenirs of Boston on your fridge like a tourist.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and grab the magnet, slapping it back on the fridge. I like that he remembers so much about the first night we met. \u201cIt was a gift. It only counts as touristy if I bought it myself.\u201d</p><p>He steps over to me and takes my glass of wine from my hands. He sets both of our glasses on the countertop, and then leans in and gives me a deep, passionate, drunken kiss. I can taste the tart fruitiness of the wine on his tongue and I like it. His hands go to the zipper on my onesie. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of these clothes.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me toward the bedroom, kissing me while we both struggle out of our clothes. By the time we make it to my bedroom, I\u2019m down to my bra and panties. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shoves me against the door, and I gasp at the unexpectedness of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he says. He presses his lips to my chest, then begins to kiss me slowly as he makes his way down my body.</p><p>Oh, Lord. Can this day seriously get any better?</p><p>I run my hands through his hair, but he grabs my wrists and presses them against the door. He climbs back up my body, squeezing my wrists tightly. He raises an eyebrow in warning. \u201cI said . . . don\u2019t move.\u201d</p> <p>I try not to smile, but it\u2019s hard to disguise. He drags his mouth back down my body. He slowly lowers my panties to my ankles, but he told me not to move, so I don\u2019t kick them off.</p><p>His mouth slides up my thigh until . . .</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Best.</p><p>Day.</p> <p>Ever.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Ryle: Are you at home or still at work?</p><p>Me: Work. Should be done in about an hour.</p><p>Ryle: Can I come see you?</p><p>Me: You know how people say there is no such thing as a stupid question? They\u2019re wrong. That was a stupid question.</p> <p>Ryle: :)</p><p>Half an hour later, he\u2019s knocking at the front door of the floral shop. I closed the shop almost three hours ago, but I\u2019m still here, trying to get caught up on the chaos that was the first month. The store is still too new to get an accurate projection of how well or how bad it\u2019s doing. Some days are great and some are so slow I send Allysa home. But overall, I\u2019m happy with how it\u2019s gone so far.</p><p>And happy with how things are going with Ryle.</p><p>I unlock the door to let him in. He\u2019s in light blue scrubs again, and he still has a stethoscope around his neck. Fresh from work. Very nice touch. I swear, every time I see him straight off a shift, I have to hide the stupid grin on my face. I give him a quick kiss and then turn back toward my office. \u201cI have a few things to finish up and then we can go back to my place.\u201d</p><p>He follows me into my office and closes the door. \u201cYou got a couch?\u201d he asks, looking around my office.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent some of this week putting the finishing touches on it. I bought a couple of lamps so I don\u2019t have to turn on the overpowering fluorescent lights. The lamps give the room a soft glow. I also bought a few plants to keep here permanently. It\u2019s no garden, but it\u2019s as close as it gets. It\u2019s come a long way since this room was being used as storage for vegetable crates.</p><p>Ryle walks over to the couch and falls down onto it, face-first. \u201cTake your time,\u201d he mumbles into the pillow. \u201cI\u2019ll just nap until you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>I sometimes worry about how hard he pushes himself with work, but I don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019ve been sitting in my office going on twelve hours now, so I don\u2019t have much room to talk when it comes to being too ambitious.</p> <p>I spend the next fifteen or so minutes finalizing orders. When I\u2019m finished, I close my laptop and look over at Ryle.</p><p>I thought he\u2019d be asleep, but instead he\u2019s on his side with his head propped up on his hand. He\u2019s been watching me this whole time, and seeing the smile on his face makes me blush. I push my chair back and stand up.</p><p>\u201cLily, I think I like you too much,\u201d he says as I make my way over to him.</p><p>I scrunch up my nose as he sits up on the couch and pulls me onto his lap. \u201cToo much? That doesn\u2019t sound like a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t know if it is,\u201d he says. He adjusts my legs on either side of him and then wraps his arms around my waist. \u201cThis is my first real relationship. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to like you this much yet. I don\u2019t want to scare you away.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cLike that could ever happen. You work way too much to smother me.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hands up my back. \u201cDoes it bother you that I work too much?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I worry about you sometimes because I don\u2019t want you to burn yourself out. But I don\u2019t mind that I have to share you with your passion. I actually really like how ambitious you are. It\u2019s kind of sexy. It might even be my favorite thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I like the most about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know this answer,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cMy mouth.\u201d</p><p>He leans his head back against the couch. \u201cOh yeah. That does come first. But do you know what my second favorite thing about you is?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put pressure on me to be something I\u2019m incapable of being. You accept me exactly how I am.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWell, in all fairness, you\u2019re a little different from when I first met you. You aren\u2019t so anti-girlfriend anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you make it easy,\u201d he says, sliding a hand inside the back of my shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s easy being with you. I can still have the career I\u2019ve always wanted, but you make it ten times better with the way you support me. When I\u2019m with you, I feel like I get to have my cake and eat it, too.\u201d</p><p>Now both of his hands are beneath my shirt, pressed against my back. He pulls me toward him and kisses me. I grin against his mouth and whisper, \u201cIs it the best cake you\u2019ve ever tasted?\u201d</p><p>One of his hands moves to the back of my bra and he unfastens it with ease. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure, but maybe I need another taste of it to be positive.\u201d He pulls my shirt and bra over my head. I begin to push myself off of him so I can pull off my jeans, but he pulls me back onto his lap. He grabs his stethoscope and puts it in his ears, then presses the diaphragm against my chest, right over my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got your heart so worked up, Lily?\u201d</p><p>I shrug innocently. \u201cIt might have a little to do with you, Dr. Kincaid.\u201d</p><p>He drops the end of the stethoscope and then lifts me off of him, pushing me back onto the couch. He spreads my legs and kneels down on the couch between them, placing the stethoscope against my chest again. He uses his other hand to hold himself up as he continues listening to my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re at about ninety beats per minute,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>He grins and lowers himself on top of me. \u201cI\u2019ll be satisfied when it reaches one forty.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. If it reaches 140, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll be satisfied, too. He lowers his mouth to my chest and my eyes fall shut when I feel his tongue slide across my breast. He takes me in his mouth, keeping the stethoscope pressed against my chest the entire time. \u201cYou\u2019re at about one hundred now,\u201d he says. He wraps the stethoscope around his neck again and then pulls back, unbuttoning my jeans. Once he slides them off of me, he turns me over until I\u2019m on my stomach, my arms draped over the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees,\u201d he says.</p><p>I do what he says and before I\u2019m even adjusted, I feel the cold metal of the stethoscope meet my chest again, this time with his arm snaked around me from behind. I remain still as he listens to my heartbeat. His other hand slowly begins to find its way between my legs and then inside my panties and then inside of me. I grip the couch but try to keep the noises to a minimum while he listens to my heart.</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred and ten,\u201d he says, still unsatisfied.</p><p>He pulls my hips back to meet him and then I can feel him freeing himself from his scrubs. He grips my hip with one hand while shoving my panties aside with the other. Then he pushes forward until he\u2019s all the way inside of me.</p><p>I\u2019m grasping the couch with two desperate fists when he pauses to listen to my heart again. \u201cLily,\u201d he says with mock disappointment. \u201cOne twenty. Not quite where I want you.\u201d</p><p>The stethoscope disappears again and his arm curls around my waist. His hand slides down my stomach and settles between my legs. I can no longer keep up with his rhythm. I can barely even stay on my knees. He\u2019s somehow holding me up with one hand and destroying me in the best possible way with his other hand. Right when I start to tremble, he pulls me upright until my back meets his chest. He\u2019s still inside me, but now he\u2019s focused on my heart again as he moves his stethoscope around to the front of my chest.</p><p>I let out a moan and he presses his lips to my ear. \u201cShh. No noises.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea how I make it through the next thirty seconds without making another sound. One of his arms is wrapped around me with the stethoscope pressed to my chest. His other arm is tight against my stomach as his hand continues its magic between my legs. He\u2019s still somehow deep inside me and I\u2019m trying to move against him, but he\u2019s rock solid as the tremors begin to rush through me. My legs are shaking and my hands are at my sides, gripping the tops of his thighs as it takes every ounce of my strength not to scream out his name.</p> <p>I\u2019m still shaking when he lifts my hand and places the diaphragm against my wrist. After several seconds, he pulls the stethoscope away and tosses it to the floor. \u201cOne fifty,\u201d he says with satisfaction. He pulls out of me and flips me onto my back and then his mouth is on mine and he\u2019s inside me again.</p><p>My body is too weak to move and I can\u2019t even open my eyes and watch him. He thrusts against me several times and then holds still, groaning into my mouth. He drops on top of me, tense, yet shaking.</p><p>He kisses my neck and then his lips meet the tattoo of the heart on my collarbone. He finally settles against my neck and sighs.</p><p>\u201cHave I already mentioned tonight how much I like you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider this the third time,\u201d he says. \u201cI like you. Everything about you, Lily. Being inside of you. Being outside of you. Being near you. I like it all.\u201d</p><p>I smile, loving how his words feel against my skin. Inside my heart. I open my mouth to tell him I like him, too, but my voice is cut off by the sound of his phone.</p><p>He groans against my neck and then pulls out of me and reaches for his phone. He pulls his scrubs back into place and laughs as he looks at his caller ID.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mother,\u201d he says, leaning over and kissing the top of my knee that\u2019s resting against the back of the couch. He tosses the phone aside and then stands and walks over to my desk, grabbing a box of tissues.</p><p>This is always awkward, having to clean up after sex. But I can\u2019t say it\u2019s ever been this awkward before, knowing his mother is on the other end of that ring.</p><p>Once all my clothes are back in place, he pulls me against him on the couch and I lie down on top of him, resting my head on his chest.</p><p>It\u2019s after ten now and I\u2019m so comfortable I debate just sleeping here for the night. Ryle\u2019s phone makes another noise, alerting him to a new voice mail. The thought of seeing him interact with his mother makes me smile. Allysa talks about their parents some, but I\u2019ve never really talked to Ryle about them before.</p><p>\u201cDo you get along with your parents?\u201d</p><p>His arm is stroking mine gently. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re good people. We hit a rough patch when I was a teenager, but we worked through it. I talk to my mother almost daily now.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over his chest and rest my chin on them, looking up at him. \u201cWill you tell me more about your mother? Allysa told me they moved to England a few years ago. And that they were in Australia on vacation, but that was like a month ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughs. \u201cMy mother? Well . . . my mother is very overbearing. Very judgmental, especially of the people she loves the most. She\u2019s never missed a single church service. And I have never heard her refer to my father as anything other than Dr. Kincaid.\u201d</p><p>Despite the warnings, he smiles the whole time he talks about her.</p><p>\u201cYour father is a doctor, too?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cPsychiatrist. He chose a field that also allowed him to have a normal life. Smart man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they ever visit you in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. My mother hates flying, so Allysa and I fly to England a couple of times a year. She does want to meet you, though, so you might be going with us on the next trip.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve told your mother about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is kind of a monumental thing, you know. Me having a girlfriend. She calls me every day to make sure I haven\u2019t screwed it up somehow.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, which makes him reach for his phone. \u201cYou think I\u2019m kidding? I guarantee she somehow brought you up in the voice mail she just left.\u201d He presses a few keys and then begins to play the voice mail.</p> <p>\u201cHey, sweetheart! It\u2019s your mom. Haven\u2019t spoken to you since yesterday. Miss you. Give Lily a hug for me. You do still see her, right? Allysa says you can\u2019t stop talking about her. She is still your girlfriend, right? Okay. Gretchen\u2019s here, we\u2019re having high tea. Love you. Kiss kiss.\u201d</p><p>I press my face against his chest and laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been dating a few months. How much do you talk about me?\u201d</p><p>He pulls my hand up between us and kisses it. \u201cToo much, Lily. Way too much.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet them. Not only did they raise an incredible daughter, but they made you. That\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d</p><p>His arms tighten around me and he kisses the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your brother\u2019s name?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>I can feel a slight stiffness in him after I ask that. I regret bringing it up, but it\u2019s too late to take it back.</p><p>\u201cEmerson.\u201d</p><p>I can tell by his voice that it\u2019s not something he wants to talk about right now. Instead of pressing it further, I lift my head and scoot forward, pressing my mouth to his.</p><p>I should know better. Kisses can\u2019t seem to stop at just kisses when it comes to me and Ryle. In a matter of minutes, he\u2019s inside of me again, but this time it\u2019s everything the other time wasn\u2019t.</p><p>This time we make love.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>My phone rings. I pick it up to see who it is and I\u2019m a little taken aback. It\u2019s the first time Ryle has ever called me. We always just text. How odd to have a boyfriend for over three months that I\u2019ve never once spoken to on the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, girlfriend,\u201d he says.</p><p>I smile cheesily at the sound of his voice. \u201cHey, boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the day off tomorrow. Your floral shop doesn\u2019t open until one o\u2019clock on Sundays. I\u2019m on my way to your apartment with two bottles of wine. You want to have a sleepover with your boyfriend and have drunken sex all night and sleep until noon?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s really embarrassing what his words do to me. I smile and say, \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cooking you dinner. And I\u2019m wearing an apron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cJust an apron.\u201d And then I hang up.</p><p>A few seconds later, I get a text message.</p><p>Ryle: Pic, please.</p><p>Me: Get over here and you can take the picture yourself.</p><p>I\u2019m almost finished preparing the casserole mixture when the door opens. I pour it into the glass pan and don\u2019t turn around when I hear him walk into the kitchen. When I said I was just wearing an apron, I meant it. I\u2019m not even wearing panties.</p><p>I can hear him suck in a rush of air when I reach over to the oven and stick the casserole inside. I might reach a little too far for show when I do it. When I close the oven, I don\u2019t face him. I grab a rag and start wiping down the oven, making sure to sway my hips as much as possible. I squeal when I feel a piercing sting on my right butt cheek. I spin around and Ryle is grinning, holding two bottles of wine.</p><p>\u201cDid you just bite me?\u201d</p><p>He gives me an innocent look. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt the scorpion if you don\u2019t want to get stung.\u201d He eyes me up and down while he opens one of the bottles. He holds it up before he pours us a glass and says, \u201cIt\u2019s vintage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVintage,\u201d I say with mock impression. \u201cWhat\u2019s the special occasion?\u201d</p><p>He hands me a glass and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be an uncle. I have a smoking hot girlfriend. And I get to perform a very rare, possibly once-in-a-lifetime craniopagus separation on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cranio-what?\u201d</p><p>He finishes off his glass of wine and pours himself another one. \u201cCraniopagus separation. Conjoined twins,\u201d he says. He points to a spot on the top of his head and taps it. \u201cAttached right here. We\u2019ve been studying them since they were born. It\u2019s a very rare surgery. Very rare.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I think I\u2019m genuinely turned on by him as a doctor. I mean, I admire his drive. I admire his dedication. But seeing how excited he is about what he\u2019s doing for a living is seriously sexy.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugs. \u201cNot sure. They\u2019re young, so being under general anesthesia for too long is a concern.\u201d He holds up his right hand and wiggles his fingers. \u201cBut this is a very special hand that has been through almost half a million dollars\u2019 worth of specialty education. I have a lot of faith in this hand.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to him and press my lips to his palm. \u201cI\u2019m a little fond of this hand, too.\u201d</p><p>He slides the hand down to my neck and then spins me so that I\u2019m flush against the counter. I gasp, because I wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>He pushes himself against me from behind and slowly slides his hand down the side of my body. I press my palms into the granite and close my eyes, already feeling the rush of the wine.</p> <p>\u201cThis hand,\u201d he whispers, \u201cis the steadiest hand in all of Boston.\u201d</p><p>He pushes on the back of my neck, bending me further over the counter. His hand meets the inside of my knee and he glides it upward. Slowly. Jesus.</p><p>He pushes my legs apart, and then his fingers are inside me. I moan and try to find something to hold on to. I grip the faucet, just as he begins to work magic.</p><p>And then, just like a magician, his hand disappears.</p><p>I hear him walking out of the kitchen. I watch as he passes the front of the counter. He winks at me, downs the rest of his glass of wine and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take a quick shower.\u201d</p> <p>What a tease.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole!\u201d I yell after him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an asshole!\u201d he yells from my bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m a highly trained neurosurgeon!\u201d</p><p>I laugh and pour myself another glass of wine.</p><p>I\u2019ll show him who the tease really is.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>I\u2019m on my third glass of wine when he walks out of my bedroom.</p><p>I\u2019m on the phone with my mother, so I watch him from the couch as he makes his way to the kitchen and pours himself another glass.</p><p>That is some seriously good wine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d my mother asks.</p><p>I have her on speakerphone. Ryle is leaning against a wall, watching me talk to her. \u201cNot much. Helping Ryle study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds . . . not very interesting,\u201d she says.</p><p>Ryle winks at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually very interesting,\u201d I say to her. \u201cI help him study a lot. Mostly reviewing fine-motor control of the hands. In fact, we\u2019ll probably be up all night studying.\u201d</p> <p>The three glasses of wine has made me frisky. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m flirting with him while I\u2019m on the phone with my mother. Gross.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWe\u2019re taking Allysa and Marshall out to dinner tomorrow night, so I\u2019ll call you on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, where are you taking them?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. The woman can\u2019t take a hint. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Ryle, where are we taking them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat place we went to that one time with your mom,\u201d he says. \u201cBib\u2019s? I made reservations for six o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>My heart feels like it slinks down my chest. My mother says, \u201cOh, good choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If you like stale bread. Bye, Mom.\u201d I hang up and look at Ryle. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back there. I didn\u2019t like it. Let\u2019s try something new.\u201d</p><p>I fail to tell him why I really don\u2019t want to go back there. But how do you tell your brand-new boyfriend that you\u2019re trying to avoid your first love?</p><p>Ryle pushes off the wall. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he says. \u201cAllysa\u2019s excited to eat there, I told her all about it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and Atlas won\u2019t be working.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of food,\u201d Ryle says. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>The casserole!</p><p>\u201cOh shit!\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>Ryle rushes to the kitchen and I stand up and follow him in there. I walk in just as he pulls the oven door open and waves away the smoke. Ruined.</p><p>I get dizzy all of a sudden from standing up too fast after having three glasses of wine. I grab the counter beside him to steady myself, just as he reaches in to pull the burnt casserole out.</p><p>\u201cRyle! You need a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cPot holder.\u201d</p><p>The casserole falls from his hand and lands on the floor, shattering everywhere. I lift up my feet to avoid broken glass and mushroom chicken splatter. I start laughing as soon as I realize he didn\u2019t even think to use a pot holder.</p><p>Must be the wine. This is some seriously strong wine.</p><p>He slams the oven shut and moves to the faucet, shoving his hand under the cold water, muttering curse words. I\u2019m trying to suppress my laughter, but the wine and the ridiculousness of the last few seconds are making it hard. I look at the floor\u2014at the mess we\u2019re about to have to clean up\u2014and the laughter bursts from me. I\u2019m still laughing as I lean over to get a look at Ryle\u2019s hand. I hope he didn\u2019t hurt it too bad.</p><p>I\u2019m instantly not laughing anymore. I\u2019m on the floor, my hand pressed against the corner of my eye.</p><p>In a matter of one second, Ryle\u2019s arm came out of nowhere and slammed against me, knocking me backward. There was enough force behind it to knock me off balance. When I lost my footing, I hit my face on one of the cabinet door handles as I came down.</p><p>Pain shoots through the corner of my eye, right near my temple.</p><p>And then I feel the weight.</p><p>Heaviness follows and it presses down on every part of me. So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.</p><p>I wrap my arms over my head and try to wish away the last ten seconds.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Lily,\u201d I hear him say. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. This hand is my fucking career.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look up at him. His voice doesn\u2019t penetrate through my body this time. It feels like it\u2019s stabbing me now, the sharpness of each of his words coming at me like swords. Then I feel him next to me, his goddamn hand on my back.</p> <p>Rubbing.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, God. Lily.\u201d He tries to pull my arms from my head, but I refuse to budge. I start shaking my head, wanting the last fifteen seconds to go away. Fifteen seconds. That\u2019s all it takes to completely change everything about a person.</p><p>Fifteen seconds that we\u2019ll never get back.</p><p>He pulls me against him and starts kissing the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just . . . I burned my hand. I panicked. You were laughing and . . . I\u2019m so sorry, it all happened so fast. I didn\u2019t mean to push you, Lily, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hear Ryle\u2019s voice this time. All I hear is my father\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jenny. It was an accident. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lily. It was an accident. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I just want him away from me. I use every ounce of strength I have in both my hands and legs and I force him the fuck away from me.</p><p>He falls backward, onto his hands. His eyes are full of genuine sorrow, but then they\u2019re full of something else.</p><p>Worry? Panic?</p><p>He slowly pulls up his right hand and it\u2019s covered in blood. Blood is trickling out of his palm, down his wrist. I look at the floor\u2014at the shattered pieces of glass from the casserole dish. His hand. I just pushed him onto glass.</p> <p>He turns around and pulls himself up. He sticks his hand under the stream of water and starts rinsing away the blood. I stand up, just as he pulls a sliver of glass out of his palm and tosses it on the counter.</p><p>I\u2019m full of so much anger, but somehow, concern for his hand still finds its way out. I grab a towel and shove it into his fist. There\u2019s so much blood.</p><p>It\u2019s his right hand.</p><p>His surgery Monday.</p><p>I try to help stop the bleeding, but I\u2019m shaking too bad. \u201cRyle, your hand.\u201d</p><p>He pulls the hand away and, with his good hand, he lifts my chin. \u201cFuck the hand, Lily. I don\u2019t care about my hand. Are you okay?\u201d He\u2019s looking back and forth between my eyes frantically as he assesses the cut on my face.</p><p>My shoulders begin to shake and huge, hurt-filled tears spill down my cheeks. \u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m a little in shock, and I know he can hear my heart breaking with just that one word, because I can feel it in every part of me. \u201cOh my God. You pushed me, Ryle. You . . .\u201d The realization of what has just happened hurts worse than the actual action.</p><p>Ryle wraps his arm around my neck and desperately holds me against him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lily. God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He buries his face against my hair, squeezing me with every emotion inside of him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me. Please.\u201d</p> <p>His voice slowly starts to become Ryle\u2019s voice again, and I feel it in my stomach, in my toes. His entire career depends on his hand, so it has to say something that he\u2019s not even worried about it. Right? I\u2019m so confused.</p><p>There\u2019s too much happening. The smoke, the wine, the broken glass, the food splattered everywhere, the blood, the anger, the apologies, it\u2019s too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says again. I pull back and his eyes are red and I\u2019ve never seen him look so sad. \u201cI panicked. I didn\u2019t mean to push you away, I just panicked. All I could think about was the surgery Monday and my hand and . . . I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He presses his mouth to mine and breathes me in.</p><p>He\u2019s not like my father. He can\u2019t be. He\u2019s nothing like that uncaring bastard.</p><p>We\u2019re both upset and kissing and confused and sad. I\u2019ve never felt anything like this moment\u2014so ugly and painful. But somehow the only thing that eases the hurt just caused by this man is this man. My tears are soothed by his sorrow, my emotions soothed with his mouth against mine, his hand gripping me like he never wants to let go.</p><p>I feel his arms go around my waist and he picks me up, carefully stepping through the mess we\u2019ve made. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m more disappointed in him or myself. Him for losing his temper in the first place or me for somehow finding comfort in his apology.</p><p>He carries me and kisses me all the way to my bedroom. He\u2019s still kissing me when he lowers me to the bed and whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lily.\u201d He moves his lips to the spot on my eye that hit the cabinet, and he kisses me there. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His mouth is on mine again, hot and wet, and I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening to me. I\u2019m hurting so much on the inside, yet my body craves his apology in the form of his mouth and hands on me. I want to lash out at him and react like I always wish my mother would have reacted when my father hurt her, but deep down I want to believe that it really was an accident. Ryle isn\u2019t like my father. He\u2019s nothing like him.</p><p>I need to feel his sorrow. His regret. I get both of these things in the way he kisses me. I spread my legs for him and his sorrow comes in another form. Slow, apologetic thrusts inside of me. Every time he enters me, he whispers another apology. And by some miracle, every time he pulls out of me, my anger leaves with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He\u2019s kissing my shoulder.

I try to forget what happened in the kitchen, but it\u2019s everything right now.</p><p>He pushed me away from him.</p><p>Ryle pushed me.</p> <p>For fifteen seconds, I saw a side of him that wasn\u2019t him. That wasn\u2019t me. I laughed at him when I should have been concerned. He shoved me when he should have never touched me. I pushed him away and caused him to cut his hand.</p><p>It was awful. The whole thing, the entire fifteen seconds it lasted, was absolutely awful. I never want to think about it again.</p><p>He still has the rag balled up in his hand and it\u2019s soaked with blood. I push against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell him. He kisses me one more time and rolls off of me. I walk to the bathroom and close the door. I look in the mirror and gasp.</p><p>Blood. In my hair, on my cheeks, on my body. It\u2019s all his blood. I grab a rag and try to wash some off, and then I look under the sink for the first aid kit. I have no idea how bad his hand is. First he burned it, then he sliced it open. Not even an hour after he was just telling me how important this surgery was to him.</p> <p>No more wine. We\u2019re never allowed vintage wine again.</p><p>I grab the box from under the sink and open the bedroom door. He\u2019s walking back into the bedroom from the kitchen with a small bag of ice. He holds it up, \u201cFor your eye,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hold up the first aid kit. \u201cFor your hand.\u201d</p><p>We both smile and then sit back down on the bed. He leans against the headboard while I pull his hand to my lap. The whole time I\u2019m dressing his wound, he\u2019s holding the bag of ice against my eye.</p><p>I squeeze some antiseptic cream onto my finger and dab it against the burns on his fingers. They don\u2019t look as bad as I thought they might be, so that\u2019s a relief. \u201cCan you prevent it from blistering?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot if it\u2019s second-degree.\u201d</p> <p>I want to ask him if he can still perform the surgery if his fingers have blisters on them come Monday, but I don\u2019t bring it up. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s on the forefront of his mind right now.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to put some on your cut?\u201d</p><p>He nods. The bleeding has stopped. I\u2019m sure if he needed stitches, he\u2019d get some, but I think it\u2019ll be fine. I pull the ACE bandage out of the first aid kit and begin wrapping his hand.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he whispers. I look up at him. His head is resting against the headboard, and it looks like he wants to cry. \u201cI feel terrible,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I could take it back . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, cutting him off. \u201cI know, Ryle. It was terrible. You pushed me. You made me question everything I thought I knew about you. But I know you feel bad about it. We can\u2019t take it back. I don\u2019t want to bring it up again.\u201d I secure the bandage around his hand and then look him in the eye. \u201cBut Ryle? If anything like that ever happens again . . . I\u2019ll know that this time wasn\u2019t just an accident. And I\u2019ll leave you without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long time, his eyebrows drawn apart in regret. He leans forward and presses his lips against mine. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, Lily. I swear. I\u2019m not like him. I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, but I swear to you . . .\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wanting him to stop. I can\u2019t take the pain in his voice. \u201cI know you\u2019re nothing like my father,\u201d I say. \u201cJust . . . please don\u2019t ever make me doubt you again. Please.\u201d</p><p>He brushes hair from my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re the most important part of my life, Lily. I want to be what brings you happiness. Not what causes you to hurt.\u201d He kisses me and then stands up and leans over me, pressing the ice to my face. \u201cHold this here for about ten more minutes. It\u2019ll prevent it from swelling.\u201d</p> <p>I replace his hand with mine. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He kisses me on the forehead and says, \u201cTo clean up my mess.\u201d</p><p>He spends the next twenty minutes cleaning the kitchen. I can hear glass being tossed into the trash can, wine being poured out in the sink. I go to the bathroom and take a quick shower to get his blood off of me and then I change the sheets on my bed. When he finally has the kitchen cleaned up, he comes to the bedroom with a glass. He hands it to me. \u201cIt\u2019s soda,\u201d he says. \u201cThe caffeine will help.\u201d</p><p>I take a drink of it and feel it fizz down my throat. It\u2019s actually the perfect thing. I take another drink and set it on my nightstand. \u201cWhat\u2019s it help with? The hangover?\u201d</p><p>Ryle slides into bed and pulls the covers over us. He shakes his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think soda actually helps anything. My mom just used to give me a soda after I\u2019d had a bad day and it always made me feel a little better.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWell, it worked.\u201d</p><p>He brushes his hand down my cheek and I can see in his eyes and in the way he touches me that he deserves at least one chance at forgiveness. I feel if I don\u2019t find a way to forgive him, I\u2019ll somewhat be placing blame on him for the resentment I still hold for my father. He\u2019s not like my father.</p><p>Ryle loves me. He\u2019s never come out and said it before, but I know he does. And I love him. What happened in the kitchen tonight is something I\u2019m confident won\u2019t happen again. Not after seeing how upset he is that he hurt me.</p><p>All humans make mistakes. What determines a person\u2019s character aren\u2019t the mistakes we make. It\u2019s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryle\u2019s eyes somehow grow even more sincere and he leans over and kisses my hand. He settles his head into the pillow and we just lie there, staring at each other, sharing this unspoken energy that fills all the holes the night has left in us.</p><p>After a few minutes, he squeezes my hand. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, brushing his thumb over mine. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I feel his words in every part of me. And when I whisper, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d it\u2019s the most naked truth I\u2019ve ever spoken to him.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>I arrive at the restaurant fifteen minutes late. Right when I was about to close tonight I had a customer come in to order flowers for a funeral. I couldn\u2019t turn them away because . . . sadly . . . funerals are the best business for florists.</p><p>Ryle waves me over to the table and I walk straight to them, doing my best not to look around. I don\u2019t want to see Atlas. I tried twice to get them to change the restaurant location, but Allysa was hell-bent on eating here after Ryle told her how good it was.</p><p>I slide into the booth and Ryle leans over and kisses me on the cheek. \u201cHey, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Allysa groans. \u201cGod, you guys are so cute, it\u2019s sickening.\u201d I smile at her, and her eyes immediately go to the corner of my eye. It doesn\u2019t look as bad as I thought it might today, which is probably due to Ryle forcing me to keep ice on it. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Allysa says. \u201cRyle told me what happened but I didn\u2019t think it was that bad.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Ryle, wondering what he told her. The truth? He smiles and says, \u201cOlive oil was everywhere. When she slipped, it was so graceful you\u2019d think she was a ballerina.\u201d</p> <p>A lie.</p><p>Fair enough. I would have done the same thing.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty pathetic,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>Somehow, we get through dinner without a hitch. No sign of Atlas, no thoughts of last night, and Ryle and I both avoid the wine. After we\u2019re finished with our food, our waiter approaches the table. \u201cCare for dessert?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head, but Allysa perks up. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d</p><p>Marshall looks just as interested. \u201cWe\u2019re eating for two, so we\u2019ll take anything chocolate,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The waiter nods, and when he walks away, Allysa looks at Marshall. \u201cThis baby is the size of a bedbug right now. You better not encourage bad habits for the next several months.\u201d</p><p>The waiter returns with a dessert cart. \u201cThe chef gives all expectant mothers dessert on the house,\u201d he says. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Allysa says, perking up.</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Bib\u2019s,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cChef likes the babies.\u201d</p><p>We all look at the cart. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I say, looking at the options.</p><p>\u201cThis is my new favorite restaurant,\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>We pick out three desserts for the table. The four of us spend the time waiting for it to be served discussing baby names.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Allysa says to Marshall. \u201cWe\u2019re not naming this baby after a state.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I love Nebraska,\u201d he whines. \u201cIdaho?\u201d</p><p>Allysa drops her head in her hands. \u201cThis is going to be the demise of our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemise,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a good name.\u201d</p><p>Marshall\u2019s murder is thwarted by the arrival of dessert. Our waiter places a piece of chocolate cake in front of Allysa, and steps aside to make room for the waiter behind him who is holding the other two desserts. The waiter motions toward the guy placing our desserts down and says, \u201cThe chef would like to extend his congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the meal?\u201d the chef asks, looking at Allysa and Marshall.</p><p>By the time his eyes make it to mine, my anxiety is seeping from me. Atlas locks eyes with me, and without thinking, I blurt out, \u201cYou\u2019re the chef?\u201d</p><p>The waiter leans around Atlas and says. \u201cThe chef. The owner. Sometimes waiter, sometimes dishwasher. He gives a new meaning to hands-on.\u201d</p><p>The next five seconds go unnoticed by everyone at our table, but they play out in slow motion to me.</p><p>Atlas\u2019s eyes fall to the cut on my eye.</p><p>The bandage wrapped around Ryle\u2019s hand.</p><p>Back to my eye.</p><p>\u201cWe love your restaurant,\u201d Allysa says. \u201cYou have an incredible place here.\u201d</p><p>Atlas doesn\u2019t look at her. I see the roll of his throat as he swallows. His jaw hardens and he says nothing as he walks away.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The waiter tries to cover for Atlas\u2019s hasty retreat by smiling and showing way too many teeth. \u201cEnjoy your dessert,\u201d he says, scuffling off to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d Allysa says. \u201cWe find a new favorite restaurant and the chef is an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs. \u201cYeah, but the assholes are the best ones. Gordon Ramsay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>I put my hand on Ryle\u2019s arm. \u201cBathroom,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He nods as I scoot out of the booth, and Marshall says, \u201cWhat about Wolfgang Puck? You think he\u2019s an asshole?\u201d</p><p>I walk across the restaurant, head down, fast paced. As soon as I get into the familiar hallway, I keep going. I push open the door to the women\u2019s restroom and then turn around and lock it.</p><p>Shit. Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>The look in his eye. The anger in his jaw.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved he walked away, but I\u2019m half-convinced he\u2019s probably going to be waiting outside the restaurant when we leave, ready to kick Ryle\u2019s ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I breathe in my nose, out my mouth, wash my hands, repeat the breathing. Once I\u2019m more calm, I dry my hands on a towel.</p><p>I\u2019ll just go back out there and tell Ryle I\u2019m not feeling well. We\u2019ll leave and we\u2019ll never come back. They all think the chef is an asshole, so that can be my excuse.</p><p>I unlock the door, but I don\u2019t pull it open. It starts pushing open from the other side, so I step back. Atlas steps inside the bathroom with me and locks the door. His back rests against the door as he stares at me, focused on the cut near my eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are narrow, still ice blue but somehow burning with fire. \u201cYou\u2019re lying, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I muster enough of a smile to get me by. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Atlas laughs, but then his face falls flat. \u201cLeave him.\u201d</p><p>Leave him?</p> <p>Jesus, he thinks this is something else entirely. I take a step forward and shake my head. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that, Atlas. It wasn\u2019t like that. Ryle is a good person.\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head and leans it forward a little bit. \u201cFunny. You sound just like your mother.\u201d</p><p>His words sting. I immediately try to reach around him for the door, but he grabs my wrist. \u201cLeave him, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I yank my hand away. I turn my back to him and inhale a deep breath. I release it slowly as I face him again. \u201cIf it\u2019s any comparison at all, I\u2019m more scared of you right now than I\u2019ve ever been of him.\u201d</p><p>My words make Atlas pause for a moment. His nod starts out slowly, and then gets more prominent as he steps away from the door. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d He motions toward the door. \u201cJust trying to repay the concern you\u2019ve always shown me.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a moment, unsure how to take his words. He\u2019s still raging on the inside, I can see it. But on the outside, he\u2019s calm\u2014collected. Allowing me to leave. I reach forward and unlock the door, then pull it open.</p> <p>I gasp when my eyes meet Ryle\u2019s. I quickly glance over my shoulder to see Atlas filing out of the bathroom with me.</p><p>Ryle\u2019s eyes fill with confusion as he looks from me to Atlas. \u201cWhat the fuck, Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyle.\u201d My voice shakes. God, this looks so much worse than it is.</p><p>Atlas steps around me and turns toward the doors to the kitchen, as if Ryle doesn\u2019t even exist to him. Ryle\u2019s eyes are glued to Atlas\u2019s back. Keep walking, Atlas.</p><p>Right when Atlas reaches the kitchen doors, he pauses.</p><p>No, no, no. Keep walking.</p><p>In what becomes one of the most dreadful moments I can imagine, he spins around and strides toward Ryle, grabbing him by the collar of his shirt. Almost as soon as it happens, Ryle forces Atlas back and slams him against the opposite wall. Atlas lunges for Ryle again, this time shoving his forearm against Ryle\u2019s throat, pinning him against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou touch her again and I\u2019ll cut your fucking hand off and shove it down your throat, you worthless piece of shit!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAtlas, stop!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Atlas releases Ryle forcefully, taking a huge step back. Ryle is breathing heavily, staring at Atlas long and hard. Then his focus moves directly to me. \u201cAtlas?\u201d He says his name with familiarity.</p><p>Why is Ryle saying Atlas\u2019s name like that? Like he\u2019s heard me say it before? I\u2019ve never told him about Atlas.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>I did.</p><p>That first night on the roof. It was one of my naked truths.</p><p>Ryle lets out a disbelieving laugh and points at Atlas, but he\u2019s still looking at me. \u201cThis is Atlas? The homeless boy you pity-fucked?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>The hallway instantly becomes a blur of fists and elbows and my screams for them to stop. Two waiters push through the door behind me and shove past me, separating them just as quickly as it started.</p><p>They\u2019re pushed apart against opposite walls, staring each other down, breathing heavily. I can\u2019t even look at either of them.</p><p>I can\u2019t look at Atlas. Not after what Ryle just said to him. I also can\u2019t look at Ryle because he\u2019s probably thinking the absolute worst possible thing right now.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d Atlas yells, pointing at the door, but looking at Ryle. \u201cGet the hell out of my restaurant!\u201d</p><p>I meet Ryle\u2019s eyes as he begins to walk past me, scared of what I\u2019ll see in them. But there isn\u2019t any anger there.</p><p>Only hurt.</p><p>Lots of hurt.</p><p>He pauses as if he\u2019s about to say something to me. But his face just twists into disappointment and he walks back out into the restaurant.</p><p>I finally glance up at Atlas and can see disappointment all across his face. Before I can explain away Ryle\u2019s words to him, he turns and walks away, pushing through the kitchen doors.</p><p>I immediately turn and run after Ryle. He grabs his jacket from the booth and walks toward the exit without even looking at Allysa and Marshall.</p><p>Allysa looks up at me and holds her hands up in question. I shake my head, grab my purse and say, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I follow Ryle outside and he\u2019s walking toward the parking lot. I run to catch up to him and he just stops and punches at the air.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring my fucking car!\u201d he yells, frustrated.</p><p>I pull my keys out of my purse and he walks up to me and snatches them from my hand. Again, I follow him, this time to my car.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if he even wants to speak to me right now. He just saw me locked in a bathroom with a guy I used to be in love with. Then, out of nowhere, that guy attacks him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, this is so bad.</p><p>When we reach my car, he heads straight for the driver\u2019s side door. He points to the passenger side and says, \u201cGet in, Lily.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak to me the entire time we\u2019re driving. I say his name once, but he just shakes his head like he\u2019s not ready to hear my explanation yet. When we pull into my parking garage, he gets out of the car as soon as he turns it off, like he can\u2019t get away from me fast enough.</p><p>He\u2019s pacing the length of the car when I get out. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what it looked like, Ryle. I swear.\u201d</p> <p>He stops pacing, and when he looks at me, my heart doubles over. There\u2019s so much pain in his eyes right now, and it\u2019s not even necessary. It was all due to a stupid misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this, Lily,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a relationship! I didn\u2019t want this stress in my life!\u201d</p><p>As much as he\u2019s hurting because of what he thinks he saw, his words still piss me off. \u201cWell, then leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I throw my hands up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your burden, Ryle! I\u2019m so sorry my presence in your life is so unbearable!\u201d</p> <p>He takes a step forward. \u201cLily, that\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m saying.\u201d He throws his hands up in frustration and then walks past me. He leans against my car and folds his arms over his chest. There\u2019s a long stretch of silence while I wait for what he has to say. His head is down, but he lifts it slightly, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cNaked truths, Lily. That\u2019s all I want from you right now. Can you please give me that?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cDid you know he worked there?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips together and wrap my arm over my chest, grabbing at my elbow. \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to go back, Ryle. I didn\u2019t want to run into him.\u201d</p><p>My answer seems to release a little of his tension. He runs a hand down his face. \u201cDid you tell him what happened last night? Did you tell him about our fight?\u201d</p> <p>I take a step forward and shake my head adamantly. \u201cNo. He assumed. He saw my eye and your hand and he just assumed.\u201d</p><p>He blows out a laden breath and leans his head back, looking up at the roof. It looks like it\u2019s almost too painful for him to even ask the next question.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you alone with him in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>I take another step forward. \u201cHe followed me in there. I know nothing about him now, Ryle. I didn\u2019t even know he owned that restaurant, I thought he was just a waiter. He\u2019s not a part of my life anymore, I swear. He just . . .\u201d I fold my arms together and drop my voice. \u201cWe both grew up in abusive households. He saw my face and your hand and . . . he was just worried for me. That\u2019s all it was.\u201d</p><p>Ryle brings his hands up and covers his mouth. I can hear the air rushing through his fingers as he releases his breath. He stands up straight, allowing himself a moment to soak in all I\u2019ve just said.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he says.</p><p>He pushes off the car and takes the three steps toward me that previously separated us. He puts both hands on my cheeks and looks me dead in the eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be with me . . . please tell me right now, Lily. Because when I saw you with him . . . that hurt. I never want to feel that again. And if it hurts this much now, I\u2019m terrified to think of what it could do to me a year from now.\u201d</p><p>I can feel the tears begin to stream down my cheeks. I place my hands on top of his and shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else, Ryle. I only want you.\u201d</p> <p>He forces the saddest smile I\u2019ve ever seen on a human. He pulls me to him and holds me there. I wrap my arms around him as tight as I can as he presses his lips to the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lily. God, I love you.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze him tight, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and wish I could wash away the entire last two days.</p><p>Atlas is wrong about Ryle.</p><p>I just wish Atlas knew he was wrong.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . I\u2019m not trying to be selfish, but you didn\u2019t taste the dessert, Lily.\u201d Allysa groans. \u201cOh, it was sooo good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never going back there,\u201d I say to her.</p><p>She stomps her foot like a little kid. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We have to respect your brother\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms over her chest. \u201cI know, I know. Why did you have to be a hormonal teenager and fall in love with the best chef in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a chef when I knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says. She walks out of my office and closes the door.</p><p>My phone buzzes with an incoming text.</p><p>Ryle: 5 hours down. About 5 more to go. So far so good. Hand is great.</p><p>I sigh, relieved. I wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to do the surgery today, but knowing how much he was looking forward to it makes me happy for him.</p><p>Me: Steadiest hands in all of Boston.</p><p>I open my laptop and check my email. The first thing I see is an inquiry from the Boston Globe. I open it and it\u2019s from a journalist interested in running an article about the store. I grin like an idiot and start emailing her back when Allysa knocks on the door. She opens it and sticks her head in.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back.</p><p>She taps her fingers on the doorframe. \u201cRemember a few minutes ago when you told me I could never go back to Bib\u2019s because it\u2019s unfair to Ryle that the boy you loved when you were a teenager is the owner?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fall back against my chair. \u201cWhat do you want, Allysa?\u201d</p><p>She scrunches up her nose and says, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t fair that we can\u2019t go back there because of the owner, how is it fair that the owner gets to come here?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I close my laptop and stand up. \u201cWhy would you say that? Is he here?\u201d</p> <p>She nods and slips inside my office, closing the door behind her. \u201cHe is. He asked for you. And I know you\u2019re with my brother and I\u2019m with child, but can we please just take a moment to silently admire the perfection that is that man?\u201d</p><p>She smiles dreamily and I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAllysa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose eyes, though.\u201d She opens the door and walks out. I follow behind her and catch sight of Atlas. \u201cShe\u2019s right here,\u201d Allysa says. \u201cWould you like me to take your coat?\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t take coats.</p> <p>Atlas glances up when I walk out of my office. His eyes cut to Allysa and he shakes his head. \u201cNo, thank you. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Allysa leans forward over the counter, dropping her chin on her hands. \u201cStay as long as you like. In fact, are you looking for an extra job? Lily needs to hire more people and we\u2019re looking for someone who can lift really heavy things. Requires a lot of flexibility. Bending over.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at Allysa and mouth, \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs innocently. I hold my door open for Atlas, but avoid looking directly at him as he passes me. I feel a world of guilt for what happened last night, but also a world of anger for what happened last night.</p><p>I walk around my desk and drop into my seat, prepared for an argument. But when I look up at him, I clamp my mouth shut.</p><p>He\u2019s smiling. He waves his hand around in a circle as he takes a seat across from me. \u201cThis is incredible, Lily.\u201d</p> <p>I pause. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He continues smiling at me, like he\u2019s proud of me. Then he places a bag between us on the desk and pushes it toward me. \u201cA gift,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can open it later.\u201d</p><p>Why is he buying me gifts? He has a girlfriend. I have a boyfriend. Our past has already caused enough problems in my present. I certainly don\u2019t need gifts to exacerbate that.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you buying me gifts, Atlas?\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his seat and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cI bought it three years ago. I\u2019ve been holding on to it in case I ever ran into you.\u201d</p><p>Considerate Atlas. He hasn\u2019t changed. Dammit.</p><p>I pick up the gift and set it on the floor behind my desk. I try to release some of the tension I\u2019m feeling, but it\u2019s really hard when everything about him makes me so tense.</p><p>\u201cI came here to apologize to you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I wave off his apology, letting him know it isn\u2019t necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was a misunderstanding. Ryle is fine.\u201d</p><p>He laughs under his breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m apologizing for,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never apologize for defending you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t defending me,\u201d I say. \u201cThere was nothing to defend.\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head, giving me the same look that he gave me last night. The one that lets me know how disappointed in me he is. It stings deep in my gut.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWhy are you apologizing, then?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. Contemplative. \u201cI wanted to apologize for saying that you sounded like your mother. That was hurtful. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I always feel like crying when I\u2019m around him. When I think about him. When I read about him. It\u2019s like my emotions are still tethered to him somehow and I can\u2019t figure out how to cut the strings.</p><p>His eyes drop to my desk. He reaches forward and grabs three things. A pen. A sticky note. My phone.</p><p>He writes something down on the sticky note and then proceeds to pull my phone apart. He slips the case off and puts the sticky note between the case and the phone, then slides the cover back over it. He pushes my phone back across the desk. I look down at it and then up at him. He stands up and tosses the pen on my desk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cell phone number. Keep it hidden there in case you ever need it.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the gesture. The unnecessary gesture. \u201cI won\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d He walks to the door and reaches for the doorknob. And I know this is my only chance to get out what I have to say before he\u2019s out of my life forever.</p><p>\u201cAtlas, wait.\u201d</p><p>I stand up so fast, my chair scoots across the room and bumps against the wall. He half turns and faces me.</p><p>\u201cWhat Ryle said to you last night? I never . . .\u201d I bring a nervous hand up to my neck. I can feel my heart beating in my throat. \u201cI never said that to him. He was hurt and upset and he misconstrued my words from a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Atlas\u2019s mouth twitches, and I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s trying not to smile or trying not to frown. He faces me straight on. \u201cBelieve me, Lily. I know that wasn\u2019t a pity fuck. I was there.\u201d</p><p>He walks out the door, and his words knock me straight back into my seat.</p><p>Only . . . my seat is no longer there. It\u2019s still on the other side of my office and I\u2019m now on the floor.</p><p>Allysa rushes in and I\u2019m lying on my back behind my desk. \u201cLily?\u201d She runs around the desk and stands over me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I hold up a thumb. \u201cFine. Just missed my chair.\u201d</p><p>She reaches out her hand and helps me to my feet. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance at the door as I retrieve my chair. I take a seat and look down at my phone. \u201cNothing. He was just apologizing.\u201d</p><p>Allysa sighs longingly and looks back at the door. \u201cSo does that mean he doesn\u2019t want the job?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve got to hand it to her. Even in the midst of emotional turmoil, she can make me laugh. \u201cGet back to work before I dock your pay.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and makes to leave. I tap my pen against my desk and then say, \u201cAllysa. Wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says, cutting me off. \u201cRyle doesn\u2019t need to know about that visit. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She closes the door.</p><p>I reach down and pick up the bag with my three-year-old gift inside of it. I pull it out and can easily tell it\u2019s a book, wrapped in tissue paper. I tear the tissue paper away and fall against the back of my chair.</p><p>There\u2019s a picture of Ellen DeGeneres on the front. The title is Seriously . . . I\u2019m Kidding. I laugh and then open the book, gasping quietly when I see it\u2019s autographed. I run my fingers over the words of the inscription.</p> <p>Lily,</p><p>Atlas says just keep swimming.</p><p>\u2014Ellen DeGeneres</p><p>I run my finger over her signature. Then I drop the book on my desk, press my forehead against it, and fake cry against the cover.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>It\u2019s after seven before I get home. Ryle called an hour ago and said he wouldn\u2019t be coming over tonight. The confusher-cackle (whatever that big word he used was) separation was a success, but he\u2019s staying at the hospital overnight to make sure there aren\u2019t complications.</p> <p>I walk in the door to my quiet apartment. I change into my quiet pajamas. I eat a quiet sandwich. And then I lie down in my quiet bedroom and open my quiet new book, hoping it can quiet my emotions.</p><p>Sure enough, three hours and the majority of a book later, all the emotions from the last several days begin to seep out of me. I place a bookmark on the page where I stopped reading and I close it.</p><p>I stare at the book for a long time. I think about Ryle. I think about Atlas. I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.</p><p>I take the book Atlas bought me and put it in the closet with all my journals. Then I pick up the one that\u2019s filled with memories of him. And I know it\u2019s finally time to read the last entry I wrote. Then I can close the book for good.</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p><p>Most of the time I\u2019m thankful you don\u2019t know I exist and that I\u2019ve never really mailed you any of these things I write to you.</p><p>But sometimes, especially tonight, I wish you did. I just need someone to talk to about everything I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s been six months since I\u2019ve seen Atlas and I honestly don\u2019t know where he is or how he\u2019s doing. So much has happened since the last letter I wrote to you, when Atlas moved to Boston. I thought it was the last time I\u2019d see him for a while, but it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I saw him again after he left, several weeks later. It was my sixteenth birthday and when he showed up, it became the absolute best day of my life.</p> <p>And then the absolute worst.</p><p>It had been exactly forty-two days since Atlas left for Boston. I counted every day like it would help somehow. I was so depressed, Ellen. I still am. People say that teenagers don\u2019t know how to love like an adult. Part of me believes that, but I\u2019m not an adult and so I have nothing to compare it to. But I do believe it\u2019s probably different. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more substance in the love between two adults than there is between two teenagers. There\u2019s probably more maturity, more respect, more responsibility. But no matter how different the substance of a love might be at different ages in a person\u2019s life, I know that love still has to weigh the same. You feel that weight on your shoulders and in your stomach and on your heart no matter how old you are. And my feelings for Atlas are very heavy. Every night I cry myself to sleep and I whisper, \u201cJust keep swimming.\u201d But it gets really hard to swim when you feel like you\u2019re anchored in the water.</p><p>Now that I think about it, I\u2019ve probably been experiencing the stages of grief in a sense. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I was deep in the depression stage the night of my sixteenth birthday. My mother had tried to make the day a good one. She bought me gardening supplies, made my favorite cake, and the two of us went to dinner together. But by the time I had crawled into bed that night, I couldn\u2019t shake the sadness.</p><p>I was crying when I heard the tap on my window. At first, I thought it had started raining. But then I heard his voice. I jumped up and ran to the window, my heart in hysterics. He was standing there in the dark, smiling at me. I raised the window and helped him inside and he took me in his arms and held me there for so long while I cried.</p><p>He smelled so good. I could tell when I hugged him that he\u2019d put on some much-needed weight in just the six weeks since I\u2019d last seen him. He pulled back and wiped the tears off my cheeks. \u201cWhy are you crying, Lily?\u201d</p><p>I was embarrassed that I was crying. I cried a lot that month\u2014probably more than any other month of my life. It was probably just the hormones of being a teenage girl, mixed with the stress of how my father treated my mother, and then having to say goodbye to Atlas.</p><p>I grabbed a shirt from the floor and dried my eyes, then we sat down on the bed. He pulled me against his chest and leaned against my headboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still my favorite person. And I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>It was probably no later than ten o\u2019clock when he got there, but we talked so much, I remember it was after midnight the next time I looked at the clock. I can\u2019t even remember what all we talked about, but I do remember how I felt. He seemed so happy and there was a light in his eyes that I\u2019d never seen there before. Like he\u2019d finally found his home.</p><p>He said he wanted to tell me something and his voice grew serious. He readjusted me so that I was straddling his lap, because he wanted me to look him in the eyes when he told me. I was thinking maybe he was about to tell me he had a girlfriend or that he was leaving even sooner for the military. But what he said next shocked me.</p><p>He said the first night he went to that old house, he wasn\u2019t there because he needed a place to stay.</p> <p>He went there to kill himself.</p><p>My hands went up to my mouth because I had no idea things had gotten that bad for him. So bad that he didn\u2019t even want to live anymore.</p><p>\u201cI hope you never know what it\u2019s like to feel that lonely, Lily,\u201d he said.</p><p>He went on to tell me that the first night he was at that house, he was sitting in the living room floor with a razor blade to his wrist. Right when he was about to use it, my bedroom light went on. \u201cYou were standing there like an angel, backlit by the light of heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>He watched me walk around my bedroom for a while. Watched me lie on the bed and write in my journal. And he put down the razor blade because he said it\u2019d been a month since life had given him any sort of feeling at all, and looking at me gave him a little bit of feeling. Enough to not be numb enough to end things that night.</p> <p>Then a day or two later is when I took him the food and set it on his back porch. I guess you already know the rest of that story.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life, Lily,\u201d he said to me. \u201cAnd you weren\u2019t even trying.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed that spot between my shoulder and my neck that he always kisses. I liked that he did it again. I don\u2019t like much about my body, but that spot on my collarbone has become my favorite part of me.</p><p>He took my hands in his and told me he was leaving sooner than he planned for the military, but that he couldn\u2019t leave without telling me thank you. He told me he\u2019d be gone for four years and that the last thing he wanted for me was to be a sixteen-year-old girl not living my life because of a boyfriend I never got to see or hear from.</p><p>The next thing he said made his blue eyes tear up until they looked clear. He said, \u201cLily. Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn\u2019t waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.\u201d</p><p>I knew what he was saying. That he was leaving for the military and he didn\u2019t want me to hold on to him while he was gone. He wasn\u2019t really breaking up with me because we weren\u2019t ever really together. We\u2019d just been two people who helped each other when we needed it and got our hearts fused together along the way.</p> <p>It was hard, being let go by someone who had never really grabbed hold of me completely in the first place. In all the time we\u2019ve spent together, I think we both sort of knew this wasn\u2019t a forever thing. I\u2019m not sure why, because I could easily love him that way. I think maybe under normal circumstances, if we were together like typical teenagers and he had an average life with a home, we could be that kind of couple. The kind who comes together so easily and never experiences a life where cruelty sometimes intercepts.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even try to get him to change his mind that night. I feel like we have the kind of connection that even the fires of hell couldn\u2019t sever. I feel like he could go spend his time in the military and I\u2019ll spend my years being a teenager and then it will all fall back into place when the timing is right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a promise to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen my life is good enough for you to be a part of it, I\u2019ll come find you. But I don\u2019t want you to wait around for me, because that might never happen.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that promise, because it meant one of two things. Either he thought he might never make it out of the military alive, or he didn\u2019t think his life would ever be good enough for me.</p><p>His life was already good enough for me, but I nodded my head and forced a smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come back for me, I\u2019ll come for you. And it won\u2019t be pretty, Atlas Corrigan.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at my threat. \u201cWell, it won\u2019t be too hard to find me. You know exactly where I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWhere everything is better.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cIn Boston.\u201d</p> <p>And then he kissed me.</p><p>Ellen, I know you\u2019re an adult and know all about what comes next, but I still don\u2019t feel comfortable telling you what happened over those next couple of hours. Let\u2019s just say we both kissed a lot. We both laughed a lot. We both loved a lot. We both breathed a lot. A lot. And we both had to cover our mouths and be as quiet and still as we could so we wouldn\u2019t get caught.</p><p>When we were finished, he held me against him, skin to skin, hand to heart. He kissed me and looked straight in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lily. Everything you are. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I know those words get thrown around a lot, especially by teenagers. A lot of times prematurely and without much merit. But when he said them to me, I knew he wasn\u2019t saying it like he was in love with me. It wasn\u2019t that kind of \u201cI love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.</p><p>That was what Atlas was telling me when he said \u201cI love you.\u201d He was letting me know that I was the biggest wave he\u2019d ever come across. And I brought so much with me that my impressions would always be there, even when the tide rolled out.</p><p>After he said he loved me, he told me he had a birthday present for me. He pulled out a small brown bag. \u201cIt isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s all I could afford.\u201d</p><p>I opened the bag and pulled out the best present I\u2019d ever received. It was a magnet that said \u201cBoston\u201d on the top. At the bottom in tiny letters, it said \u201cWhere everything is better.\u201d I told him I would keep it forever, and every time I look at it I\u2019ll think of him.</p> <p>When I started out this letter, I said my sixteenth birthday was one of the best days of my life. Because up until that second, it was.</p><p>It was the next few minutes that weren\u2019t.</p><p>Before Atlas had shown up that night, I wasn\u2019t expecting him, so I didn\u2019t think to lock my bedroom door. My father heard me in there talking to someone, and when he threw open my door and saw Atlas in bed with me, he was angrier than I\u2019d ever seen him. And Atlas was at a disadvantage by not being prepared for what came next.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget that moment for as long as I live. Being completely helpless as my father came down on him with a baseball bat. The sound of bones snapping was the only thing piercing through my screams.</p><p>I still don\u2019t know who called the police. I\u2019m sure it was my mother, but it\u2019s been six months and we still haven\u2019t talked about that night. By the time the police got to my bedroom and pulled my father off of him, I didn\u2019t even recognize Atlas, he was covered in so much blood.</p> <p>I was hysterical.</p><p>Hysterical.</p><p>Not only did they have to take Atlas away in an ambulance, they also had to call an ambulance for me because I couldn\u2019t breathe. It was the first and only panic attack I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>No one would tell me where he was or if he was even okay. My father wasn\u2019t even arrested for what he\u2019d done. Word got out that Atlas had been staying in that old house and that he had been homeless. My father became revered for his heroic act\u2014saving his little girl from the homeless boy who manipulated her into having sex with him.</p><p>My father said I\u2019d shamed our whole family by giving the town something to gossip about. And let me tell you, they still gossip about it. I heard Katie on the bus today telling someone she tried to warn me about Atlas. She said she knew he was bad news from the moment she laid eyes on him. Which is crap. If Atlas had been on the bus with me, I probably would have kept my mouth shut and been mature about it like he tried to teach me to be. Instead, I was so angry, I turned around and told Katie she could go to hell. I told her Atlas was a better human than she\u2019d ever be and if I ever heard her say one more bad thing about him, she\u2019d regret it.</p><p>She just rolled her eyes and said, \u201cJesus, Lily. Did he brainwash you? He was a dirty, thieving homeless kid who was probably on drugs. He used you for food and sex and now you\u2019re defending him?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s lucky the bus stopped at my house right then. I grabbed my backpack and walked off the bus, then went inside and cried in my room for three hours straight. Now my head hurts, but I knew the only thing that would make me feel better is if I finally got it all out on paper. I\u2019ve been avoiding writing this letter for six months now.</p><p>No offense, Ellen, but my head still hurts. So does my heart. Maybe even more right now than it did yesterday. This letter didn\u2019t help one damn bit.</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to take a break from writing to you for a while. Writing to you reminds me of him, and it all hurts too much. Until he comes back for me, I\u2019m just going to keep pretending to be okay. I\u2019ll keep pretending to swim, when really all I\u2019m doing is floating. Barely keeping my head above water.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>I flip to the next page, but it\u2019s blank. That was the last time I ever wrote to Ellen.</p><p>I also never heard from Atlas again, and a huge part of me never blamed him. He almost died at the hands of my father. There\u2019s not much room for forgiveness there.</p><p>I knew he survived and that he was okay, because my curiosity has sometimes gotten the best of me over the years and I\u2019d find what I could about him online. There wasn\u2019t much, though. Enough to let me know he\u2019d survived and that he was in the military.</p><p>I still never got him out of my head, though. Time made things better, but sometimes I would see something that would remind me of him and it would put me in a funk. It wasn\u2019t until I was in college for a couple of years and dating someone else that I realized maybe Atlas wasn\u2019t supposed to be my whole life. Maybe he was only supposed to be a part of it.</p> <p>Maybe love isn\u2019t something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives.</p><p>On a particularly lonely night in college, I went alone to a tattoo studio and had a heart put in the spot where he used to kiss me. It\u2019s a tiny heart, about the size of a thumbprint, and it looks just like the heart he carved for me out of the oak tree. It\u2019s not fully closed at the top and I wonder if Atlas carved the heart like that on purpose. Because that\u2019s how my heart feels every time I think about him. It just feels like there\u2019s a little hole in it, letting out all the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After college I ended up moving to Boston, not necessarily because I was hoping to find him, but because I had to see for myself if Boston really was better. Plethora held nothing for me anyway, and I wanted to get as far away from my father as I could. Even though he was sick and could no longer hurt my mother, he still somehow made me want to escape the entire state of Maine, so that\u2019s exactly what I did.</p><p>Seeing Atlas in his restaurant for the first time filled me with so many emotions, I didn\u2019t know how to process them. I was glad to see that he was okay. I was happy that he looked healthy. But I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little bit heartbroken that he never tried to find me like he promised.</p><p>I love him. I still do and I always will. He was a huge wave that left a lot of imprints on my life, and I\u2019ll feel the weight of that love until I die. I\u2019ve accepted that.</p><p>But things are different now. After today when he walked out of my office, I thought long and hard about us. I think our lives are where they\u2019re supposed to be. I have Ryle. Atlas has his girlfriend. We both have the careers we\u2019d always hoped for. Just because we didn\u2019t end up on the same wave, doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t still a part of the same ocean.</p> <p>Things with Ryle are still fairly new, but I feel that same depth with him that I used to feel with Atlas. He loves me just like Atlas did. And I know if Atlas had a chance to get to know him, he would be able to see that and he\u2019d be happy for me.</p><p>Sometimes an unexpected wave comes along, sucks you up and refuses to spit you back out. Ryle is my unexpected tidal wave, and right now I\u2019m skimming the beautiful surface.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I think I might throw up.\u201d</p> <p>Ryle puts his thumb under my chin and tilts my face up to his. He grins at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Stop freaking out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my hands out and bounce up and down inside the elevator. \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d I say. \u201cEverything you and Allysa have told me about your mother makes me so nervous.\u201d My eyes widen and I bring my hands up to my mouth. \u201cOh, God, Ryle. What if she asks me questions about Jesus? I don\u2019t go to church. I mean, I read the Bible when I was younger, but I don\u2019t know answers to any Bible trivia questions.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s really laughing now. He pulls me to him and kisses the side of my head. \u201cShe won\u2019t talk about Jesus. She already loves you, based on what I\u2019ve told her. All you have to do is be you, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I start nodding. \u201cBe me. Okay. I think I can pretend to be me for one evening. Right?\u201d</p><p>The doors open and he walks me out of the elevator, toward Allysa\u2019s apartment. It\u2019s funny watching him knock, but I guess he technically doesn\u2019t live here anymore. Over the last few months, he just sort of slowly began staying with me. All of his clothes are at my apartment. His toiletries. Last week he even hung that ridiculous blurry photograph of me up in our bedroom, and it really felt official after that.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know we live together?\u201d I ask him. \u201cIs she okay with that? I mean, we aren\u2019t married. She goes to church every Sunday. Oh, no, Ryle! What if your mother thinks I\u2019m a blasphemous whore?\u201d</p> <p>Ryle nudges his head toward the apartment door and I spin around to see his mother standing in the doorway, a layer of shock on her face.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Ryle says. \u201cMeet Lily. My blasphemous whore.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God.</p><p>His mother reaches for me and pulls me in for a hug, and her laughter is everything I need to get me through this moment. \u201cLily!\u201d she says, pushing me out to arm\u2019s length so she can get a good look at me. \u201cSweetie, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a blasphemous whore. You\u2019re the angel I\u2019ve been praying would land in Ryle\u2019s lap for the last ten years!\u201d</p><p>She ushers us into the apartment. Ryle\u2019s father is the next to greet me with a hug. \u201cNo, definitely not a blasphemous whore,\u201d he says. \u201cNot like Marshall here, who sank his teeth into my little girl when she was only seventeen.\u201d He glares back at Marshall, who is sitting on the couch.</p><p>Marshall laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Dr. Kincaid, because Allysa was the one who sank her teeth into me first. My teeth were in another girl who tasted like Cheetos and . . .\u201d</p><p>Marshall doubles over when Allysa elbows him in the side.</p><p>And just like that, every single fear I had has vanished. They\u2019re perfect. They\u2019re normal. They say whore and laugh at Marshall\u2019s jokes.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.</p><p>Three hours later, I\u2019m lying on Allysa\u2019s bed with her. Their parents went to bed early, claiming jet lag. Ryle and Marshall are in the living room, watching sports. I have my hand on Allysa\u2019s stomach, waiting to feel the baby kick.</p><p>\u201cHer feet are right here,\u201d she says, moving my hand over a few inches. \u201cGive it a few seconds. She\u2019s really active tonight.\u201d</p><p>We remain quiet while we both wait for her to kick. When it happens, I squeal with laughter. \u201cOh my God! It\u2019s like an alien!\u201d</p><p>Allysa holds her hands on her stomach, smiling. \u201cThese last two and a half months are going to be hell,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so ready to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I can\u2019t wait to be an aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you and Ryle to have a baby,\u201d she says.</p><p>I fall onto my back and put my hands behind my bed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he wants any. We\u2019ve never really talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t want any,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will. He didn\u2019t want a relationship before you. He didn\u2019t want to get married before you, and I feel a proposal coming on any month now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I prop my head up on my hand and face her. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely been together six months. Pretty sure he wants to wait a lot longer than that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t push things with Ryle when it comes to speeding things up in our relationship. Our lives are perfect how they are. We\u2019re too busy for a wedding anyway, so I don\u2019t mind if he wants to wait a lot longer.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Allysa presses. \u201cWould you say yes if he proposed?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAre you kidding me? Of course. I\u2019d marry him tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa looks over my shoulder at her bedroom door. She purses her lips together and tries to hide her smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s standing in the doorway, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cHe heard me say that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nods again.</p> <p>I roll onto my back and look at Ryle, propped up against the doorframe with his arms folded over his chest. I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking after hearing that. His expression is tight. His jaw is tight. His eyes are narrowed in my direction.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says with stoic composure. \u201cI would marry the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>His words make me smile the most embarrassing, widest smile, so I pull a pillow over my face. \u201cWhy, thank you, Ryle,\u201d I say, my words muffled by the pillow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet,\u201d I hear Allysa say. \u201cMy brother is actually sweet.\u201d</p><p>The pillow is pulled away from me and Ryle is standing over me, holding it at his side. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>My heart begins to beat faster. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p> <p>He nods. \u201cI took the weekend off because my parents are in town. You have people who can run your store for you. Let\u2019s go to Vegas and get married.\u201d</p><p>Allysa sits up on the bed. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d she says. \u201cLily\u2019s a girl. She wants a real wedding with flowers and bridesmaids and shit.\u201d</p><p>Ryle looks back at me. \u201cDo you want a real wedding with flowers and bridesmaids and shit?\u201d</p><p>I think about it for a second.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The three of us are quiet for a moment, and then Allysa starts kicking her legs up and down on the bed, giddy with excitement. \u201cThey\u2019re getting married!\u201d she yells. She rolls off the bed and rushes toward the living room. \u201cMarshall, pack our bags! We\u2019re going to Vegas!\u201d</p><p>Ryle reaches down and grabs my hand, pulling me to a stand. He\u2019s smiling, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing this unless I know for sure he wants it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this, Ryle?\u201d</p> <p>He runs his hands through my hair and pulls my face to his, brushing his lips against mine. \u201cNaked truth,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be your husband, I could piss my damn pants.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been six weeks Mom, you gotta get over it.\u201d</p><p>My mother sighs into the phone. \u201cYou\u2019re my only daughter. I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019ve been dreaming about your wedding your whole life.\u201d</p><p>She still hasn\u2019t forgiven me, even though she was there. We called her right before Allysa booked our flights. We forced her out of bed, we forced Ryle\u2019s parents out of bed, and then we forced them all on a midnight flight to Vegas. She didn\u2019t try to talk me out of it because I\u2019m sure she could tell that Ryle and I had made up our minds by the time she made it to the airport. But she hasn\u2019t let me forget it. She\u2019s been dreaming of a huge wedding and dress shopping and cake tasting since the day I was born.</p><p>I kick my feet up on the couch. \u201cHow about I make it up to you?\u201d I say to her. \u201cWhat if, whenever we decide to have a baby, I promise to do it the natural way and not buy one in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>My mom laughs. Then she sighs. \u201cAs long as you give me grandchildren someday, I guess I can get over it.\u201d</p><p>Ryle and I talked about kids on the flight to Vegas. I wanted to make sure that possibility was open for discussion in our future before I made a commitment to spend the rest of my life with him. He said it was definitely open for discussion. Then we cleared the air about a lot of other things that might cause problems down the road. I told him I wanted separate checking accounts, but since he makes more money than me, he has to buy me lots of presents all the time to keep me happy. He agreed. He made me promise him I\u2019d never become vegan. That was a simple promise. I love cheese too much. I told him we had to start some kind of charity, or at least donate to the ones Marshall and Allysa like. He said he already does, and that made me want to marry him even sooner. He made me promise to vote. He said I was allowed to vote Democratic, Republican, or Independent, as long as I made sure to vote. We shook on it.</p><p>By the time we landed in Vegas, we were completely on the same page.</p><p>I hear the front door unlocking so I flip onto my back. \u201cGotta go,\u201d I say to my mother. \u201cRyle just got home.\u201d He closes the door behind him and then I grin and say, \u201cWait. Let me rephrase that, Mom. My husband just got home.\u201d</p><p>My mother laughs and tells me goodbye. I hang up with her and toss my phone aside. I bring my arm up above my head and rest it lazily against the arm of the couch. Then I prop my leg over the back of it, letting my skirt slide down my thighs and pool at my waist. Ryle drags his eyes up my body, grinning as he makes his way over to me. He drops to his knees on the couch and slowly crawls up my body.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my wife?\u201d he whispers, planting kisses all around my mouth. He presses himself between my legs and I let my head fall back as he kisses down my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is the life.</p><p>We both work almost every day. He works twice as many hours as I do and he only gets home before I\u2019m in bed two or three nights a week. But the nights we actually do get to spend together, I tend to want him to spend those nights buried deep inside me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t complain.</p><p>He finds a spot on my neck and he claims it, kissing it so hard it hurts. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p> <p>He lowers himself on top of me and mutters into my neck. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a hickey. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, but I let him. My hair is long enough that I can cover it, and I\u2019ve never had a hickey before.</p><p>His lips remain in the same spot, sucking and kissing until I can no longer feel the sting. He\u2019s pressed against me, bulging against his scrubs. I move my hands and shove his scrubs down far enough so that he can slide inside of me. He continues kissing my neck as he takes me right there on the couch.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He took a shower first, and as soon as he got out, I jumped in. I told him we needed to wash the smell of sex off of us before we had dinner with Allysa and Marshall.</p> <p>Allysa is due in a few weeks, so she\u2019s forcing as much couple time on us as she can. She\u2019s worried we\u2019ll stop coming to visit after the baby is born, which I know is ridiculous. The visits will just grow more frequent. I already love my niece more than any of them, anyway.</p><p>Okay, maybe not. But it\u2019s close.</p><p>I try to avoid getting my hair wet as I rinse off, because we\u2019re already running late. I grab my razor and press it under my arm when I hear a crash. I pause.</p><p>\u201cRyle?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I finish shaving and then wash the soap off. Another crash.</p> <p>What in the world is he doing?</p><p>I turn off the water and grab a towel, running it over myself. \u201cRyle!\u201d</p><p>He still doesn\u2019t respond. I pull my jeans on in a hurry and open the door as I\u2019m pulling my shirt over my head. \u201cRyle?\u201d</p><p>The nightstand by our bed is tipped over. I move to the living room and see him sitting on the edge of the couch, his head in one of his hands. He\u2019s looking down at something in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me and I don\u2019t recognize his expression. I\u2019m confused by what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know if he just got bad news or . . . Oh, God. Allysa.</p><p>\u201cRyle, you\u2019re scaring me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He holds up my phone and just looks at me like I should know what\u2019s happening. When I shake my head in confusion, he holds up a piece of paper. \u201cFunny thing,\u201d he says, setting my phone on the coffee table in front of him. \u201cI dropped your phone by accident. Cover pops off. I find this number hidden in the back of it.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>He crumbles the number in his fist. \u201cI thought, \u2018Huh. That\u2019s weird. Lily doesn\u2019t hide things from me.\u2019 \u201d He stands up and picks up my phone. \u201cSo I called it.\u201d He tightens his fist around the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky I got his fucking voice mail.\u201d He chunks my phone clear across the room and it crashes against the wall, shattering to the floor.</p><p>There\u2019s a three-second pause where I think this could go one of two ways.</p><p>He\u2019s going to leave me.</p><p>Or he\u2019s going to hurt me.</p><p>He runs a hand through his hair and walks straight for the door.</p><p>He leaves.</p><p>\u201cRyle!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Why did I never throw that number away?!</p><p>I open the door and run after him. He\u2019s taking the stairs two at a time, and I finally reach him when he\u2019s at the landing of the second floor. I shove myself in front of him and grab his shirt in my fists. \u201cRyle, please. Let me explain.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my wrists and pushes me away from him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>I feel his hands on me. Gentle. Steady.</p><p>Tears are flowing and for some reason, they sting.</p><p>\u201cLily, be still. Please.\u201d</p><p>His voice is soothing. My head hurts. \u201cRyle?\u201d I try to open my eyes, but the light is too bright. I can feel a sting at the corner of my eye and I wince. I try to sit up, but I feel his hand press down on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be still until I\u2019m finished, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes again and look up at the ceiling. It\u2019s our bedroom ceiling. \u201cFinished with what?\u201d My mouth hurts when I speak, so I bring my hand up and cover it.</p><p>\u201cYou fell down the stairs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>My eyes meet his. There\u2019s concern in them, but also hurt. Anger. He\u2019s feeling everything right now, and the only thing I feel is confused.</p><p>I close my eyes again and try to remember why he\u2019s angry. Why he\u2019s hurt.</p><p>My phone.</p><p>Atlas\u2019s number.</p><p>The stairwell.</p><p>I grabbed his shirt.</p><p>He pushed me away.</p><p>\u201cYou fell down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>But I didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>He pushed me. Again.</p><p>That\u2019s twice.</p><p>You pushed me, Ryle.</p><p>I can feel my whole body start to shake with the sobs. I have no idea how bad I\u2019m hurt, but I don\u2019t even care. No physical pain could even compare to what my heart is feeling in this moment. I start to slap at his hands, wanting him away from me. I feel him lift off the bed as I curl up into a ball.</p><p>I wait for him to try and soothe it out like he did the last time he hurt me, but it never comes. I hear him walking around our bedroom. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m still crying when he kneels down in front of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou might have a concussion,\u201d he says, matter-of-fact. \u201cYou have a small cut on your lip.

Right after I found out what a fucking liar I married.\u201d He places something on my pillow next to me. \u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m sure you can call this number.\u201d</p><p>I look at the crumpled up piece of paper by my head that holds Atlas\u2019s phone number.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I sob.</p><p>What is happening?</p> <p>I hear the front door slam.</p><p>My whole world comes crashing down around me.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I whisper to no one. I cover my face with my hands and I cry harder than I\u2019ve ever cried. I am destroyed.</p><p>Five minutes.</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes to completely destroy a person.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>A few minutes pass.</p><p>Ten, maybe?</p><p>I can\u2019t stop crying. I still haven\u2019t moved from the bed. I\u2019m scared to look in the mirror. I\u2019m just . . . scared.</p><p>I hear the front door open and slam shut again. Ryle appears in the doorway and I have no idea if I\u2019m supposed to hate him.</p><p>Or be terrified of him.</p><p>Or feel bad for him.</p><p>How can I be feeling all three?</p><p>He presses his forehead to our bedroom door and I watch as he hits his head against it. Once. Twice. Three times.</p> <p>He turns and rushes at me, falling to his knees at the side of the bed. He grabs both of my hands and he squeezes them. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, his whole face twisting in pain. \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s nothing.\u201d He brings his hand to the side of my head and I can feel his hands shaking. \u201cI can\u2019t take this, I can\u2019t.\u201d He leans forward and presses his lips hard against my forehead, then rests his forehead against mine. \u201cPlease tell me you aren\u2019t seeing him. Please.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure I can tell him that because I don\u2019t even want to speak.</p><p>He stays pressed against me, his hand wrapped tightly in my hair. \u201cIt hurts so much, Lily. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wanting the truth out of me so he\u2019ll see what a huge mistake he just made. \u201cI forgot his number was even there,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cThe day after the fight in the restaurant . . . he came to the store. You can ask Allysa. He was only there for five minutes. He took my phone from me and he put his number inside of it, because he didn\u2019t believe I was safe with you. I forgot it was there, Ryle. I\u2019ve never even looked at it.\u201d</p><p>He breathes out a shaky breath and begins nodding with relief. \u201cYou swear, Lily? You swear on our marriage and our lives and on everything that you are that you haven\u2019t spoken to him since that day?\u201d He pulls back so he can look me in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI swear, Ryle. You overreacted before giving me the chance to explain,\u201d I say to him. \u201cNow get the fuck out of my apartment.\u201d</p><p>My words knock the breath from him. I see it happen. His back meets the wall behind him and he stares at me silently. In shock. \u201cLily,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou fell down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s trying to convince me or himself.</p><p>I calmly repeat myself. \u201cGet out of my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He remains frozen in place. I sit up on the bed. My hand immediately goes to the throbbing in my eye. He pushes himself up off the floor. When he takes a step forward, I scoot back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt, Lily. I\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>I grab one of my pillows and throw it at him, like it could actually do damage. \u201cGet out!\u201d I yell. He catches the pillow. I grab the other one and stand up on the bed and start swinging it at him as I scream, \u201cGet out! Get out! Get out!\u201d</p><p>I toss the pillow on the floor after the front door slams shut.</p><p>I run to the living room and dead-bolt the door.</p><p>I run back to my bedroom and fall onto my bed. The same bed I share with my husband. The same bed he makes love to me on.</p><p>The same bed he lays me on when it\u2019s time for him to clean up his messes.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>I tried salvaging my phone before I fell asleep last night, but it was no use. It was in two completely separate pieces. I set my alarm so I could get up early and stop and get a new one on my way in to work today.</p><p>My face doesn\u2019t look as bad as I feared it would. Of course, it\u2019s not something I could hide from Allysa, but I\u2019m not even going to try and do that. I part my hair to the side to cover up most of the bandage Ryle had placed over my eye. The only thing visible from last night is the cut on my lip.</p><p>And the hickey he gave me on my neck.</p><p>Fucking irony at its best.</p><p>I grab my purse and open the front door. I stop short when I see the lump at my feet.</p><p>It moves.</p><p>It\u2019s several seconds before I realize that lump is actually Ryle. He slept out here?</p><p>He pulls himself to his feet as soon as he realizes I\u2019ve opened the door. He\u2019s in front of me, pleading eyes, gentle hands on my cheeks. Lips on my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and scroll my eyes over him. He slept out here?</p><p>I step out of my apartment and pull my door shut. I calmly walk past him and down the stairs. He follows me the entire way to my car, begging me to talk to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>I leave.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It\u2019s an hour later when I have a new phone in my hands. I\u2019m sitting in my car at the cell phone store when I turn it on. I watch the screen as seventeen messages appear. All from Allysa.</p> <p>I guess it would make sense that Ryle didn\u2019t call me all night, since he knew what kind of shape my phone was in.</p><p>I start to open a text message when my phone begins ringing. It\u2019s Allysa.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavily, and then, \u201cLily! What in the hell is going on? Oh my God, you can\u2019t do this to me, I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d</p><p>I start my car and set the phone to Bluetooth while I drive toward the store. Allysa is off today. She\u2019s only got a few days left before she gets a jump start on her maternity leave.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I tell her. \u201cRyle is okay. We got into a fight. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t call you, he broke my phone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment, and then, \u201cHe did? Are you okay? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Heading to work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m almost there myself.\u201d</p><p>I start to protest, but she hangs up before I have the chance.</p><p>By the time I make it to the store, she\u2019s already there.</p> <p>I open the front door, ready to field questions and defend my reasons for kicking her brother out of my apartment. But I stop short when I see the two of them standing at the counter. Ryle is leaning against it and Allysa has her hands on top of his, saying something to him that I can\u2019t hear.</p><p>They both turn to face me when they hear the door close behind me.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d Allysa whispers. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d She walks around the counter and pulls me in for a hug. \u201cOh, Lily,\u201d she says, running her hand down my back. She pulls back with tears in her eyes, and her reaction confuses me. She obviously knows Ryle is responsible, but if that\u2019s the case, it seems she would be attacking him, or at least yelling.</p><p>She turns back to Ryle and he\u2019s looking up at me apologetically. Longingly. Like he wants to reach out and hug me, but he\u2019s scared to death to touch me. He should be.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell her,\u201d Allysa says to Ryle.</p><p>He instantly drops his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d Allysa says, her voice angrier now. \u201cShe has the right to know, Ryle. She\u2019s your wife. If you don\u2019t tell her, I will.\u201d</p><p>Ryle\u2019s shoulders roll forward and his head is fully pressed against the counter now. Whatever it is Allysa wants him to tell me has him so agonized, he can\u2019t even look at me. I clench my stomach, feeling the angst deeper than my soul.</p> <p>Allysa spins toward me and puts her hands on my shoulders. \u201cHear him out,\u201d she begs. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to forgive him, because I have no idea what happened last night. But just please, as my sister-in-law and my best friend, give my brother a chance to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Allysa said she\u2019d watch the store for the next hour until another employee comes in for their shift. I was still so upset with Ryle, I didn\u2019t want him in the same car with me. He said he\u2019d send for an Uber and meet me at my apartment.</p><p>My entire drive home I agonized over what he could possibly need to tell me that Allysa already knows. So many things went through my head. Is he dying? Has he been cheating on me? Did he lose his job? She didn\u2019t seem to know the details of what happened between us last night, so I have no idea how this relates to that.</p><p>Ryle finally walks through my front door ten minutes after me. I\u2019m sitting on the couch, nervously picking at my nails.</p><p>I stand up and start to pace as he slowly walks to the chair and takes a seat. He leans forward, clasping his hands in front of him.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Lily.\u201d</p><p>He says it pleadingly, like he can\u2019t take seeing me worry. I return to my seat on the couch, but I scoot to the arm, pull my feet up, and bring my hands to my mouth. \u201cAre you dying?\u201d</p><p>His eyes stretch wide and he immediately shakes his head. \u201cNo. No. It\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>I just want him to spit it out. My hands are starting to shake. He sees how much he\u2019s freaking me out, so he leans forward and pulls my hands from my face, holding them in his. Part of me doesn\u2019t want him touching me after what he did last night, but a piece of me needs the reassurance from him. The anticipation of what I\u2019m about to find out is making me nauseous.</p><p>\u201cNo one is dying. I\u2019m not cheating on you. What I\u2019m about to tell you isn\u2019t going to hurt you, okay? It\u2019s all in the past. But Allysa thinks you need to know. And . . . so do I.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he releases my hands. He\u2019s the one up and pacing now, back and forth behind the coffee table. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s having to work up the courage to find his own words and that\u2019s making me even more nervous.</p><p>He sits in the chair again. \u201cLily? Do you remember the night we met?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou remember when I walked out onto the roof? How angry I was?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. He was kicking the chair. It was before he knew marine-grade polymer was virtually indestructible.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember my naked truth? What I told you about that night and what caused me to be so angry?\u201d</p><p>I lean my head down and think back to that night and to all the truths he told me. He said marriage repulsed him. He was only into one-night stands. He never wanted to have kids. He was mad about a patient he\u2019d lost that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I start nodding. \u201cThe little boy,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you were mad, because a little boy died and it upset you.\u201d</p><p>He blows out a quick breath of relief. \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I was mad.\u201d He stands up again and it\u2019s like I see his entire soul crumble. He presses his palms against his eyes and fights back tears. \u201cWhen I told you about what happened to him, do you remember what you said to me?\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m about to cry and I don\u2019t even know why yet. \u201cYes. I told you I couldn\u2019t imagine what something like that will do to that little boy\u2019s brother. The one who accidentally shot him.\u201d My lips start to tremble. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you said, \u2018It\u2019ll destroy him for life, that\u2019s what it\u2019ll do.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Where is he going with this?</p><p>Ryle walks over and drops down to his knees in front of me. \u201cLily,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew it would destroy him. I knew exactly what that little boy was feeling . . . because that\u2019s what happened to me. To Allysa\u2019s and my older brother . . .\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hold in the tears. I just start crying and he wraps his arms tightly around my waist and lays his head on my lap. \u201cI shot him, Lily. My best friend. My big brother. I was only six years old. I didn\u2019t even know I was holding a real gun.\u201d</p><p>His whole body begins to shake and he grips me even tighter. I press a kiss into his hair because it feels like he\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. Just like that night on the roof. And while I\u2019m still so angry at him, I also still love him and it absolutely kills me to find this out about him. About Allysa. We sit quietly for a long time\u2014his head on my lap, his arms around my waist, my lips in his hair.</p><p>\u201cShe was only five when it happened. Emerson was seven. We were in the garage, so no one heard our screams for a long time. And I just sat there, and . . .\u201d</p><p>He pulls away from my lap and stands up, facing the other direction. After a long stretch of silence he sits down on the couch and leans forward. \u201cI was trying to . . .\u201d Ryle\u2019s face contorts in pain and he lowers his head, covering it with his hands, shaking it back and forth. \u201cI was trying to put everything back inside his head. I thought I could fix him, Lily.\u201d</p><p>My hand flies up to my mouth. I gasp so loudly, there\u2019s no way to hide it.</p><p>I have to stand up so I can catch a breath.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>I still can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Ryle walks over to me, taking my hands and pulling me to him. We hug each other for a solid minute when he says, \u201cI would never tell you this because I want it to excuse my behavior.\u201d He pulls back and looks me firmly in the eyes. \u201cYou have to believe that. Allysa wanted me to tell you all of this because since that happened, there are things I can\u2019t control. I get angry. I black out. I\u2019ve been in therapy since I was six years old. But it is not my excuse. It is my reality.\u201d</p><p>He wipes away my tears, cradling my head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhen you ran after me last night, I swear I had no intention of hurting you. I was upset and angry. And sometimes when I feel that much emotion, something inside of me just snaps. I don\u2019t remember the moment I pushed you. But I know I did. I did. All I was thinking when you were running after me was how I needed to get away from you. I wanted you out of my way. I didn\u2019t process that there were stairs around us. I didn\u2019t process my strength compared to yours. I fucked up, Lily. I fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his mouth to my ear. His voice cracks when he says, \u201cYou are my wife. I\u2019m supposed to be the one who protects you from the monsters. I\u2019m not supposed to be one.\u201d He holds me with so much desperation, he begins to shake. I have never, in all my life, felt so much pain radiating from one human.</p><p>It breaks me. It rips me apart from the inside out. All my heart wants to do is wrap tightly around his.</p><p>But even with everything he just told me, I\u2019m still fighting my own forgiveness. I swore I wouldn\u2019t let it happen again. I swore to him and to myself that if he ever hurt me again, I would leave.</p><p>I pull away from him, unable to look him in the eye. I walk toward my bedroom to try and take a moment to just catch my breath. I close my bathroom door behind me and grip the sink, but I can\u2019t even stand up. I end up sliding to the floor in a heap of tears.</p><p>This isn\u2019t how this was supposed to be. My whole life, I knew exactly what I\u2019d do if a man ever treated me the way my father treated my mother. It was simple. I would leave and it would never happen again.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t leave. And now, here I am with bruises and cuts on my body at the hands of the man who is supposed to love me. At the hands of my own husband.</p> <p>And still, I\u2019m trying to justify what happened.</p><p>It was an accident. He thought I was cheating on him. He was hurt and angry and I got in his way.</p><p>I bring my hands to my face and I sob, because I feel more pain for that man out there, knowing what he went through as a child, than I feel for myself. And that doesn\u2019t make me feel selfless or strong. It makes me feel pathetic and weak. I\u2019m supposed to hate him. I\u2019m supposed to be the woman my mother was never strong enough to be.</p><p>But if I\u2019m emulating my mother\u2019s behavior, then that would mean Ryle is emulating my father\u2019s behavior. But he isn\u2019t. I have to stop comparing us to them. We\u2019re our own individuals in an entirely different situation. My father never had an excuse for his anger, nor was he immediately apologetic. The way he treated my mother was much worse than what\u2019s happened between Ryle and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryle just opened up to me in a way that he\u2019s probably never opened up to anyone. He\u2019s struggling to be a better person for me.</p><p>Yes, he screwed up last night. But he\u2019s here and he\u2019s trying to make me understand his past and why he reacted the way he did. Humans aren\u2019t perfect and I can\u2019t let the only example I\u2019ve ever witnessed of marriage weigh in on my own marriage.</p><p>I wipe my eyes and pull myself up. When I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t see my mother. I just see me. I see a girl who loves her husband and wants more than anything to be able to help him. I know Ryle and I are strong enough to move past this. Our love is strong enough to get us through this.</p><p>I walk out of the bathroom and back into the living room. Ryle stands up and faces me, his face full of fear. He\u2019s scared I\u2019m not going to forgive him, and I\u2019m not sure that I do forgive him. But an act doesn\u2019t have to be forgiven in order to learn from it.</p> <p>I walk over to him and I grab both of his hands in mine. I speak to him with nothing but naked truth.</p><p>\u201cRemember what you said to me on the roof that night? You said, \u2018There is no such thing as bad people. We\u2019re all just people who sometimes do bad things.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He nods and squeezes my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a bad person, Ryle. I know that. You can still protect me. When you\u2019re upset, just walk away. And I\u2019ll walk away. We\u2019ll leave the situation until you\u2019re calm enough to talk about it, okay? You are not a monster, Ryle. You\u2019re only human. And as humans, we can\u2019t expect to shoulder all of our pain. Sometimes we have to share it with the people who love us so we don\u2019t come crashing down from the weight of it all. But I can\u2019t help you unless I know you need it. Ask me for help. We\u2019ll get through this, I know we can.\u201d</p><p>He exhales what feels like every breath he\u2019s been holding in since last night. He wraps his arms tightly around me and buries his face in my hair. \u201cHelp me, Lily,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI need you to help me.\u201d</p> <p>He holds me against him and I know deep in my heart that I\u2019m doing the right thing. There is so much more good in him than bad, and I\u2019ll do whatever I can to convince him of that until he can see it, too.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading out. You need me to do anything else?\u201d</p><p>I look up from the paperwork and shake my head. \u201cThank you, Serena. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She nods and walks away, leaving the door to my office open.</p><p>Allysa\u2019s last day was two weeks ago. She\u2019s due any day now. I have two other full-time employees, Serena and Lucy.</p> <p>Yes. That Lucy.</p><p>She\u2019s been married for a couple of months now and came in looking for a job two weeks ago. It\u2019s actually worked out pretty well. She keeps herself busy, and if I\u2019m here when she is, I just keep my office door shut so I don\u2019t have to listen to her sing.</p><p>It\u2019s been almost a month since the incident on the stairs. Even with everything Ryle told me about his childhood, the forgiveness was still hard to come by.</p><p>I know Ryle has a temper. I saw it the first night we met, before we ever even spoke a word to each other. I saw it that awful night in my kitchen. I saw it when he found the phone number in my phone case.</p><p>But I also see the difference between Ryle and my father. Ryle is compassionate. He does things my father never would have done. He donates to charity, he cares about other people, he puts me before everything. Ryle would never in a million years make me park in the driveway while he took the garage.</p><p>I have to remind myself of those things. Sometimes the girl inside of me\u2014the daughter of my father\u2014is really opinionated. She tells me I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven him. She tells me I should have left the first time. And sometimes I believe that voice. But then the side of me that knows Ryle understands that marriages aren\u2019t perfect. Sometimes there are moments that both parties regret. And I wonder how I\u2019d feel about myself had I just left him after that first incident. He never should have pushed me, but I also did things I wasn\u2019t proud of. And if I\u2019d have just left, would that not be going against our marriage vows? For better or for worse. I refuse to give up on my marriage that easily.</p><p>I am a strong woman. I\u2019ve been around abusive situations my whole life. I will never become my mother. I believe that a hundred percent. And Ryle will never become my father. I think we needed what happened on the stairwell to happen so that I would know his past and we\u2019d be able to work on it together.</p><p>Last week we got into another fight.</p> <p>I was scared. The other two fights we\u2019d gotten into did not end well, and I knew this would be a testament to whether or not our agreement for me to help him through his anger would work.</p><p>We were discussing his career. He\u2019s finished with his residency now and there\u2019s a three-month specialized course in Cambridge, England, he applied for. He\u2019ll find out soon if he was approved, but that\u2019s not why I was upset. It\u2019s a great opportunity and I\u2019d never ask him not to go. Three months is nothing with how busy we are, so that wasn\u2019t even what got me so upset. I became upset when he discussed what he wanted to do after the Cambridge trip was over.</p><p>He was offered a job in Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic and he wants us to move there. He said Mass General is rated the second best neurological hospital in the world. Mayo Clinic is number one.</p><p>He said he never intended to stay in Boston forever. I told him that would have been a good subject to bring up when we discussed our futures on the flight to get married in Vegas. I can\u2019t leave Boston. My mother lives here. Allysa lives here. He told me it was only a five-hour flight and that we could visit as often as we wanted. I told him it was pretty hard to run a floral business when you live several states away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fight continued to escalate and both of us were getting angrier by the second. At one point, he knocked a vase full of flowers off the table and onto the floor. We both just stared at them for a moment. I was scared, wondering if I had made the right decision to stay. To trust that we could work on his anger issues together. He took a deep breath and he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to leave for an hour or two. I think I need to walk away. When I get back, we\u2019ll continue this discussion.\u201d</p><p>He walked out the door and, true to his word, he came back an hour later when he was much calmer. He dropped his keys on the table and then walked straight to where I was standing. He took my face in his hands and he said, \u201cI told you I wanted to be the best in my field, Lily. I told you this the first night we ever met. It was one of my naked truths. But if I have to choose between working at the best hospital in the world and making my wife happy . . . I choose you. You are my success. As long as you\u2019re happy, I don\u2019t care where I work. We\u2019ll stay in Boston.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew that I had made the right choice. Everyone deserves another chance. Especially the people who mean the most to you.</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since that fight and he hasn\u2019t mentioned moving again. I feel bad, like I thwarted his plans in some way, but marriage is about compromise. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s best for the couple as a whole, not individually. And staying in Boston is better for everyone in both of our families.</p> <p>Speaking of families, I look over at my phone right as a text from Allysa comes through.</p><p>Allysa: Are you finished up at work yet? I need your opinion on furniture.</p><p>Me: Be there in fifteen minutes.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the impending delivery or the fact that she\u2019s not currently working, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve spent more time at her house this week than I have at my own. I close up the shop and head toward her apartment.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>When I step off the elevator, there\u2019s a note taped to her apartment door. I see my name written across it, so I pull it off the door.</p><p>Lily,</p><p>On the seventh floor. Apartment 749.</p><p>\u2014A</p><p>She has an apartment here just for extra furniture? I know they\u2019re rich, but even that seems a little excessive for them. I get on the elevator and press the button for the seventh floor. When the doors open, I head down the hall toward apartment 749. When I reach it, I have no idea if I should knock or just go inside. For all I know, someone could live here. Probably one of her people.</p><p>I knock on the door and hear footsteps from the other side.</p> <p>I\u2019m shocked when the door swings open and Ryle is standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He grins and leans against the doorframe. \u201cI live here. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I glance at the pewter number plate next to the door and then back at him. \u201cWhat do you mean you live here? I thought you lived with me. You\u2019ve had your own apartment this whole time?\u201d I would think an entire apartment would be something a husband would bring up to his wife at some point. It\u2019s a little unnerving.</p><p>Actually, it\u2019s ludicrous and deceptive. I think I might be really angry at him right now.</p><p>Ryle laughs and pushes off the doorframe. Now he\u2019s filling up the entire doorway as he lifts his hands to the frame over his head and grips it. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had a chance to tell you about this apartment, considering I just signed the paperwork on it this morning.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back. \u201cWait. What?\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my hand and pulls me inside the apartment. \u201cWelcome home, Lily.\u201d</p> <p>I pause in the foyer.</p><p>Yes. I said foyer. There is a foyer.</p><p>\u201cYou bought an apartment?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly, gauging my reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou bought an apartment,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>He\u2019s still nodding. \u201cI did. Is that okay? I figured since we live together now we could use the extra room.\u201d</p><p>I spin in a slow circle. When my eyes land on the kitchen, I pause. It\u2019s not as big as Allysa\u2019s kitchen, but it\u2019s just as white and almost as beautiful. There\u2019s a wine cooler and a dishwasher, two things my own apartment doesn\u2019t have. I walk into the kitchen and look around, scared to touch anything. Is this really my kitchen? This can\u2019t be my kitchen.</p><p>I look in the living room at the cathedral ceilings and the huge windows overlooking Boston Harbor.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d he says from behind me. \u201cYou aren\u2019t mad, are you?\u201d</p><p>I spin and face him, realizing that he\u2019s been waiting on me to react for the past several minutes. But I\u2019m completely speechless.</p><p>I shake my head and bring my hand up to cover my mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He walks up to me and takes my hands in his, pulling them up between us. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d He looks worried and confused. \u201cPlease give me a naked truth, because I\u2019m starting to think maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done this as a surprise.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the hardwood floor. It\u2019s real hardwood. It\u2019s not laminate. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, looking back up at him. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy that you just went and bought an apartment without me. I feel like that\u2019s something we should have done together.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s nodding and it looks like he\u2019s about to spit out an apology, but I\u2019m not finished.</p><p>\u201cBut my naked truth is that . . . it\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t even know what to say, Ryle. Everything is so clean. I\u2019m scared to move. I might get something dirty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He blows out a rush of air and pulls me to him. \u201cYou can get it dirty, babe. It\u2019s yours. You can get it as dirty as you want.\u201d He kisses the side of my head and I don\u2019t even say thank you yet. It seems like such a small response to such a huge gesture.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we move in?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cTomorrow? I have the day off. It\u2019s not like we have a whole lot of stuff. We can spend the next few weeks buying new furniture.\u201d</p><p>I nod, trying to run through tomorrow\u2019s schedule in my head. I already knew Ryle was off tomorrow, so I didn\u2019t have anything planned.</p> <p>I suddenly feel the need to sit down. There aren\u2019t any chairs, but luckily, the floor is clean. \u201cI need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>Ryle helps me to the floor and then he lowers himself in front of me, still holding my hands.</p><p>\u201cDoes Allysa know?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He smiles and nods his head. \u201cShe\u2019s so excited, Lily. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting an apartment here for a while now. After we decided to stay in Boston for good, I just went ahead with it to surprise you. She helped, but I was starting to worry she\u2019d tell you before I had the chance.\u201d</p><p>I just can\u2019t wrap my head around this. I live here? Me and Allysa get to be neighbors now? I don\u2019t know why I feel like this should bother me, because I really am excited about it.</p> <p>He smiles and then says, \u201cI know you need a minute to process everything, but you haven\u2019t seen the best part and it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me!\u201d</p><p>He grins and pulls me to my feet. We make our way through the living room and down a hallway. He opens each door and tells me what the rooms are, but doesn\u2019t even give me time to go in any of them. By the time we make it to the master bedroom, I\u2019ve concluded that we live in a three-bedroom, two-bath apartment. With an office.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have time to process the beauty of the bedroom as he pulls me across the room. He reaches a wall covered by a curtain and he turns and faces me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a ground that you can plant a garden in, but with a few pots, it can come close.\u201d He pulls the curtain aside and opens a door, revealing a huge balcony. I follow him outside, already daydreaming about all the potted plants I could fit up here.</p><p>\u201cIt overlooks the same view as the rooftop deck,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have the same view we had from the night we met.\u201d</p><p>It took a while to sink in, but it all hits me in this moment and I just start crying. Ryle pulls me to his chest and wraps his arms tightly around me. \u201cLily,\u201d he whispers, running his hand over my hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh between my tears. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe I live here.\u201d I pull away from his chest and look up at him. \u201cAre we rich? How can you afford this?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou married a neurosurgeon, Lily. You aren\u2019t necessarily strapped for cash.\u201d</p><p>His comment makes me laugh and then I cry some more. And then we have our very first visitor because someone begins pounding on the door.</p><p>\u201cAllysa,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s been waiting down the hall.\u201d</p><p>I run to the front door and swing it open and we both hug and squeal and I might even cry a little more.</p><p>We spend the rest of the evening at our new apartment. Ryle orders Chinese takeout and Marshall comes down to eat with us. We have no tables or chairs yet, so the four of us sit in the middle of the living room floor and eat straight out of the containers. We talk about how we\u2019ll decorate, we talk about all the neighborly things we\u2019ll do together, we talk about Allysa\u2019s impending delivery.</p><p>It\u2019s everything and more.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to tell my mother.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Allysa is three days overdue.</p><p>We\u2019ve lived in our new apartment for a week now. We successfully got all of our stuff moved the day Ryle was off, and Allysa and I went furniture shopping the second day we moved in. We were practically settled by the third day. We got our first piece of mail yesterday. It was a utility bill for establishing service, so it finally feels official now.</p><p>I\u2019m married. I have a great husband. An awesome house. My best friend just happens to be my sister-in-law and I\u2019m about to be an aunt.</p><p>Dare I say it . . . but can my life get any better?</p><p>I close my laptop and get ready to leave for the evening. I\u2019ve been leaving earlier now than I usually do because I\u2019m so excited to get home to my new apartment. Just as I begin to close my office door, Ryle uses his key to open the front door to the store. He lets the door fall shut behind him as he walks in with his hands full.</p><p>There\u2019s a newspaper tucked under his arm and two coffees in his hands. Despite the frenzied look about him and the urgency in his step, he\u2019s smiling. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, walking toward me. He shoves one of the coffees in my hand and then pulls the newspaper out from under his arm. \u201cThree things. One . . . did you see the paper?\u201d He hands it to me. The paper is folded inside-out. He points at the article. \u201cYou got it, Lily. You got it!\u201d</p><p>I try not to get my hopes up as I look down at the article. He could be talking about something totally different from what I\u2019m thinking. Once I read the headline, I realize he\u2019s talking about exactly what I was thinking. \u201cI got it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been notified that my business was nominated for an award for Best of Boston. It\u2019s a people\u2019s choice awards the newspaper holds annually, and Lily Bloom\u2019s was nominated under the \u201cBest new businesses in Boston\u201d category. The criteria are for businesses that have been open less than two years. I had a suspicion I might have been chosen when a reporter for the paper called me last week and asked me a series of questions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The title reads \u201cBest new businesses in Boston. Votes are in for your top ten!\u201d</p><p>I smile and almost spill my coffee when Ryle pulls me in, picks me up, and spins me around.</p><p>He said he had three pieces of news, and if he started with that one, I have no idea what the other two could be. \u201cWhat\u2019s the second thing?\u201d</p><p>He sets me back down on my feet and says, \u201cI started with the best one. I was too excited.\u201d He takes a sip of his coffee and then says, \u201cI got selected for the training at Cambridge.\u201d</p> <p>My face is taken over by a huge smile. \u201cYou did?\u201d He nods and then he hugs me and spins me around again. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d I say, kissing him. \u201cWe\u2019re both so successful, it\u2019s sickening.\u201d</p><p>He laughs.</p><p>\u201cNumber three?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He pulls back. \u201cOh, yeah. Number three.\u201d He casually leans against the counter and takes a slow sip of his coffee. He gently places his coffee back on the counter. \u201cAllysa is in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I yell.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nods toward our coffees. \u201cThat\u2019s why I brought you caffeine. We aren\u2019t getting any sleep tonight.\u201d</p><p>I start clapping, jumping up and down, and then panicking as I try to find my purse, my jacket, my keys, my phone, the light switch. Right before we make it to the door, Ryle rushes back to the counter and grabs the newspaper and tucks it under his arm. My hands are shaking with excitement as I lock the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be aunts!\u201d I say as I run to my car.</p><p>Ryle laughs at my joke and says, \u201cUncles, Lily. We\u2019re gonna be uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Marshall calmly steps out into the hallway. Ryle and I both perk up and wait for the news. It\u2019s been quiet in there for the past half an hour. We\u2019ve been waiting to hear Allysa scream in agony\u2014a sign she delivered\u2014but there were no sounds at all. Not even the cries of a newborn. My hands go up to my mouth and seeing the look on Marshall\u2019s face has me fearing the worst.</p> <p>His shoulders just start shaking and tears pour out of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a dad.\u201d And then he punches the air. \u201cI\u2019m a DAD!\u201d</p><p>He hugs Ryle and then me and says, \u201cGive us fifteen minutes and you can come inside to meet her.\u201d</p><p>When he closes the door, Ryle and I both release huge sighs of relief. We look at each other and smile. \u201cYou were thinking the worst, too?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod and then hug him. \u201cYou\u2019re an uncle,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>He kisses my head and says, \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, Ryle and I are both standing next to the bed, watching Allysa hold her new baby. She\u2019s absolutely perfect. A little too new to tell who she looks like yet, but she\u2019s beautiful, regardless.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hold your niece?\u201d Allysa says to Ryle.</p><p>He kind of stiffens up like he\u2019s nervous, but then he nods. She leans over and puts the baby in Ryle\u2019s arms, showing him how to hold her. He stares down at her nervously and then walks over to the couch and takes a seat. \u201cHave you guys decided on a name yet?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>Ryle and I both look at Allysa and she smiles, teary eyed. \u201cWe wanted to name her after someone Marshall and I both think the world of. So we added an E to your name. We\u2019re calling her Rylee.\u201d</p><p>I instantly look back over at Ryle and he blows out a quick breath like he\u2019s a little in shock. He looks back down at Rylee and just starts smiling. \u201cWow,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze Allysa\u2019s hand and then walk over and take a seat next to Ryle. I\u2019ve had a lot of moments when I thought I couldn\u2019t love him more than I already do, but once again I\u2019m proven wrong. Seeing the way he looks at his new baby niece makes my heart expand.</p><p>Marshall sits down on the bed next to Allysa. \u201cDid you guys hear how quiet Issa was through the whole thing? Not a single peep. She didn\u2019t even take drugs.\u201d He puts his arm around her and lies down next to her on the bed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in that movie Hancock with Will Smith and I\u2019m about to find out I\u2019m married to a superhero.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s kicked my ass a time or two growing up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cussing around Rylee,\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d Ryle whispers to her.</p><p>We both laugh and then he asks me if I want to hold her. I make like I have grabby hands because waiting for my turn has been killing me. I pull her into my arms and am shocked by how much love I have for her already.</p><p>\u201cWhen are Mom and Dad coming in?\u201d Ryle asks Allysa.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here by lunch tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should probably get some sleep then. Just got off a long shift.\u201d He looks back at me. \u201cYou coming with?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI want to hang out for a little while longer. Just take my car and I\u2019ll catch a cab home.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me on the side of my head and then rests his head against mine as we both look down at Rylee. \u201cI think we should make one of these,\u201d he says.</p><p>I glance up at him, not sure if I heard him correctly.</p><p>He winks. \u201cIf I\u2019m asleep when you get home later, wake me up. We\u2019ll start on it tonight.\u201d He tells Marshall and Allysa goodbye and Marshall walks him out.</p><p>I glance over at Allysa and she\u2019s smiling. \u201cI told you he\u2019d want babies with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grin and walk back over to her bed. She scoots over and makes room for me. I hand Rylee back to her and we snuggle together on her bed and watch Rylee sleep, like it\u2019s the most magnificent thing we\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>It\u2019s three hours later and after ten o\u2019clock when I make it back home. I stayed with Allysa for another hour after Ryle left and then went back to my office to finish up a few things so that I don\u2019t have to go in for the next two days. Whenever Ryle has a day off, I try to coincide my own days off with his.</p><p>The lights are off when I walk through the front door, so that means Ryle is already in bed.</p> <p>The entire drive home I thought about what he\u2019d said. I wasn\u2019t expecting this conversation to come up so soon. I\u2019m almost twenty-five, but I had it in my head it would be at least a couple of years before we started trying for a family. I\u2019m still not certain I\u2019m ready for it yet, but knowing it\u2019s now something he wants someday has put me in an incredibly happy mood.</p><p>I decide to make myself a quick bite to eat before waking him up. I haven\u2019t had dinner yet and I\u2019m starving. When I flip on the kitchen light, I scream. My hand goes to my chest and I fall against the counter. \u201cJesus Christ, Ryle! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s leaning with his back against the wall next to the refrigerator. His feet are crossed at the ankles and his eyes are narrowed in my direction. He\u2019s flipping something over in his fingers, staring at me.</p><p>My eyes fall to the counter to his left and I see an empty glass that probably recently held scotch. He drinks it on occasion to help him fall asleep.</p><p>I look back at him and there\u2019s a smirk on his face. My body instantly grows warm at that smile because I know what comes next. This apartment is about to become a frenzy of clothes and kisses. We\u2019ve christened nearly every room since we moved in here, but the kitchen is one we haven\u2019t tackled yet.</p> <p>I smile back at him, my heart still beating erratically from the shock of finding him here in the dark. His eyes fall to his hand, and I notice he\u2019s holding the Boston magnet. I brought it from the old apartment and stuck it on this fridge when we moved in.</p><p>He places it back on the fridge and taps it. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p><p>I look at the magnet and then back at him. The last thing I want to do is tell him that magnet came from Atlas on my sixteenth birthday. It would only bring up an already sore subject, and I\u2019m too excited for what\u2019s about to come next between us to give him the naked truth right now.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve had it forever.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me silently and then straightens up, taking two steps toward me. I back myself against the counter and my breath catches. His hands meet my waist and he slides them between my ass and my jeans and pulls me against him. His mouth claims mine and he kisses me while he begins to lower my jeans.</p><p>Okay. So we\u2019re doing this right now.</p> <p>His lips drag down my neck as I kick off my shoes and then he pulls my jeans off the rest of the way.</p><p>I guess I can eat later. Christening the kitchen just became my priority.</p><p>When his mouth is back on mine, he lifts me and sets me down on the countertop, standing between my knees. I can smell the scotch on his breath, and I kind of like it. I\u2019m already breathing heavily as his warm lips slide across mine. He takes a fistful of my hair and he tugs gently so that I\u2019m looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cNaked truth?\u201d he whispers, looking at my mouth like he\u2019s about to devour me.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>His other hand begins to slide slowly up my thigh until there\u2019s nowhere left for his hand to go. He slips two warm fingers inside of me, keeping my gaze locked with his. I suck in a rush of air as my legs tighten around his waist. I begin to slowly move against his hand, moaning softly as he stares heatedly at me.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that magnet, Lily?\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>My heart feels like it begins beating in reverse.</p><p>Why does he keep asking me this?</p><p>His fingers are still moving inside of me, his eyes still look like they want me. But his hand. The hand that\u2019s wrapped in my hair begins to tug harder and I wince.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I whisper, keeping my voice calm, even though I\u2019m beginning to shake. \u201cThat hurts.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stop moving, but his gaze never leaves mine. He slowly pulls his fingers out of me and then brings his hand up around my throat, squeezing gently. His lips meet mine and his tongue dives inside my mouth. I take it, because I have no idea what\u2019s going through his head right now and I pray I\u2019m overreacting.</p><p>I can feel him hard against his jeans as he presses into me. But then he pulls back. His hands leave me entirely as he flattens his back against the refrigerator, scraping his eyes over my body like he wants to take me right here in the kitchen. My heart begins to calm down. I\u2019m overreacting.</p><p>He reaches beside him, next to the stove, and he picks up a newspaper. It\u2019s the same newspaper he showed me earlier, with the awards article printed in it. He holds it up, then tosses it toward me. \u201cDid you get a chance to read that yet?\u201d</p><p>I blow out a breath of relief. \u201cNot yet,\u201d I say, my eyes falling to the article.</p><p>\u201cRead it out loud.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at him. I smile, but my stomach is anxious. There\u2019s something about him right now. The way he\u2019s acting. I can\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to read the article?\u201d I ask. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>I feel odd, sitting on my kitchen counter half naked, holding a newspaper. He nods. \u201cI\u2019d like you to take off your shirt first. Then read it out loud.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at him, trying to gauge his behavior. Maybe the scotch has made him extra frisky. A lot of times when we make love, it\u2019s as simple as making love. But occasionally, our sex is wild. A little dangerous, like the look in his eyes right now.</p><p>I set the paper down, pull off my shirt, and then pick the paper back up. I start reading the article out loud, but he takes a step forward and says, \u201cNot the whole thing.\u201d He flips the paper over where it starts in the middle of the article and he points to a sentence. \u201cRead the last few paragraphs.\u201d</p><p>I look down, even more confused this time. But whatever will get us past this and into the bed . . .</p><p>\u201cThe business with the highest number of votes should come as no surprise. The iconic Bib\u2019s on Marketson opened in April of last year, quickly becoming one of the highest rated restaurants in the city, according to TripAdvisor.\u201d</p> <p>I stop reading and look up at Ryle. He has poured himself more scotch and he\u2019s swallowing a sip of it. \u201cKeep reading,\u201d he says, nudging his head at the paper in my hand.</p><p>I swallow heavily, the saliva in my mouth growing thicker by the second. I try to control the trembling of my hands as I continue reading. \u201cThe owner, Atlas Corrigan, is a two-time award-winning chef and also a United States Marine. It\u2019s no secret what the acronym for his highly successful restaurant, Bib\u2019s, stands for: Better In Boston.\u201d</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>Everything is better in Boston.</p><p>I clench my stomach, trying to keep my emotions under control as I keep reading. \u201cBut when interviewed regarding his most recent award, the chef finally revealed the true history of the meaning behind the name. \u2018It\u2019s a long story,\u2019 Chef Corrigan stated. \u2018It was an homage to someone who had a huge impact on my life. Someone who meant a lot to me. She still means a lot to me.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>I put the newspaper on the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to read anymore.\u201d My voice cracks on its way up my throat.</p><p>Ryle takes two swift steps forward and grabs the newspaper. He picks up where I left off, his voice loud and angry now. \u201cWhen asked if the girl was aware he named a restaurant after her, Chef Corrigan smiled knowingly and said, \u2018Next question.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The anger in Ryle\u2019s voice makes me nauseous. \u201cRyle, stop it,\u201d I say calmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d I push past him and walk quickly out of the kitchen toward the hallway that leads to our bedroom. There\u2019s so much happening right now and I\u2019m not sure I understand any of it.</p><p>The article never stated who Atlas was talking about. Atlas knows it was me and I know it was me, but how in the hell would Ryle put two and two together?</p><p>And the magnet. How would he know that came from Atlas just by reading that article?</p><p>He\u2019s overreacting.</p> <p>I can hear him following me as I walk toward the bedroom. I swing open the door and come to a sudden halt.</p><p>The bed is littered with things. An empty moving box with the words, \u201cLily\u2019s stuff,\u201d written on the side of it. And then all the contents that were inside that box. Letters . . . journals . . . empty shoeboxes. I close my eyes and breathe in slowly.</p><p>He read the journal.</p><p>No.</p><p>He. Read. The. Journal.</p><p>His arm comes around my waist from behind. He slides a hand up my stomach and takes a firm hold of one of my breasts. His other hand feathers my shoulder as he moves the hair away from my neck.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, just as his fingers begin to trace across my skin, up to my shoulder. He slowly runs his finger over the heart and a shudder runs over my whole body. His lips meet my skin, right over the tattoo, and then he sinks his teeth into me so hard, I scream.</p><p>I try to pull away from him, but he has such a tight grip on me he doesn\u2019t even budge. The pain from his teeth piercing my collarbone rips through my shoulder and down my arm. I immediately start crying. Sobbing.</p> <p>\u201cRyle, let me go,\u201d I say, my voice pleading. \u201cPlease. Walk away.\u201d His arms are cutting into mine as he holds me tightly from behind.</p><p>He spins me, but my eyes are still closed. I\u2019m too scared to look at him. His hands are digging into my shoulders as he pushes me toward the bed. I start trying to fight him off of me, but it\u2019s useless. He\u2019s too strong for me. He\u2019s angry. He\u2019s hurt. And he\u2019s not Ryle.</p><p>My back meets the bed and I frantically scoot back toward the headboard, trying to get away from him. \u201cWhy is he still here, Lily?\u201d His voice isn\u2019t as composed as it was in the kitchen. He\u2019s really angry now. \u201cHe\u2019s in everything. The magnet on the fridge. The journal in the box I found in our closet. The fucking tattoo on your body that used to be my favorite goddamn part of you!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s on the bed now.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I beg. \u201cI can explain.\u201d Tears streak down my temples and into my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re angry. Please don\u2019t hurt me, please. Walk away, and when you come back, I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>His hand grips my ankle and he yanks me until I\u2019m beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m not angry, Lily,\u201d he says, his voice disturbingly calm now. \u201cI just think I haven\u2019t proved to you how much I love you.\u201d His body comes down against mine and he takes my wrists with one hand above my head, pressing them against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cRyle, please.\u201d I\u2019m sobbing, trying to push him off of me with any part of my body. \u201cGet off me. Please.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no, no.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lily,\u201d he says, his words crashing against my cheek. \u201cMore than he ever did.

All I can see when I squeeze my eyes shut is my mother crying on our old living room couch; my father forcing himself on top of her. Hatred rips through me and I start screaming.</p><p>Ryle tries to muffle my screams with his mouth.</p><p>I bite down on his tongue.</p><p>His forehead comes crashing down against mine.</p> <p>In an instant, all the pain fades as a blanket of darkness rolls over my eyes and consumes me.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I can feel his breath against my ear as he mutters something inaudible. My heart is racing, my whole body is still shaking, my tears are still somehow falling and I\u2019m gasping for air.

I can feel something trickling into my right eye and I instantly know it\u2019s blood.</p><p>My blood.</p> <p>His words begin to come into focus.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>His hand is still pressing mine into the mattress and he\u2019s still on top of me. He\u2019s no longer trying to force himself on me.</p><p>\u201cLily, I love you, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His words are full of panic. He\u2019s kissing me, his lips gentle against my cheek and mouth.</p><p>He knows what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s Ryle again, and he knows what he\u2019s just done to me. To us. To our future.</p> <p>I utilize his panic to my advantage. I shake my head and I whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ryle. It\u2019s okay. You were angry, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>His lips meet mine in a frenzy and the taste of scotch makes me want to puke now. He\u2019s still whispering apologies when the room begins to fade out again.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My eyes are closed. We\u2019re still on the bed, but he\u2019s no longer fully on top of me. He\u2019s on his side, his arm wrapped tightly over my waist. His head is pressed against my chest. I remain stiff as I assess everything around me.</p><p>He isn\u2019t moving, but I can feel his breaths, heavy with sleep. I don\u2019t know if he passed out or if he fell asleep. The last thing I can remember is his mouth on mine, the taste of my own tears.</p><p>I lie still for several more minutes. The pain in my head begins to worsen with every minute of consciousness. I close my eyes and try to think.</p><p>Where\u2019s my purse?</p><p>Where are my keys?</p> <p>Where is my phone?</p><p>It takes me a full five minutes to slide out from under him. I\u2019m too scared to move too much at once, so I do it an inch at a time until I\u2019m able to roll onto the floor. When I can no longer feel his hands on me, an unexpected sob breaks from my chest. I slap my hand over my mouth as I pull myself to my feet and run out of the bedroom.</p><p>I find my purse and my phone, but I have no idea where he put my keys. I frantically search the living room and kitchen, but I can barely see anything. When he head-butted me, it must have left a gash on my forehead, because there\u2019s too much blood in my eyes and everything is blurry.</p><p>I slide to the floor near the door, growing dizzy. My fingers are shaking so hard, it takes three tries to get the password right on my phone.</p><p>When I have the screen up to dial a number, I pause. My first thought is to call Allysa and Marshall, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do that to them right now. She just gave birth to a baby a matter of hours ago. I can\u2019t do this to them.</p><p>I could call the police, but my mind can\u2019t even process what all that entails. I don\u2019t want to give a statement. I don\u2019t know that I want to press charges, knowing what this could do to his career. I don\u2019t want Allysa mad at me. I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t completely rule out eventually notifying the police. I just don\u2019t have the energy to make that decision right now.</p><p>I squeeze the phone and try to think. My mother.</p><p>I start to dial her number, but when I think of what this would do to her I start to cry again. I can\u2019t involve her in this mess. She\u2019s been through too much. And Ryle will try to find me. He\u2019ll go to her first. Then Allysa and Marshall. Then to everyone else we know.</p><p>I wipe the tears from my eyes and then begin dialing Atlas\u2019s number.</p><p>I hate myself more in this moment than I ever have in my entire life.</p><p>I hate myself, because the day Ryle found Atlas\u2019s number in my phone, I lied and said I had forgotten it was there.</p><p>I hate myself, because the day Atlas placed his number there, I opened it and looked at it.</p><p>I hate myself, because deep down inside, I knew there was a chance that I might one day need it. So I memorized it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>His voice is cautious. Inquiring. He doesn\u2019t recognize this number. I immediately start crying when he speaks. I cover my mouth and try to quiet myself.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d His voice is much louder now. \u201cLily, where are you?\u201d</p><p>I hate myself, because he knows the tears are mine.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he says again. I can hear panic in his voice. I can hear him walking, moving stuff around. I hear a door slam on his end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d I whisper, too scared to keep speaking. I don\u2019t want Ryle to wake up. I hang up the phone and somehow find the strength to still my hands while I text him my address and the access code for entry. Then I send a second text that says Text me when you get here. Please don\u2019t knock.</p><p>I crawl to the kitchen and find my pants, struggling back into them. I find my shirt on the counter. When I\u2019m dressed, I go to the living room. I debate opening the door and meeting Atlas downstairs, but I\u2019m too scared I won\u2019t be able to make it down to the lobby alone. My forehead is still bleeding and I feel too weak to even stand up and wait by the door. I slide to the floor, clenching my phone in my shaky fist and staring at it, waiting for his text. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s an agonizing twenty-four minutes later when my phone lights up.</p><p>Here.</p><p>I scramble to my feet and swing open the door.

I\u2019ve never heard my name spoken so sadly. He urges me to look up at him. His blue eyes scroll over my face, and I see it happen. I watch the concern vanish as he darts his head up to the apartment door. \u201cIs he still in there?\u201d</p> <p>Rage.</p><p>I can feel the rage come off of him and he starts to step toward the apartment door. I grab his jacket in my fists. \u201cNo. Please, Atlas. I just want to leave.\u201d</p><p>I see the pain roll over him as he pauses, struggling to decide whether to listen to me or bust through the door. He eventually turns away from the door and wraps his arms around me. He helps me to the elevator and then through the lobby. By some miracle, we only run into one person and he\u2019s on his phone and facing the other direction.</p><p>By the time we make it to the parking garage, I start to feel dizzy again. I tell him to slow down, and then I feel his arm wrap under my knees as he picks me up. Then we\u2019re in the car. Then the car is moving.</p><p>I know I need stitches.</p> <p>I know he\u2019s taking me to the hospital.</p><p>But I have no idea why the next words out of my mouth are, \u201cDon\u2019t take me to Mass General. Take me somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>For whatever reason, I don\u2019t want to risk the chance of running into any of Ryle\u2019s colleagues. I hate him. I hate him in this moment more than I\u2019ve ever hated my father. But concern for his career still somehow breaks through the hatred.</p><p>When I realize this, I hate myself just as much as I hate him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Atlas is standing on the other side of the room. He hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off me the entire time the nurse has been helping me. After taking a blood sample, she immediately returned and began to attend to my cut. She hasn\u2019t asked me very many questions yet, but it\u2019s obvious my injuries are the result of an attack. I can see the pitying look on her face as she cleans up blood from the bite mark left on my shoulder.</p> <p>When she\u2019s finished, she glances back at Atlas. She steps to the right, blocking his view of me as she turns and faces me again. \u201cI need to ask you some personal questions. I\u2019m going to ask him to leave the room, okay?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s in that moment that I realize she thinks Atlas is the one who did these things to me. I immediately start to shake my head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him,\u201d I tell her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make him leave.\u201d</p><p>Relief washes over her face. She nods her head and then pulls up a chair. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, because she can\u2019t fix all the parts of me Ryle broke on the inside.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d Her voice is gentle. \u201cWere you raped?\u201d</p><p>Tears fill my eyes and I see Atlas roll across the wall, pressing his forehead against it.</p><p>The nurse waits until I make eye contact with her again to continue speaking. \u201cWe have a certain examination for these situations. It\u2019s called a SANE exam. It\u2019s optional, of course, but I highly encourage it in your situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t raped,\u201d I say. \u201cHe didn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure, Lily?\u201d the nurse asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI don\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>Atlas faces me again and I can see the pain in his expression as he steps forward. \u201cLily. You need this.\u201d His eyes are pleading.</p><p>I shake my head again. \u201cAtlas, I swear . . .\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut and lower my head. \u201cI\u2019m not covering for him this time,\u201d I whisper. \u201cHe tried, but then he stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose to press charges, you\u2019ll need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the exam,\u201d I say again, my voice firm.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the door and a doctor enters, sparing me from more pleading looks from Atlas. The nurse gives the doctor a brief rundown of my injuries. She then steps aside as he examines my head and shoulder. He flashes a light into both of my eyes. He looks down at the paperwork again and says, \u201cI\u2019d like to rule out a concussion, but given your situation, I don\u2019t want to administer a CT. We\u2019d like to keep you for observation, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to administer a CT?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>The doctor stands up. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to perform X-rays on pregnant women unless it\u2019s vital. We\u2019ll monitor you for complications and if there are no further concerns, you\u2019ll be free to go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hear anything beyond that.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The pressure begins to build in my head. My heart. My stomach. I grip the edges of the exam table I\u2019m sitting on and I stare at the floor until they both leave the room.</p><p>When the door closes behind them, I sit, suspended in frozen silence. I see Atlas move closer. His feet are almost touching mine. His fingers brush lightly over my back. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>I release a quick breath, and then drag in more air. I start shaking my head, and when his arms come down around me, I cry harder than I knew my body was even capable of. He holds me the entire time I cry. He holds me through my hatred.</p><p>I did this to myself.</p><p>I allowed this to happen to me.</p><p>I am my mother.</p><p>\u201cI want to leave,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Atlas pulls back. \u201cThey want to monitor you, Lily. I think you should stay.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him and shake my head. \u201cI need to get out of here. Please. I want to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods and helps me back into my shoes. He pulls off his jacket and wraps it around me, then we walk out of the hospital without anyone noticing.</p><p>He says nothing to me as we drive. I stare out the window, too exhausted to cry. Too in shock to speak. I feel submerged.</p><p>Just keep swimming.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Atlas doesn\u2019t live in an apartment. He lives in a house. A small suburb outside of Boston called Wellesley, where all the homes are beautiful, sprawling, manicured, and expensive. Before we pull into his driveway, I wonder to myself if he ever married that girl. Cassie. I wonder what she\u2019ll think of her husband bringing home a girl he once loved who has just been attacked by her own husband.</p><p>She\u2019ll pity me. She\u2019ll wonder why I never left him. She\u2019ll wonder how I let myself get to this point. She\u2019ll wonder all the same things I used to wonder about my own mother when I saw her in my same situation. People spend so much time wondering why the women don\u2019t leave. Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn\u2019t that where the only blame should be placed?</p><p>Atlas parks in the garage. There\u2019s not another vehicle here. I don\u2019t wait for him to help me out of the car. I open the door and get out on my own, and then I follow him into his house. He punches in a code on an alarm and then flips on a few lights. My eyes roam around the kitchen, the dining room, the living room. Everything is made of rich woods and stainless steel, and his kitchen is painted a calming bluish-green. The color of the ocean. If I wasn\u2019t hurting so much, I would smile.</p><p>Atlas kept swimming, and look at him now. He swam all the way to the fucking Caribbean.</p><p>He moves to his refrigerator and pulls out a bottle of water, walking it over to me. He takes the lid off and hands it to me. I take a drink and watch as he turns the living room light on, then the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cDo you live alone?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods as he walks back into the kitchen. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Even if I was, I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you your room,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a shower if you need it.\u201d</p><p>I do. I want to wash the taste of scotch out of my mouth. I want to wash the sterile smell of the hospital off of me. I want to wash away the last four hours of my life.</p><p>I follow him down the hallway and to a spare bedroom where he flips on the light. There are two boxes on a bare bed and more stacked up against the walls. There\u2019s an oversized chair against one wall, facing the door. He moves to the bed and takes off the boxes, setting them against the wall with the others.</p> <p>\u201cI just moved in a few months ago. Haven\u2019t had much time to decorate yet.\u201d He walks to a dresser and pulls open a drawer. \u201cI\u2019ll make the bed for you.\u201d He takes out sheets and a pillowcase. He begins making the bed as I walk inside the bathroom and close the door.</p><p>I remain in the bathroom for thirty minutes. Some of those minutes are spent staring at my reflection in the mirror. Some of those minutes are spent in the shower. The rest are spent over the toilet as I make myself sick with thoughts of the last several hours.</p><p>I\u2019m wrapped in a towel when I crack the bathroom door. Atlas is no longer in the bedroom, but there are clothes folded on the freshly made bed. Men\u2019s pajama bottoms that are too big for me and a T-shirt that goes past my knees. I pull the drawstring tight, tie it, and then crawl into bed. I turn the lamp off and pull the covers up and over me.</p><p>I cry so hard, I don\u2019t even make a noise.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>I smell toast.</p><p>I stretch out on my bed and smile, because Ryle knows toast is my favorite.</p><p>My eyes flick open and the clarity smashes down on me with the force of a head-on collision. I squeeze my eyes shut when I realize where I am and why I\u2019m here and that the toast I smell is not at all because my sweet and caring husband is making me breakfast in bed.</p> <p>I immediately want to cry again, so I force myself off the bed. I focus on the hollowness in my stomach as I use the bathroom, and tell myself I can cry after I eat something. I need to eat before I make myself sick again.</p><p>When I walk out of the bathroom and back into the bedroom, I notice the chair has been turned so that it\u2019s facing the bed now instead of the door. There\u2019s a blanket thrown over it haphazardly, and it\u2019s obvious Atlas was in here last night while I slept.</p><p>He was probably worried I had a concussion.</p><p>When I walk into the kitchen, Atlas is moving back and forth between the fridge, the stove, the counter. For the first time in twelve hours, I feel an inkling of something that isn\u2019t agony, because I remember he\u2019s a chef. A good one. And he\u2019s cooking me breakfast.</p><p>He glances up at me as I make my way into the kitchen. \u201cMorning,\u201d he says, careful to say it without too much inflection. \u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d He slides a glass and a container of orange juice across the counter toward me, then he turns and faces the stove again.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He glances back over his shoulder and gives me a ghost of a smile. I pour myself a glass of orange juice and then walk to the other side of the kitchen where there\u2019s a breakfast nook. There\u2019s a newspaper on the table and I begin to pick it up. When I see the article about the best businesses in Boston printed across the page, my hands immediately begin to shake and I drop the paper back on the table. I close my eyes and take a slow sip of the orange juice.</p><p>A few minutes later, Atlas sets a plate down in front of me, then claims the seat across from me at the table. He pulls his own plate of food in front of him and cuts into a crepe with his fork. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look down at my plate. Three crepes, drizzled in syrup and garnished with a dab of whipped cream. Orange and strawberry slices line the right side of the plate.</p><p>It\u2019s almost too pretty to eat, but I\u2019m too hungry to care. I take a bite and close my eyes, trying not to make it obvious that it\u2019s the best bite of breakfast I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I finally allow myself to admit that his restaurant deserved that award. As much as I tried to talk Ryle and Allysa out of going back, it was the best restaurant I\u2019d ever been to.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to cook?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>He sips from a cup of coffee. \u201cThe Marines,\u201d he says, placing the cup back down. \u201cI trained for a while during my first stint and then when I reenlisted I came on as a chef.\u201d He taps his fork against the side of his plate. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious. But you\u2019re wrong. You knew how to cook before you enlisted.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYou remember the cookies?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. \u201cBest cookies I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his chair. \u201cI taught myself the basics. My mother worked second shift when I was growing up, so if I wanted dinner at night I had to make it. It was either that or starve, so I bought a cookbook at a yard sale and made every single recipe in it over the course of a year. And I was only thirteen.\u201d</p> <p>I smile, shocked that I\u2019m even able to. \u201cThe next time someone asks you how you learned to cook, you should tell them that story. Not the other one.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person who knows anything about me before the age of nineteen. I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>He begins telling me about working as a chef in the military. How he saved up as much money as he could so that when he got out, he could open his own restaurant. He started with a small caf\u00e9 that did really well, then opened Bib\u2019s a year and a half ago. \u201cIt does okay,\u201d he says with modesty.</p><p>I glance around his kitchen and then look back at him. \u201cLooks like it does more than just okay.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and takes another bite of his food. I don\u2019t talk after that as we finish eating, because my mind wanders to his restaurant. The name of it. What he said in the interview. Then, of course, those thoughts lead me back to thoughts of Ryle and the anger in his voice as he yelled the last line of the interview at me.</p><p>I think Atlas can see the change in my demeanor, but he says nothing as he clears the table.</p> <p>When he takes another seat, he chooses the chair right next to me this time. He places a reassuring hand on top of mine. \u201cI have to go in to work for a few hours,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave. Stay here as long as you need, Lily. Just . . . please don\u2019t go back home today.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head when I hear the concern in his words. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll stay here,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything before I go?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He stands up and grabs his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll make it as quick as I can. I\u2019ll be back after lunch and I\u2019ll bring you something to eat, okay?\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. He opens a drawer and pulls out a pen and paper. He writes something on it before he leaves. When he\u2019s gone, I stand up and walk to the counter to read what he wrote. He listed instructions for how to set the alarm. He wrote his cell phone number, even though I have it memorized. He also wrote down his work number, his home address, and his work address.</p><p>At the bottom in small print, he wrote, \u201cJust keep swimming, Lily.\u201d</p><p>Dear Ellen,</p> <p>Hi. It\u2019s me. Lily Bloom. Well . . . technically it\u2019s Lily Kincaid now.</p><p>I know it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve written to you. A really long time. After everything that happened with Atlas, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to open up the journals again. I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to watch your show after school, because it hurt to watch it alone. In fact, all thoughts of you kind of depressed me. When I thought of you, I thought of Atlas. And to be honest, I didn\u2019t want to think of Atlas, so I had to cut you out of my life, too.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t miss me like I missed you, but sometimes the things that matter to you most are also the things that hurt you the most. And in order to get over that hurt, you have to sever all the extensions that keep you tethered to that pain. You were an extension of my pain, so I guess that\u2019s what I was doing. I was just trying to save myself a little bit of agony.</p><p>I\u2019m sure your show is as great as ever, though. I hear you still dance at the beginning of some episodes, but I\u2019ve grown to appreciate that. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest signs a person has matured\u2014knowing how to appreciate things that matter to others, even if they don\u2019t matter very much to you.</p><p>I should probably catch you up on my life. My father died. I\u2019m twenty-four now. I got a college degree, worked in marketing for a while, and now I own my own business. A floral shop. Life goals, FTW!</p><p>I also have a husband and he isn\u2019t Atlas.</p><p>And . . . I live in Boston.</p><p>I know. Shocker.</p><p>The last time I wrote to you, I was sixteen. I was in a really bad place and I was so worried about Atlas. I\u2019m not worried about Atlas anymore, but I am in a really bad place right now. More so than the last time I wrote to you.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t seem to need to write to you when I\u2019m in a good place. You tend to only get the shit end of my life, but that\u2019s what friends are for, right? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t even know where to start. I know you don\u2019t know anything about my current life or my husband, Ryle. But there\u2019s this thing we do where one of us says \u201cnaked truth,\u201d and then we\u2019re forced to be brutally honest and say what we\u2019re really thinking.</p><p>So . . . naked truth.</p><p>Brace yourself.</p><p>I am in love with a man who physically hurts me. Of all people, I have no idea how I let myself get to this point.</p> <p>There were many times growing up I wondered what was going through my mother\u2019s head in the days after my father had hurt her. How she could possibly love a man who had laid his hands on her. A man who repeatedly hit her. Repeatedly promised he would never do it again. Repeatedly hit her again.</p><p>I hate that I can empathize with her now.</p><p>I\u2019ve been sitting on Atlas\u2019s couch for over four hours, wrestling with my feelings. I can\u2019t get a grip on them. I can\u2019t understand them. I don\u2019t know how to process them. And true to my past, I realized that maybe I need to just get them out on paper. My apologies to you, Ellen. But get ready for a whole lot of word vomit.</p><p>If I had to compare this feeling to something, I would compare it to death. Not just the death of anyone. The death of the one. The person who is closer to you than anyone else in the whole world. The one who, when you simply imagine their death, it makes your eyes tear up.</p><p>That\u2019s what this feels like. It feels like Ryle has died.</p> <p>It\u2019s an astronomical amount of grief. An enormous amount of pain. It\u2019s a sense that I\u2019ve lost my best friend, my lover, my husband, my lifeline. But the difference between this feeling and death is the presence of another emotion that doesn\u2019t necessarily follow in the event of an actual death.</p><p>Hatred.</p><p>I am so angry at him, Ellen. Words can\u2019t express the amount of hatred I have for him. Yet somehow, in the midst of all my hatred, there are waves of reasoning that flow through me. I start to think things like \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t have had the magnet. I should have told him about the tattoo from the beginning. I shouldn\u2019t have kept the journals.\u201d</p><p>The reasoning is the hardest part of this. It eats at me, little by little, wearing down the strength my hatred lends to me. The reasoning forces me to imagine our future together, and how there are things I could do to prevent that type of anger. I\u2019ll never betray him again. I\u2019ll never keep secrets from him again. I\u2019ll never give him reason to react that way again. We\u2019ll both just have to work harder from now on.</p><p>For better, for worse, right?</p><p>I know these are the things that once went through my mother\u2019s head. But the difference between the two of us is that she had more to worry about. She didn\u2019t have the financial stability that I have. She didn\u2019t have the resources to leave and give me what she thought was a decent shelter. She didn\u2019t want to take me away from my father when I was used to living with both parents. I have a feeling reasoning really kicked her ass a time or two.</p> <p>I can\u2019t even begin to process the thought that I\u2019m having a child with this man. There is a human being inside of me that we created together. And no matter which option I choose\u2014whether I choose to stay or choose to leave\u2014neither are choices I would wish upon my child. To grow up in a broken home or an abusive one? I\u2019ve already failed this baby in life, and I\u2019ve only known about his or her existence for a single day.</p><p>Ellen, I wish you could write back to me. I wish that you could say something funny to me right now, because my heart needs it. I have never felt this alone. This broken. This angry. This hurt.</p><p>People on the outside of situations like these often wonder why the woman goes back to the abuser. I read somewhere once that 85 percent of women return to abusive situations. That was before I realized I was in one, and when I heard that statistic, I thought it was because the women were stupid. I thought it was because they were weak. I thought these things about my own mother more than once.</p><p>But sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they\u2019re in love. I love my husband, Ellen. I love so many things about him. I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.</p><p>I\u2019m a statistic now. The things I\u2019ve thought about women like me are now what others would think of me if they knew my current situation.</p><p>\u201cHow could she love him after what he did to her? How could she contemplate taking him back?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s sad that those are the first thoughts that run through our minds when someone is abused. Shouldn\u2019t there be more distaste in our mouths for the abusers than for those who continue to love the abusers?</p><p>I think of all the people who have been in this situation before me. Everyone who will be in this situation after me. Do we all repeat the same words in our heads in the days after experiencing abuse at the hands of those who love us? \u201cFrom this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe those vows weren\u2019t meant to be taken as literally as some spouses take them.</p><p>For better, for worse?</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>That.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u2014Lily</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>I\u2019m lying on Atlas\u2019s guest bed, staring up at the ceiling. It\u2019s a normal bed. Really comfortable, actually. But it feels like I\u2019m on a water bed. Or maybe a raft, adrift at sea. And I scale over these huge waves, each of them carrying something different. Some are waves of sadness. Some are waves of anger. Some are waves of tears. Some are waves of sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Occasionally, I\u2019ll place my hands on my stomach and a tiny wave of love will come. I have no idea how I can already love something so much, but I do. I think about whether or not it\u2019ll be a boy or a girl and what I\u2019ll name it. I wonder if it will look like me or Ryle. And then another wave of anger will come and crash down on that tiny wave of love.</p><p>I feel robbed of the joy a mother should have when she finds out she\u2019s pregnant. I feel like Ryle took that from me last night and it\u2019s just one more thing I have to hate him for.</p><p>Hatred is exhausting.</p><p>I force myself off the bed and into the shower. I\u2019ve been in my room most of the day. Atlas returned home several hours ago and I heard him open the door at one point to check on me but I pretended to be asleep.</p> <p>I feel awkward being here. Atlas is the very reason Ryle was angry at me last night, yet he\u2019s the one I ran to when I needed help? Being here fills me with guilt. Maybe even a little bit of shame, as though my calling Atlas lends credibility to Ryle\u2019s anger. But there\u2019s literally nowhere I can go right now. I need a couple of days to process things and if I go to a hotel, Ryle could track the credit card charge and find me.</p><p>He\u2019d be able to find me at my mother\u2019s. At Allysa\u2019s. At Lucy\u2019s. He\u2019s even met Devin a couple of times and would more than likely go there, too.</p><p>I can\u2019t see him tracking down Atlas, though. Yet. I\u2019m sure if I go a week avoiding his calls and texts, he\u2019ll look everywhere he can possibly look to find me. But for now, I don\u2019t think he would show up here.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I feel safer here than anywhere else I could possibly go. And Atlas has an alarm system, so there\u2019s that.</p><p>I glance at the nightstand to look at my phone. I skip over all the missed texts from Ryle and open the one from Allysa.</p> <p>Allysa: Hey, Aunt Lily! They\u2019re sending us home tonight. Come see us tomorrow when you get home from work.</p><p>She sent a picture of her and Rylee, and it makes me smile. Then cry. Damn these emotions.</p><p>I wait until my eyes are dry again before I walk into the living room. Atlas is sitting at his kitchen table, working on his laptop. When he looks up at me, he smiles and closes it.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile and then look in the kitchen. \u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>Atlas stands up quickly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, sit down. I\u2019ll get something ready for you.\u201d</p> <p>I take a seat on the couch as he works his way around the kitchen. The television is on, but it\u2019s muted. I unmute it and click on the DVR. He has a few shows recorded, but the one that catches my eye is The Ellen DeGeneres Show. I smile and click on the most recent unwatched episode and hit Play.</p><p>Atlas brings me a bowl of pasta and a glass of ice water. He glances at the TV and then sits down next to me on the couch.</p><p>For the next three hours, we watch a full week\u2019s worth of episodes. I laugh out loud six times. It feels good, but when I take a bathroom break and come back to the living room, the weight of it all starts to sink in again.</p><p>I sit back down on the couch next to Atlas. He\u2019s leaning back with his feet propped up on the coffee table. I naturally lean into him and just like he used to do when we were teenagers, he pulls me against his chest and we just sit there in silence. His thumb brushes the outside of my shoulder, and I know it\u2019s his unspoken way of saying he\u2019s here for me. That he feels bad for me. And for the first time since he picked me up last night, I feel like talking about it. My head is resting against his shoulder and my hands are in my lap. I\u2019m fidgeting with the drawstring on the pants that are way too big for me.</p><p>\u201cAtlas?\u201d I say, my voice barely a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got so angry at you that night at the restaurant. You were right. Deep down I knew you were right, but I didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d I lift my head and look at him, cracking a pitiful smile. \u201cYou can say, \u2018I told you so\u2019 now.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows draw together, like my words somehow hurt him. \u201cLily, this is not something I wanted to be right about. I prayed every day that I was wrong about him.\u201d</p><p>I wince. I shouldn\u2019t have said that to him. I know better than to think Atlas would ever think something like I told you so. He squeezes my shoulder and leans forward, kissing the top of my head. I close my eyes as I soak up the familiarity of him. His smell, his touch, his comfort. I\u2019ve never understood how someone can be so rock solid, yet comforting. But that\u2019s always how I\u2019ve viewed him. Like he could withstand anything, but somehow still feels the weight that everyone else carries.</p><p>I don\u2019t like that I was never fully able to let go of him, no matter how hard I tried. I think about the fight with Ryle over Atlas\u2019s phone number. The fight about the magnet, the article, the things he read in my journal, the tattoo. None of that would have happened if I would have just let go of Atlas and thrown it all away. Ryle wouldn\u2019t have had anything to be so upset with me about.</p> <p>I pull my hands up to my face after that thought, upset that there\u2019s a part of me trying to blame Ryle\u2019s reaction on my lack of closure with Atlas.</p><p>There\u2019s no excuse. None.</p><p>This is just another wave I\u2019m being forced to ride on. A wave of complete and utter confusion.</p><p>Atlas can feel the change in my composure. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not.</p><p>I\u2019m not okay, because until this moment, I had no idea how hurt I still am that he never came back for me. If he\u2019d have just come back for me like he promised, I would have never even met Ryle. And I would have never been in this situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yep. I\u2019m definitely confused. How am I possibly lending blame to Atlas for any of this?</p><p>\u201cI think I need to call it a night,\u201d I say quietly, pulling away from him. I stand up and Atlas stands up, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gone most of the day tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cWill you be here when I get home?\u201d</p><p>I cringe at his question. Of course he wants me to get my shit together and find another place to stay. What am I even still doing here? \u201cNo. No, I can get a hotel, it\u2019s fine.\u201d I turn to walk toward the hallway, but he puts a hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says, turning me around. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you to leave. I was just making sure you\u2019d still be here. I want you to stay as long as you need to.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are sincere, and if I didn\u2019t think it would be a little inappropriate, I would throw my arms around him and hug him. Because I\u2019m not ready to leave yet. Just a couple more days before I\u2019m forced to figure out what my next step is.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI need to go in to work for a few hours tomorrow,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThere are some things I need to take care of. But if you really don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to stay here for a few more days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, Lily. I\u2019d prefer it.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile and then head to the guest bedroom. At least he\u2019s giving me a buffer before I\u2019m forced to confront everything.</p> <p>As much as his presence in my life confuses me right now, I\u2019ve never been more thankful for him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>My hand is trembling when I reach for the doorknob. I\u2019ve never once been scared to walk into my own business before, but I\u2019ve also never been this on edge.</p><p>The building is dark when I enter it, so I flip on the lights, holding my breath. I walk slowly to my office, pushing the door open with caution.</p><p>He\u2019s nowhere, yet he\u2019s everywhere.</p><p>When I take a seat at my desk, I turn on my phone for the first time since I went to bed last night. I wanted a good night\u2019s sleep without having to worry about whether or not Ryle was trying to contact me.</p> <p>When it powers on, I have twenty-nine missed texts from Ryle. It just so happens to be the same number of doors Ryle knocked on to find my apartment last year.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at the irony.</p><p>I spend the rest of the day like this. Glancing over my shoulder, looking up at the door every time it opens. I wonder if he\u2019s ruined me. If the fear of him will ever leave me.</p><p>Half a day goes by without a single phone call from him while I catch up on paperwork. Allysa calls me after lunch and I can tell by her voice that she has no idea about the fight Ryle and I had. I let her talk about the baby for a while before I pretend I have a customer and hang up.</p><p>I plan on leaving when Lucy returns from her lunch break. She has half an hour left.</p><p>Ryle walks through the front door three minutes later.</p><p>I\u2019m the only one here.</p><p>As soon as I see him, I turn stone cold. I\u2019m standing behind the counter, my hand on the cash register because it\u2019s close to the stapler. I\u2019m sure a stapler couldn\u2019t do much harm against the arms of a neurosurgeon, but I\u2019ll use what I have.</p> <p>He slowly makes his way to the counter. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him since he was on top of me on our bed the other night. My whole body is immediately taken back to that moment, and I\u2019m engulfed in the same level of emotions as I was in that moment. Both fear and anger rush through me when he reaches the counter.</p><p>He lifts his hand and places a set of keys on the counter in front of me. My eyes fall to the keys.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for England tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone for three months. I paid all the bills so you won\u2019t have to worry about it while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>His voice is composed but I can see the veins in his neck as they prove his composure is taking all the effort he has. \u201cYou need time.\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cAnd I want to give that to you.\u201d He grimaces and pushes the keys to my apartment toward me. \u201cGo back home, Lily. I won\u2019t be there. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He turns and begins walking toward the door. It occurs to me that he didn\u2019t even try to apologize. I\u2019m not angry about it. I understand it. He knows that an apology will never take back what he did. He knows that the best thing for us right now is separation.</p><p>He knows what a huge mistake he made . . . yet I still feel the need to dig that knife in a little deeper.</p><p>\u201cRyle.\u201d</p><p>He looks back at me and it\u2019s as if he puts a shield up between us. He doesn\u2019t turn all the way around and he\u2019s stiff as he waits for whatever I\u2019m about to say. He knows my words are going to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what the worst part about this whole thing is?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just stares at me, waiting for my answer.</p><p>\u201cAll you had to do when you found my journal was ask me for a naked truth. I would have been honest with you. But you didn\u2019t. You chose to not ask for my help and now we\u2019ll both have to suffer the consequences of your actions for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>He grimaces with every word. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, turning toward me.</p><p>I hold up my hand to stop him from saying anything else. \u201cDon\u2019t. You can leave now. Have fun in England.\u201d</p><p>I can see the war waging inside of him. He knows he can\u2019t get anywhere with me in this moment, no matter how hard he wants to beg for my forgiveness. He knows the only choice he has is to turn and walk out that door, even though it\u2019s the last thing he wants to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he finally forces himself out the door, I run and lock it. I slide down to the floor and hug my knees, burying my face against them. I\u2019m shaking so hard, I can feel my teeth chatter.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe part of that man is growing inside me. And I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll one day have to admit that to him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>After Ryle left me his keys this afternoon; I debated going back to our new apartment. I even had a cab pull up to the building, but I couldn\u2019t force myself out of the car. I knew if I went back there today, I\u2019d probably see Allysa at some point. I\u2019m not ready to explain the stitches on my forehead to her. I\u2019m not ready to see the kitchen where Ryle\u2019s harsh words cut through me. I\u2019m not ready to walk into the bedroom where I was completely destroyed.</p> <p>So instead of returning to my own home, I took the cab back to Atlas\u2019s house. It feels like my only safe zone right now. I don\u2019t have to confront things when I\u2019m hiding out here.</p><p>Atlas has already texted me twice today checking on me, so when I get a text a few minutes before seven o\u2019clock in the evening, I assume it\u2019s from him. It\u2019s not; it\u2019s from Allysa.</p><p>Allysa: You home from work yet? Come up and visit us, I\u2019m already bored.</p><p>My heart sinks when I read her text. She has no idea what happened between me and Ryle. I wonder if Ryle even told her he left for England today. My thumb types and erases and types some more as I try to come up with a good excuse as to why I\u2019m not there.</p><p>Me: I can\u2019t. I\u2019m in the emergency room. Hit my head on that shelf in the storage room at work. Getting stitches.</p> <p>I hate that I lied to her, but it\u2019ll save me from having to explain the cut and also why I\u2019m not home right now.</p><p>Allysa: Oh no! Are you alone? Marshall can come sit with you since Ryle is gone.</p><p>Okay, so she knows Ryle left for England. That\u2019s good. And she thinks we\u2019re fine. This is good. That means I have at least three months before I have to tell her the truth.</p><p>Look at me, sweeping shit under the rug just like my mother.</p><p>Me: No, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be finished up by the time Marshall could even get here. I\u2019ll come by tomorrow after work. Give Rylee a kiss for me.</p><p>I lock the screen on my phone and set it on my bed. It\u2019s dark outside now, so I immediately see the scroll of the headlights as someone pulls into the driveway. I instantly know that it isn\u2019t Atlas, because he uses the driveway to the side of the house and parks in the garage. My heart begins to race as fear rushes through me. Is it Ryle? Did he find out where Atlas lives?</p> <p>Moments later, there\u2019s a loud knock at the front door. More like pounding. The doorbell also rings.</p><p>I tiptoe to the window and barely move the curtains over far enough to take a look outside. I can\u2019t see who\u2019s at the door, but there\u2019s a truck in the driveway. It doesn\u2019t belong to Ryle.</p><p>Could it be Atlas\u2019s girlfriend? Cassie?</p><p>I grab my phone and make my way down the hallway, toward the living room. The pounding on the door and the chime of the doorbell are still going off simultaneously. Whoever is at the door is being ridiculously impatient. If it is Cassie, I already find her extremely annoying.</p><p>\u201cAtlas!\u201d a guy yells. \u201cOpen the damn door!\u201d</p><p>Another voice\u2014also male\u2014yells, \u201cMy balls are freezing up! They\u2019re raisins, man, open the door!\u201d</p><p>Before I open the door and let them know Atlas isn\u2019t home, I text him, hoping he\u2019s about to pull in the driveway and deal with this himself.</p><p>Me: Where are you? There are two men at your front door and I have no idea if I should let them in.</p> <p>I wait through more presses of the doorbell and more pounding, but Atlas doesn\u2019t immediately text me back. I finally walk to the door and leave the chain bolted, but unlock the deadbolt and open the door a few inches.</p><p>One of the guys is tall, about six feet or so. Despite the youthful look to his face, his hair is salt and pepper. Black with a little bit of gray sprinkled in. The other one is shorter by a few inches, with sandy brown hair and a baby face. They both look to be in their late twenties, maybe early thirties. The tall one\u2019s face twists into confusion. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asks, peeking through the door.</p><p>\u201cLily. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>The shorter one pushes in front of the taller one. \u201cIs Atlas here?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to tell them no, because then they\u2019ll know I\u2019m here alone. I don\u2019t necessarily hold much trust in the male population this week.</p><p>The phone in my hand rings and all three of us jump from the unexpectedness of it. It\u2019s Atlas. I swipe the answer button and bring it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Lily, they\u2019re just friends of mine. I forgot it was Friday, we always play poker on Fridays. I\u2019ll call them now and tell them to leave.\u201d</p><p>I look back at the two of them and they\u2019re just standing there, watching me. I feel bad that Atlas feels like he has to cancel his plans just because I\u2019m crashing at his house. I shut the door and unlock the deadbolt, then open the door again, motioning them inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Atlas. You don\u2019t have to cancel your plans. I was about to go to bed anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m on my way. I\u2019ll have them leave.\u201d</p><p>I still have the phone pressed to my ear when the two men enter the living room.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d I say to Atlas and then end the call. The next few seconds are awkward as the guys assess me and I assess them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are your names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Darin,\u201d the tall one says.</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d the shorter one says.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d I say to them, even though I already told them my name. \u201cAtlas will be here soon.\u201d I move to close the door and they seem to relax a little. Darin heads into the kitchen and helps himself to Atlas\u2019s refrigerator.</p> <p>Brad takes off his jacket and hangs it up. \u201cDo you know how to play poker, Lily?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years, but I used to play with friends in college.\u201d</p><p>Both of them walk toward the dining room table.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your head?\u201d Darin asks as he takes a seat. He asks it so casually, like it doesn\u2019t even cross his mind that it might be a sensitive subject.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I have an urge to give him the naked truth. Maybe I just want to see how someone will react when they find out my own husband did this to me.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband happened. We got into a fight two nights ago and he head-butted me. Atlas took me to the emergency room. They gave me six stitches and told me I was pregnant. Now I\u2019m hiding out here until I figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>Poor Darin is frozen, halfway between standing and sitting. He has no idea how to respond to that. Based on the look on his face, I think he\u2019s convinced I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>Brad pulls out his chair and takes a seat, pointing at me. \u201cYou should get some Rodan and Fields. The amp roller works wonders for scarring.\u201d</p><p>I immediately laugh at his random response. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Brad!\u201d Darin says, finally sinking into his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than your wife with this direct sales shit. You\u2019re like a walking infomercial.\u201d</p><p>Brad raises his hands in defense. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says innocently. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell her anything, I\u2019m being honest. The stuff works. You\u2019d know that if you\u2019d use it on your damn acne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Darin says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to be a perpetual teenager,\u201d Brad mutters. \u201cAcne isn\u2019t cool when you\u2019re thirty.\u201d</p><p>Brad pulls out the chair next to him while Darin begins shuffling a deck of cards. \u201cHave a seat, Lily. One of our friends decided to be an idiot and get married last week, and now his wife won\u2019t let him come to poker night anymore. You can be his fill-in until he gets a divorce.\u201d</p><p>I had every intention of hiding out in my room tonight, but these two make it hard to walk away. I take a seat next to Brad and reach across the table. \u201cHand me those,\u201d I say to Darin. He\u2019s shuffling the cards like a one-armed infant.</p><p>He raises an eyebrow and pushes the deck of cards across the table. I don\u2019t know much about card games, but I can shuffle cards like a pro.</p><p>I separate the cards into two piles and scoot them together, pressing my thumbs to the ends, watching as they beautifully intertwine. Darin and Brad are staring at the deck of cards, when there\u2019s another knock on the door. This time the door swings open without pause and a guy walks in dressed in what looks like a very expensive tweed jacket. There\u2019s a scarf wrapped around his neck, and he begins to unwind it as soon as he slams the door behind him. He nudges his head in my direction as he walks toward the kitchen. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s older than the other two, probably in his mid-forties.</p><p>Atlas definitely has an interesting mix of friends.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Lily,\u201d Brad says. \u201cShe\u2019s married to an asshole and just found out she\u2019s pregnant with the asshole\u2019s baby. Lily, this is Jimmy. He\u2019s pompous and arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPompous and arrogant are the same thing, idiot,\u201d Jimmy says. He pulls out the chair next to Darin and nudges his head at the cards in my hands. \u201cDid Atlas plant you here to hustle us? What kind of average person knows how to shuffle cards like that?\u201d</p><p>I smile and begin to pass cards out to each of them. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to play a round to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We\u2019re on our third round of bets when Atlas finally walks in. He closes the door behind him and looks around at the four of us. Brad said something funny right before Atlas opened the door, so I\u2019m in the middle of a fit of laughter when Atlas locks eyes with me. He nods his head toward the kitchen and begins walking in that direction.</p><p>\u201cFold,\u201d I say, laying my cards flat on the table as I stand up to follow him. When I get to the kitchen, he\u2019s standing where he isn\u2019t visible to the guys at the table. I walk over to him and lean against the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to ask them to leave?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m actually enjoying it. It\u2019s keeping my mind off things.\u201d</p><p>He nods and I can\u2019t help but notice how he smells like herbs. Rosemary, specifically. It makes me wish I could see him in action at his restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot really. I ate some leftover pasta a couple hours ago.\u201d</p><p>My hands are pressed into the counter on either side of me. He takes a step closer and puts one of his hands over mine, brushing his thumb across the top of it. I know he doesn\u2019t mean for it to be anything more than a comforting gesture, but when he touches me, it feels like a whole lot more. A rush of warmth moves up my chest and I immediately drop my eyes to our hands. Atlas pauses his thumb for a second, like he feels it, too. He pulls his h and away and backs up a step.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters, turning toward the refrigerator, pretending to look for something. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s trying to spare me from the awkwardness of what just happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk back to the table and pick up my cards for the next round. A couple of minutes later, Atlas walks over and takes the seat next to me. Jimmy shuffles out a round of new cards to everyone. \u201cSo, Atlas. How do you and Lily know each other?\u201d</p><p>Atlas picks up his cards one at a time. \u201cLily saved my life when we were kids,\u201d he says, matter-of-fact. He glances over at me and winks, and I drown in guilt for the way that wink makes me feel. Especially at a time like this. Why is my heart doing this to me?</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d Brad says. \u201cLily saved your life, now you\u2019re saving hers.\u201d</p><p>Atlas lowers his cards and glares at Brad. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Brad says. \u201cMe and Lily are tight, she knows I\u2019m kidding.\u201d Brad looks at me. \u201cYour life might be complete crap right now, Lily, but it\u2019ll get better. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>Darin laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been beat up and pregnant and hiding out at another man\u2019s house?\u201d he says to Brad.</p><p>Atlas slaps his cards on the table and pushes back in his chair. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d he yells at Darin.</p><p>I reach over and squeeze his arm reassuringly. \u201cRelax,\u201d I say. \u201cWe bonded before you got here. I actually don\u2019t mind that they\u2019re making light of my situation. It really does make it a little less heavy.\u201d</p><p>He runs a frustrated hand through his hair, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d he says. \u201cYou were alone with them for ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cYou can learn a lot about someone in ten minutes.\u201d I try to redirect the conversation. \u201cSo how do you all know each other?\u201d</p><p>Darin leans forward and points at himself. \u201cI\u2019m the sous chef at Bib\u2019s.\u201d He points at Brad. \u201cHe\u2019s the dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Brad interjects. \u201cI\u2019m working my way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I say to Jimmy.</p><p>He smirks and says, \u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><p>Based on the way he dresses and the fact that he\u2019s been called arrogant and pompous, I\u2019d have to assume . . . \u201cMa\u00eetre d\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Atlas laughs. \u201cJimmy actually works in valet.\u201d</p><p>I glance back at Jimmy and raise an eyebrow. He tosses three poker chips down and says, \u201cIt\u2019s true. I park cars for tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you,\u201d Atlas says. \u201cHe works in valet, but only because he\u2019s so rich he gets bored.\u201d</p><p>I smile. It reminds me of Allysa. \u201cI have an employee like that. Only works because she\u2019s bored. She\u2019s actually the best employee I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Jimmy mutters.</p><p>I take a look at my cards when it\u2019s my turn and toss in the three poker chips. Atlas\u2019s phone rings and he pulls it out of his pocket. I\u2019m raising the pot with another chip when he excuses himself from the table to take the call.</p><p>\u201cFold,\u201d Brad says, slapping his cards on the table.</p><p>I\u2019m watching the hallway Atlas just disappeared down in a hurry. It makes me wonder if he\u2019s talking to Cassie, or if there\u2019s someone else in his life. I know what he does for a living. I know he has at least three friends. I just know nothing about his love life.</p> <p>Darin lays his cards on the table. Four of a kind. I lay down my straight flush and reach forward for all the poker chips as Darin groans.</p><p>\u201cSo does Cassie not usually come to poker night?\u201d I ask, fishing for more information on Atlas. Information I\u2019m too scared to ask him myself.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Brad says.</p><p>I stack my winnings up in front of me and nod. \u201cIsn\u2019t that his girlfriend\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Darin laughs. \u201cAtlas doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend. I\u2019ve known him for two years and he\u2019s never mentioned anyone named Cassie.\u201d He begins passing out new cards, but I\u2019m trying to absorb the information he just gave me. I pick up my first two cards when Atlas walks back into the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Atlas,\u201d Jimmy says. \u201cWho the hell is Cassie and how come we\u2019ve never heard you talk about her?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>I\u2019m completely mortified. I tighten my grip around the cards in my hands and try to avoid looking up at Atlas, but the room grows so quiet, it would be more obvious if I didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at Jimmy. Jimmy is staring at him. Brad and Darin are staring at me.</p><p>Atlas folds his lips together for a moment and then says, \u201cThere is no Cassie.\u201d His eyes meet mine, but only for a brief second. But in that brief second, I can see it written all over his face.</p><p>There never was a Cassie.</p><p>He lied to me.</p><p>Atlas clears his throat and then says, \u201cListen, guys. I should have cancelled tonight. This week has been kind of . . .\u201d He rubs his hand over his mouth and Jimmy stands up.</p><p>He squeezes Atlas on the shoulder and says, \u201cNext week. My place.\u201d</p><p>Atlas nods appreciatively. The three of them begin to gather their cards and poker chips. Brad pries my cards from my fingers apologetically because I\u2019m unable to move as I clutch them tightly.</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely meeting you, Lily,\u201d Brad says. I somehow find the strength to smile and stand up. I give them all hugs goodbye and after the front door closes behind them, it\u2019s just me and Atlas in the room.</p><p>And no Cassie.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s never even been in this room, because Cassie doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Atlas hasn\u2019t moved from his spot near the table. Neither have I. He\u2019s standing firm with his arms folded across his chest. His head is slightly tilted down but his eyes are boring into me from across the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why would he lie to me?</p><p>Ryle and I weren\u2019t even an official couple yet when I ran into Atlas at that restaurant the first time. Hell, if Atlas had given me any reason to believe there was a chance between us that night, I know without a doubt that I would have chosen him over Ryle. I barely even knew Ryle at that point.</p><p>But Atlas didn\u2019t say anything. He lied to me and told me he\u2019d been in a relationship for an entire year. Why? Why would he do that unless he didn\u2019t want me to think I had a chance with him?</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ve been wrong all this time. Maybe he never even loved me to begin with and he knew that inventing this Cassie person would keep me away from him for good.</p><p>Yet, here I am. Crashing at his house. Interacting with his friends. Eating his food. Using his shower.</p><p>I can feel the tears begin to sting my eyes and the last thing I want is to stand in front of him and cry right now. I walk around the table and rush past him. I don\u2019t make it far when he grabs my hand. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>I stop, still facing the other direction.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Lily.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right behind me now, his hand still wrapped around mine. I pull it away from him and walk to the other side of the living room.</p><p>I spin and face him just as the first tear rolls down my cheek. \u201cWhy did you never come back for me?\u201d</p><p>He looked prepared for anything to come out of my mouth other than the words I just spoke to him. He runs a hand through his hair and walks to the couch, taking a seat. After blowing out a calming breath, he carefully looks over at me.</p><p>\u201cI did, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t allow air to move in or out of my lungs.</p><p>I stand completely still, processing his answer.</p><p>He came back for me?</p><p>He folds his hands together in front of him. \u201cWhen I got out of the Marines the first time, I went back to Maine, hoping to find you. I asked around and found out which college you went to. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I showed up, because we were two different people by then. It had been four years since we saw each other. I knew a lot about both of us had probably changed in those four years.\u201d</p><p>My knees feel weak, so I walk to the chair next to him and lower myself. He came back for me?</p><p>\u201cI walked around your campus the whole day looking for you. Finally, late that afternoon, I saw you. You were sitting in the courtyard with a group of your friends. I watched you for a long time, trying to work up the courage to walk over to you. You were laughing. You looked happy. You were vibrant like I\u2019d never seen you before. I had never felt that kind of happiness for another person like I felt when I saw you that day. Just knowing you were okay . . .\u201d</p><p>He pauses for a moment. My hands are clenched around my stomach, because it hurts. It hurts knowing I was so close to him and I didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>\u201cI began walking toward you when someone came up behind you. A guy. He dropped to his knees next to you and when you saw him, you smiled and threw your arms around him. Then you kissed him.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. He was just a boy I dated for six months. He never even made me feel a fraction of what I had felt for Atlas.</p><p>He blows out a sharp breath. \u201cI left after that. When I saw that you were happy, it was the worst and best feeling a person could ever have at once. But I believed at that point that my life was still not good enough for you. I had nothing to offer you but love, and to me, you deserved more than that. The next day I signed up for another tour in the Marines. And now . . .\u201d He tosses his hand up lazily in the air, like nothing about his life is impressive.</p><p>I bury my head in my hands to take a moment. I quietly grieve what could have been. What is. What wasn\u2019t. My fingers move to the tattoo on my shoulder. I begin to wonder if I\u2019ll ever be able to fill in that hole now.</p> <p>It makes me wonder if Atlas ever feels like I felt when I got this tattoo. Like all the air is being let out of his heart.</p><p>I still don\u2019t understand why he lied to me after running into me at his restaurant. If he really felt the things I felt for him, why would he make something like that up?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie about having a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He rubs a hand over his face and I can already see the regret before I even hear it in his voice. \u201cI said that because . . . you looked happy that night. When I saw you telling him goodbye, it hurt like hell, but at the same time I was relieved that you seemed to be in a really good place. I didn\u2019t want you to worry about me. And I don\u2019t know . . . maybe I was a little jealous. I don\u2019t know, Lily. I regretted lying to you as soon as I did it.\u201d</p><p>My hand goes to my mouth. My mind starts to race just as fast as my heart is racing. I instantly start thinking about the what-ifs. What if he would have been honest with me? Told me how he\u2019d felt? Where would we be now?</p><p>I want to ask him why he did it. Why he didn\u2019t fight for me. But I don\u2019t have to ask him, because I already know the answer. He thought he was giving me what I wanted, because all he\u2019s ever wanted for me was happiness. And for some stupid reason, he\u2019s never felt I could get that with him.</p><p>Considerate Atlas.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more difficult it becomes to breathe. I think about Atlas. Ryle. Tonight. Two nights ago. It\u2019s too much.</p><p>I stand up and make my way back to the guest bedroom. I pick up my phone and grab my purse and go back to the living room. Atlas hasn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cRyle left for England today,\u201d I say. \u201cI think I should probably go home now. Can you drive me?\u201d</p><p>A sadness enters his eyes and when it does, I know that leaving is the right thing to do. Neither of us has closure. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll ever get it. I\u2019m beginning to think closure is a myth, and being here right now while I\u2019m still processing everything that\u2019s happening to my life is just going to make things worse for me. I have to eliminate as much confusion as possible, and right now, my feelings for Atlas top the list of most confusing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He presses his lips tightly together for a moment, and then he nods and grabs his keys.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Neither of us speaks the entire drive to my apartment. He doesn\u2019t drop me off. He pulls into the parking lot and gets out of his car. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if you let me walk you up,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod and we wade through even more silence as we ride the elevator up to the seventh floor. He follows me all the way to my apartment. I fish around in my purse for the keys and don\u2019t even realize my hands are shaking until my third failed attempt to open the door. Atlas calmly takes the keys from me and I step aside as he opens the door for me.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to make sure no one\u2019s here?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. I know Ryle isn\u2019t here because he\u2019s on his way to England, but I\u2019m honestly still a little scared to walk into the apartment by myself.</p><p>Atlas walks in before me and flips on the lights. He continues walking through the apartment, flipping on all the lights and walking into each of the rooms. When he makes it back to the living room, he slides his hands in his jacket pockets. He takes a deep breath and then says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens next, Lily.\u201d</p><p>He does. He knows. He just doesn\u2019t want it to happen, because we both know how much it hurts to say goodbye to each other.</p><p>I look away from him because seeing the look on his face right now cuts straight to my heart. I fold my arms over my chest and stare at the floor. \u201cI have a lot to work through, Atlas. A lot. And I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to do it with you in my life.\u201d I lift my eyes back to his. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t take offense to that, because if anything, it\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p> <p>He regards me silently for a moment, not at all surprised by what I\u2019m saying. But I can see there\u2019s so much he wants to say. There\u2019s a lot I wish I could say to him, too, but we both know discussing the two of us isn\u2019t appropriate at this point. I\u2019m married. I\u2019m pregnant with another man\u2019s baby. And he\u2019s standing in the living room of an apartment that another man bought for me. I\u2019d say these aren\u2019t very good conditions in which to bring up all the things we should have said to each other a long time ago.</p><p>He looks at the door momentarily as if he\u2019s trying to decide to leave or speak. I can see the twitch in his jaw right before he locks eyes with me. \u201cIf you ever need me, I want you to call me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only if it\u2019s an emergency. I\u2019m not capable of being casual with you, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken aback by his words, but only momentarily. As much as I wasn\u2019t expecting him to admit it, he\u2019s absolutely right. Since the day we met, there has been nothing casual about our relationship. It\u2019s either all in or not in at all. That\u2019s why he separated ties when he left for the military. He knew that a casual friendship would never work between us. It would have been too painful.</p><p>Apparently, that hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Atlas.\u201d</p><p>Saying those words again tears me up almost as much as the first time I had to say them. He winces and then turns and walks to the door like he can\u2019t leave fast enough. When the door closes behind him, I walk over and lock it, then press my head against it.</p> <p>Two days ago I was asking myself how my life could possibly get any better. Today I\u2019m asking myself how it could possibly get any worse.</p><p>I jump back with the sudden knock at the door. It\u2019s only been ten seconds since he walked out, so I know it\u2019s Atlas. I unlock it and open it and I\u2019m suddenly pressed against something soft. Atlas\u2019s arms wrap tightly around me, desperately, and his lips are pressed against the side of my head.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and finally let the tears fall. I\u2019ve cried so many tears for Ryle over the past two days, I have no idea how I still have any left for Atlas. But I do, because they\u2019re falling down my cheeks like rain.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he whispers, still holding me tightly. \u201cI know this is the last thing you need to hear right now. But I have to say it because I\u2019ve walked away from you too many times without saying what I really want to say.\u201d</p><p>He pulls back to look down at me and when he sees my tears, he brings his hands up to my cheeks. \u201cIn the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.\u201d He presses his lips against my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.\u201d</p><p>He releases me and walks away, not even needing a response.</p><p>When I close the door again, I slide to the floor. My heart feels like it wants to give up. I don\u2019t blame it. It\u2019s suffered through two separate heartaches in the course of two days.</p><p>And I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a long time before either of those heartaches can even begin to heal.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Allysa drops onto the couch beside me and Rylee. \u201cI miss you so much, Lily,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about coming back to work a day or two a week.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, a little shocked by her comment. \u201cI live downstairs and I visit almost every day. How can you possibly miss me?\u201d</p><p>She pouts as she pulls her legs up beneath her. \u201cFine, it\u2019s not you I miss. I miss work. And sometimes I just want out of this house.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been six weeks since she had Rylee, so I\u2019m sure she would be cleared to come back to work. But I honestly didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even want to come back now that she has Rylee. I bend forward and give Rylee a kiss on her nose. \u201cWould you bring Rylee with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allysa shakes her head. \u201cNo, you keep me too busy for that. Marshall can watch her while I work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t have people for that?\u201d</p><p>Marshall is passing through the living room when he hears me say that. \u201cShush, Lily. Don\u2019t speak like a rich girl in front of my daughter. Blasphemy.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. That\u2019s why I come over here a few nights a week, because it\u2019s the only time I laugh. It\u2019s been six weeks since Ryle left for England, and no one knows what happened between us. Ryle hasn\u2019t told anyone, and neither have I. Everyone, my mother included, believes he simply left for the study at Cambridge and that nothing has changed between us.</p> <p>I also still haven\u2019t told anyone about the pregnancy.</p><p>I\u2019ve been to the doctor twice. It turns out I was already twelve weeks along the night I found out I was pregnant, which makes me eighteen weeks along now. I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it. I\u2019ve been on the pill since I was eighteen. Apparently being forgetful a few times caught up with me.</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to show, but it\u2019s cold out so it\u2019s been easy to hide. No one suspects a thing when you have on a baggy sweater and a jacket.</p><p>I know I need to tell someone soon, but I feel like Ryle should be the first one I tell, and I don\u2019t want to do that over a long-distance phone conversation. He\u2019ll be back in six weeks. If I can somehow keep things quiet until then, I\u2019ll decide where to go from there.</p><p>I look down at Rylee and she\u2019s smiling up at me. I make silly faces at her to make her smile more. There have been so many times I\u2019ve wanted to tell Allysa about the pregnancy, but it makes it hard when the secret I\u2019m keeping is being kept from her own brother. I don\u2019t want to put her in that kind of situation, no matter how much it kills me that I can\u2019t talk to her about it.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you holding up without Ryle?\u201d Allysa asks. \u201cYou ready for him to come home?\u201d</p><p>I nod, but I don\u2019t say anything. I always try to brush off the subject when she brings him up.</p><p>Allysa leans back into the couch and says, \u201cIs he still liking Cambridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, sticking my tongue out at Rylee. She grins. I wonder if my baby will look like her. I hope so. She\u2019s really cute, but I might be a little partial.</p><p>\u201cDid he ever figure out the subway system there?\u201d Allysa laughs. \u201cI swear, every time I talk to him, he\u2019s lost. He can\u2019t figure out whether to take the A-line or the B-line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe figured it out.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa sits up on the couch. \u201cMarshall!\u201d</p><p>Marshall walks into the living room and Allysa pulls Rylee out of my hands. She hands her to Marshall and says, \u201cWill you change her diaper?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why she asks him that. I just changed her diaper.</p><p>Marshall scrunches up his nose and lifts Rylee out of Allysa\u2019s arms. \u201cAre you a stinky girl?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re wearing matching onesies.</p><p>Allysa grabs my hands and yanks me off the couch so fast, I squeal.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer me. She marches toward her bedroom and then slams the door once we\u2019re both inside. She paces back and forth a few times and then she stops and faces me.</p> <p>\u201cYou better tell me what the hell is going on right now, Lily!\u201d</p><p>I pull back in shock. What is she talking about?</p><p>My hands instantly go to my stomach, because I think maybe she\u2019s noticed, but she doesn\u2019t look at my stomach. She takes a step forward and pokes a finger in my chest. \u201cThere is no subway system in Cambridge, England, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I am so confused.</p><p>\u201cI made that up!\u201d she says. \u201cSomething hasn\u2019t been right with you for a long time. You\u2019re my best friend, Lily. And I know my brother. I talk to him every week, and he isn\u2019t the same. Something happened between you two, and I want to know what it is right now!\u201d</p><p>Shit. I guess this is happening sooner rather than later.</p><p>I slowly bring my hands up to my mouth, not sure what to tell her. How much to tell her. I had no idea until this moment how much it\u2019s been killing me that I haven\u2019t been able to talk to her about this. I almost feel a little relieved that she reads me so well.</p><p>I walk to her bed and take a seat on it. \u201cAllysa,\u201d I whisper. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>I know this is going to hurt her almost as much as it hurt me. She walks over to her bed and sits down next to me, pulling my hands to hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes my hands, but says nothing. For the next fifteen minutes, I tell her everything. I tell her about the fight. I tell her about Atlas picking me up. I tell her about the hospital. I tell her about the pregnancy.</p><p>I tell her about how, for the last six weeks, I cry myself to sleep every night because I have never felt so alone and so scared.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished telling her everything, we\u2019re both crying. She hasn\u2019t responded to what I\u2019ve told her with anything other than the occasional \u201cOh, Lily.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to respond, though. Ryle is her brother. I know she wants me to take his past into consideration just like the last time it happened. I know she\u2019ll want me to work things out with him because he\u2019s her brother. We\u2019re supposed to be one big, happy family. I know exactly what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a long time as she struggles through everything I\u2019ve told her. She finally lifts her eyes to mine and squeezes my hands. \u201cMy brother loves you, Lily. He loves you so much. You have changed his entire life and have made him someone that I never thought he could be. As his sister, I wish more than anything that you could find a way to forgive him. But as your best friend, I have to tell you that if you take him back, I will never speak to you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It takes a moment for her words to register, but when they do, I start sobbing.</p><p>She starts sobbing.</p><p>She wraps her arms around me and we cry over the mutual love we have for Ryle. We cry over how much we hate him right now.</p><p>After several minutes of us sobbing pathetically on her bed, she releases me and walks over to her dresser to retrieve a box of tissues.</p> <p>We\u2019re both wiping our eyes and sniffling when I say, \u201cYou\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. And now I\u2019m gonna be the best aunt.\u201d She wipes her nose and sniffles again, but she\u2019s smiling. \u201cLily. You\u2019re having a baby.\u201d She says it with excitement, and it\u2019s the first moment I\u2019ve been able to share any sense of joy over my pregnancy. \u201cI hate to say it, but I noticed you put on weight. I thought you were just depressed and eating a lot since Ryle left.\u201d</p><p>She walks to the back of her closet and starts pulling things out for me. \u201cI have so many maternity clothes to give you.\u201d</p><p>We start going through clothes and she pulls down a suitcase and opens it. She begins to throw things toward the suitcase until it starts to overflow.</p><p>\u201cI could never wear these,\u201d I tell her, holding up a shirt that still has the tag on it. \u201cThey\u2019re all designer. I\u2019ll get them dirty.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs and shoves them into the suitcase anyway. \u201cI won\u2019t need them back. If I get pregnant again, I\u2019ll just have my people buy me more.\u201d She pulls a shirt off a hanger and hands it to me. \u201cHere, try this one on.\u201d</p><p>I take my shirt off and then pull the maternity shirt over my head. When I get it into place, I look in the mirror.</p><p>I look . . . pregnant. Like you-can\u2019t-hide-this-shit pregnant.</p><p>She puts a hand on my stomach and stares in the mirror with me. \u201cHave you found out if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s a girl,\u201d she says. \u201cOur daughters can be besties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>We both spin around to find Marshall standing in the doorway. His eyes are on my stomach. On Allysa\u2019s hand still on my stomach. He tilts his head. He points at me.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d he says, confused. \u201cLily, there\u2019s a . . . do you realize you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Allysa calmly walks to the door and puts her hand on the doorknob. \u201cThere are some things you are never, ever to repeat if you want to keep me as your wife. This is one of those things. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Marshall raises his eyebrows and takes a step back. \u201cYes. Okay. Got it. Lily is not pregnant.\u201d He kisses Allysa on the forehead and looks back at me. \u201cI am not telling you congratulations, Lily. For absolutely nothing.\u201d Allysa shoves him all the way out the door and closes it, then turns back to me.</p><p>\u201cWe need to plan a baby shower,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to tell Ryle first.\u201d</p><p>She waves her hand dismissively. \u201cWe don\u2019t need him to plan a shower. We\u2019ll just keep it between the two of us until then.\u201d</p> <p>She pulls out her laptop, and for the first time since I found out I was pregnant, I feel happy about it.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>It\u2019s rather convenient only having to take an elevator to get home from Allysa\u2019s, as much as I want to move out of my own apartment at times. It\u2019s still strange living there. We only lived there a week before we split up and Ryle left for England. It never even had the chance to feel like home and now it feels a little tainted. I haven\u2019t even been able to sleep in our bedroom since that night, so I\u2019ve been sleeping in the guest room on my old bed.</p><p>Allysa and Marshall are still the only ones who know about the pregnancy. It\u2019s only been two weeks since I told them, which makes me twenty weeks along now. I know I should tell my mother, but Ryle will be back in a few weeks. I feel like I should tell him first before anyone else finds out. If I can just somehow hide my baby bump from her until he gets back to the States.</p><p>I should probably just accept the fact that I\u2019m more than likely going to have to call him and tell him long-distance. I haven\u2019t seen my mother face-to-face in two weeks. It\u2019s the longest we\u2019ve gone without seeing each other since she moved to Boston, so if something doesn\u2019t happen soon she\u2019ll show up at my front door when I\u2019m not prepared.</p><p>I swear my stomach has doubled in size these last two weeks alone. If someone sees me who knows me well, it\u2019ll be impossible to hide. So far, no one at the floral shop has asked about it. I think I\u2019m still on the cusp of \u201cIs she pregnant? Or just chubby?\u201d</p><p>I start to unlock the door to my apartment, but it begins to open from the other side. Before I can pull the jacket over to hide my stomach from whoever is on the other side of the door, Ryle\u2019s eyes land on me. I\u2019m wearing one of the shirts Allysa gave me and it\u2019s kind of impossible to hide the fact that I\u2019m wearing a maternity shirt when he\u2019s staring right at it.</p><p>Ryle.</p><p>Ryle is here.</p><p>My heart begins to smash against the walls of my chest. My neck begins to itch, so I bring my hand up and rest it there, feeling the pounding of my heart against my palm.</p><p>It\u2019s pounding because I\u2019m terrified of him.</p><p>It\u2019s pounding because I hate him.</p><p>It\u2019s pounding because I\u2019ve missed him.</p><p>His eyes slowly crawl from my stomach to my face. A hurtful expression takes over him, like I\u2019ve just stabbed him straight through the heart. He takes a step back into my apartment and his hands come up to his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He begins to shake his head in confusion. I can see the betrayal all over his face when he barely forces out my name. \u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>I stand frozen, one hand on my stomach in protection, the other hand still flat against my chest. I\u2019m too scared to move or say anything. I don\u2019t want to react until I know exactly how he\u2019s going to react.</p><p>When he sees the fear in my eyes and the small gasps of breath I\u2019m barely inhaling, he holds up a reassuring palm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Lily. I\u2019m just here to talk to you.\u201d He swings the door open wider and points into the living room. \u201cLook.\u201d He steps aside and my eyes fall to someone standing behind him.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m the one who feels betrayed.</p><p>\u201cMarshall?\u201d</p><p>Marshall immediately holds up his hands in defense. \u201cI had no idea he was coming home early, Lily. Ryle texted and asked for my help. He specifically told me not to say anything to you or Issa. Please don\u2019t let her divorce me, I\u2019m simply an innocent bystander.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying to understand what I\u2019m seeing.</p><p>\u201cI asked him to meet me here so you\u2019d feel more comfortable talking to me,\u201d Ryle says. \u201cHe\u2019s here for you, he\u2019s not here for me.\u201d</p> <p>I glance back at Marshall and he nods. It gives me enough reassurance to enter the apartment. Ryle is still somewhat in shock, which is understandable. His eyes keep meeting my stomach and then flicking away like it hurts to look at me. He runs two hands through his hair and then points down the hallway while looking at Marshall.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the bedroom. If you hear me get . . . if I start to yell . . .\u201d</p><p>Marshall knows what Ryle is asking him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>As I follow Ryle into my bedroom, I wonder what that must be like. To have no idea what might set you off or how bad your reaction will be. To have absolutely no control over your own emotions.</p><p>For a brief moment, I feel a minuscule amount of sorrow for him. But when my eyes fall to our bed and I remember that night, my sorrow diminishes completely.</p><p>Ryle pushes the door shut, but doesn\u2019t close it all the way. He looks like he\u2019s aged an entire year in the two months it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen him. The bags under his eyes, the furrowed brow, the sunken posture. If regret took human form, it would look identical to Ryle.</p> <p>His eyes fall to my stomach again and he takes a slow step forward. Then another. He\u2019s cautious, as he should be. He reaches out a timid hand, asking for permission to touch me. I nod softly.</p><p>He takes one more step forward and then places a steady palm against my stomach.</p><p>I can feel the warmth of his hand through my shirt, and my eyes snap shut. Despite the resentment I\u2019ve built up in my heart toward him, it doesn\u2019t mean the emotions aren\u2019t still there. Just because someone hurts you doesn\u2019t mean you can simply stop loving them. It\u2019s not a person\u2019s actions that hurt the most. It\u2019s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.</p><p>He moves his hand over my stomach and I open my eyes again. He\u2019s shaking his head, like he can\u2019t process what\u2019s happening right now. I watch as he slowly sinks to his knees in front of me.</p><p>His arms snake around my waist and he presses his lips against my stomach. He clasps his hands around my lower back and presses his forehead against me.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to describe what I feel for him in this moment. Like any mother would want for her child, it\u2019s a beautiful thing to see the love he already has. It\u2019s been hard not sharing this with anyone. It\u2019s hard not being able to share this with him, no matter how much resentment I hold toward him. My hands go to his hair while he holds me against him. Part of me wants to scream at him and call the police like I should have done that night. Part of me feels for that little boy who held his brother in his arms and watched him die. Part of me wishes I would have never met him. Part of me wishes I could forgive him.</p><p>He unwraps his arms from around my waist and presses a hand into the mattress next to us. He pulls himself up and then sits on the bed. His elbows rest on his knees and his hands are drawn up to his mouth.</p><p>I sit next to him, knowing we have to have this conversation, but not wanting to. \u201cNaked truths?\u201d</p> <p>He nods.</p><p>I don\u2019t know which one of us is supposed to go first. I don\u2019t really have much to say to him at this point, so I wait for him to speak first.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start, Lily.\u201d He rubs his hands down his face.</p><p>\u201cHow about you start with, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I attacked you.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine, wide with certainty. \u201cLily, you have no idea. I am so sorry. You have no idea what I\u2019ve been through these past two months knowing what I\u2019ve done to you.\u201d</p><p>I clench my teeth together. I can feel my fingers as they fist around the blanket beside me.</p><p>I have no idea what he\u2019s been through?</p><p>I shake my head, slowly. \u201cYou have no idea, Ryle.\u201d</p><p>I stand up, the anger and hatred spilling out of me. I spin, pointing at him. \u201cYou have no idea! You have no idea what it\u2019s like to go through what you\u2019ve put me through! To fear for your life at the hands of the man you love? To get physically sick just thinking about what he\u2019s done to you? You have no idea, Ryle! None! Fuck you! Fuck you for doing this to me!\u201d</p><p>I suck in a huge breath, shocked at myself. The anger just came like a wave. I swipe at my tears and spin around, unable to look at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yell, spinning around again. \u201cI am not finished! You don\u2019t get to say your truth until I\u2019ve said mine!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s grabbing at his jaw, squeezing the stress out of it. He drops his eyes to the floor, unable to look at the rage in mine. I take three steps toward him and drop to my knees. I place my hands on his legs, forcing him to look me straight in the eyes while I speak to him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I kept the magnet Atlas gave me when we were kids. Yes. I kept the journals. No, I didn\u2019t tell you about my tattoo. Yes, I probably should have. And yes, I still love him. And I\u2019ll love him until I die, because he was a huge part of my life. And yes, I\u2019m sure that hurts you. But none of that gave you the right to do what you did to me. Even if you would have walked into my bedroom and caught us in bed together, you still would not have the right to lay a hand on me, you goddamn son of a bitch!\u201d</p> <p>I push off his knees and stand up again. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn!\u201d I yell.</p><p>I continue pacing the room. My heart is pounding like it wants out. I wish I could give it a way out. I\u2019d set the motherfucker free right now if I could.</p><p>Several minutes pass as I continue to pace. Ryle\u2019s silence and my anger eventually just fold together into pain.</p><p>My tears have exhausted me. I am so tired of feeling. I fall desperately onto my bed and cry into my pillow. I press my face so hard against my pillow, I can barely breathe.</p><p>I feel Ryle lie down next to me. He places a gentle hand on the back of my head, attempting to sooth away the pain he\u2019s causing me. My eyes are closed, still pressed into the pillow, but I feel him gently rest his head against mine.</p> <p>\u201cMy truth is that I have absolutely nothing to say,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to take back what I did to you. And you\u2019ll never believe me if I promise it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d He presses a kiss against my head. \u201cYou are my world, Lily. My world. When I woke up on this bed that night and you were gone, I knew I would never get you back. I came here to tell you how incredibly sorry I am. I came to tell you I was taking that job offer in Minnesota. I came to tell you goodbye. But Lily . . .\u201d His lips press against my head again and he exhales sharply. \u201cLily, I can\u2019t do that now. You have a part of me inside of you. And I already love this baby more than I\u2019ve ever loved anything in my whole life.\u201d His voice cracks and he grips me even harder. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take this away from me, Lily. Please.\u201d</p><p>The pain in his voice ripples through me, and when I lift my tear-soaked face to look at him, he presses his lips desperately to mine and then pulls back. \u201cPlease, Lily. I love you. Help me.\u201d</p><p>His lips briefly meet mine again. When I don\u2019t push him away, his mouth comes back a third time.</p><p>A fourth.</p><p>When his lips meet mine the fifth time, they don\u2019t leave.</p><p>He wraps his arms around me and pulls me to him. My body is tired and weak, but it remembers him. My body remembers how his body can soothe everything I\u2019m feeling. How his has a gentleness in it that my body has been craving for two months now.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers against my mouth. His tongue sweeps softly against mine and it\u2019s so wrong and so good and so painful. Before I know it, I\u2019m on my back and he\u2019s crawling on top of me. His touch is everything I need and everything I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>His hand wraps in my hair and in an instant, I\u2019m transferred back to that night.</p><p>I\u2019m in the kitchen, and his hand is tugging my hair so hard it hurts.</p><p>He brushes the hair from my face and in an instant, I\u2019m transferred back to that night.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in the doorway, and his hand is trailing across my shoulder, right before he bites into me with all the strength in his jaw.</p><p>His forehead rests gently against mine and in an instant, I\u2019m transferred back to that night.</p><p>I\u2019m on this same bed beneath him when he slams his head against mine so hard I have to get six stitches.</p><p>My body becomes unresponsive to his. The anger begins to roll back over me. His mouth stops moving against mine when he feels me freeze.</p> <p>When he pulls back and looks down on me, I don\u2019t even have to say anything. Our eyes, locked together, speak more naked truths than our mouths ever have. My eyes are telling his that I can no longer stand being touched by him. His eyes are telling mine that he already knows.</p><p>He begins to nod, slowly.</p><p>He backs away from me, crawling down my body until he\u2019s at the edge of the bed with his back to me. He\u2019s still nodding as he comes to a slow stand, fully aware that he\u2019s not getting my forgiveness tonight. He begins heading toward my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>He half-turns, looking back at me from the doorway.</p><p>I lift my chin, looking at him with finality. \u201cI wish this baby wasn\u2019t yours, Ryle. With everything that I am, I wish this baby was not a part of you.\u201d</p><p>If I thought his world couldn\u2019t crumble more, I was wrong.</p><p>He walks out of my bedroom and I press my face into my pillow. I thought if I could just hurt him like he had hurt me, I would feel avenged.</p><p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, I feel vindictive and mean.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m my father.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Mom: I miss you. When am I going to see you?</p><p>I stare at the text. It\u2019s been two days since Ryle found out I\u2019m pregnant. I know it\u2019s time to tell my mother. I\u2019m not nervous about telling her I\u2019m pregnant. The only thing that scares me is discussing my situation with Ryle with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Me: Miss you, too.

It\u2019s homemade pizza night.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been to Allysa\u2019s in a few days. Since before Ryle came home. I\u2019m not sure where he\u2019s staying, but I assume it\u2019s with them. The last thing I want right now is to have to be in the same apartment as him.</p><p>Me: Who all will be there?</p><p>Allysa: Lily . . . I wouldn\u2019t do that to you. He\u2019s working until 8 tomorrow morning. It\u2019ll just be the three of us.</p><p>She knows me way too well.

Rylee was asleep when I got here, but I woke her up so I could hold her. Allysa didn\u2019t mind; she said she doesn\u2019t want her wide awake when she\u2019s ready to go to bed.</p><p>\u201cBreast milk,\u201d Marshall says with a mouthful. \u201cBut sometimes I stick my finger in my soda and put it in her mouth so she can taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall!\u201d Allysa yells. \u201cYou better be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally kidding,\u201d he says, although I can\u2019t tell if he really is.</p><p>\u201cBut when do they start eating baby food?\u201d I ask. I figure I need to learn this stuff before giving birth.</p><p>\u201cAround four months,\u201d Allysa says with a yawn. She drops her fork and leans back in her chair, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to keep her at my place tonight so you guys can get a full night of sleep?\u201d</p><p>Allysa says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d at the same time Marshall says, \u201cThat would be awesome.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cReally. I live right downstairs. I don\u2019t work tomorrow so if I don\u2019t get any sleep tonight I can just sleep in tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Allysa looks like she\u2019s contemplating it for a moment. \u201cI could leave my cell phone on in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>I look back down at Rylee and grin. \u201cDid you hear that? You get to have a sleepover with Aunt Lily!\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>With everything Allysa is throwing in her diaper bag, it looks like I\u2019m about to take Rylee on a trip across the country. \u201cShe\u2019ll let you know when she\u2019s hungry. Don\u2019t use the microwave to heat the milk, just put it in . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI\u2019ve made her like fifty bottles since she\u2019s been alive.\u201d</p> <p>Allysa nods and then walks over to her bed. She drops the diaper bag down beside me. Marshall is in the living room feeding Rylee one last time, so Allysa lies down beside me on the bed while we wait. She props her head up on her hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get to have sex tonight. It\u2019s been four months.\u201d</p><p>I crinkle up my nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and falls down on her pillow, but then sits straight up. \u201cShit,\u201d she says. \u201cI should probably shave my legs. I think it\u2019s been four months since I did that, too.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, but then I gasp. My hands move quickly to my stomach. \u201cOh my God! I just felt something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Allysa puts her hand on my stomach and we\u2019re both quiet for the next five minutes as we wait for it to happen again. It does, but it\u2019s so soft, it\u2019s almost unnoticeable. I laugh again as soon as it happens.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d Allysa says, pouting. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll be a few more weeks before you can feel it from the outside, though. Is this the first time you felt it move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been scared I was growing the laziest baby in history.\u201d I keep my hands on my stomach, hoping to feel it again. We sit quietly for a few more minutes, and I can\u2019t help but wish my circumstances were different. Ryle should be here. He should be the one sitting beside me with his hand on my stomach. Not Allysa.</p><p>The thought almost takes away all the joy I\u2019m feeling. Allysa must notice because she puts one of her hands on mine and squeezes. When I look at her, she isn\u2019t smiling anymore.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to say something to you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. I don\u2019t like the sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She sighs and then forces a gloomy smile. \u201cI know you\u2019re sad that you\u2019re going through this without my brother. No matter how involved he is, I just want you to know that this is going to be the best thing you\u2019ve ever experienced in your life. You\u2019re gonna be a great mom, Lily. This baby is really lucky.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad Allysa is the only one in here right now, because her words make me laugh, cry, and snot like a hormonal teenager. I hug her and tell her thank you. It\u2019s amazing how hearing those words gives me back the joy I was feeling.</p><p>She smiles and then says, \u201cNow go get my baby and take her away from here so I can have some sex with my filthy rich husband.\u201d</p><p>I roll off the bed and stand up. \u201cYou sure know how to bring levity into a situation. I\u2019d say it\u2019s your strong point.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. Now go away.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Of all the secrets I\u2019ve held over the last few months, I\u2019m the saddest about keeping everything from my mother. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll take it. I know she\u2019ll be excited about the pregnancy, but I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll feel about me and Ryle splitting up. She loves Ryle. And based on her history with these types of situations, she\u2019ll probably find it very easy to excuse his behavior and try and convince me to take him back. And in all honesty, that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019ve been stalling this, because I\u2019m scared there\u2019s a chance she might be successful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most days I\u2019m strong. Most days I\u2019m so mad at him that the thought of ever forgiving him is ludicrous. But some days I miss him so much I can\u2019t breathe. I miss the fun I had with him. I miss making love to him. I miss missing him. He used to work so many hours that when he would walk in the front door at night I would rush across the room and jump in his arms because I missed him so much. I even miss how much he loved it when I would do that.</p><p>It\u2019s the not-so-strong days when I wish my mother knew about everything that was going on. I sometimes just want to drive over to her house and curl up on the couch with her while she tucks my hair behind my ear and tells me it\u2019ll all be okay. Sometimes even grown women need their mother\u2019s comfort so we can just take a break from having to be strong all the time.</p><p>I sit in my car, parked in her driveway, for a good five minutes before I work up the strength to go inside. It sucks that I have to do this because I know that in a way, I\u2019ll be breaking her heart, too. I hate it when she\u2019s sad and telling her I married a man who might be like my father is going to make her really sad.</p><p>When I walk through the front door, she\u2019s in the kitchen layering noodles in a pan. I don\u2019t remove my coat right away for obvious reasons. I\u2019m not wearing a maternity shirt but my bump is almost impossible to hide without a jacket. Especially from a mother.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie!\u201d she says.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and give her a side hug while she layers cheese over the top of the lasagna. Once the lasagna is in the oven, we walk over to the dining room table and take a seat. She leans back in her chair and takes a sip from a glass of tea.</p><p>She\u2019s smiling. I hate it even more that she looks so happy right now.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. I was coming over here to talk to her. I\u2019m not prepared to receive a talk.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask hesitantly.</p><p>She grips her glass of tea with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, shaking my head. \u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d I\u2019m about to say good, but then I grow instantly worried that she\u2019s just put herself in a similar situation she was in with my father. She can see the worry on my face, so she grabs my hands in both of hers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good, Lily. He\u2019s so good. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Relief washes over me in an instant, because I can see she\u2019s telling the truth. I can see the happiness in her eyes. \u201cWow,\u201d I say, not expecting this at all. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. When can I meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, if you want,\u201d she says. \u201cI can invite him over to eat with us.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNow\u2019s not a good time.\u201d</p><p>Her hands squeeze around mine as soon as she realizes I\u2019m here to tell her something important. I start with the better part of the news first.</p><p>I stand up and remove my jacket. At first, she doesn\u2019t think anything of it. She just assumes I\u2019m making myself comfortable. But then I take one of her hands and I press it against my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a grandma.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen and for several seconds, she\u2019s stunned speechless. But then tears begin to form. She jumps up and pulls me into a hug. \u201cLily!\u201d she says. \u201cOh my God!\u201d She pulls back, smiling. \u201cThat was so fast. Were you trying? You haven\u2019t even been married for very long.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. It was a shock. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and after another hug, we both sit down again. I try to keep up my smile, but it\u2019s not the smile of an elated expectant mother. She sees that almost immediately. She slides a hand over her mouth. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she whispers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Until this moment, I\u2019ve fought to remain strong. I\u2019ve fought to not feel too sorry for myself when I\u2019m around other people. But sitting here with my mother, I crave weakness. I just want to be able to give up for a little while. I want her to take over and hug me and tell me it\u2019ll all be okay. And for the next fifteen minutes while I cry in her arms, that\u2019s exactly what happens. I just stop fighting for myself because I need someone else to do it for me.</p> <p>I spare her most of the details of our relationship, but I do tell her the most important things. That he\u2019s hurt me on more than one occasion, and I don\u2019t know what to do. That I\u2019m scared to have this baby alone. That I\u2019m scared I might make the wrong decision. That I\u2019m scared I\u2019m being too weak and that I should have had him arrested. That I\u2019m scared I\u2019m being too sensitive and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting. Basically, I tell her everything I haven\u2019t even been brave enough to fully admit to myself.</p><p>She retrieves some napkins out of the kitchen and comes back to the table. After our eyes are finally dry, she begins to crumple the napkin up between her hands, rolling it over in circles as she stares down at it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take him back?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t say yes. But I also don\u2019t say no.</p><p>This is the first moment since this has happened that I\u2019m being completely honest. I\u2019m honest to her and to myself. Maybe because she\u2019s the only one I know who has been through this. She\u2019s the only one I know who would understand the massive amounts of confusion I\u2019ve been experiencing.</p><p>I shake my head, but I also shrug. \u201cMost of me feels like I\u2019ll never be able to trust him again. But a huge part of me grieves what I had with him. We were so good together, Mom. The times I spent with him were some of the best moments of my life. And occasionally I feel like maybe I don\u2019t want to give that up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wipe the napkin beneath my eye, soaking up more tears. \u201cSometimes . . . when I\u2019m really missing him . . . I tell myself that maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad. Maybe I could put up with him when he\u2019s at his worst just so I can have him when he\u2019s at his best.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand on top of mine and rubs her thumb back and forth. \u201cI know exactly what you mean, Lily. But the last thing you want to do is lose sight of your limit. Please don\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she means by that. She sees the confusion in my expression, so she squeezes my arm and explains in more detail.</p><p>\u201cWe all have a limit. What we\u2019re willing to put up with before we break. When I married your father, I knew exactly what my limit was. But slowly . . . with every incident . . . my limit was pushed a little more. And a little more. The first time your father hit me, he was immediately sorry. He swore it would never happen again. The second time he hit me, he was even more sorry. The third time it happened, it was more than a hit. It was a beating. And every single time, I took him back. But the fourth time, it was only a slap. And when that happened, I felt relieved. I remember thinking, \u2018At least he didn\u2019t beat me this time. This wasn\u2019t so bad.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>She brings the napkin up to her eyes and says, \u201cEvery incident chips away at your limit. Every time you choose to stay, it makes the next time that much harder to leave. Eventually, you lose sight of your limit altogether, because you start to think, \u2018I\u2019ve lasted five years now. What\u2019s five more?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She grabs my hands and holds them while I cry. \u201cDon\u2019t be like me, Lily. I know that you believe he loves you, and I\u2019m sure he does. But he\u2019s not loving you the right way. He doesn\u2019t love you the way you deserve to be loved. If Ryle truly loves you, he wouldn\u2019t allow you to take him back. He would make the decision to leave you himself so that he knows for a fact he can never hurt you again. That\u2019s the kind of love a woman deserves, Lily.\u201d</p><p>I wish with all my heart that she didn\u2019t learn these things from experience. I pull her to me and hug her.</p><p>For whatever reason, I thought I would have to defend myself to her when I came over here. Not once did I think I would come over here and learn from her. I should know better. I thought my mother was weak in the past, but she\u2019s actually one of the strongest women I know.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I say, pulling back. \u201cI want to be you when I grow up.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs and brushes the hair from my face. I can see in the way she looks at me that she\u2019d trade spots with me in a heartbeat. She\u2019s feeling more pain for me in this moment than she ever felt for herself. \u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d she says.</p><p>She reaches for my hands again.</p><p>\u201cThe day you gave your father\u2019s eulogy? I know you didn\u2019t freeze up, Lily. You stood at that podium and refused to say a single good thing about that man. It was the proudest I have ever been of you. You were the only one in my life who ever stood up for me. You were strong when I was scared.\u201d A tear falls from her eye when she says, \u201cBe that girl, Lily. Brave and bold.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with three car seats?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on Allysa\u2019s couch, staring at all the stuff. She threw me a baby shower today. My mother came. Ryle\u2019s mother even flew in for it, but she\u2019s in the guest room sleeping off her jet lag now. The girls from the floral shop came and a few friends from my old job. Even Devin came. It was actually a lot of fun, despite the fact that I\u2019ve been dreading it for the past several weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to start a registry, so none of the gifts would be duplicated,\u201d Allysa says.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI guess I can have Mom return hers. She\u2019s bought me enough stuff as it is.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and start gathering all the gifts. Marshall already said he\u2019d help me carry them down to my apartment, so Allysa helps me throw everything inside trash bags. I hold them open while she picks everything up from the floor. I\u2019m almost thirty weeks pregnant now, so she doesn\u2019t get the easier job of holding open the trash.</p><p>We have everything bagged up and Marshall is on his second trip down to my apartment when I open Allysa\u2019s front door, prepared to drag a trash bag full of gifts to the elevator. What I\u2019m not prepared for is Ryle, who is standing on the other side of the door looking back at me. We both look equally as shocked to see each other, considering we haven\u2019t spoken since our fight three months ago.</p><p>This encounter was bound to happen, though. I can\u2019t be best friends with my husband\u2019s sister and live in the same building as him without eventually running into him.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he knew I was having the shower today since his mother flew in for it, but he still looks a little surprised when he sees all the stuff behind me. It makes me wonder if him showing up just as I\u2019m leaving is a coincidence or a suitable convenience. He looks down at the trash bag I\u2019m holding and he takes it from my hands. \u201cLet me get this.\u201d</p><p>I let him. He takes that bag and another one down to the apartment while I gather my things. He and Marshall are walking back inside the apartment as I\u2019m preparing to walk out.</p><p>Ryle grabs the last bag of stuff and begins to head toward the front door again. I\u2019m following behind him when Marshall gives me a silent look, asking me if I\u2019m okay with Ryle going downstairs with me. I nod. I can\u2019t keep avoiding Ryle forever, so now is as good a time as any to discuss where we go from here.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s only a few floors between their apartment and mine, but the elevator ride down with Ryle feels like the longest it\u2019s ever taken. I catch him staring at my stomach a couple of times and it makes me wonder how it must feel, going three months without seeing me pregnant.</p><p>My apartment door is unlocked, so I push it open and he follows me inside. He takes the last of the stuff to the nursery and I can hear him moving things around, opening boxes. I stay in the kitchen and clean things that don\u2019t even need cleaning. My heart is in my throat, knowing he\u2019s in my apartment. I don\u2019t feel scared of him in this moment. I just feel nervous. I wanted to be more prepared for this conversation because I absolutely hate confrontation. But I know we need to discuss the baby and our future. I just don\u2019t want to. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>He walks down the hallway and into the kitchen. I catch him looking at my stomach again. He glances away just as quickly. \u201cDo you want me to assemble the crib while I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>I should probably say no, but he\u2019s half responsible for the child growing inside of me. If he\u2019s going to offer physical labor I\u2019m going to take it, no matter how angry I still am at him. \u201cYeah. That would be a big help.\u201d</p> <p>He points toward the laundry room. \u201cIs my toolbox still in there?\u201d</p><p>I nod and he heads toward the laundry room. I open the refrigerator and face it so I don\u2019t have to watch him walk back through the kitchen. When he\u2019s finally in the nursery again, I close the refrigerator and press my forehead against it as I grip the handle. I breathe in and out as I try to process everything that\u2019s happening inside of me right now.</p><p>He looks really good. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen him, I forgot how beautiful he is. I have an urge to run down the hallway and jump into his arms. I want to feel his mouth on mine. I want to hear him tell me how much he loves me. I want him to lie down next to me and put his hand on my stomach like I\u2019ve imagined him doing so many times.</p><p>It would be so easy. My life would be so much easier right now if I would just forgive him and take him back.</p><p>I close my eyes and repeat the words my mother said to me. \u201cIf Ryle truly loves you, he wouldn\u2019t allow you to take him back.\u201d</p> <p>That reminder is the only thing that prevents me from running down the hallway.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I keep myself busy in the kitchen for the next hour as he remains in the nursery. I eventually have to walk past it to grab my phone charger from my room. On my way back down the hallway, I pause at the door of the nursery.</p><p>The crib is assembled. He even put the bedding on. He\u2019s standing over it, gripping the railing, staring inside the empty crib. He\u2019s so quiet and still, he looks like a statue. He\u2019s lost in thought and doesn\u2019t even notice me standing outside the doorway. It makes me wonder where his mind has wandered.</p><p>Is he thinking about the baby? The child he won\u2019t even be living with when it sleeps in that very crib?</p><p>Until this moment, I wasn\u2019t sure if he even wanted to be a part of the baby\u2019s life. But the look on his face proves to me that he does. I\u2019ve never seen so much sadness in one expression, and I\u2019m not even facing him straight on. I feel like the sadness he\u2019s feeling in this moment has absolutely nothing to do with me and everything to do with thoughts of his child.</p> <p>He glances up and sees me standing in the doorway. He pushes off the crib and shakes himself out of his trance. \u201cFinished,\u201d he says, waving a hand toward the crib. He begins putting his tools back inside the tool case. \u201cIs there anything else you need while I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I walk over to the crib and admire it. Since I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl, I decided to go with a nature theme. The bedding set is tan and green with pictures of plants and trees all over it. It matches the curtains and will eventually match a mural I plan to paint on the wall at some point. I also plan to fill the nursery with a few live plants from the shop. I can\u2019t help but smile, finally seeing it all start to come together. He even put up the mobile. I reach up and turn it on and Brahms\u2019s Lullaby begins to play. I stare at it as it makes a full spin and then I glance back at Ryle. He\u2019s standing a few feet away, just watching me.</p><p>As I stare back at him, I think about how easy it is for humans to make judgments when we\u2019re standing on the outside of a situation. I spent years judging my mother\u2019s situation.</p><p>It\u2019s easy when we\u2019re on the outside to believe that we would walk away without a second thought if a person mistreated us. It\u2019s easy to say we couldn\u2019t continue to love someone who mistreats us when we aren\u2019t the ones feeling the love of that person.</p><p>When you experience it firsthand, it isn\u2019t so easy to hate the person who mistreats you when most of the time they\u2019re your godsend.</p><p>Ryle\u2019s eyes gain a little bit of hope, and I hate that he can see that my walls are temporarily lowered. He begins to take a slow step toward me. I know he\u2019s about to pull me to him and hug me, so I take a quick step away from him.</p><p>And just like that, the wall is back up between us.</p><p>Allowing him back inside this apartment was a huge step for me in itself. He needs to realize that.</p> <p>He hides whatever rejection he\u2019s feeling with a stoic expression. He tucks the toolbox under his arm and then grabs the box the crib came in. It\u2019s filled with all the trash from everything he opened and put together. \u201cI\u2019ll take this to the Dumpster,\u201d he says, walking toward the door. \u201cIf you need help with anything else, just let me know, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod and somehow mutter, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>When I hear the front door close, I turn back and face the crib. My eyes fill with tears, and not for myself this time. Not for the baby.</p><p>I cry for Ryle. Because even though he\u2019s responsible for the situation he\u2019s in, I know how sad he is about it. And when you love someone, seeing them sad also makes you sad.</p><p>Neither of us brought up our separation or even a chance at reconciliation. We didn\u2019t even talk about what\u2019s going to happen when this baby is born in ten weeks.</p> <p>I\u2019m just not ready for that conversation yet and the least he can do for me right now is show me patience.</p><p>The patience he still owes me from all the times he had none.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>I finish rinsing the paint out of the brushes and then walk back to the nursery to admire the mural. I spent most of yesterday and all of today painting it.</p><p>It\u2019s been two weeks since Ryle came over and put the crib together. Now that the mural is finished and I brought in a few plants from the store, I feel like the nursery is finally complete. I look around and feel a little sad that no one is here to admire the room with me. I grab my phone and text Allysa.</p> <p>Me: Mural is finished! You should come down and look at it.</p><p>Allysa: I\u2019m not home. Running errands. I\u2019ll come look at it tomorrow, though.</p><p>I frown and decide to text my mother. She has to work tomorrow, but I know she\u2019ll be just as excited to see it as I was to finish it.</p><p>Me: Feel like driving into town tonight? The nursery is finally finished.</p><p>Mom: Can\u2019t. Recital night at school. I\u2019ll be here late. I can\u2019t wait to see it! I\u2019ll come by tomorrow!</p><p>I sit down in the rocking chair and know that I shouldn\u2019t do what I\u2019m about to do, but I do it anyway.</p> <p>Me: The nursery is finished. Do you want to come look at it?</p><p>Every nerve in my body springs to life as soon as I hit Send. I stare at my phone until his reply comes through.</p><p>Ryle: Of course. On my way down now.</p><p>I immediately stand up and begin making last minute touches. I fluff the pillows on the loveseat and straighten one of the wall hangings. I\u2019m barely to the front door when I hear his knock. I open it and dammit. He\u2019s wearing scrubs.</p><p>I step aside as he makes his way in.</p><p>\u201cAllysa said you were painting a mural?\u201d</p><p>I follow him down the hallway toward the nursery.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken two days to finish,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMy body feels like I ran a marathon and all I did was walk up and down a step ladder a few times.\u201d</p> <p>He glances over his shoulder and I can see the concern in his expression. He\u2019s worried that I was here doing it all on my own. He shouldn\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got this.</p><p>When we make it to the nursery, he stops in the doorway. On the opposite wall, I painted a garden. It\u2019s complete with almost every fruit and vegetable I could think of that grows in a garden. I\u2019m not a painter, but it\u2019s amazing what you can do with a projector and transparent paper.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ryle says.</p><p>I grin, because I recognize the surprise in his voice and I know it\u2019s genuine. He walks into the room and looks around, shaking his head the whole time. \u201cLily. It\u2019s . . . wow.\u201d</p><p>If he were Allysa, I\u2019d clap and jump up and down. But he\u2019s Ryle and with the way things have been between us, that would be a little awkward.</p><p>He walks over to the window where I set up a swing. He gives it a little push and it begins moving from side to side.</p><p>\u201cIt also moves front to back,\u201d I tell him. I don\u2019t know if he even knows anything about baby swings, but I was pretty impressed by that feature.</p><p>He walks over to the changing table and pulls one of the diapers out of the holder. He unfolds it and holds it up in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiny,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Rylee being this tiny.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him mention Rylee makes me a little sad. We\u2019ve been living apart since the night she was born, so I\u2019ve never been able to see him interact with her.</p><p>Ryle folds up the diaper and puts it back in the holder. When he turns to face me, he smiles, lifting his hands to motion around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s really great, Lily,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of it. You\u2019re really doing . . .\u201d His hands drop to his hips and his smile falters. \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well.\u201d</p><p>A thickness seems to form in the air around me. It\u2019s suddenly difficult to take in a full breath because for whatever reason, I feel like I need to cry. I just really like this moment and it saddens me that we couldn\u2019t spend the entire pregnancy full of moments like these. It feels good sharing this with him, but I\u2019m also scared I might be giving him false hope.</p><p>Now that he\u2019s here and he saw the nursery, I\u2019m not sure what to do next. It\u2019s glaringly obvious that we need to discuss a lot of things, but I have no idea where to start. Or how.</p><p>I walk over to the rocking chair and take a seat. \u201cNaked truth?\u201d I say, looking up at him.</p><p>He exhales a huge breath and nods, then takes a seat on the sofa. \u201cPlease. Lily, please tell me you\u2019re ready to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>His reaction eases my nerves a little, knowing he\u2019s ready to discuss everything. I wrap my arms around my stomach and lean forward in the rocking chair. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>He clasps his hands together between his knees. He looks at me with so much sincerity, I have to glance away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me, Lily. I don\u2019t know what role you want me to have. I\u2019m trying to give you all the space you need, but at the same time I want to help more than you possibly know. I want to be in our baby\u2019s life. I want to be your husband and I want to be good at it. But I have no idea what\u2019s going through your head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His words fill me with guilt.

I want him to be a good father. But deep down, I\u2019m still holding on to one of my biggest fears, and I know I need to talk to him about it.</p><p>\u201cI would never keep you from your child, Ryle.

The way you lose control? How do I know something won\u2019t set you off while you\u2019re alone with this baby?\u201d</p> <p>So much agony floods his eyes, I think they might burst like dams. He begins to shake his head adamantly. \u201cLily, I would never . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Ryle. You would never intentionally hurt your own child. I don\u2019t even believe it was intentional when you hurt me, but you did. And trust me, I want to believe that you would never do something like that. My father was only abusive toward my mother. There are many men\u2014women even\u2014who abuse their significant others without ever losing their temper with anyone else. I want to believe your words with all my heart, but you have to understand where my hesitation comes in. I\u2019ll never deny you a relationship with your child. But I\u2019m going to need you to be really patient with me while you rebuild all the trust you\u2019ve broken.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement. He has to know that I\u2019m giving him much more than he deserves. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is on your terms. Everything is on your terms, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ryle\u2019s hands come together again and he begins to chew nervously on his bottom lip. I sense he has more to say, but he\u2019s doubting whether or not he should say it.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and say whatever you\u2019re thinking while I\u2019m in the mood to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>He tilts his head back and looks up at the ceiling. Whatever it is, it\u2019s hard for him. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because the question is hard to ask or because he\u2019s scared of the answer I might give him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I lean my head back and sigh. I knew this question would come, but it\u2019s really difficult to give him an answer I don\u2019t have. Divorce or reconciliation are really the only two options we have, but neither is a choice I want to make.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give you false hope, Ryle,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIf I had to make a choice today . . . I\u2019d probably choose divorce. But in all honesty, I don\u2019t know if I would be making that choice because I\u2019m overloaded with pregnancy hormones or because it\u2019s what I really want. I don\u2019t think it would be fair to either of us if I made that decision before the birth of this baby.\u201d</p><p>He blows out a shaky breath and then brings a hand up to the back of his neck, squeezing tightly. Then he stands up and faces me. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cFor inviting me over. For the conversation. I\u2019ve been wanting to stop by since I was here a couple of weeks ago, but I didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d feel about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I would have felt about it, either,\u201d I say with complete honesty. I try to push myself out of the rocking chair, but for some reason it\u2019s become a lot harder in the past week. Ryle walks over and reaches for my hand to help me up.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to last until my due date when I can\u2019t even get out of a chair without grunting.</p><p>Once I\u2019m standing, he doesn\u2019t immediately release my hand. We\u2019re just a few inches apart, and I know if I look up at him I\u2019ll feel things. I don\u2019t want to feel things for him.</p><p>He finds my other hand until he\u2019s holding both of them down at my sides. He threads his fingers through mine and I feel it all the way to my heart. I press my forehead against his chest and close my eyes. His cheek meets the top of my head and we stand completely still, both of us too scared to move. I\u2019m scared to move because I might be too weak to stop him from kissing me. He\u2019s scared to move because he\u2019s afraid if he does, I\u2019ll pull away.</p><p>For what feels like five full minutes, neither of us moves a muscle.</p><p>\u201cRyle,\u201d I finally say. \u201cCan you promise me something?\u201d</p><p>I feel him nod.</p><p>\u201cUntil this baby comes, please don\u2019t try to talk me into forgiving you. And please don\u2019t try to kiss me . . .\u201d I pull away from his chest and look up at him. \u201cI want to tackle one huge thing at a time, and right now my only priority is having this baby. I don\u2019t want to add any more stress or confusion on top of everything that\u2019s already happening.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes both of my hands reassuringly. \u201cOne monumental life-changing thing at a time. Got it.\u201d</p> <p>I smile, relieved that we\u2019ve finally had this conversation. I know I didn\u2019t make a final decision about the two of us, but I still feel like I can breathe easier now that we\u2019re on the same page.</p><p>He releases my hands. \u201cI\u2019m late for my shift,\u201d he says, tossing a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cI should get to work.\u201d</p><p>I nod and see him out. It isn\u2019t until after I\u2019ve shut the door and am alone in my apartment that I realize I have a smile on my face.</p><p>I\u2019m still incredibly angry with him that we\u2019re even in this predicament to begin with, so my smile is simply due to making a little headway. Sometimes parents have to work through their differences and bring a level of maturity into a situation in order to do what\u2019s best for their child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Learning how to navigate our situation before our child is brought into the fold.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p>I smell toast.</p><p>I stretch out on my bed and smile, because Ryle knows toast is my favorite. I lie here for a while before I even attempt to get up. It feels like it takes the effort of three men to roll me out of bed. I eventually take a deep breath, and then throw my feet over the side, pushing myself up from the mattress.</p> <p>The first thing I do is pee. It\u2019s really all I do now. I\u2019m due in two days and my doctor says it could be another week. I started maternity leave last week, so this is my life right now. I pee and watch TV.</p><p>When I make it to the kitchen, Ryle is stirring a pan of scrambled eggs. He spins around when he hears me walk in. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says. \u201cNo baby yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and put my hand on my stomach. \u201cNo, but I peed nine times last night.\u201d</p><p>Ryle laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s a new record.\u201d He spoons some eggs onto a plate and then tosses bacon and toast on it. He turns around and hands me the plate, pressing a quick kiss to the side of my head. \u201cI gotta go. I\u2019m already late. I\u2019m leaving my phone on all day.\u201d</p><p>I smile when I look down at my breakfast. Okay, so I eat, too. Pee, eat, and watch TV.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say cheerfully. I take my plate to the couch and turn on the TV. Ryle rushes around the living room, gathering his stuff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come check on you at lunch. I might be working late tonight, but Allysa said she can bring you dinner.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Ryle. The doctor said light bed rest, not complete debilitation.\u201d</p><p>He starts to open the door, but pauses like he forgets something. He runs back toward me and leans down, planting his lips on my stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll double your allowance if you decide to come out today,\u201d he says to the baby.</p><p>He talks to the baby a lot. I finally felt comfortable enough to let him feel the baby kick a couple of weeks ago and since then, he stops by sometimes just to talk to my belly and doesn\u2019t even say much to me. I like it, though. I like how excited he is to be a father.</p><p>I grab the blanket Ryle slept on the couch with last night and wrap it over me. He\u2019s been staying here for a week now, waiting for me to go into labor. I wasn\u2019t sure about the arrangement at first, but it\u2019s actually been really helpful. I still sleep in the guest bedroom. The third bedroom is now a nursery, which means the master bedroom is available for him to sleep in. But for whatever reason, he chooses to sleep on the couch. I think the memories in that bedroom plague him just as much as they plague me, so neither of us even bothers going in there.</p> <p>The last several weeks have been really good. Aside from the fact that there\u2019s absolutely no physical relationship between us at this point, things feel like they\u2019ve kind of gone back to how they used to be. He still works a lot, but on the evenings he\u2019s off, I\u2019ve started having dinner upstairs with all of them. We never eat alone as a couple, though. Anything that might feel like a date or a couples thing, I avoid. I\u2019m still trying to focus on one monumental thing at a time, and until this baby is born and my hormones are back to normal, I refuse to make a decision about my marriage. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just using the pregnancy as an excuse to stall the inevitable, but being pregnant allows a person to be a little selfish.</p><p>My phone begins to ring, and I drop my head into the couch and groan. My phone is all the way in the kitchen. That\u2019s like fifteen feet from here.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>I push myself off the couch, but nothing happens.</p><p>I try it again. Still sitting.</p><p>I grab hold of the arm of my chair and pull myself up. Third time\u2019s the charm.</p><p>When I stand, my glass of water spills all over me. I groan . . . but then I gasp.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t holding a glass of water.</p> <p>Holy shit.</p><p>I look down and water is trickling down my leg. My phone is still ringing on the kitchen counter. I walk\u2014or waddle\u2014to the kitchen and answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Lucy! Quick question. Our order of red roses was damaged in shipment, but we\u2019ve got the Levenberg funeral today and they specifically wanted red roses for the casket spray. Do we have a backup plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, call the florist on Broadway. They owe me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks!\u201d</p><p>I start to hang up so I can call Ryle and tell him my water broke, but I hear Lucy say, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>I pull the phone back to my ear.</p><p>\u201cAbout these invoices. Did you want me to pay them today or wait . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wait, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Again, I start to hang up but she yells my name and starts firing off another question.</p><p>\u201cLucy,\u201d I say calmly, interrupting her. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call you about all this tomorrow. I think my water just broke.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cOh. OH! GO!\u201d</p><p>I hang up right when the first sign of pain shoots through my stomach. I wince and start dialing Ryle\u2019s number. He picks up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to turn around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Really? It\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily!\u201d he says, excited. And then the phone goes dead.</p><p>I spend the next few minutes gathering everything I\u2019ll need. I already have a hospital bag, but I feel kind of gross, so I jump in the shower to rinse off. The second burst of pain comes about ten minutes after the first. I bend forward and clench my stomach, letting the water beat down on my back. Right when I near the end of the contraction, I hear the bathroom door swing open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the shower?\u201d Ryle says. \u201cLily, get out of the shower, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand me a towel.\u201d</p><p>Ryle\u2019s hand appears around the shower curtain a few seconds later. I try to fit the towel around me before pulling the shower curtain aside. It\u2019s odd, hiding your body from your own husband.</p><p>The towel doesn\u2019t fit. It covers up my boobs but then opens like an upside-down V over my stomach.</p><p>Another contraction hits as I\u2019m stepping out of the shower. Ryle grabs my hand and helps me breathe through it, then walks me into the bedroom. I\u2019m calmly picking out clean clothes to wear to the hospital when I glance over at him.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at my stomach. There\u2019s a look on his face I can\u2019t decipher.</p><p>His eyes meet mine and I pause what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment that passes between us where I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s about to frown or smile. His face twists into both somehow, and he blows out a quick breath, dropping his eyes back to my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>A pang shoots through my chest that has nothing to do with the contractions. I realize this is the first time he\u2019s seen my bare stomach. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s witnessed what I look like with his baby growing inside of me.</p><p>I walk over to him and take his hand. I place it on my stomach and hold it there. He smiles at me, brushing his thumb back and forth. It\u2019s a beautiful moment. One of our better moments.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lily.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s written all over him, the way he\u2019s touching my stomach, the way his eyes are looking back at mine. He\u2019s not thanking me for this moment, or any moment that came before this one. He\u2019s thanking me for all the moments I\u2019m allowing him to have with his child.</p><p>I groan, leaning forward. \u201cFucking hell.\u201d</p><p>The moment is over.</p><p>Ryle grabs my clothes and helps me into them. He picks up all the things I tell him to carry and then we make our way to the elevator. Slowly. I have a contraction when we\u2019re halfway there.</p><p>\u201cYou should call Allysa,\u201d I tell him when we pull out of the parking garage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving. I\u2019ll call her when we get to the hospital. And your mom.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I\u2019m sure I could call them right now, but I kind of just want to make sure we make it to the hospital first, because it feels like this baby is being really impatient and wants to make its debut right here in the car.</p><p>We make it to the hospital, but my contractions are less than a minute apart when we arrive. By the time the doctor scrubs in and they get me to a bed, I\u2019m dilated to a nine. It\u2019s only five minutes later when I\u2019m being told to push. Ryle doesn\u2019t even have a chance to call anyone, it all happens so fast.</p><p>I squeeze Ryle\u2019s hand with every push. At one point, I think about how important the hand I\u2019m squeezing is to his career, but he says nothing. He just allows me to squeeze it as hard as I possibly can, and that\u2019s exactly what I do.</p><p>\u201cThe head is almost out,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cJust a few more pushes.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even describe the next few minutes. It\u2019s a blur of pain and heavy breathing and anxiety and pure, unequivocal elation. And pressure. Such an enormous pressure, like I\u2019m about to implode, and then, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d Ryle says. \u201cLily, we have a daughter!\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and the doctor is holding her up. I can only make out the outline of her, because my eyes are full of too many tears. When they lay her on my chest, it\u2019s the absolute greatest moment of my life. I immediately touch her red lips and cheeks and fingers. Ryle cuts the umbilical cord, and when they take her from me to clean her up, I feel empty.</p> <p>A few minutes later she\u2019s back on my chest again, swaddled in a blanket.</p><p>I can do nothing but stare at her.</p><p>Ryle sits on the bed next to me and pulls the blanket down around her chin so we can get a better look at her face. We count her fingers and her toes. She tries to open her eyes and we think it\u2019s the funniest thing in the world. She yawns and we both smile and fall even more in love with her.</p><p>After the last nurse leaves the room and we\u2019re finally alone, Ryle asks if he can hold her. He raises the head of my bed to make it easier for both of us to sit on the bed. After I hand her to him, I lay my head on his shoulder and we just can\u2019t stop staring at her.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he whispers. \u201cNaked truth?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so much prettier than Marshall and Allysa\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and elbow him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I know exactly what he means, though. Rylee is a gorgeous baby, but no one will ever hold a candle to our own daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we name her?\u201d he asks. We didn\u2019t have the typical relationship during this pregnancy, so the baby\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been something we\u2019ve discussed yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to name her after your sister,\u201d I say, glancing at him. \u201cOr maybe your brother?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what he thinks of that. I personally think naming our daughter after his brother could be somewhat healing for him, but he may not see it that way.</p><p>He glances over at me, not expecting that answer. \u201cEmerson?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of cute for a girl name. We could call her Emma. Or Emmy.\u201d He smiles proudly and looks down at her. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, actually.\u201d He leans down and kisses Emerson on her forehead.</p><p>After a while, I pull away from his shoulder so I can watch him hold her. It\u2019s a beautiful thing, seeing him interact with her like this. I can already see how much love he has for her just from the little time he\u2019s known her. I can see that he would do anything to protect her. Anything in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It isn\u2019t until this moment that I finally make a decision about him.</p><p>About us.</p><p>About what\u2019s best for our family.</p><p>Ryle is amazing in so many ways. He\u2019s compassionate. He\u2019s caring. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s charismatic. He\u2019s driven.</p> <p>My father was some of these things, too. He wasn\u2019t very compassionate toward others, but there were times we spent together that I knew he loved me. He was smart. He was charismatic. He was driven. But I hated him so much more than I loved him. I was blinded to all the best things about him thanks to all the glimpses I got of him when he was at his worst. Five minutes of witnessing him at his worst couldn\u2019t make up for even five years of him at his best.</p><p>I look at Emerson and I look at Ryle. And I know that I have to do what\u2019s best for her. For the relationship I hope she builds with her father. I don\u2019t make this decision for me and I don\u2019t make it for Ryle.</p><p>I make it for her.</p><p>\u201cRyle?\u201d</p><p>When he glances at me, he\u2019s smiling. But when he assesses the look on my face, he stops.</p> <p>\u201cI want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>He blinks twice. My words hit him like voltage. He winces and looks back down at our daughter, his shoulders hunched forward. \u201cLily,\u201d he says, shaking his head back and forth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>His voice is pleading, and I hate that he\u2019s been holding on to hope that I would eventually take him back. That\u2019s partly my fault, I know, but I don\u2019t think I realized what choice I was going to make until I held my daughter for the first time.</p><p>\u201cJust one more chance, Lily. Please.\u201d His voice cracks with tears when he speaks.</p><p>I know I\u2019m hurting him at the worst possible time. I\u2019m breaking his heart when this should be the best moment of his life. But I know if I don\u2019t do it in this moment, I might never be able to convince him of why I can\u2019t risk taking him back.</p><p>I begin to cry because this is hurting me as much as it\u2019s hurting him. \u201cRyle,\u201d I say gently. \u201cWhat would you do? If one of these days, this little girl looked up at you and she said, \u2018Daddy? My boyfriend hit me.\u2019 What would you say to her, Ryle?\u201d</p> <p>He pulls Emerson to his chest and buries his face against the top of her blanket. \u201cStop, Lily,\u201d he begs.</p><p>I push myself up straighter on the bed. I place my hand on Emerson\u2019s back and try to get Ryle to look me in the eyes. \u201cWhat if she came to you and said, \u2018Daddy? My husband pushed me down the stairs. He said it was an accident. What should I do?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>His shoulders begin to shake, and for the first time since the day I met him, he has tears. Real tears that rush down his cheeks as he holds his daughter tightly against him. I\u2019m crying, too, but I keep going. For her sake.</p><p>\u201cWhat if . . .\u201d My voice breaks. \u201cWhat if she came to you and said, \u2018My husband tried to rape me, Daddy. He held me down while I begged him to stop. But he swears he\u2019ll never do it again. What should I do, Daddy?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He\u2019s kissing her forehead, over and over, tears spilling down his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say to her, Ryle? Tell me. I need to know what you would say to our daughter if the man she loves with all her heart ever hurts her.\u201d</p><p>A sob breaks from his chest. He leans toward me and wraps an arm around me. \u201cI would beg her to leave him,\u201d he says through his tears. His lips press desperately against my forehead and I can feel some of his tears as they fall onto my cheeks. He moves his mouth to my ear and cradles both of us against him. \u201cI would tell her that she is worth so much more. And I would beg her not to go back, no matter how much he loves her. She\u2019s worth so much more.\u201d</p><p>We become a sobbing mess of tears and broken hearts and shattered dreams. We hold each other. We hold our daughter. And as hard as this choice is, we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.</p> <p>He hands her back to me and wipes his eyes. He stands up, still crying. Still trying to catch his breath. In the last fifteen minutes, he lost the love of his life. In the last fifteen minutes, he became a father to a beautiful little girl.</p><p>That\u2019s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.</p><p>It can save them.</p><p>He points toward the hallway, letting me know he needs to go gather himself. He\u2019s sadder than I\u2019ve ever seen him as he walks toward the door. But I know he\u2019ll thank me for this one day. I know the day will come when he\u2019ll understand that I made the right choice by his daughter.</p><p>When the door closes behind him, I look down at her. I know I\u2019m not giving her the life I dreamed for her. A home where she lives with both parents who can love her and raise her together. But I don\u2019t want her to live like I lived. I don\u2019t want her to see her father at his worst. I don\u2019t want her to see him when he loses his temper with me to the point that she no longer recognizes him as her father. Because no matter how many good moments she might share with Ryle throughout her lifetime, I know from experience that it would only be the worst ones that stuck with her.</p><p>Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet.</p><p>My mother went through it.</p><p>I went through it.</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned if I allow my daughter to go through it.</p><p>I kiss her on the forehead and make her a promise. \u201cIt stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Epilogue</p><p>I push through the crowds of Boylston Street until I get to the cross street. I pull the stroller to a crawl and then stop at the edge of the curb. I pull the top of it back and look down at Emmy. She\u2019s kicking her feet and smiling like usual. She\u2019s a very happy baby. She has a calm energy about her and it\u2019s addictive.</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d a woman asks. She\u2019s standing at the crosswalk with us, staring down at Emerson appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cEleven months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d she says. \u201cLooks just like you. Identical mouths.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThank you. But you should see her father. She definitely has his eyes.\u201d</p><p>The sign flashes to walk, and I try to beat the crowd as we rush across the street. I\u2019m already half an hour late and Ryle has texted me twice. He hasn\u2019t experienced the joy of carrots yet, though. He\u2019ll find out today just how messy they are, because I packed plenty in her bag.</p><p>I moved out of the apartment Ryle bought when Emerson was three months old. I got my own place closer to my work so I\u2019m within walking distance, which is great. Ryle moved back into the apartment he bought, but between visiting Allysa\u2019s place and Ryle\u2019s days with Emerson, I feel like I\u2019m still at their apartment building almost as much as I\u2019m at mine.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, Emmy.\u201d We make a right around the corner and I\u2019m in such a rush, a man has to step out of our way and into the wall just to avoid being plowed over. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter, ducking my head and making my way around him.</p> <p>\u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>I stop.</p><p>I turn slowly, because I felt that voice all the way to my toes. There are only two voices that have ever done that to me, and Ryle\u2019s doesn\u2019t reach that far anymore.</p><p>When I look back at him, his blue eyes are squinting against the sun. He lifts a hand to shield it and he grins. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, my frenzied brain trying to slow down and allow me to play catch-up.</p><p>He glances at the stroller and points at it. \u201cIs that . . . is this your baby?\u201d</p> <p>I nod and he walks around to the front of the stroller. He kneels down and smiles widely at her. \u201cWow. She\u2019s gorgeous, Lily,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerson. We call her Emmy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He puts his finger in her hand and she starts kicking, shaking his finger back and forth. He stares at her appreciatively for a moment and then stands back up again.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d he says.</p><p>I try not to give him an obvious once-over, but it\u2019s hard. He looks as good as ever, but this is the first time seeing him that I\u2019m not trying to deny how gorgeous he turned out to be. A far cry from that homeless boy in my bedroom. Yet . . . somehow still exactly the same.</p><p>I can feel the buzz of my text message going off in my pocket again. Ryle.</p><p>I point down the street. \u201cWe\u2019re really late,\u201d I say. \u201cRyle has been waiting for half an hour.\u201d</p><p>When I say Ryle\u2019s name, there\u2019s a sadness that reaches Atlas\u2019s eyes, but he tries to disguise it. He nods and slowly steps aside for us to pass.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s his day to have her,\u201d I clarify, saying more in those six words than I could in most full conversations.</p><p>I see the relief flash in his eyes. He nods and points behind him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m running late, too. Opened a new restaurant on Boylston last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Congratulations. I\u2019ll have to take Mom there to check it out soon.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYou should. Let me know and I\u2019ll make sure and cook for you myself.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward pause, and then I point down the street. \u201cWe have to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>I nod again and then duck my head and continue walking. I have no idea why I\u2019m reacting this way. Like I don\u2019t know how to hold a normal conversation. When I\u2019m several yards away, I glance back over my shoulder. He hasn\u2019t moved. He\u2019s still watching me as I walk away.</p><p>We round the corner and I see Ryle waiting beside his car outside the floral shop. His face lights up when he sees us approaching. \u201cDid you get my email?\u201d He kneels down and begins to unstrap Emerson.</p><p>\u201cYeah, about the playpen recall?\u201d</p><p>He nods as he pulls her out of the stroller. \u201cDidn\u2019t we buy one of those for her?\u201d</p><p>I press the buttons to fold the stroller and then walk it to the back of his car. \u201cYeah, but it broke like a month ago. I threw it in the Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>He pops the trunk, and then touches Emerson\u2019s chin with his fingers. \u201cDid you hear that, Emmy? Your mommy saved your life.\u201d She smiles up at him and slaps playfully at his hand. He kisses her on the forehead and then picks up her stroller and tosses it in the trunk. I slam the trunk shut and lean over to give her a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Emmy. See you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ryle opens the back door to put her in the car seat. I tell him goodbye and then I start to head back down the street in a rush.</p><p>\u201cLily!\u201d he yells. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure he expected me to walk to the front door of my store, since I\u2019m already late opening it. I probably should, but the nagging in my gut won\u2019t go away. I need to do something about it. I spin around and walk backward. \u201cThere\u2019s something I forgot to do! I\u2019ll see you when I pick her up tonight!\u201d</p><p>Ryle lifts Emerson\u2019s hand and they wave goodbye to me. As soon as I round the corner, I break out into a sprint. I dodge people, bump into a few and cause one lady to curse at me, but it\u2019s all worth it the moment I see the back of his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAtlas!\u201d I yell. He\u2019s heading in the other direction, so I keep pushing through the crowd. \u201cAtlas!\u201d</p><p>He stops walking but he doesn\u2019t turn around. He cocks his head like he doesn\u2019t want to fully trust his ears.</p><p>\u201cAtlas!\u201d I yell again.</p><p>This time when he turns, he turns with purpose. His eyes meet mine and there\u2019s a three-second pause while we both stare at each other. But then we both start walking toward each other, determination in every step. Twenty steps separate us.</p> <p>Ten.</p><p>Five.</p><p>One.</p><p>Neither of us takes that final step.</p><p>I\u2019m out of breath, panting and nervous. \u201cI forgot to tell you Emerson\u2019s middle name.\u201d I put my hands on my hips and exhale. \u201cIt\u2019s Dory.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t immediately react, but then his eyes crinkle a little in the corners. His mouth twitches like he\u2019s forcing back a smile. \u201cWhat a perfect name for her.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and smile, and then stop.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to do now. I just needed him to know that, but now that I\u2019ve told him, I didn\u2019t really think of what I\u2019d do or say next.</p><p>I nod again, and then glance around me, throwing a thumb over my shoulder. \u201cWell . . . I guess I\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>Atlas steps forward, grabs me, and pulls me hard against his chest. I immediately close my eyes when he wraps his arms around me. His hand goes up to the back of my head and he holds me still against him as we stand, surrounded by busy streets, blasts of horns, people brushing us as they pass in a hurry. He presses a gentle kiss into my hair, and all of that fades away.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI feel like my life is good enough for you now. So whenever you\u2019re ready . . .\u201d</p> <p>I clench his jacket in my hands and keep my face pressed tight against his chest. I suddenly feel like I\u2019m fifteen again. My neck and cheeks flush from his words.</p><p>But I\u2019m not fifteen.</p><p>I\u2019m an adult with responsibilities and a child. I can\u2019t just allow my teenage feelings to take over. Not without a little reassurance, at least.</p><p>I pull back and look up at him. \u201cDo you donate to charity?\u201d</p><p>Atlas laughs with confusion. \u201cSeveral. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want kids someday?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever want to leave Boston?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. Never. Everything is better here, remember?\u201d</p><p>His answers give me the reassurance I need. I smile up at him. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me tight against him and I laugh. With everything that has happened since the day he came into my life, I never expected this outcome. I\u2019ve hoped for it a lot, but until now I wasn\u2019t sure if it would ever happen.</p><p>I close my eyes when I feel his lips meet the spot on my collarbone. He presses a gentle kiss there and it feels just like the first time he kissed me there all those years ago. He brings his mouth to my ear, and in a whisper, he says, \u201cYou can stop swimming now, Lily. We finally reached the shore.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
