I know that I wasn\u2019t who you came to meet, but I\u2019m glad we had a chance to talk. Even though I was just his little sister\u2019s best friend, Aires still felt like a brother to me.</p><p>Between you and me, I keep smiling when I think of the look on your face when we decided to sneak out of the wake without being caught. That was a strange, messed-up night, and I\u2019m grateful you were there to help me through it.</p><p>I know how I miss Aires so I can only imagine how you miss Josh. Just remember that I\u2019m thinking of you.</p> <p>Can I write you again? Will you write back? I hope you do. I sort of feel like we were meant to meet.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>Dear Lila,</p><p>Thank you for the card. I\u2019m going to admit, I\u2019m not much of a kitten guy, but I appreciate the thought. Mostly, I appreciate your note.</p><p>Yeah, I agree, the night of Aires\u2019s funeral was messed up, but messed up in a good way. Mom and Dad thought if we met Aires\u2019s family that it would help us with losing Josh. I thought Mom and Dad had it all jacked up, and in a way, they did. It wasn\u2019t meeting Aires\u2019s family that helped, it was talking to you\u2014so thanks.</p> <p>And no, I don\u2019t mind if you want to write me again. Even if you do it in one of those kitten-hanging-from-a-tree cards.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>Lincoln</p><p>Is it weird that I feel close to you even though you\u2019re hundreds of miles away and we\u2019ve only met once? I hope not. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re in my life.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>On the computer screen, the question \u201cWhy?\u201d glares at me like the correct accusation it is. This dialogue between Lila and me, it breaks every unsaid rule about our relationship. We never plug in like this. Never. Not that part of me hasn\u2019t wanted a faster connection to her. A link beyond the letters, but there was something about the written word that made our relationship safe.</p> <p>And now we\u2019re crossing lines. The one relationship I need, the one relationship I depend on...I\u2019ve jacked it up. Fitting since I have a natural inclination toward destroying anything good. It\u2019s genetic, my sister tells me. Anyone sharing our bloodline is inherently doomed.</p><p>\u201cYou should have talked to me before buying it,\u201d my father shouts at my mother in the kitchen. \u201cI made a budget.\u201d</p><p>My home is a volcano, a constant gurgle of hot lava on the verge of explosion. I try to ignore my parents, but it\u2019s difficult. We have one computer in the house, and it sits wide open in the family room. From the corner of my eye, I have a clear shot of how Dad\u2019s hands shake with anger and how Mom\u2019s frustration paints her cheeks a frightening scarlet.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I have to ask your permission for anything?\u201d A chair slams into the wooden kitchen table and Mom\u2019s high heels stomp against the tile floor. \u201cIt\u2019s my money too. And as for the budget\u2014you never asked me what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>I asked you why. Lila\u2019s words appear on our direct message conversation.</p><p>I rub at the lines on my forehead, and a tense uneasiness paralyzes my fingers over the keyboard. I don\u2019t know why I did it. That\u2019s a lie, I do know, but I don\u2019t know how to tell her. I don\u2019t know how to salvage this.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, I reply.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask for an apology, she rapid-fires back, I asked WHY!</p> <p>Because I love you. It\u2019s as if someone places two hands around my heart and chokes it. I love her. I\u2019ve fallen for a girl I met only once, a girl I\u2019ve exchanged letters with for two years. There\u2019s no way she can feel the same about me. Those words would push her over the edge.</p><p>I want to keep her, but what do I say? What can I do?</p><p>Like the warning tremors before an eruption, my parents\u2019 argument becomes more heated. Mom turns on the blender to drown out Dad. In response, Dad yells louder and bangs his hand against the table, making the china clink against the water glasses. The baby who was sleeping moments before, my nephew, begins to cry. It\u2019s not a cry, it\u2019s a shriek\u2014one that causes my skin to peel back from my bones.</p><p>The noises press against my skull, scattering my already screwed-up thought process into more of a mess. I can explain, I type. Though I\u2019m not sure I can.</p><p>Then EXPLAIN! She\u2019s a fast typer. Too fast. My heart thumps in my ears. I mentally will the chaos around me to stop and pray that Lila will...what? What is it that I expect her to do?</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Meg?\u201d my father roars. \u201cThat baby is her responsibility! I never agreed to be her babysitter.\u201d He never agreed to be a grandfather at forty-five either.</p><p>My eyes dart to my father, dressed in his polo shirt and slacks in preparation for my graduation, to the baby dressed in a blue onesie pulling himself up in the playpen placed in the middle of the spacious living room. His entire face flushes red. Drool pours from his small gaping mouth. He wails again, the sound like a tornado siren.</p><p>\u201cMeg\u2019s out,\u201d Mom screams over the blender still grinding away. Meg just turned seventeen and is gone\u2014at eight in the morning, meaning she never came home last night. She left Junior with us. With me. I also never agreed to be a babysitter.</p><p>As if on cue, the front door clicks open. Impressive\u2014my sister has returned before noon. Maybe today, she\u2019ll hold her son.</p><p>I don\u2019t acknowledge Meg. I don\u2019t even glance at her. Instead, I focus on the cursor blinking on the screen. I have seconds before I completely lose Lila. I made a mistake, I type. I\u2014</p><p>The screen flashes to black. \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need this,\u201d Meg says as she straightens from resetting the computer. She tucks her freshly dyed chin-length blue hair behind her ear. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>The new guy, the one who isn\u2019t the baby daddy, the one who hates kids, stands in the front doorway with his hands shoved in his sagging jeans.</p><p>\u201cMeg!\u201d Mom rushes in from the kitchen. Does she know she left the blender running? Does anyone notice the baby still howling? \u201cWhere have you been? Lincoln\u2019s graduation ceremony is in an hour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I mutter as I press my fingertips against my head. Lila. I lost Lila. The only sane person in my life.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I have to go?\u201d Meg throws her hands out to her sides, barely missing her own child\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s not my graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I say louder. Anger gains traction in my bloodstream.</p><p>Dad knocks over a chair in his charge into the living room. \u201cPick up your baby! Pick him up! He\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s voice is smothered by Meg shouting over and over again that she\u2019s not attending my graduation.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d I yell above them all, and slam my hands onto the computer desk.</p><p>They fall silent: Mom, Dad, Meg. Everyone except the baby. \u201cSomeone pick him up!\u201d</p><p>No one does. They all continue to watch me with wide eyes because they know I\u2019ve cracked. I never yell. Not once in eighteen years have they witnessed me lose my temper. I\u2019m the odd one, yeah, but I\u2019m the steady one. The unemotional one. The one who didn\u2019t cry at my brother\u2019s funeral. The one who never demands more of anyone or anything\u2014even from myself.</p><p>The cries reach a higher pitch. In a quick motion, I slide the kid out of his prison and he immediately places his head on my shoulder, his thumb stuck safely in his mouth. The sweet scent of formula and baby powder drifts from his tiny body. We must look ironic: fifteen pounds of premature warmth curled into six feet and a hundred and seventy-five pounds of rock-climbing muscle. Part of me hates that he\u2019ll calm down for me, because it makes him my burden. The other part...at least I can help someone feel better.</p><p>I glance over at the shut-down computer. Lila. My hand covers the baby\u2019s back as if I\u2019m seeking his comfort. I lost Lila. There\u2019s no way she\u2019ll connect with me online now. No way I can wait long enough to see if she\u2019d respond to my letter. To see if she will grant me another chance.</p><p>\u201cTake your baby,\u201d I say to my sister. Her eyes widen as her head convulses in tiny shakes meaning no.</p><p>\u201cTake\u2014your\u2014baby.\u201d I\u2019m wrong. My house isn\u2019t a volcano\u2014I am, and the past two years have created a dormant giant who no longer will tolerate being ignored. I\u2019m tired of this. Tired of how everyone\u2019s become so obsessed with themselves, obsessed with the moment, that we\u2019ve ceased caring what\u2019s going to happen next.</p><p>I\u2019m just as guilty, and that downfall has led to hurting Lila. Soon, the same damn poor decisions will devastate this family. God, I\u2019m a moron.</p><p>I work hard at keeping my voice gentle, because it\u2019s not this baby\u2019s fault that I dropped out of reality or that his mother is so jacked up she\u2019s never held him or that his grandparents are so concerned about winning a fight that they can\u2019t comprehend what\u2019s happening to their future.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d I motion with my eyes for her to take the now-sleeping infant.</p><p>She bustles over like the busy bird she is and slips him out of my grasp. How the hell do I fix all of the mistakes I\u2019ve made in the past two years?</p><p>My family still stares at me like deer waiting for the gunshot. I should start with telling them the truth, but the words escape me. No, not escape...I just can\u2019t stop thinking about Lila.</p><p>If she can find a way to forgive me, then I can find a way to fix this.</p><p>Lila</p><p>No, it\u2019s not weird that you feel close to me. Honestly? Sometimes knowing that I\u2019ll be getting a letter from you is the only thing pushing me through my days.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>The moment I open the door, I immediately regret not heeding the advice on the yellow Post-it note clinging near the small round hole: Lila, Always check the peephole before answering the door. You never know who\u2019s on the other side.</p><p>Translation: serial killers knock before attacking. I watch CSI. It happens.</p><p>Standing before me isn\u2019t a serial killer but a different type of nightmare. Stephen, the guy I\u2019ve dated on and off since sophomore year, tilts his head with a way too smug I\u2019m concerned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I sniff and use a crumpled tissue to wipe my runny nose. Let\u2019s see: swollen, puffy red eyes with dark circles? No, I\u2019m not okay\u2014and now I\u2019m worse because he thinks I\u2019m crying over him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking on you.\u201d His green eyes survey the empty living room behind me. \u201cI know your parents and brothers left yesterday for vacation. I wanted to make sure you made it through your first night alone.\u201d</p><p>First night alone\u2014ever. And it epically blew. I\u2019ve got six more days of alone and then, come fall, the rest of my life. \u201cI survived.\u201d</p><p>Stephen scrutinizes me with a cocked eyebrow that says he can tell I didn\u2019t sleep. Which I didn\u2019t because I was too busy being terrified. My imagination boarded a train south to crazyville and convinced me that someone was scratching on the windows.</p><p>A hot June evening breeze drifts into the house, bringing with it the scent of the sickly sweet gel he uses to force his brown hair into a styled mess.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asks when I\u2019m obviously not offering.</p><p>No. I sigh. \u201cSure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stephen enters and fingers the purple Post-it on the phone reminding me to check the caller ID. When I woke up yesterday morning, I found the peephole note, along with about a hundred other Post-its stuck to various objects around the house. All of them my mother\u2019s desperate attempts to teach me how to live on my own so I\u2019m prepared when I head fourteen hours away from home to the University of Florida.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me if you\u2019re scared to be alone at night,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll come over.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>Stephen was my first...and last. When I gave him my virginity, I thought I loved him, and maybe I sort of did, but then everything became complicated. Not everything\u2014me. I became complicated and I didn\u2019t want to have sex anymore. Stephen lacked sympathy.</p> <p>And then there was Lincoln...</p><p>My lips tremble and a new pool of warm tears builds in my eyes.</p><p>Stephen turns toward me with his mouth popped open for his next witty suggestion. It snaps shut when he spots my face. \u201cWhoa. Lila. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not. My bones suddenly weigh too much for my body, and I collapse onto the couch. The tissue in my grasp balls into a rock. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired.\u201d Just heartbroken. Lincoln lied to me this morning and then he cut me off. As if the past two years of letters meant nothing to him.</p><p>Letters\u2014not emails, not texts\u2014letters. It\u2019s what we promised each other when we met. Because somehow, letters made our relationship private...different...real.</p> <p>I stare at the red-and-black amoeba patterns on the Oriental rug covering the hardwood floor. My stomach aches when I see the project that started or ended it all, depending on how I choose to view it, peeking out from underneath the cherry end table. The sturdy scrapbook paper represents hours of cutting and pasting and care meant to celebrate Lincoln\u2019s graduation from high school. The petals of the dried-out lilac-colored roses Lincoln sent me for my graduation last week create the border.</p><p>I\u2019m so unbelievably stupid to have fallen for a guy I\u2019ve met once. Stupid because nice guys only belong in the land of make-believe.</p><p>The other end of the couch shifts as Stephen half sits on the arm. How many times did my mother ask him not to do that? Stephen licks his thumb and rubs dirt off his new prized possession: the two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar athletic shoes he stood in line for overnight.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Lila.\u201d One more lick. One more rub. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you this week. No strings attached.\u201d</p><p>I blow out enough air that my hair moves. I\u2019m not being fair. Stephen\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s my fault I fell for someone else. Someone who doesn\u2019t really exist. \u201cI know, and thanks. But I\u2019ve got to work this out for myself. How can I even imagine moving to Florida on my own if I can\u2019t stay the night in my house alone?\u201d</p><p>Stephen scratches his chin, indicating I\u2019m going to hate whatever gushes out of his mouth next. \u201cLook, I know you better than anyone else and here\u2019s the thing...you\u2019re not as strong as you make everybody think you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d A combination of anger and hurt splits open my stomach as my shoulders roll back. \u201cDid you really say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust listen,\u201d he says in a rush. \u201cYour mom told my mom that you haven\u2019t turned down the offer from the University of Louisville. You must be having second thoughts, so I\u2019m not saying anything you aren\u2019t already thinking.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens and I avoid eye contact, ashamed that I\u2019m close to trashing a dream because of fear.</p><p>\u201cStay home.\u201d He softens his tone. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about being scared. Echo\u2019s staying. Grace and Natalie are staying.\u201d He pauses and glances at the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my lower lip\u2014half mad, half emotional basket case. The University of Florida has always been my goal, but I\u2019m frightened of leaving home. Scared of leaving everything and everyone I\u2019ve ever known. But I\u2019m also tired of everyone wearing me down with their 1,001 reasons why I shouldn\u2019t go.</p><p>When I don\u2019t respond, Stephen continues. \u201cI know that\u2019s why you broke up with me last month. That you don\u2019t think we can handle the whole long-distance thing. So stay.\u201d</p><p>No, that\u2019s not why I broke up with him, but it is the reason I gave. Two months ago, Lincoln sent this amazing letter and it shook me to the core. Actually, every letter he sends is amazing, but it finally hit me why Stephen and I could never seem to get it together. It was because I had given my heart to Lincoln.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to hurt Stephen then and I don\u2019t want to hurt him now. Especially since I realize what a fool I\u2019ve been. My eyes shut as I digest what I have possibly thrown away with Stephen. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>The defeat crushes me in such a way that the couch no longer feels steady enough to carry my weight. Maybe everyone is right. Maybe all my crazy dreams of moving away are stupid and insane. Maybe I just think I\u2019m capable of being more than what I really am: not strong, but a homebody.</p><p>All my strength and energy flows out of me and right into Stephen. He jumps off the arm of the couch. \u201cGo to college here, in Louisville, Lila. It\u2019ll be like high school. Chad\u2019s staying. So\u2019s Luke. All of us will be together, going to the same school, and then you and I can start again.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. But I\u2019m not in love with you. The words catch in my mouth. His green eyes shine and his face completely lights up. What do I honestly know about love? Obviously nothing after what\u2019s happened with Lincoln. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Why is that the only phrase I seem capable of saying?</p><p>His fingers spread out as he raises his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough. For now. Look, I\u2019ve got to get to work, but I\u2019m serious\u2014if you get freaked staying by yourself, call. Mom and Dad won\u2019t care if I stay with you.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath to try to explain to him that I need to do this on my own, but before I can form the first word Stephen plants a kiss on my cheek and strides out the front door.</p><p>I blink a few times, trying to let my mind process the turn of events. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>In the span of minutes, Stephen managed to drag me back into high school. Wasn\u2019t this drama supposed to end when I received my diploma?</p><p>Three quick raps on the door and a surge of angry adrenaline pumps in my veins. Good. He\u2019s back. Now I can really tell him what I think about him staying the night and implying that I\u2019m not strong. Forget the fact he\u2019s possibly right. No guy should ever call me a coward.</p><p>With a particularly hard yank, I throw open the front door and yell, \u201cYou really are a jerk, you know?\u201d</p><p>All the air rushes out of my lungs in a fast hiss. It\u2019s not Stephen. No. Not at all. This guy has hair the color of midnight. He\u2019s tall, built like no guy I\u2019ve ever dated before\u2014in an oh, hell yeah sort of way\u2014and possesses soft blue eyes that entice me to hold him already. And he\u2019s clutching a bouquet. Roses. Purple ones.</p><p>Something nags me from the back of my brain. Then I remember that I\u2019m required to speak. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>He shifts his footing, shoving one hand into his faded jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Lila.\u201d</p><p>Me? \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLincoln.\u201d</p><p>I really should have taken my mother\u2019s advice on the peephole.</p><p>Lincoln</p><p>I know I should stop gushing about the card you sent for my birthday, but I can\u2019t. See, Stephen forgot about my birthday. It\u2019s cool. Really. He remembered eventually, and bought me roses, but I need to complain. I know I\u2019m going to sound like a snot, but he got me red roses.</p><p>Red. Whenever I see red roses I think of my grandma\u2019s funeral, and then I want to cry. I\u2019ve told Stephen that\u2014twice.</p><p>I\u2019ve dropped hint after hint that purple are my favorites. Of course, I told him that I loved his present and gushed about it, but what do I need to do? Tattoo it on my forehead? Purple!!!</p><p>Or at least not red.</p><p>Here\u2019s the reason why I don\u2019t care about Stephen forgetting: you made my birthday special. No one has ever made me a card before. So thanks, Lincoln. Sometimes I think you\u2019re my best friend.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>She\u2019s stunning. Yeah, she was drop-dead gorgeous two years ago, but now...</p><p>I\u2019m staring and I need to stop, but seeing her inhibits brain function. Girls don\u2019t know it, but standing in the presence of beauty impairs guys. At least, it impairs me.</p><p>Screw it. It\u2019s Lila. Lila impairs me.</p><p>The ends of her golden hair curl near her shoulders. She cut it and I like the new style. A lot. When I first met Lila, she was between\u2014not quite a girl, not really a woman. With those curves, she left between in the dust.</p><p>I was only a few inches taller than her then. I grew. She stayed the same height. Lila would fit perfectly under my arm, tucked close into my body. She let me hold her hand the night we met, and I never forgot how her skin felt like satin. I hope she\u2019ll let me touch her again.</p><p>That is, if she can forgive me.</p><p>Her bewildered sky blue eyes travel along my face, over my arms and chest. Crimson stains her cheeks as she prevents herself from checking out anything lower. I clear my throat to disguise the chuckle.</p><p>I want to laugh because she looks so damned cute, but she wouldn\u2019t see it that way. She\u2019d think I was belittling her. Lila can\u2019t tolerate guys who view women as beneath them. I received more than one letter from her with that rant.</p><p>Lila\u2019s house sits in the middle of nowhere. Its zip code exists in the city of Louisville, but acreage borders three sides of her house and across the street is a state park. The only beings watching me beg for her forgiveness on the wraparound front porch are the crickets and God.</p><p>It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019m not a people person.</p><p>Her blessed pink lips pucker to form a w and then flatten. She repeats the cycle three more times until she finally decides on a word beginning with h. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoogle.\u201d</p><p>She gives me the you\u2019re-crazy stare.</p><p>\u201cMaps.\u201d Very awkward pause. \u201cI know your address by heart.\u201d</p><p>The worry lines on her forehead disappear as the lightbulb turns on. \u201cBut you live...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen hours away. Yeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve, actually,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>My world blanks out for a second. Does that mean she calculated the distance between us too? \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly adhere to recommended motor vehicle regulations.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitches; she\u2019s well aware I\u2019ve never been a fan of rules. \u201cYou sped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bent suggested limits.\u201d</p><p>The blush fades, leaving her cheeks pale. \u201cIs that how you view what you did to me?\u201d</p><p>The hand grasping the roses begins to sweat. \u201cI got these for you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re roses. Purple.\u201d Keep talking, man. You\u2019re losing her. \u201cYour favorite.\u201d</p><p>Lila folds her hands over her chest and juts her hip out to the side.</p><p>Stupid, moronic idiot. The girl has eyes and an IQ. Didn\u2019t she score a twenty-seven on her ACT? She can think fast enough to figure out what I\u2019m holding. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes scrunch together.</p><p>\u201cYou called me a jerk when you opened the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you. Stephen was. Is.\u201d She closes her eyes, then reopens them. \u201cI take that back. You are a jerk.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps to the side. Stephen? Her ex-boyfriend? The kid will not give up and, when it comes to Lila, he has a proven track record of winning. This is the third time they\u2019ve broken up. He groveled twice and both times she took him back. When we first started writing, it didn\u2019t bother me. Lila and I were friends. But then I fell for her and Stephen became a sharp rock wedged in my side.</p> <p>I trash all the questions I have about Stephen and his appearance at her house and focus on what\u2019s important: Lila. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I run my hand through my damp hair. It\u2019s ninety degrees with the sun setting, though it could be her microscopic stare making me sweat. \u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>Her head falls back. \u201cGod, Lincoln. If you had come here two days ago or last week or last month, I would have been ecstatic. But now? I thought I knew you.\u201d</p><p>I step forward as my heart surges out of my chest. \u201cYou do.\u201d She does. Better than anyone else. \u201cYes, I lied. But everything else is true.\u201d</p> <p>The way she sucks in her lower lip as her head shakes no tells me that the odds are against me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she says. \u201cFor all I know you\u2019re the serial killer the Post-it note warned me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Never mind. It doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cLila, you are the one person who knows me. I swear it. I lied to you about one thing. One minor thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinor!\u201d Her eyes redefine the term frigid.</p><p>I retreat a step. Bad choice in words. \u201cMinor could be an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstatement!\u201d she shrieks. \u201cYou didn\u2019t graduate from high school, Lincoln, and you had the balls to lie to me about it.\u201d Lila bursts forward and stabs my chest with her long pink fingernail. Each poke a piercing reminder of my mistake. \u201cI...was...depending...on...you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou still can. I\u2019m going to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>A gust of air hits my cheeks as she slams the front door in my face. My arm drops and the leaves rustle together as the roses slap the side of my thigh. A few petals float down to the wooden porch. With a heavy sigh, I sit on the steps. Not that I ever wanted to know, but this is what being set on fire must feel like\u2014everything shrouded in agony.</p><p>If I feel this way, how must Lila feel?</p><p>I glance to the left, then to the right. Disoriented. Lost. Not knowing which way is home. But that\u2019s been the problem since the beginning. The root of all my evils.</p><p>Lila</p><p>So the guidance counselor asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I answered\u2014rock climbing. He said it wasn\u2019t a profession and to get serious. That if I wanted to get into a decent college I needed to apply myself now.</p><p>I told him I was serious. That I loved rock climbing. He said that was a hobby and that I needed to become realistic about my \u201cgoals.\u201d</p> <p>I told him it wasn\u2019t my damn fault he pissed away his life to make thirty grand a year and to drink cheap coffee. And then I asked him to kindly stop dumping on my dreams. He gave me two days\u2019 detention. Did I mention the guy\u2019s an asshole?</p><p>Do you know the last time I had detention? Never. I\u2019m no saint, but I keep my mouth shut and head down. Rules suck. Society sucks.</p><p>Josh followed the rules and now he\u2019s dead. He liked riding horses. Maybe if he had looked that damn counselor in the eye and said, \u201cI want to ride horses for the rest of my life,\u201d then my brother would still be alive today.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the middle of my bed, I turn over Lincoln\u2019s letter. My fingers slide over the deep indentations of words obviously written in agitation. Words written so quickly, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to decipher most of them if I wasn\u2019t already familiar with his handwriting.</p><p>He sent this one to me in the fall, a week after he started his senior year. Lincoln hated his guidance counselor. He was the one who convinced Lincoln\u2019s brother to join the Marines out of high school. It\u2019s because of that fateful decision that I met Lincoln.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d says Echo, her voice a bit disjointed from the speaker. \u201cYou still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say and glance at my phone lying on the bed next to me. My best friend is in freaking Iowa with the freaking love of her life on their way to freaking Colorado. Right now, I despise happy people. \u201cHow\u2019s Iowa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKansas,\u201d she corrects.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, it\u2019s flat and they have tornadoes.\u201d I pick up one of the many stacks of letters from Lincoln cluttering my bed and easily find the one I\u2019m searching for. The one that promised he\u2019d come with me to Florida.</p><p>Cluttering isn\u2019t the right word. Nothing about me is cluttered. Each stack represents the month the letter was sent, and each letter is arranged by the date on the postmark. My favorite letters have a pink highlight marking the side.</p><p>My entire life is systemized like this. My books alphabetized by author on my cherry bookcase. Within the matching glass hutch, my Precious Moments figurines are organized by date received. My scrapbooking materials are boxed in color-coordinated Tupperware. I like plans and organization and not boys who promise to attend the University of Florida with me and then screw it all up by not graduating from high school.</p><p>\u201cLila?\u201d says Echo. She pauses for way too long. \u201cDid you give him a chance to explain?\u201d</p><p>The envelope crunches in my hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t graduate from high school, Echo, and he didn\u2019t tell me about it. Do you have any idea how I felt when I had to find out on my own that he lied?\u201d</p><p>I found out only by accident, when I searched online at his local newspaper to print out the list of graduates to complete the scrapbook page I made for Lincoln\u2019s present. His name was not listed among the one hundred and fifty graduates. I should know. I checked\u2014three times.</p><p>She sighs through the phone. \u201cMaybe you should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re biased,\u201d I snap. \u201cYou\u2019re on Lincoln\u2019s side because of Aires.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s older brother, Josh, and Echo\u2019s older brother, Aires, were part of the same military unit. No one knows the whole story, but they died two and a half years ago in Afghanistan, in a roadside bombing. I met Lincoln at Aires\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly,\u201d Echo says with an attitude that has very rarely emerged over the past two years, \u201cI\u2019m the one who said you shouldn\u2019t be writing a stranger and I\u2019m the one who said you needed to stop writing him because you were falling for him.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m overwhelmed with the urge to punch something\u2014hard, because... \u201cI know. Sorry. That wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a few moments. I crossed a line with her by throwing Aires into a fight. I pick at my thumbnail. We\u2019ve been best friends since birth and we never stay mad for long, but I don\u2019t want to get off the phone with her angry at me. At least not tonight.</p><p>\u201cHotel, motel or tent?\u201d I slur the last word as a curse. More silence, then a rustle of sheets. Please, please, please play along, Echo. I need my best friend.</p><p>\u201cMotel. We slept in the tent for the past few nights,\u201d she says in a light tone that causes me to smile. Yeah, I hate happy people, but Echo deserves happy. \u201cNoah\u2019s in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I draw out the word. \u201cHave you had sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She chokes. Hand to God, she chokes. I giggle as she coughs.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you do,\u201d I say when she recovers from her hacking fit, \u201cdon\u2019t let your first time be in a tent. That would be awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a tent could be romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d I say. Echo used to be in the only-if-there-is-room-service camp, like me, but then she permitted the hot and mysterious Noah to sway her to the dark side. \u201cDirt and bugs and snakes, Echo. Just saying.\u201d</p><p>In the background, I hear Hot and Mysterious\u2019s deep voice. Echo fumbles with the phone while she answers him. I check out the clock on my nightstand. Midnight. My mouth dries out as I smooth back my hair. Another night by myself.</p><p>No moon tonight so the entire world beyond my window is pitch-black. I don\u2019t want Echo to let me go because then I\u2019ll be alone again in this big, empty house.</p><p>Part of me hates Noah. If it wasn\u2019t for him, she wouldn\u2019t be in Iowa or Kansas or where the hell ever and would instead be staying the night with me. She wouldn\u2019t be spending all of her time with him and his friends: that scary guy with all the tattoos and Biker Chick Beth. Tattoo Boy and Biker Chick Beth also live with Noah\u2019s foster parents, and they were a year behind me and Echo at school. Echo says they aren\u2019t a couple, but I\u2019d bet the new heels I received for graduation they are.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Noah, she would need me more...she would still be insecure, she would still be obsessing over the scars on her arms. She possibly wouldn\u2019t have recovered her memory of the night she got them. If it wasn\u2019t for him, she wouldn\u2019t be moving on with her life. Damn him for being a great guy.</p><p>\u201cGuess I should let you go.\u201d Yep, I said it in a way that indicated that is so not what I want to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay on,\u201d she says. \u201cWe could keep our phones on all night. Just like we did in elementary school.\u201d Only then it was landlines. She would, because that\u2019s what best friends do.</p><p>I swear I hear Noah groan in agony. Guess he doesn\u2019t like BFF breaking in on make-out time.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d It\u2019s a lie. I stare at the scrapbook page that I lugged back to my room earlier and wonder where Lincoln\u2019s sleeping tonight. I should think I could sleep tonight, but the exhaustion only increases my terror...and deepens my sadness over Lincoln. I should have heard him out. Why didn\u2019t I listen?</p><p>\u201cI think you should talk to Lincoln,\u201d Echo says, reading my mind like always. \u201cMaybe wait until you\u2019ll know he\u2019s back home, like tomorrow evening, and DM him again.\u201d</p><p>My thumbnail clicks as I mess with it. \u201cI thought you wanted me to stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you already fell for him. Now I don\u2019t want you to have regrets.\u201d</p><p>Regrets. The moment I slammed the door on him, I sort of regretted it, and then I fully regretted it when I heard his engine accelerate down the road.</p><p>I hate that he won\u2019t be in Florida in the fall. I hate that I\u2019ll be alone at a strange college, in a strange state, and not know a soul. I\u2019ll be a complete and utter outsider. But what I really hate is that I\u2019ll never get to figure out if Lincoln and I would ever have been more than just friends.</p><p>Even with the lie, what I don\u2019t hate is Lincoln.</p><p>Echo remains on the phone with me as I lock every single window and every single door. It\u2019s only when I reach the front door and peek out onto the porch that I finally let her go.</p><p>My heart does this funny little tumble. Lincoln left the roses and an envelope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should have kept Echo on the line, and I almost press Send to reconnect, but curse myself. If I can\u2019t open a door and grab flowers and a letter then I should kiss Florida goodbye.</p><p>I undo the lock with an audible click. Thoughts of every urban legend and horror movie I\u2019ve ever heard or seen flood my brain. My hand hesitates over the doorknob and adrenaline pumps into my blood. Oh my God, I\u2019m such a wuss.</p><p>With disgust I wrench the door open and step out into the humid night. It\u2019s not an envelope but a piece of paper with the words: I\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t given up on Florida. I swear. Lincoln. He listed his cell phone number under his name.</p><p>I drop to the top step and caress the roses. Even in the heat, the petals are silky and cool. Lincoln is the only guy who has ever bought me purple roses. Sure, guys have bought me plenty of red ones, but not purple. Not my favorite.</p> <p>Is it possible that he does know me that well?</p><p>I jerk my head toward a rustle in the thick overgrowth next to the driveway. My entire body pulses. Part of me panics and begs to run back inside, but the frustrated part stubbornly stays planted on the wooden steps. I\u2019ve sat here countless times by myself in the middle of the night. Granted, my parents were asleep inside at the time, but why should now be different?</p><p>I swallow and dig deep for courage, snickering at my patheticness. With a sigh, I press Lincoln\u2019s number into my cell. Yeah, it\u2019s midnight, but he\u2019s either driving home or asleep somewhere. Either way, I\u2019ll leave a message.</p><p>The phone rings once, but then all I hear is footsteps: the snap of rubber hitting blacktop. My hand lowers from my ear as my eyes strain to scrutinize the dark road. The sound becomes louder, indicating it\u2019s coming nearer. I stand, my hands shaking at my side. My heart misses beats as it drums in my chest.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see it: a silhouette, a shadow...blackness in a form. Then there is breath. I scream.</p> <p>Lincoln</p><p>...and we\u2019ll be about an hour from the beach and I think we should go there every weekend. Oh, Lincoln!!!! You\u2019re going to the University of Florida too!!! This makes everything better.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you something that I haven\u2019t told many people. Actually, only two other people: I was thinking of backing out of Florida. The thought of being away from home and knowing no one, it scared me. I don\u2019t have to be scared now. I have YOU!!!!!!!</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>Each word from the letter she sent to me this past fall is embedded in my brain. From the moment I left my entire family slack-mouthed and shocked in the living room, I\u2019ve been trying to form a plan to fix all the mistakes that led to me not graduating. If I can clean up this mess and somehow go to Florida, then maybe Lila will forgive me.</p><p>The windshield acts as a recliner while my legs stretch out on the hood of my car. My clasped hands serve as a pillow. The air doesn\u2019t move. It\u2019s stagnant and strangles me like a twisted blanket. Sweat drips down my back as the cicadas celebrate the heat by chanting in the woods. From a few campsites over, children giggle near a crackling bonfire.</p> <p>Josh, Meg and I used to laugh when we roasted marshmallows at a campfire. That was before Mom and Dad began arguing over money, before Josh left for the military, before Meg got pregnant, before I started ditching school.</p><p>Today was jacked up. I walked out on my family and drove ten hours for Lila to slam the door in my face. Lesson learned: I need to talk faster. Or type faster.</p><p>In general: just be faster.</p><p>My parents remain ignorant of the fact that I didn\u2019t graduate today and of my exact location. But I\u2019m not that bad a son. I called, so at least they know I\u2019m alive.</p><p>On the hood next to me, my cell brightens and vibrates. I peek over and practically slide off when I notice the area code. Lila! The hood makes a booming, popping noise as I grab for the phone. It slips from my grasp and falls to the ground with a thud. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>The buzzing continues. I scramble over the side and search on my hands and knees through the dirt. A quick wave behind the tire and I snatch the cell, pressing Accept. \u201cLila, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>As I take a breath to tell her what happened and how I plan to fix everything, I hear a high-pitched scream.</p><p>Chills spread across my skin as ice enters my bloodstream. \u201cLILA!\u201d</p> <p>She sobs, begging God to help her. My hands dig into my jeans pocket, yanking out my keys. \u201cTalk to me!\u201d</p><p>My engine growls and the people from the adjoining campsite shield their faces from the glare of my headlights. Rocks kick up and hit the belly of the car as I tear out of the camp. \u201cLila!\u201d</p><p>A thump on Lila\u2019s end accompanied by tapping draws my attention back to her. She continues to cry. A rush of panic washes over me. Lila\u2019s alone. Her letter last week told me about her parents leaving and how she was terrified of an empty house.</p><p>And I abandoned her.</p><p>Then there\u2019s no noise. No tapping. No cries. Silence. A glance at my cell and my gut rips open. Call disconnected. The car shakes as it veers off the winding forest road. I jerk the steering wheel to the right. My eyes dart between the gravel and my desperate attempt to reconnect. Her phone continuously rings. Lila\u2019s cheerful voice fills the line. But it\u2019s a recording. A damn recording.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I slam my hand against the steering wheel. What the hell is wrong with me? I left her there\u2014defenseless.</p><p>Near the exit to the campgrounds, a park ranger waves at me to stop. As he opens his mouth to explain campsite hours, I spit out, \u201cCall the police! Call them now!\u201d</p><p>Red and blue lights become a homing beacon. My fingers drum the steering wheel as I coast into her driveway. The fear recedes as I see no ambulance, but then my frayed nerves explode in terror. What if the ambulance already took her? What if she\u2019s dead?</p><p>Nausea spreads through me, making me dizzy. I can\u2019t lose someone else I love. I can\u2019t. Please, God, please let Lila be okay.</p><p>I dash out of the car, the memories of my parents breaking the news of Josh\u2019s death replaying in my mind like a sick movie. I never got past the front door. I just saw them there, my parents crumpled together in a heap on the living room floor. My father holding my mother. My mother holding my father. Both of their faces consumed by tears.</p><p>I knew in that moment my brother had died.</p><p>My chest tightens and a crazy panic causes my hands to shake and my feet to quicken their pace. Not Lila. Not Lila too. A police officer spots me and turns his head as if he\u2019s going to say something, but I move faster\u2014my feet pounding up the wooden stairs, my hand twisting the sun-baked knob, my shoulder forcing the door open.</p><p>My legs wobble when I see her standing in the middle of her living room, and if it weren\u2019t for the two police officers in the room, I\u2019d fall to my knees.</p><p>She runs a trembling hand through her rumpled golden hair as she wraps her other arm around her stomach. Even with the warm summer air creeping into the air-conditioned living room, goose bumps form on her arms. She wears only a tank top and shorts.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d I say to expel the idea that I could be dreaming.</p><p>Both she and the police officer who speaks to her in a low, soothing tone glance at me. Relief smooths the lines on her forehead, and her arms drop to her sides. \u201cLincoln.\u201d</p><p>My name leaves her mouth in a relieved, airy rush, as if she\u2019s glad to see me. As if she wants to see me. And those gorgeous blue eyes stare at me like I\u2019m her man. My heart squeezes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She bites her bottom lip while nodding.</p><p>Having no clue what to say, I scratch the back of my head. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t finish. Lila half stumbles, half runs into my body. The fact that she\u2019s touching me, holding me, causes me to lose my balance. I quickly recover as her arms become steel bands around my waist.</p><p>I inhale, trying to figure out what to do. Ah hell, she smells like her letters; like lavender. I press my cheek against her silky hair and ease one hand onto the small of her back while the other hugs her shoulders.</p><p>Lila falling into me is peaceful, like landing on a feather bed. She\u2019s warm and soft, all curves and gentleness\u2014alive, fitting perfectly into my body. Just as I imagined.</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if Miss McCormick isn\u2019t alone tonight. Will you be staying with her, sir?\u201d asks the police officer, but the way she tilts her head and smirks at her partner informs me she can guess my response.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lila answers for me as she burrows her forehead into my chest. Her grip on me tightens. \u201cI know him. He\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Everything stills. I have never heard sweeter words. She knows me and she wants me to stay. I\u2019m not a stranger to her. Not some guy she barely identifies with. She knows me.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d the officer prompts.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cI will.\u201d I slide my hand along the curve of Lila\u2019s spine. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>Her nose moves against my chest as she nods. \u201cYes. Just freaked.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for sending you away.\u201d</p><p>Lila peeks up at me and I give her a half smile. \u201cI deserved it.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, light shines in her eyes. \u201cYou sort of did.\u201d</p><p>The police officer clears her throat and Lila steps away from me. My arms feel empty without her. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve dated more than a few girls and have never had this reaction.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay now, Miss McCormick?\u201d the officer asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she answers. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>The police officers inch toward the door and I block their path. \u201cWhoa. Wait. You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLincoln...\u201d Lila rubs her biceps. Her mouth scrunches to the right, calling my attention to her lips. \u201cI...uh...was calling you...and I thought I saw someone...and I guess you answered right as I screamed...and I, ah...dropped my phone...then it turned off...and then the police came and said you called them and...yeah.\u201d</p><p>And...yeah. Not buying it. \u201cBlood. Curdling. Scream.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dart to the police, then away. \u201cWell, I thought I saw something, but I was probably wrong.\u201d Then she looks at me, her eyes pleading, begging for me to drop it.</p><p>The muscles in my neck tighten.</p><p>\u201cWe searched the property,\u201d says the officer with a pitying smile at Lila. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t find anyone. Miss McCormick knows she can call us if there\u2019s an issue.\u201d</p><p>They think it\u2019s her imagination, yet I heard her terror. That type of scream can\u2019t be created by a fear in your head. That\u2019s death hovering in front of you wielding a bloody ax.</p><p>Lila thanks the officers and shows them out. With a click, she shuts the front door and, for the first time in my life I\u2019m completely alone in a room with the girl I\u2019ve fallen in love with. What the hell do I do now?</p><p>I should immediately tell her what happened with school. I should tell her my plan to fix things, how when I return home I\u2019ll sign up for summer school. I should tell her that the thought of losing her paralyzes me. Instead, I follow my gut. \u201cYou saw somebody, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lila collapses against the door and her face drains of all color. \u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her head dips forward. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it. The police think I\u2019m crazy. And ninety percent of me thinks everything\u2019s okay because if there was somebody outside they would have hurt me. But ten percent of me is pretty positive that someone is messing with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fold my arms over my chest, not liking the thought of anyone screwing with Lila. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and smiles at the same time, making it clear she doesn\u2019t believe the words. \u201cMaybe I have a stalker.\u201d</p><p>Maybe? Knowing what to do to help calm her nerves, I hold out my hand. \u201cStart talking, because I\u2019m not leaving until I know you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Lila</p> <p>When Josh first died, my parents got close, but as time has worn on, they\u2019ve grown apart. The worst moments are when my entire family is in the same room. With the people I should love the most surrounding me, I feel the most alone.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>Lincoln assesses the orange Post-it note on the oven meant to remind me to turn it off as he stirs milk over the stove top. From the second he knotted my fingers with his in the living room and led me into the kitchen, I\u2019ve found it impossible to tear my eyes away from him.</p><p>He grew\u2014stunningly so. Taller. Thicker. His blue eyes are aged beyond his years, but when he smiles at me he becomes carefree and eighteen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I respond. I downloaded everything, except he\u2019s not humiliating me with condescending looks or a lecture about overactive imaginations. I spilled about the scratching on the windows last night, the sound of shoes against the pavement tonight, and the shadow walking toward me and the sound of his breath.</p><p>The police didn\u2019t take me seriously, but the way Lincoln\u2019s shoulder blades tense, I can tell he believes me. \u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d He empties the steaming liquid into a mug.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>Lincoln slides the mug into my hands. His finger accidently skims mine. Electricity! A fantastic chill runs through me that reaches the tips of my toes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like liars and you\u2019re not big into hypocrites,\u201d he answers.</p> <p>Those were my words to him a few months ago when my sort-of friend, Grace, tormented Echo. Lincoln and I share a knowing smile and stare into each other\u2019s eyes. The world fades away and it\u2019s just me and him and a fragrant cup of hot chocolate in the palm of my hand. Lincoln breaks the link and withdraws his fingers. I\u2019d give anything for him to touch me again. But first...</p><p>\u201cYou have some explaining to do,\u201d I say. \u201cAs to why you didn\u2019t graduate.\u201d</p><p>He turns away and washes the pot in the sink. \u201cLet\u2019s figure out your problem first. Then we\u2019ll handle mine.\u201d The water beats against the pot. \u201cAre you still mad at me?\u201d</p><p>My finger circles the rim of the mug. Hurt\u2014yes. Angry\u2014\u201dNo.\u201d How can I be mad at a guy who drove ten hours to see me and returned after I rejected him? \u201cSo you believe me? That someone was outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you scream. No one\u2019s imagination works that well.\u201d</p><p>He grabs a dish towel and dries off the pot before placing it back on the hook on the wall. Lincoln\u2019s so efficient, especially for a guy who \u201cbends rules.\u201d With a scrape against the tile floor, he pulls out the chair next to mine and angles it so he\u2019s facing me. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, a stalker suggests multiple run-ins over a period of time. I think this is more of a prank.\u201d</p><p>The skin between my eyes squishes together. \u201cA prank? Really?\u201d</p><p>Lincoln relaxes into the chair, his long legs kicked out, an arm resting on the table. I feel like a dwarf next to him. He drums his fingers once against the table, causing me to focus on his hands. The skin is tough, rougher than the hands of most of the guys I\u2019ve dated. It\u2019s not an imperfection, but a reminder of how he dangles from rock walls.</p> <p>I wonder if he\u2019d ever let me watch him climb or if he\u2019d teach me. My stomach tickles as if fuzzy bunnies are jumping around. Would he catch me with those strong hands if I fell?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the CSI dictionary,\u201d he answers. \u201cDidn\u2019t an episode talk about how stalkers have patterns or some crap like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started watching CSI?\u201d I\u2019m grinning from ear to ear, and his cheeks redden in response. The big, strong rock-climbing guy folds his hands across his chest and switches his gaze to the floor. It\u2019s my favorite show ever, and I\u2019ve written a few letters to him detailing certain episodes.</p><p>He sloppily shrugs one shoulder. \u201cI caught a few shows here and there.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but the fact that he showed interest in something I like creates giddiness. I swirl the hot chocolate in my mug and blow on it in order to hide the glee. \u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s a prank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself. If someone wanted to hurt you, you\u2019d be hurt. Your parents are gone, and I\u2019d bet someone thinks it would be funny to scare you.\u201d</p><p>My forehead furrows with the idea that anyone would want to freak me out. \u201cWhy?\u201d I ask again.</p><p>\u201cBecause people can be stupid.\u201d</p><p>True. Tired of thinking about it, I change the subject. \u201cHot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it for Meg every night after she found out she was pregnant. It seemed to help calm her down when she\u2019d get all worked up.\u201d</p><p>Translation? He believes I\u2019m about to crack. My heart beats a little faster when I replay the image of the shadow walking toward me. Maybe he\u2019s not wrong. \u201cHas she held the baby yet?\u201d</p><p>Lincoln subtly shakes his head. \u201cI keep wondering how jacked up the kid will become because his mother can\u2019t get her shit together.\u201d</p><p>The way his blue eyes darken into hurt causes a sharp pain in my chest. I reach out and claim one of the hands resting against his crossed arms. Lincoln weaves his with mine and we hold hands on the table, both of us staring at our combined fingers. God, his hands are warm\u2014strong\u2014and I swallow as I imagine him caressing my face.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Echo?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s in Kansas or Iowa or someplace.\u201d Not here with me, and that sucks. She no longer needs me now that she has... \u201cShe\u2019s with Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s moved on,\u201d he says almost as a whisper.</p><p>From me? Yes. But she hasn\u2019t moved on the way Lincoln suggests. Sadness envelops me like a cloud. I\u2019ve witnessed Echo grieve for her brother. Hell, I\u2019m still grieving for Aires. He was like my older brother too. \u201cShe\u2019s living. Not forgetting.\u201d</p><p>Lincoln removes his hand to rub his face. I leave my hand on the table for a second, hoping he\u2019ll wrap his back around mine. When he lowers it into his lap instead, I curl my arm into my own body\u2014hating the rejection, missing his warmth. But I\u2019m not mad at him. I can see I\u2019ve lost him to memory. Echo has done this mental retreat several times herself.</p><p>We lapse into silence, I guess both of us processing the past couple of hours. The silence feels comfortable, like an old quilt, and I revel in it. But then my eyes dart to him. What if he\u2019s not comfortable? What if the written connection in our letters is all we possess? What if we don\u2019t ignite a real life spark?</p><p>What does it matter since he lied to me? We need to talk about it, but not now. Not when I\u2019ve barely slept in almost two days and my mind\u2019s a disoriented mess. He could explain basic addition and I\u2019d drool like an idiot.</p><p>Sleep\u2014I crave it, but can I have it? My thoughts shift back to the idea of someone pranking me. \u201cWho would want to scare me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d He kneads his eyes, and for the first time I notice the dark circles beneath them. He\u2019s tired and as I sip the warm drink, I realize my exhaustion is contagious.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d And the unknown terrifies me.</p><p>Lincoln</p><p>It\u2019s crazy how you brought up feeling alone. I feel alone a lot. Oddly enough, I feel the most alone when I\u2019m in a room full of people. Everyone I know is changing. Echo\u2019s distant. Grace wants new friends. Even Natalie is spreading her wings.</p><p>To be fair, I\u2019m changing too. At times I feel like my skin is too tight on me. All the time, I fight the urge to cut my hair and buy new clothes. I mean, who exactly am I going to change into? I\u2019m still me, but not.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>Lila\u2019s fingernail taps repeatedly against the table, like a machine gun firing off multiple rounds. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to deal with this now.\u201d She slams her hand on the table, silencing any more discussion on her possible prankster.</p><p>She stands and I follow, wondering if the park ranger will allow me back into the camp. Otherwise, I\u2019m screwed. \u201cCan I come back in the morning?\u201d Then I remember what time it is. \u201cLate morning? Afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Lila freezes the same way Meg does anytime she\u2019s near the baby. Hell, Lila hates me.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay? I told the police you would. You told the police you would. If you leave that would be like breaking the law or something, so you have to stay.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow at her logic\u2014or lack of logic\u2014but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m blowing this opportunity. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because you have to.\u201d</p><p>Lila leads me back into the living room and mumbles for me to stay put. Her footsteps are light down the hallway. The one-story house is the size of a mansion and decorated like one of Mom\u2019s Better Homes and Gardens magazines. Nice and breakable shit\u2014everywhere. After several abrupt sounds that indicate Lila must have accepted a wrestling match with an alligator, she reappears with blankets and a pillow.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind sleeping on the couch?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I\u2019d sleep on nails in order to be near her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She hands me the ingredients for a temporary bed.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Lila\u2019s fingers draw toward the hem of her tank top, and I remind myself to breathe when I catch sight of the sun-kissed skin of her flat stomach. In seconds, she pulls at the hem and her belly button disappears.</p><p>\u201cWell, good night,\u201d she says while tucking her golden hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Night,\u201d I respond. Should I hug her? Kiss her? Shake her hand? Get on my knees and start begging for forgiveness?</p><p>She shifts her footing but stays in place. \u201cThe bathroom is down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take a shower if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019ve already had this conversation. Lila sniffs as if her allergies bother her, and she lowers her head. I want to comfort her, but I have no clue how to tread on this territory. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d she whispers. \u201cNot even alone in a room. Isn\u2019t that pathetic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never be pathetic,\u201d I say. Not the girl I\u2019ve come to love from the letters. The girl who defended her best friend, even though taking that stand cost her other friendships. The girl who tells me exactly what she thinks of me, even when the truth hurts. The girl who dreams of being more\u2014the girl who dreams of Florida.</p><p>Her lower lip trembles. \u201cIf you think that, then you don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p><p>I know her better than she realizes. I know the letters she writes to me late at night are more emotional than the ones written during the day, as if a lack of sleep inhibits reasoning. I ditch the blankets and pillow on the arm of the couch and plop myself onto the cushions. \u201cCome here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze switches from the space on the couch to me. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>I snatch the extrahuge pillow and drop it on my lap. \u201cSleep here.\u201d</p><p>Lila stretches the hem of her tank top over her hips as she moves toward me. When she sits, it\u2019s with her thigh melting against mine. Her heat radiates past my jeans to my skin. Every single cell within my body sizzles to life. Play this right, Lincoln. She deserves a man, not a boy.</p><p>Without saying a word, Lila rests her head on the pillow and extends her legs on the couch. I drape the blanket over her body, and I love how she flips to her side, knees curled up in the fetal position.</p> <p>Her eyelids flutter as she talks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I slammed the door in your face.\u201d</p><p>A lock of her hair strays onto her cheek. I shouldn\u2019t, but I do it anyhow. With the same care I use when handling my nephew, I sweep the silky strands behind her ear. I\u2019d give my left arm to comb my fingers through her hair until she falls asleep. \u201cI deserved it.\u201d</p><p>Her chest expands and she yawns. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you graduate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was stupid.\u201d A nauseating pit forms in my gut. Stupid\u2014it\u2019s what Lila must assume about me. A moron who can\u2019t put two words together to form a sentence, a moron who can\u2019t add, a moron who didn\u2019t graduate. But that\u2019s not what happened. I didn\u2019t graduate because I stopped caring.</p><p>Lila closes her eyes and lazily mumbles, \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. I\u2019ve read all your letters\u2014several times. You\u2019re a good writer. And you got a twenty-nine on your ACT. That\u2019s hardly stupid.\u201d She pauses. \u201cNot unless that was a lie too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI only lied about graduating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about getting in to the University of Florida?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou told me you were accepted through early admission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut admittance was contingent on graduating.\u201d I struggle to find the right words. How do I prove to her that I\u2019m not lying? \u201cI\u2019ll send you my official ACT scores. I\u2019ll send you my acceptance letter. Whatever you need in order to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d She\u2019s motionless long enough that I wonder if she\u2019s drifted to sleep. Then she pats my knee and whispers, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Lila removes her hand, but my skin still burns from her touch. She believes me. Maybe, someday, she\u2019ll trust me. I prop my elbow on the arm of the couch and lean my head against my fist. I should keep my other arm resting on the back of the couch. Instead, I cave to temptation and snake it around her body. She nuzzles closer to me in response. For a girl who is just my friend\u2014just a pen pal\u2014this feels incredibly right.</p><p>\u201cLincoln?\u201d she urges.</p> <p>\u201cWe should wait until morning,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt is morning. And I\u2019m impatient.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. She is. Lila informed me of her unhappiness anytime a letter from me ran a day later than she thought it should have. I take a deep breath and jump.</p><p>\u201cI began skipping in the fall and then skipped more days than I should have. By the time I realized I hadn\u2019t earned enough classroom hours to graduate, I was already screwed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicker open. \u201cDid you skip because you missed Josh?\u201d</p><p>Hearing his name on her lips causes my chest to jerk. The familiar, unwanted pain spreads from my heart to my brain. She\u2019ll never know him. Never meet him. \u201cYeah, Josh. And everything else.\u201d</p><p>I told her in several letters that I had skipped. That when I woke in the morning and felt the emptiness of Josh\u2019s death, the burden of feeding a baby, the anger of listening to my parents argue, I\u2019d feel like I\u2019d explode if I didn\u2019t break free. So I\u2019d drive to the state park and climb until my fingers bled.</p><p>Her head rocks in my lap. \u201cI should have seen it coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeen what coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat when you can\u2019t handle things, you run.\u201d She wrote the same criticism in her letters to me when I told her I had skipped school.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I say.</p><p>Her only response is the rush of air blowing out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I repeat with the stubbornness of a dog gripping a chewed-up slipper in its jaws.</p><p>Lila fiddles with the frayed corner of the blanket. \u201cToday was your graduation day and you drove here to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cOnly stating the evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here for you.\u201d The tension in my muscles begs me to shift, but if I do, I\u2019ll give Lila an excuse to move. \u201cYou were upset with me.\u201d</p><p>A nagging pang of guilt causes my spine to straighten. What I said, it\u2019s not a lie. I came here for Lila. But then I remember my mom and dad fighting, the way Meg panicked when I asked her to hold the baby, and the nausea when I considered telling my parents about my failure.</p><p>Then my mind redirects to how summer school starts in forty-eight hours\u2014on Monday. I drove here with the intention of telling Lila that I was going to fix everything, but all I really wanted was to mend things between us. I rub a hand over my head. Is Lila right? Am I running from the real issues in my life?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d I say one more time. Even I notice the doubt in my voice.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she mumbles, exhaustion weighing down her words. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Because she\u2019d be disappointed in me. Because I was disappointed in myself. Because her dreams became my dreams and I failed us both. Because I was chicken shit.</p><p>Two years ago, Lila began writing about the University of Florida. She talked about it enough that I checked out the school. Way before I fell for Lila, I fell for the dream of heading to another state for school. To possibly gain my degree in forest resource and conservation; to work around rock walls for a living.</p><p>How the hell could I lose sight of my future?</p><p>My right leg begins to tingle and all I can think about is getting up, walking around, heading back to the campsite, exploring the trails\u2014even in the dark\u2014and finding a rock wall. Then I glance down at the beauty cuddled close to me.</p><p>Her breathing becomes light and she flinches in her sleep. The baby does the same thing when he enters REM sleep. I tuck the blanket around her and permit myself to touch her hair one more time.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not a runner. Not this time. She\u2019ll have more hard questions, and I\u2019m determined to answer them\u2014standing right in front of her. It\u2019s time I start facing the problems in my life instead of avoiding them. It\u2019s time that I create a plan and follow it through. And hopefully, Lila will forgive me and be by my side as I go forward.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to hate me,\u201d I whisper as I respond to her last question. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve fallen in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Lila</p><p>I thought of you when I climbed today. You should try it sometime. I think you\u2019d enjoy the rush.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>My entire body seizes at the sound of pounding. I jump, my hands flail, and then I finally crash onto the hardwood floor, a disheveled mess. That crack had to be my tailbone. \u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>I blink several times as I nurse my lower back. What am I doing in the living room?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d The gravelly, sleep-deprived voice causes my heart to thump hard once. My eyes dart above me to the couch. Lincoln stretches his arms over his head. Absolutely amazing. He slept sitting up, holding me, the entire night.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he says. His gorgeous eyes fall on me, and my cheeks warm when the corners of his mouth lift. Echo would make fun of me for the silly smile forming on my face.</p><p>Feeling suddenly shy and self-conscious, I comb my hair with my hand. Oh hell, tangles. Why, why, why do I always wake up resembling a troll? \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings several times and the pounding resumes. Sunlight streams through the venetian blinds. The brightness definitely hints at more of a midday than a morning situation. \u201cIt\u2019s probably Stephen,\u201d I say.</p><p>Lincoln\u2019s head jerks. \u201cYour ex?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll admit it. I sort of like the alpha-male pissed-off stare he\u2019s got going on. I scramble off the floor and for once heed my mother\u2019s Post-it note advice by glancing through the peephole. Nope, not the ex. Which is good since Lincoln looks annoyed enough to chop the boy into deer steaks.</p><p>\u201cLila!\u201d Grace yells. \u201cAre you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shout back to my ex-best friend. \u201cGive me a sec, Grace.\u201d</p><p>I turn to explain to Lincoln that it\u2019s Grace and ram right into his chest. Both of his hands land on my shoulders to steady me. \u201cI thought you two weren\u2019t on speaking terms after what happened with Echo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t. Which is why I need to answer. The world must have collapsed into a zombie apocalypse if she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>His grip on my shoulders changes into a massage that causes me to close my eyes. He could touch me like that for the rest of my life and I\u2019d never move. \u201cThen answer,\u201d he says.</p><p>My stomach knots into a big ball of dread. Lincoln\u2019s appearance screams that he just rolled out of bed and I\u2019m in my pj\u2019s and my parents are out of town and Grace is a huge gossip. \u201cCrap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hide,\u201d he says as if reading my mind. His hands slide off my shoulders and I have to fight the urge to pout. \u201cBut you\u2019d have to explain my car.\u201d</p><p>I brighten for two point one seconds and then deflate. \u201cI\u2019m not that creative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes alone with her. Maybe she won\u2019t notice the car.\u201d Lincoln starts down the hallway, then pauses to eye me in a way that suggests my clothes are riding up. \u201cYou look good right now. All rumpled and drowsy.\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck explodes with heat, and I immediately focus on the muscles of his biceps. Lincoln flashes a flirtatious grin, grabs an extra pair of jeans from his backpack, which leans against the door to my room, and disappears into the bathroom. Good Lord, he\u2019s hot.</p><p>Tangled thoughts of him and me muddle my groggy brain. He touches me and talks to me as if we\u2019ve known each other forever. Is it possible he\u2019s into me too? As more than friends?</p><p>Grace resumes her banging. I bat at the hair sticking on top of my head and open the front door. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>In a cargo skirt that grazes her knees and a white lace tank, Grace hitches her thumb toward the car. \u201cHave a guest?\u201d She takes in my clothes. \u201cAn overnight one?\u201d</p><p>Not interested in playing her games anymore, I say, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Shock and giddiness burst onto her face. \u201cReally? Who?\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time, I would have told her. She knew all of my secrets\u2014including my writing relationship with Lincoln. That is, until she chose her new friends over Echo. Echo and I have always been a package deal. What sucks is that I miss Grace. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you want to come in.\u201d</p><p>She does and practically pees her pants when she sees the pillow and blanket on the couch. \u201cYou had a guy overnight!\u201d she squeals.</p><p>I shush her while waving my hands for her to keep it down. Embarrassment creeps along my skin. Lincoln must be laughing his ass off. \u201cHow do you know? It could be a girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour girlfriends sleep in your room. So who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d And I can\u2019t think of anything believable, because the truth is unbelievable. \u201cLincoln. And you better keep it to yourself. This is private, Grace. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my hand, not missing a beat, acting as if our friendship didn\u2019t disintegrate in a shower of flames months ago. \u201cLincoln? Pen pal Lincoln? Oh. My. God. That is so...so...is he hot?\u201d</p><p>This is what I miss about Grace: her passion, her enthusiasm. And when she decided to, she could be a great friend. I clasp her hand back. \u201cSmoking.\u201d</p> <p>And I have the urge to call Echo and Natalie and force the four of us to be what we used to be\u2014inseparable.</p><p>\u201cHow long is he staying?\u201d Grace asks.</p><p>My energy fades and I release her. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Will Lincoln leave soon? Have I squandered the only time we may ever have together? Remembering last night\u2019s late conversation, I remind myself that leaving would be Lincoln\u2019s M.O.</p><p>Grace\u2019s cell phone chimes to indicate a text. She reads it, then shoves the phone into her purse. \u201cI\u2019ve got to bolt, but I have something to tell you. Which is why I came.\u201d</p><p>I circle my hand, motioning for her to continue.</p> <p>\u201cI overheard Stephen, Chad and Luke talking about how they\u2019ve been showing up here at night, trying to scare you since your parents went on vacation.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gapes and I go completely numb long enough to tense when the rush of anger pummels my bloodstream. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Stupid, right? Stephen thinks if you get scared, you\u2019ll call him, and then you guys can work things out.\u201d Grace glances at the blanket on the couch. \u201cGuess he didn\u2019t count on the dark horse pulling up late in the race.\u201d</p><p>Disoriented, I lean against the arm of the couch for support. Holy crap, I\u2019m not crazy. Someone was pranking me. But the relief is short-lived.</p><p>I lost my virginity to Stephen. He\u2019s the first guy I ever said the words I love you to. And he\u2019s betraying me? He\u2019s trying to scare me? What has he become?</p><p>I feel my eyes dart, even though I\u2019m honestly looking at nothing within the room. My mind rapidly tries to sort through the anger, the confusion and the weird emptiness. I\u2019m mad at Stephen\u2014all right, that\u2019s the understatement of the century. The next time I see him, I\u2019ll fry him like the catfish my brothers catch at the lake, but what I\u2019m lacking is the epic sense of betrayal, the massive pang of hurt, the emotions I experienced last night because Lincoln lied to me. I mean, Stephen and I were together for two years. That should count for something, right?</p> <p>\u201cLila?\u201d Grace refocuses my attention on her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bastard is going to hang from his toenails, but, yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Astonishingly so.</p><p>She fidgets with her class ring. \u201cDon\u2019t let him find out I\u2019m the one who told you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Okay. Sure.\u201d Grace and Chad are an item. She\u2019s worked hard over the past year to claim him as her guy. \u201cWhy did you tell me, anyway?\u201d</p><p>The fire that always consumes Grace dissolves. \u201cBecause I want us to be friends again. I made some really bad choices, and I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re leaving for Florida and if we don\u2019t fix this now, it won\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</p><p>Just as things will never be fixed between her and Echo. She doesn\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s there, hanging in the air like the stench of rotten fish.</p><p>A lot of bad blood has been shed, but maybe people can change. As much as that thought makes me happy, it also saddens me. No matter what, the relationship between Grace and me will never be the same. \u201cThanks for the heads-up.\u201d</p><p>Grace stands there, looking like a damn puppy locked in a cage at the store. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve got a soft spot for imprisoned animals. \u201cMaybe we could go shopping together sometime.\u201d</p> <p>She cracks a smile. \u201cYeah. That\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>I close the door behind Grace and walk to my bedroom. Across the hall, water beats against the tub as Lincoln takes a shower. A black T-shirt pokes out from the backpack still resting against my bedroom door. I told him to store the pack in my room last night as he was warming the hot chocolate, but I didn\u2019t realize what he\u2019d see: the stacks of letters still lying on my bed and the scrapbook page I made for his graduation.</p><p>I sink to the corner of my bed and stare into the room as if I\u2019ve never seen it. Everything is changing. My relationships are changing, my future is changing, my feelings are changing. My life is one big constant state of flux. I grew up scared of spiders, bees and dark corners in dimly lit basements. But this foe...change...it terrorizes me like nothing before.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I wish I wasn\u2019t growing up.</p><p>Lincoln</p><p>A rush? Heights and rocks sound like a huge risk. But if you were there, I think I would consider climbing.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>The high-pitch creaking of drawers being opened and closed greets me when I exit the bathroom. Across the hall, Lila yanks a manila file from her desk, flips through it, then dumps it onto the growing pile on the floor. The papers of the folder spill out, creating a fan.</p><p>\u201cLila?\u201d I ask and step into her room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find it.\u201d She hammers the drawer shut and opens the bottom one with such force that it falls out of the desk. \u201cI can\u2019t freaking find it!\u201d</p><p>My letters to her still sit on her bed, stacked neatly. My chest squeezes again at the sight of them. I can\u2019t believe it. She kept all my letters\u2014just like I kept all of hers.</p><p>The room represents Lila perfectly\u2014order, discipline. Yeah, everything fits, except for the golden-haired pixie set on mass destruction. \u201cCan\u2019t find what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy acceptance package from the University of Louisville. The one that has the paperwork for me to return. I put it in a file. I labeled it. I would have filed it in alphabetical order under Colleges, but it\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>She frantically searches through the files. Once. Twice. A third time. Lila slams her hands on the floor next to her. \u201cWhere is it?!\u201d</p><p>I approach her slowly. The way I had to with Meg when she found out she was pregnant. I bend my knees to crouch in front of her. \u201cWhy do you need the file?\u201d</p><p>Lila tilts her head as if she\u2019s noticing me for the first time. Her eyes are too wide for her delicate face. \u201cI\u2019m going to accept.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cAccept?\u201d I suck in air to steady myself. It\u2019s as if the girl socked me in the stomach with a bat. \u201cWhat about Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen\u2019s the one pranking me.\u201d The words tumble out as she clasps her hands over her chest. \u201cHe wanted to scare me, and it worked. I was terrified. Terrified! I can\u2019t do it.\u201d She chokes on a sob. \u201cI can\u2019t go to Florida. Not by myself.\u201d</p><p>I bolt upright. Rage explodes through me\u2014the eruption of the volcano complete. The bastard\u2019s dead. No question. \u201cTell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows scrunch together. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe asshole who has you doubting yourself. The asshole who scared you. Stephen.\u201d</p><p>Lila jumps to her feet. \u201cAll he did was point out what he already knew. That I can\u2019t handle being on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is bull.\u201d Unlike yesterday morning, I don\u2019t yell. This emotion burrowing through me, it\u2019s an eerie, deathly calm. Since Josh\u2019s death, I\u2019m used to numb, and Lila\u2019s letters have been the only weapon strong enough to slip past that wall. Since realizing I could lose the connection with her I\u2019ve felt anger, despair, guilt, hope, love and now pure, unadulterated rage.</p><p>\u201cBefore the prank you were ready to head south,\u201d I say. \u201cYour entire last letter was filled with what you wanted to do the moment you crossed the state line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was before!\u201d She throws her arms out at her sides. \u201cThat was when I thought I had someone.\u201d</p><p>The anger dissipates\u2014gone in a flash\u2014leaving emptiness behind. \u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Her eyelashes become wet as they flutter. \u201cYou were supposed to be right there beside me, and now you\u2019re not. I thought I\u2019d be able to convince Echo to come with me, but then she found Noah. I\u2019m by myself now. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not capable of going to Florida alone.\u201d</p><p>I scratch at the stubble forming on my jaw as she wipes at a renegade tear streaming from the corner of her eye. She glances away and I feel sick.</p><p>Lila was depending on me and I jacked it up for her. For my family. For me.</p><p>An overwhelming urge bubbles inside me to head home\u2014to talk to my family, the counselor at school, to fill out Florida\u2019s spring admissions paperwork, which the counselor gave me to motivate me to do well in summer school. Since Josh died all I\u2019ve been doing is ignoring my life, my future\u2014just like how Meg ignores her baby. Yeah, going home, it would be running, but not the kind I\u2019ve been doing for two years. It would be running forward instead of away.</p><p>When I left home to find Lila, I felt the first spark of awareness that things needed to change, but seeing Lila doubt herself, seeing her backtrack, it clears up my vision of what I need to do to get my life in order.</p><p>My grandpa once told me never to provoke an injured bear, especially one nursing its wounds, but sometimes the bear needs to be poked. \u201cWho\u2019s the runner now?\u201d</p><p>A flash of fear shivers up my spine at the way her ice-cold blue eyes strike through me. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Hope I know what I\u2019m doing. \u201cI came here for you, Lila. For the girl who would never let anyone walk all over her. For the girl who wouldn\u2019t be feeling sorry for herself because someone pranked her. Maybe I\u2019m not the only one who told a lie. Maybe you invented the girl in the letters.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open; her cheeks redden as if I had physically slapped her. \u201cYou are a jerk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mad now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now stop focusing on what you can\u2019t control and start focusing on what you can.\u201d Like summer school, working toward college, applying for spring admissions and not on my parents, my sister, my nephew...my brother\u2019s death.</p><p>Lila shakes her head, as if she\u2019s waking from a dream. She leans against the desk for support and runs her hands through her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>This is the girl I know: one hundred percent in or out. No waffling. A girl who treats life like a missile with a locked-in course.</p><p>Her eyes roam over me and I\u2019m confused by the slant of her lips.</p><p>\u201cLincoln?\u201d she says as the silly smile grows.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a shirt.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment heats my body and my hand darts to my chest, feeling the exposed skin. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Those blue eyes smolder. \u201cI\u2019m not. But you may want to get dressed for this.\u201d</p><p>Lila</p><p>...and on the rock climbing\u2014I think you\u2019re underestimating yourself.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>Lincoln walks beside me through the open field toward the tree line. He has a wide gait and I struggle to appear casual as I attempt to match his stride. His shirt\u2019s back on, which is a sin. He could definitely give Echo\u2019s guy a run for his money in the abs department. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the wooden shed, the combination lock whines as I spin it to the right, the left and then back to the right. With a click, I unlatch the lock and open the door. Sunlight streams in and dust particles dance in the beams.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what we\u2019re doing out here?\u201d Lincoln asks.</p><p>\u201cReclaiming my pride.\u201d Stupid Stephen and stupid me. The past six months of our relationship flip through my mind like a bad award show montage: how I told him I was going to Florida, how he balked and then started talking about how scared I\u2019d be once I moved. He played me. He played me so well that I almost abandoned my dreams.</p><p>If I\u2019m being deep-down honest, though, Stephen\u2019s prank was just the excuse I\u2019d been searching for to drop Florida. And I could include my anxiety over Echo leaving and Lincoln not heading to Florida in the fall in the pathetic-excuse category. The truth is I\u2019ve doubted going away to school because I\u2019ve doubted me. I\u2019m afraid of being alone.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how to fix my fear, but I do know how to fix Stephen.</p><p>Once my eyes adjust to the darkness of the shed, I walk in and grab my brothers\u2019 paintball guns. Lincoln was completely right. It\u2019s time to stop being scared and start being proactive. It\u2019s time someone turned the tables on the slimy little bastard.</p><p>I toss Lincoln one of the guns. He raises his eyebrows once he realizes what he holds in his hands.</p><p>\u201cShoot for their feet,\u201d I say. \u201cTheir shoes cost two hundred and fifty dollars and they\u2019d be pissed if they got stained.\u201d</p><p>His wicked smile answers that he understands the plan and that he\u2019s on board. \u201cHave you ever used one of these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d But it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever broadcast to the world. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Good. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six hours until sunset, and then it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Lincoln\u2019s eyes travel over my body, his gaze lingering on my curves. \u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love.\u201d</p><p>At the word love, my insides flutter. I tuck my hair behind my ear, trying to imagine how sexy I could possibly be while wearing a pair of ratty cutoff jeans and a T-shirt and cradling a paintball gun. And then I wonder what it would be like if he really was falling for me, because Lincoln in real life is a million times more intense than Lincoln in letters...and I\u2019m seriously falling for him.</p><p>Lincoln</p> <p>Will you go outside on the 28th and watch the meteor shower? I know what you\u2019re thinking: 3:00 a.m.? But I think it will be beautiful. Besides, it will be cool to know that you\u2019re watching the sky at the same exact time as me.</p><p>~ Lila</p><p>With a hip cocked in the door frame of Lila\u2019s room, I watch as she towel-dries her hair. Earlier, I witnessed Lila hit bull\u2019s-eye after bull\u2019s-eye with that paintball gun. The girl ain\u2019t playing. Experiencing her Rambo side brought on some fear.</p><p>I chuckle to myself. It also turned me on.</p><p>The late-afternoon sun floats into her bedroom. We\u2019ve got a few hours until nightfall. Being a natural climber, I called the high position in the trees. Lila plans to be at ground level.</p><p>She tosses the towel into a hamper and combs through her hair. \u201cWhen will you have to leave?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI called my parents while you were in the shower. I told them I\u2019d be home by Monday morning.\u201d I also told them to expect major changes when I finally did arrive home\u2014that I was going to focus on my future, not on the past. They weren\u2019t happy I left so suddenly and that I didn\u2019t graduate, but they weren\u2019t irate.</p><p>She bites her lower lip and sinks to her bed. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Our gazes meet, and it\u2019s the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever felt staring into someone else\u2019s eyes. \u201cWill you be okay by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI\u2019ll probably wake to every little sound, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d My eyes widen as I realize what I said. Lila\u2019s not my girl. I want her to be, but... \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I like what you said.\u201d Lila glances away, her hair swinging into her face.</p><p>Could she possibly feel what I feel? Lila and I were once strangers who met at a funeral. We became friends through letters, bonded by a shared dream of college in another state, and then I fell for her. Could she have also fallen for me?</p><p>In a handful of hours, I\u2019m going to head home, and the one lesson I learned from Josh\u2019s death is that life has to be lived now; the future isn\u2019t always guaranteed. I have this one shot with her, and I\u2019m going to take it. \u201cThis past fall you told me that you felt close to me even though we\u2019re hundreds of miles away.\u201d</p><p>Lila\u2019s eyes jump to mine, I guess in shock that I remembered.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I continue, \u201cthat\u2019s what it\u2019s been like for me too. I\u2019ve never shared my private thoughts with someone other than you, and I can\u2019t imagine sharing them with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>I pause, terrified to continue. If I\u2019m wrong on this, I\u2019ll ruin the relationship Lila and I share. Lila fidgets with a strand of her wet hair and keeps those gorgeous innocent eyes locked on me. No, I\u2019ve fallen for her and I\u2019ll regret walking away from this moment.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Lila. As more than a friend. I wake up in the morning and I think of you. I go to bed at night and you\u2019re the last thought in my mind. I dream of you. The best days of the week are the ones when I get your letters.\u201d</p><p>She blinks once, her face frozen. My stomach sinks. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t feel the same way, it\u2019s okay. I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLincoln,\u201d she says before I can finish. \u201cI feel that same way...for you.\u201d</p><p>I inhale as if it\u2019s the first breath I\u2019ve ever taken. Lila cares for me. I step into her room and pause beside her. \u201cCan I sit?\u201d Because it\u2019s her bed and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ve got permission for a place as sacred as that.</p><p>She scoots over, creating a space for me. I lower onto the bed and my heart picks up speed. I rub my hands against my jeans and release a slow, steady stream of air. \u201cI\u2019ll be starting summer school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Lila angles her body toward me, a sure sign I\u2019ve got her attention.</p><p>\u201cMy guidance counselor said that I\u2019ve got a good chance at spring admission to the University of Florida because of my ACT and SAT scores and my grades before this year. He thinks if I can focus on summer school and write a kick-ass essay on how I learned from my screwup, the admissions board will look past my mistakes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to admit, until I came here, I was still ignoring what needed to be done. I knew I wanted to fix us, but watching you tackle your fears has helped me realize that I\u2019ve got to tackle mine. I\u2019ve made mistakes and I\u2019m going to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Her thin, delicate fingers rest on her knee. Two and a half years ago, Lila and I sat outside a funeral home and she had the courage to reach over to me when I described my relationship with my older brother. No, I didn\u2019t cry at Josh\u2019s funeral, but what I never told anyone was how I wept like a baby to a girl I had never met before...to Lila.</p><p>Channeling the same strength she showed that night, I place my hand over hers. Lila immediately laces her fingers with mine.</p><p>I continue. \u201cI should have told you the truth about not graduating before, but I didn\u2019t want you to be disappointed in me\u2014I didn\u2019t want to admit that I let you down. I know I\u2019m going to be a semester late, but I\u2019m coming to Florida, Lila, and I swear I won\u2019t let you down again.\u201d</p><p>A tender smile eases onto her lips. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there\u2014waiting.\u201d</p><p>My chest expands as I lean into her. Her lavender scent engulfs me, and those sky blue eyes draw me in. \u201cI like you,\u201d I whisper as I nuzzle the satin skin of her cheek. More than like, but I don\u2019t want to rush things.</p><p>Lila tilts her head and whispers against my lips, \u201cI like you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her kiss is soft and warm\u2014inviting. We both explore, a hesitant dance as we glide over lines neither one of us imagined crossing. I let go of her hand to push the damp hair away from her face. My fingers trace her cheekbone, then drift to the nape of her neck.</p><p>My skin vibrates when a feminine sigh escapes her lips\u2014a sound of approval, a sound of longing. Lila shifts and I take advantage by wrapping an arm around her body. She weaves her fingers into my hair and pulls me closer. My blood heats and so does our kiss.</p><p>I suck in her lower lip and in our next breath our tongues slide against one another. Hands\u2014my hands, her hands\u2014roam. Over arms, over backs, memorizing curves, lingering near shirt hems.</p><p>We kiss and touch and continue to kiss. With hearts beating hard and breath difficult to catch, we press our lips together one final time, then break away.</p><p>Yeah, we\u2019ve crossed lines today, but there are some borders neither one of us is eager to breach. Lila\u2019s eyes shining up at me confirm her approval of the new path we\u2019ve chosen, and on this path we have time to explore, we have time to kiss, and we have all the time in the world to fall in love.</p><p>Lila</p><p>The entire sky erupted into hundreds of streaks of light. I never felt so alive. I wished that you were here with me or me with you. But I think you were. Call me crazy, but it was a moment, Lila, and I\u2019m glad I shared it with you. Even if it was from a couple hundred miles away.</p><p>~ Lincoln</p><p>\u201cI need a code name,\u201d Lincoln says over the walkie-talkie I confiscated from my youngest brother\u2019s room. It\u2019s midnight and the two of us have been hunkered in our positions since nine.</p><p>If I squint and stare long enough, I can decipher Lincoln\u2019s shadow fifteen feet in the air in the large oak tree near the front of the house. It almost looks as if the tree has a cancerous growth springing from it. For the first hour, I worried over how he dangled from the branch, but I soon discovered that Lincoln\u2019s as comfortable with heights as I am at a sale at Macy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d I ask. Behind the row of bushes and up against the trunk of a weeping willow, I scan the midnight horizon. The sky\u2019s clear. Beautiful white stars twinkle down on us, but there\u2019s no moon tonight. A good thing, as Stephen and his traveling band of hyenas won\u2019t see us. A bad thing, as it makes it hard for us to spot them.</p><p>\u201cSomething dangerous, like Razor or Blade.\u201d</p><p>I hear the tease in his voice and accept the bait. \u201cHow about Abe? Or Honest? Those sound like perfect code names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har. How about you lay a president joke I haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been like this for the past three hours\u2014a comfortable steady stream of conversation. Earlier, Lincoln kissed me...and I kissed him back. Before coming out here, we spent a couple of hours wrapped in each other\u2019s arms on my bed, alternating between talking and kissing.</p><p>My heart aches when I think of him leaving in the morning, but we have a plan and both of us are sticking to it.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d I ask. \u201cThat you had feelings for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Static on the other side. Crap. Maybe I went too far.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cIt grew over time. I guess I first knew something was up when I wanted to scratch out Stephen\u2019s name from your letters.\u201d</p><p>I giggle, totally unashamed that I like that he was jealous.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, though...You wrote me a letter back before school started and I took it with me on one of my climbing trips. At the top of the rock, I read your letter and realized you were the one person I wished I could share the view with.\u201d</p> <p>My lips tilt up with his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the letter about?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cNothing. That\u2019s the strange part. You\u2019ve sent me letters about Echo and Stephen and Grace and your family and Florida and I loved those letters. I knew you were sharing your soul with me. But this one letter, you talked about lying in your backyard and watching the leaves in the trees blow. When I was done reading, I found a four-leaf clover tucked into the envelope. I knew then that I wanted to share the big moments with you, but more important the small. I want to climb rocks with you, Lila, then spend quiet time at the top sharing the view with you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth curls around my heart. I want the same exact thing. \u201cI sent you the clover so you\u2019d have good luck with your admissions letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll work again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I have to find you another clover?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cNope. I still have the first one tucked safely in my wallet. I like having something from you close to me.\u201d</p><p>Overwhelmed, I feel my throat swell a little. He kept a gift I gave him. In his wallet. That is unbelievably sweet.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d he asks hesitantly. \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of the meteor shower,\u201d I answer automatically. \u201cAnd then the letter you sent after it.\u201d I think of the hundreds of lights dancing across the night sky. \u201cI knew you were watching. I know it sounds stupid, but I felt you with me, and then when you sent that letter describing that night...\u201d I drop off, unable to find the right words to explain the emotion.</p><p>Lincoln rescues me. \u201cI know. Me too.\u201d</p> <p>We sit in silence for a few seconds, both of us absorbing the moment. Finally, I clear my throat and ask, \u201cHow many hours is the University of Florida from you again?\u201d We\u2019re going to take turns driving back and forth to visit on the weekends and we\u2019ll talk on the phone and we\u2019ll Skype and, of course, write letters.</p><p>\u201cAbout four if I stick to the recommended posted limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the law,\u201d I remind him. \u201cLike the get-a-ticket-if-you-break-it type of law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA suggestion,\u201d he responds.</p><p>Before I can compose my comeback, Lincoln breaks in through the radio. \u201cIncoming.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens. They\u2019re here. My eyes sweep the yard around my house and my pulse begins to beat in my ears.</p><p>I wipe my hands on the side of my jeans to dry them of sweat and lie flat on the ground. Movement out of the corner of my eye causes my breathing to hitch. Three forms skulk against the side of the house. One of them raises its hand in the air, waving for the other two to head toward the front porch.</p><p>The lone stray shadow creeps to my bedroom window. Asshole. This has to be Stephen.</p> <p>I ready the paintball gun, the tank tucked into my shoulder. I align my sight and decide against the shoes, aiming for the heart. Let\u2019s see how he feels after I sink a couple of balls into it.</p><p>Lincoln\u2019s under strict instructions\u2014he\u2019ll shoot only after I fire, and Stephen is mine.</p><p>After a few seconds, Stephen raises his hand and rakes his fingers down my window.</p><p>It is so not your night tonight, buddy. Last night, I was terrified. Now, I feel empowered.</p><p>I pull the trigger. Pop, pop, pop, pop. The figure yelps and bends over as each ball pummels his body. Shouts from the front of the house tell me that Lincoln has hit his prey.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on the move. On the move.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s voice crackles on the radio.</p><p>His silhouette swings down from the tree in effortless grace, and once on the ground he takes off for the front of the house. I refocus on Stephen. His head whips back and forth, looking for his attacker in the bushes. \u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>I drift up from the ground. Still hidden by the rain of branches from the weeping willow, I plug two more balls into the ground, right near his feet.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he yells as he dances away from the paint.</p><p>With a snap, I flick on my flashlight and aim it at his face. He places his hand above his eyes in an effort to see who approaches. Paint smears his favorite shirt and jeans. Good. I aimed too low, though, and barely stained his two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar athletic shoes.</p><p>I toss the flashlight in his direction on the ground. He blinks twice when he recognizes me. \u201cLila?\u201d Shock widens his eyes. \u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>This time I aim directly at his shoes. Pop. Pop. Light blue bleeds over his ex-white sneakers. \u201cI\u2019m going to Florida, Stephen. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>Headlights flash near the driveway. \u201cStephen!\u201d yells Luke from the driver\u2019s side. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When Stephen hesitates, Luke honks the horn and beats his hand against the door of his car. Stephen glances at me one more time. \u201cLila\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re still some white spots on your shoes.\u201d I set my sight on his obsession again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call when you\u2019ve regained sanity,\u201d he huffs as he retreats to his moronic friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shooting you with a paintball gun at midnight,\u201d I shout after him. \u201cI think we left sane behind a couple of days ago.\u201d</p><p>When the red taillights of Luke\u2019s car disappear, I drop the paintball gun to the ground, flop down beside it and rest my arms on my bent knees.</p><p>From the front of the house, a shadow emerges. Yesterday, I would have lost it if I were outside in the dark with a large figure looming. In fact, yesterday I did just that. Funny how much can change in twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d asks Lincoln.</p><p>Let\u2019s see, my best friend has moved on, I\u2019ve conquered my fear of moving away, I shot my pranking ex-boyfriend with a paintball gun and I\u2019m alone with a guy who causes my heart to stutter. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>And I mean it. It\u2019s a small yet humongous realization: I\u2019m always going to be scared of something\u2014spiders, the dark, being on my own\u2014but I don\u2019t have to let the fear be in control.</p><p>\u201c...and when I came around the corner, he ran into the door of his car and slammed right onto the ground.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s shoulders move with his laughter as he recaps tonight\u2019s events, and I giggle along with him. We lie next to each other on my bed: me in my pj\u2019s of a tank top and shorts and Lincoln in a fresh pair of jeans and a T-shirt.</p><p>Our laughter fades and we both stare into the darkness. The chirping of the crickets from the other side of the window fills the silence. My muscles have that good, exhausted jellyfish feel. It\u2019s two in the morning and even though I\u2019m definitely tired enough for sleep, I\u2019m not ready to give up this precious time with Lincoln.</p><p>As if reading my mind, he turns his head toward me. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I flip so that I\u2019m facing him and traitorously yawn.</p><p>Lincoln chuckles and mirrors my position. He runs his fingers down my arm, starting at the edge of the strap of my tank and ending at the tip of my elbow. I shut my eyes with the exquisite tickle. I inch closer to him and happily sigh when he cups the curve of my waist. It\u2019s a heavy, warm weight that creates the sensation of protection.</p><p>\u201cYou should go to sleep, Lila.\u201d Good God, his voice is beautiful\u2014deep and smooth.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can sleep tomorrow and the day after that. I only have you for a few more hours.\u201d My stomach sinks and I open my eyes. \u201cBut you should sleep. You\u2019ve got a long drive in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should.\u201d Lincoln shifts his head so that his mouth is wickedly near mine. I lick my lips and inhale to steady my breathing. We\u2019ve kissed three times since this afternoon. Each time he\u2019s hypnotized me, and I\u2019m greedy to be captivated again.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYou should.\u201d But I really don\u2019t want him to\u2014not yet. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>His hand slips to the small of my back and presses so that our bodies now touch. A rush of air escapes my lungs. Holy hell, he\u2019s solid. I allow a hand to skim along his back, and Lincoln smiles with the caress.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he says. My skin tingles as his mouth whispers against mine. \u201cSleep. But not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I try to ask innocently.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He brushes his nose along the curve of my neck, and I could almost moan in frustration. I want kisses, lots of kisses, but I also love the slow burn. Lincoln has talent, and my heart beats faster when I think of all the hundreds of ways we could spend our evenings.</p><p>He slowly creates a trail along my cheek, and just when I\u2019m on the verge of begging, his lips finally come within butterfly-inducing distance of mine. This is one of my favorite moments: the seconds before the kiss. It\u2019s like dangling on a ledge with gravity pulling me forward and the wind daring me to let go and fly.</p><p>Lincoln breathes out and I breathe in. A synchronized movement that causes my mind to disconnect and conscious thought to float away. A nudge forward on his part, a tilt of my head, and then we fall.</p><p>His mouth is hot against mine and my hands tangle in his hair in response. Our lips part and our tongues slide together, a delicious slow movement that makes me want to purr like a cat.</p><p>Earlier, we let our kisses be just what they needed to be: simple, a sign of trust, a sign of what\u2019s to come, but this feels like more. After the words we\u2019ve said to each other tonight, I\u2019m tempted by more, but I\u2019m not ready to give up that slow burn.</p><p>Lincoln draws my lower lip between his, releases it and then lifts his head. The warmth and sincerity in his eyes tells me he\u2019s not ready to leave the slow burn either. This is why I\u2019m with him, because Lincoln gets me, understands me, possibly more than I understand myself.</p><p>\u201cHow about one more kiss?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHow about more than one?\u201d I counter. \u201cJust a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d he agrees. His body melts against me and our lips meet again\u2014a warm, building kiss that causes me to arch into him. Beneath his massive body, I feel small, fragile and protected. I\u2019ve never felt so feminine, so in tune with another.</p><p>Our movements are soft and deliberate. Fingers exploring skin, lips moving in time, feet rubbing against each other. Until it becomes time for one last kiss. One that will be singed into my memory and will carry over until I can be in his arms again.</p><p>Lincoln places his forehead on mine and caresses my cheek. My fingers trace the hollow of his neck, and I enjoy the beat of his heart against my chest.</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep,\u201d he says.</p><p>Unable to speak, I nod. Lincoln rolls onto his back and pulls me so that I\u2019m cradled against him. He kisses the top of my head and combs his fingers through my hair. \u201cThank you, Lila.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Words are still hard, but I find the energy to ask, \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor helping me find me again.\u201d</p><p>I mold myself around him and wonder what our future will look like. Someday distance will no longer be an issue and we\u2019ll have more than just letters\u2014we\u2019ll be together. Who knows...maybe forever.</p><p>\u201cYou were always in there. You just weren\u2019t looking in the right place.\u201d I pause. He\u2019s not the only one who rediscovered himself this weekend. \u201cNeither one of us were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he agrees and gathers me closer. \u201cBut we figured it out.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and hug my body to his. Two years of letters, two years of redefining myself and two years of falling for my best friend. As I cuddle into Lincoln, I know that I would relive it all in order to experience this moment again.</p><p>Lincoln</p><p>I think sometimes things we don\u2019t like happen so we can appreciate the good. Like, can I really enjoy a sunrise if I didn\u2019t experience the darkness of night? Without her past, Echo would never have met Noah, and without her losing Aires, I would never have met you. So, yeah, I do mean what I said in the last letter. You are like a sunrise in my life.</p><p>~ Lila</p> <p>Stretched out on her stomach with her face toward me, Lila sleeps. Her tousled hair falls over her shoulder, onto her cheek. I\u2019ve been awake for an hour, watching her. She smiles when she dreams. Twice, little lines formed between her eyebrows and I had to stop myself from smoothing them out. She\u2019s too beautiful to wear worry. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to ensure her happiness.</p><p>Birds begin to chirp outside Lila\u2019s window\u2014a warning of the impending moment. Soon, I\u2019ll have to say goodbye.</p><p>I\u2019ve got a long drive and a lot of work in front of me in order to catch up with Lila. After spending time with her, going back to letters will be difficult, but we also agreed to phone calls and Skype and weekend visits.</p><p>I skim my finger against the soft skin of her cheek, and her head angles toward my touch. Her eyes flutter open and her lips edge up when she sees me. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I respond.</p><p>Someday I\u2019ll teach her how to climb a rock wall, I\u2019ll introduce her to my parents, let her hold my nephew and I\u2019ll confess my love.</p> <p>Lila reaches up and smooths the hair near my ear. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve known you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like you,\u201d she says in a low, sexy tone. And I recognize it, the spark in her eyes. It\u2019s more than like, more than attraction.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Her hand glides down to my chest and pauses over my heart. When our eyes meet, I know she notices the spark within me too. I capture her hand and keep it against my chest as I lean in for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI still expect two letters a week,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Our lips move against each other\u2019s, and in between breaths I say to her, \u201cI\u2019ll send you three.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
