Please stand.\u201d</p><p>She stood. So did Gavin.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to say anything before we discuss your case?\u201d</p><p>Gavin glanced at the members of teen court and then at the magistrate. \u201cPermission to speak on Sierra\u2019s behalf, Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>The magistrate\u2019s hard gaze zoomed to him. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin Daniels, Your Honor. Sierra\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission granted. What\u2019s on your mind, Mr. Daniels?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that a community service sentence is often handed down in a case like this. I agree that it would be a good lesson for my daughter. But I respectfully request you consider an alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, Mr. Daniels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we will be moving out of state next week.\u201d Gavin shot Sierra a harsh look when she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNext week?\u201d the magistrate asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Honor. The day of my daughter\u2019s arrest last month I was meeting with Judge O\u2019Connor and he granted me sole custody of Sierra at her mother\u2019s request. Since I\u2019m no longer legally bound to live in Arizona, we\u2019ll be moving closer to family.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cWhere will that be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSundance, Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye he saw Sierra gaping at him, but Gavin kept his attention on the magistrate.</p><p>\u201cIn light of this being your first offense, your guilty plea and the security guard recovering the stolen item, I will dismiss the charge\u2014provided you have no contact with the store and you have no subsequent incidents in the next six months. Then this infraction will be expunged from your juvenile record.\u201d</p><p>The magistrate looked at Sierra. \u201cAnd to be honest...your father forcing you to move to Wyoming is punishment enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you and I\u2019m never ever ever going to forgive you for this! Why are you ruining my life?\u201d</p><p>Choking silence filled the air.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d he asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cWill you change your mind about making me move to Bumfuck, Wyoming?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot on your life, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d She stomped off.</p><p>He listened to her footsteps fading on the tiled floor, counting out the seconds.</p><p>Wait for it... Wait for it...</p><p>Slam.</p><p>Yep. There it was. God knows her tantrum wouldn\u2019t be complete without a house-shaking door slam.</p><p>Gavin loaded his lowball glass with ice, then filled it with Crown XR. He knocked back half the whiskey in one swallow.</p><p>Damn kid was driving him to drink\u2014something even her psychotic mother hadn\u2019t been able to do. Wasn\u2019t the first time Sierra had professed her hatred for him\u2014nor would it be the last.</p><p>His announcement in teen court today had come as quite a shock to her. But her arrest had been the last straw, especially after his ex-wife had called shoplifting \u201ca teenage rite of passage\u201d and excused Sierra\u2019s bad behavior.</p><p>Problem was, bad behavior had been the norm for Sierra since the beginning of her freshman year. She broke curfew without explanation or apology. She lied about her plans. Her grades had slipped. She\u2019d become surly and defiant with an air of entitlement\u2014much like her mother.</p><p>Sharing joint custody with his ex-wife meant his attempts at keeping their daughter on the right path were largely ignored whenever Sierra stayed at Mommy Dearest\u2019s house. So Gavin considered it a sign, an omen, hell, a blessing, when Ellen suddenly announced she was moving to Paris with her boyfriend du jour.</p><p>After years of custody battles, she signed over full custody of her only child for one year. Evidently Ellen didn\u2019t want parental responsibilities spoiling a good time in gay Paree.</p><p>His self-centered ex hadn\u2019t considered how her actions would affect Sierra. Once again he\u2019d been left holding the bag, standing helplessly outside her bedroom door, listening to his daughter cry.</p><p>That\u2019s when he\u2019d known they both needed a drastic change.</p><p>He\u2019d called Rielle, he\u2019d called Charlie and Vi, and he\u2019d called a moving van.</p><p>By this time next week they\u2019d be living in Sundance.</p><p>If they didn\u2019t kill each other on the eighteen-hour drive to Wyoming first.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the man is kicking you out of your own bedroom. What an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Rielle ignored Rory\u2019s comment and lugged the box of yarn downstairs into the last bedroom on the main level.</p><p>Rory followed her. \u201cMom. Seriously, you don\u2019t have to stay here. My cabin will be empty next week when I\u2019m back at college in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but this is fine. And it\u2019s not like Gavin is throwing me out\u2014\u201d her eyes narrowed on her daughter, \u201c\u2014which he has every right to do because he owns this house.\u201d</p><p>Rory plopped on the bed. \u201cI know that. But you have to admit you never thought he\u2019d move here permanently and take over ownership.\u201d</p><p>Rielle moved a stack of bedding off the dresser. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault since I\u2019ve been dragging my feet on getting West Construction to start on my building plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say it\u2019s lucky that you\u2019ve stayed on as caretaker and he shouldn\u2019t expect you to just move everything at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky? I\u2019ll remind you that I\u2019m lucky and I wouldn\u2019t even be living here if it wasn\u2019t for Gavin saving me from financial ruin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial ruin,\u201d Rory scoffed. \u201cHe only bought the land and buildings to one-up the McKays\u2014which is ironic since he is a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin\u2019s last name is Daniels.\u201d</p><p>Rory waved off her comment. \u201cSemantics. If it looks like a McKay, acts like a McKay...then it is a McKay.\u201d</p><p>Pointless to argue with her headstrong daughter when it came to her opinions on the McKay family\u2014opinions that she herself often shared.</p><p>\u201cWhen do they get here?\u201d Rory asked.</p><p>\u201cThey left Scottsdale today, but Gavin said they\u2019re taking a couple extra days to play tourist. Sierra starts school in a week, so I\u2019m assuming they\u2019ll be somewhat settled in by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met the precocious and precious only child Sierra?\u201d</p><p>Rielle used a decorative pillow to whap Rory\u2019s arm. \u201cWatch it, Aurora Rose Wetzler. Lots of folks around here said the same thing about you when you were sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, mamacita, that argument ain\u2019t gonna fly. You rode herd on me from the time I was a little tyke. I never had the chance to get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look where me cracking the whip got you\u2014a graduate assistantship at UWYO as you\u2019re working on your Master\u2019s.\u201d Rielle stood in front of Rory and tucked a strand of her wild blonde hair behind her ear, like she\u2019d done a hundred times. She still experienced that same overwhelming burst of love as she had the first time she\u2019d cradled the squalling baby in her arms twenty-four years ago. \u201cI\u2019m so damn proud of you, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, Mom.\u201d Rory hugged her. \u201cBut stop this mushy stuff or we\u2019ll both start crying. There\u2019ll be plenty of tears when I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d She clutched her a little tighter. At six foot one, Rory towered over her by eight inches\u2014making her daughter a supersized version of her instead of a mini-me. Rory\u2019s green eyes\u2014identical to her own\u2014contained a devilish twinkle. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this shit done because I have a surprise for you later. And no groaning \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna be awesomely fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>They cleared out both the bigger bedrooms upstairs. Rielle opted to leave the existing furniture in the great room downstairs. If Gavin wanted to replace it with his furniture, fine, but somehow she doubted his home furnishings from Arizona would mesh with the western d\u00e9cor.</p><p>She propped her shoulder against the doorjamb, letting her gaze wander. She\u2019d spent months decorating this main room, scouring auctions, secondhand stores and yard sales for funky western pieces. Using a little imagination and a lot of elbow grease, she\u2019d repurposed everything\u2014from rusty tractor parts and old wooden household implements to rodeo memorabilia.</p><p>The room reflected her personality and life philosophy: quirky, bohemian, old items interspersed with new. Some pieces were high-end, some were low-rent. Vibrant colors and random fabric patterns and textures. Organic mixed with luxurious. Her heart told her to clear this space because everything in it was personal, but her practical side warned that Gavin might see an empty room as a hostile move.</p><p>But dammit, she did feel like her house was being invaded.</p><p>Rory poked her head out the swinging door separating the kitchen from the great room. \u201cYour martini is ready.\u201d</p><p>Entering the kitchen reinforced Rielle\u2019s melancholy mood; the house teemed with life with Rory in residence. Music drifted from her iPod speakers and she danced around the island, singing to country tunes.</p><p>Plates of appetizers were arranged across the eat-in service bar. Rory shook the cocktail shaker vigorously and filled martini glasses with pale yellow liquid.</p><p>Rielle squinted at the three glasses. \u201cYou expecting someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And there she is, right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>The door swung open and Ainsley Hamilton meandered in. She ditched her high heels first thing. \u201cI hope you made those drinks strong, Rory, because I\u2019ve had a bitch of a day.\u201d Ainsley grinned at Rielle. \u201cHeya, neighbor. You ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>Rory mimed zipping her lips. Then she said brightly, \u201cBelly up to the bar, ladies, and sample my latest concoction. A lemon-drop martini with an Asian twist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds heavenly,\u201d Ainsley said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the twist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandied ginger and lemongrass.\u201d</p><p>Rielle slid onto the barstool. Even if the cocktail tasted like crap, she\u2019d get an A for presentation. Sugar-rimmed glasses, a slice of lemon, pieces of lemongrass twined around a cocktail pick weighted at the bottom with a chunk of amber-colored candied ginger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley raised her glass. \u201cTo the support of good friends.\u201d</p><p>They clinked glasses and knocked back a swallow.</p><p>\u201cWow, Rory, this has got to be your best drink ever,\u201d Rielle said, sucking down another taste.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, but I can\u2019t take full credit. I tweaked the recipe from a guy who bartends at the hipster joint in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. Damn potent, so I\u2019ll only have one.\u201d Ainsley tipped back another swallow. \u201cUnless you\u2019re driving us into town?\u201d</p><p>Rielle frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s going into town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are. See, Rory and I got to chatting...about our discussion at your fortieth birthday party last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot be held responsible for anything I said since you all got me drunk.\u201d Her head had pounded so horrifically the next morning she\u2019d literally taken a dirt nap in her garden.</p> <p>\u201cThis spilled out when you were sober, darlin\u2019,\u201d Ainsley reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYou sound more like Ben every day with darlin\u2019 this and darlin\u2019 that,\u201d Rielle retorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d She preened. \u201cBut it is what my loving\u2014but clueless\u2014husband said that caused your distress, so I feel the need to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Rielle drained her drink, hating the reminder of Ben\u2019s comment when he\u2019d jokingly guessed her age as fifty, not forty. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for the dumb shit Ben says any more than you are responsible for the dumb shit all men say.\u201d</p><p>Rory refilled Rielle\u2019s glass and sent Ainsley an insolent look. \u201cI knew you\u2019d take the wrong tack.\u201d She set her elbows on the counter. \u201cMom. You\u2019re not old. And we\u2019re gonna deal with your claim that you look like a crone, because it\u2019s a seriously fucked-up self-image.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated, but her tongue sharpened. \u201cSo where is your other cohort in crime, Doc Monroe? Has she set up an appointment with a plastic surgeon as her part of this embarrassing intervention?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoely planned to be here but she had to deliver a baby.\u201d Ainsley got right in Rielle\u2019s face. \u201cDial down the animosity, sister, and listen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still wearing your large-and-in-charge big-girl panties, Miz Bank Prez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least until I get home and Bennett makes me strip them off.\u201d She grinned cheekily. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the mushy, gushy stuff that makes you squirm...unless you\u2019ve been knocking back tequila shooters. You\u2019ve become one of my best friends since I moved in with Ben. You\u2019re a wonderful person, funny, sweet, thoughtful and you work harder than anyone I know. You\u2019re beautiful inside and out. I see it. Rory sees it. It\u2019s a pity you don\u2019t. We thought maybe if we helped you change your outer appearance, then you\u2019d see it as well as feel it.\u201d</p><p>Rielle remained quiet and traced the sugared rim of her martini glass. Upbeat Ainsley didn\u2019t pull any punches\u2014and to think that was why she hadn\u2019t initially liked the woman. They\u2019d started out on the wrong foot when Ainsley had been sneaking around with Ben McKay. But after Ainsley stood up for Ben and bitch-slapped her for the shitty way she\u2019d treated him, Rielle realized she\u2019d wronged them both.</p><p>It\u2019d taken a couple months for Rielle to swallow her pride and apologize. Luckily Ben and Ainsley were ready to let bygones be bygones. Now she and Ainsley were tight\u2014much tighter than Rielle had ever been with Ben.</p><p>\u201cMom? Are you crying?\u201d Rory asked with an edge of fear.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cJust feeling idiotic for opening my mouth. It sucks dealing with this stupid female pride and age thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, you don\u2019t have to deal with it alone.\u201d Ainsley snagged a section of Rielle\u2019s baby-fine long blond hair. \u201cRory. How long has your mom worn her hair this way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s an easy style,\u201d Rielle protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a dated style,\u201d Ainsley corrected.</p><p>\u201cWell, forgive me but I don\u2019t have time to fuss with a fancy hairdo when I spend my days digging in the dirt or sweating in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why you need a smart cut. Not every style is high-maintenance.\u201d Ainsley held onto Rielle\u2019s chin, turning her face to the left and right. \u201cYou have amazing bone structure. You hide it instead of highlight it. We need to fix that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would we do that?\u201d</p><p>Rory grinned. \u201cBy placing yourself in Nikki\u2019s hands tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki?\u201d Rielle knew her eyes grew comically wide. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your friend who sported a purple and lime green Mohawk in tenth grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s toned down the shock factor. We\u2019ve already discussed this and she\u2019s come up with a cool cut for you. She swears this style is easy to manage and it\u2019ll take ten years off your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think your face is the issue. It\u2019s all this hippie hair.\u201d Ainsley knocked back her drink. \u201cSo let\u2019s whisk you off to the beauty shop and transform you from a hippie-chick into a hip-chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is such a good idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s where I\u2019m playing hardball.\u201d Rory loomed over her. \u201cYou\u2019ve always told me change is inevitable. Have you been putting expectations on me that you aren\u2019t willing to apply to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I have been making changes in my life.\u201d Most were forced, not that she\u2019d admit that.</p><p>\u201cThen it shouldn\u2019t be such an ordeal to add this change to the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Ainsley interrupted. \u201cI think your mom is afraid to look hot and have men notice her. Once she\u2019s no longer hidden behind all this scarecrow hair, she\u2019ll hook herself a man. Just you watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarecrow hair?\u201d Rielle repeated. \u201cReally, Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t contain a bit of malice, just concern. \u201cYou need to do this. For you. We\u2019ll be right there, every snip of the way.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the drinks bolstered her courage. Heaven knew if the decision was left up to her, she\u2019d never do it. She slid off the barstool. \u201cFine. But if I end up looking like Carrot Top, there\u2019s gonna be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley draped her arm around Rielle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDarlin\u2019, the truth is, even that might be an improvement.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Late Saturday afternoon Gavin pulled into the parking area of the former Sage Creek Bed and Breakfast.</p><p>The five-thousand-square-foot, two-story structure had large windows stretching along the main and upper floors. This time of day the sun reflected off the sections of glass in tones of amber and rosy-gold. The siding had been crafted out of rough-hewn lumber and applied vertically, horizontally, crossways, creating the impression of depth. A copper-colored tin roof covered a wide-planked porch that spanned the entire length of the front side. The porch supports were notched logs, worn into a smooth vanilla-hued patina in some places and left rough with chunks of bark in others. The concrete work at the base of the house was covered by round, grayish river rock, so the foundation appeared built from cobbled stone. The steps continued the western theme, constructed from old railroad ties, the centers shored up with marbled-looking concrete. Even the split-rail fence separating the parking lot from the porch resembled an old-fashioned hitching post. The overall impression of the place was rustic with western flair. Charming. Welcoming. Homey.</p><p>Homey. As Gavin listened to the engine cool, he had to remind himself this was his home. He\u2019d owned it for almost two years, but he\u2019d never cooked a meal in the kitchen. Never washed a load of clothes in the laundry room. Never flopped on the couch and watched a Cardinals football game. He\u2019d always treated this place like a hotel.</p><p>No more.</p><p>He glanced at his daughter, gauging her reaction to their new home. \u201cSo, Sierra, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>She peered over the top of her pink sunglasses. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than I thought. Rustic, but it works in this setting with the different types of trees as a backdrop. It looks more like an upscale hunting lodge than a single family dwelling.\u201d</p><p>The kid knew the lingo after being around the real estate business her whole life.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap. Who is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Sierra pointed. \u201cThere. By the fence.\u201d</p><p>Gavin saw a shapely, jean-clad ass bent over a wheelbarrow. The woman stood and turned to grab the wheelbarrow\u2019s handles, giving him a front-and-center view of her low-cut tank top. The full swells of her cleavage bounced nicely as she started downhill. Her face was hidden beneath the bill of a brown and gold University of Wyoming ball cap.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her?\u201d Sierra asked. \u201cIs she seasonal help or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Where was Rielle? She always met him on the porch with her pack of dogs.</p><p>They climbed out of the Lexus. Gavin continued to stare from behind his sunglasses at the woman heading toward them, showing a lot of sun-kissed skin. When she removed her cap, revealing artfully tousled short blond hair, and smiled at him, Gavin\u2019s jaw nearly hit the dirt. \u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting someone else?\u201d She stepped closer, slipping off her glove before offering her hand. \u201cYou must be Sierra. I\u2019m Rielle Wetzler. Your dad has talked about you nonstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it bad, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Sierra smirked and Gavin held his breath, waiting for the snarky sixteen-year-old to emerge. \u201cI\u2019ll admit Dad said nothing to me about you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin was tempted to correct his daughter, but Rielle had already engaged his sometimes-prickly child in conversation.</p><p>Sierra started sharing her favorite parts of their tourist excursions. Rather than stand and gawk at this sexier version of Rielle, he returned to his car and began unloading luggage and tried to figure out how they were going to make this situation work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The circumstances were unconventional, but his buyout offer hadn\u2019t exactly been normal either. After they\u2019d hashed out an agreement, he\u2019d asked her to stay on the premises as a caretaker, although she refused payment for the position. His property manager called her every other month to check in. Gavin and Rielle were friendly, but he didn\u2019t know her. He hadn\u2019t seen Rielle beyond her role as his personal chef, maid and property custodian. And because of that line\u2014she\u2019d essentially worked for him\u2014he\u2019d never noticed such a hot woman existed beneath the tie-dyed clothes and Marcia Brady hair.</p><p>You\u2019re a superficial asshole.</p><p>Maybe, but it didn\u2019t change the facts. Gavin hauled luggage to the porch, his depraved brain compiling a list of Rielle\u2019s overlooked attributes. When he turned around Rielle and Sierra were staring at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad. I said I\u2019d help you like three times. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, I didn\u2019t. Thinking about too many things, I guess.\u201d R-rated things about the scantily clad and surprisingly hot Rielle that he couldn\u2019t share with his daughter. \u201cLet\u2019s leave this stuff here and do a quick tour.\u201d He faced Rielle. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your house.\u201d</p><p>He detected tension in that answer and knew they needed to discuss specific living arrangements tonight.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ll be in the garden until dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch up with you later. Charlie and Vi invited us over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food oughta be good since Vi\u2019s a great cook.\u201d She grabbed three balls of dirt from the wheelbarrow and set them on the railing. \u201cTake her some of these golden beets. They\u2019re her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlastic bags are under the sink. See you.\u201d Rielle lifted the wheelbarrow handles and Gavin had the urge to offer his help. But by the looks of the toned muscles in her arms, shoulders, back, ass, thighs and calves, she didn\u2019t need help. He glanced at Sierra after Rielle disappeared around the side of the house. She wore an odd look. Shit. Had she caught him checking Rielle out? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be weird, having someone else live with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But we\u2019ll figure out a way to make it work.\u201d He set his hand on her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s check out our new digs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad. No one says digs. You are such a dork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone said dork anymore either,\u201d he teased.</p><p>After Sierra\u2019s initial outburst about their sudden departure from Arizona, she\u2019d come to a grudging acceptance that something had to change. He suspected she was secretly relieved for the chance to start fresh and she had acted enthusiastic when she\u2019d told her mother about the move. Gavin didn\u2019t kid himself it was genuine, but rather a way for Sierra to show her mother she\u2019d be too busy with her new adventure to miss her, but he hoped in time she would embrace this new life in Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cThis place has a lot of personality,\u201d Sierra commented on the great room. \u201cIs the furniture and stuff in here ours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Rielle\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is our furniture?\u201d</p><p>Hell if I know. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sierra whirled around. \u201cI hope it ended up lost or in the Dumpster.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze sharpened. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was ugly and boring. Like you walked into a discount furniture store, saw a perfectly put together living room set, and said, I\u2019ll take that crap.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d done. \u201cAnd that\u2019s bad...how?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to a chair comprised of half cowhide, half distressed leather with braided piping on the front and animal hooves as the feet. \u201cThis is a seriously awesome piece. It says a lot about Rielle. She\u2019s picked pieces that are unique, yet funky. I\u2019ll bet she even made some of them.\u201d Then Sierra poked him in the chest. \u201cYou could learn a lot from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning...we\u2019re starting over, right? We need to shitcan that ugly furniture we\u2019ve had forever. What bad taste demon possessed you to buy it in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Gavin suppressed a grin. It boded well Sierra had bounced back to her annoyingly sweet and pushy self after clearing out of Arizona. \u201cBecause I spent damn near six months searching for furniture with your mother right after we got married. I hated everything she picked. So after the divorce, when I moved into the condo, I chose big, comfy pieces, without damn flowers or checks or stripes. Plus, the furniture had to be stain resistant, because you, dear daughter, have a tendency to spill ice cream, cereal and pizza.\u201d He kissed her forehead.</p><p>Sierra twined her arms around him and sighed. \u201cDad. I\u2019m not six anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wish you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But promise you\u2019ll let me help when we pick out new stuff for our place, okay?\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly. This was the daughter he\u2019d missed in the last year when the teenager from hell had inhabited her body. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed away. \u201cShow me the rest.\u201d</p><p>The main floor was comprised of the enormous kitchen, the dining room and the great room. Down the hallway were a bathroom and two bedrooms, both with en-suite bathrooms. Gavin noticed Rielle had relocated to the biggest room in the far corner. He fought a pang of guilt for kicking her out of the master suite.</p><p>This is your house. Remember that.</p><p>A wide staircase opened onto the landing of the second floor. Another comfortable lounging area stretched out in front of the windows. Gavin turned down the left hallway and walked past the bedroom he intended to use as an office. He opened the door to the master suite and glanced up at the skylights spilling sunbeams across the plush carpet. The angle of the roof provided architectural interest. On the far side was a set of French doors that led to a private balcony. He poked his head into the bathroom, happy for the oversized shower, but ambivalent about the garden tub.</p><p>\u201cThis is a lot bigger than your bedroom in Arizona.\u201d She hip-checked him. \u201cYou could sneak someone in here. Have wild parties and I\u2019d never know.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cLike that\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should. I wouldn\u2019t mind if you...ah, got involved with someone.\u201d</p><p>Gavin gaped at his daughter. Since when did she care about that? And what the hell was her vague reference to someone? Then she flitted off, down the other hallway.</p><p>The last bedroom and Sierra\u2019s room were opposite each other on the other end of the hallway. She squealed upon seeing her stuff. \u201cI love it! This is exactly where I would\u2019ve put everything. So can we hang my TV and set up my computer right now?\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cWe have to be at Charlie and Vi\u2019s pretty quick so the TV will have to wait until I find my tools. But let\u2019s hook up your computer.\u201d</p><p>That task finished, they hauled everything from the car. He showed Sierra the small servants\u2019 staircase connecting the second floor directly through the kitchen. Sierra tried the handle on another door. \u201cWhere does this go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole other level?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s unfinished and Rielle uses it for storage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna use it for?\u201d</p><p>His immediate thought was to ask Rielle\u2019s permission and he had to remind himself for the tenth time that he owned this place. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s where our old furniture is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope there\u2019s another wood burning stove down there, so we can just chop it up and torch it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s package up the beets and head to the McKays.\u201d</p><p>Sierra didn\u2019t speak as they started up the driveway to Charlie and Vi McKay\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. This might sound random, but what am I supposed to call them? I mean, they are my grandparents. When they visited us I didn\u2019t think too much about it because I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get to know them. But now? We\u2019re living up the road from them. I bet we\u2019ll see them all the time.\u201d</p><p>Another issue he should address. Did he remind Charlie and Vi that he preferred they didn\u2019t drop by unannounced? Or would he come across like a jerk?</p><p>\u201cIs this weird for you?\u201d Sierra prompted.</p><p>\u201cUnbelievably. Just when I think I\u2019ve wrapped my head around it...I realize I don\u2019t have a clue how to deal with any of this we\u2019re your family stuff. And then they\u2019re all cowboys. I am so far from a cowboy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Mr. I\u2019ve-always-got-the-right-answer-and-I-can-lecture-you-for-hours-on-it...doesn\u2019t have the right one this time?\u201d She snickered. \u201cWow. That might be a first, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart aleck. I trust you\u2019ll be on your best behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI polished my halo before we left.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m starved.\u201d He glanced at the bag of beets in the backseat. Maybe if he \u201cremembered\u201d them after the meal, Vi wouldn\u2019t insist on cooking them for the meal. God. He hated beets.</p><p>\u201cQuit stalling, Dad, here they come.\u201d</p><p>He plastered on a smile.</p><p>Charlie and Vi met them on the porch. Vi hugged them while Charlie offered his hand.</p><p>Then they stared at each other.</p><p>But it lasted about a minute. Awkwardness vanished as Sierra jabbered enough for both of them.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Rielle had just popped the top on a bottle of Moose Drool beer when Gavin wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>Speaking of drool. Man, oh, man. The last year had been very good to him. He\u2019d always been attractive in the charming and confident manner of a businessman. But since she\u2019d last seen him, he\u2019d slimmed down and toned up to the point he was almost...buff.</p><p>She\u2019d chalked up his previous physique\u2014or lack thereof\u2014to sitting behind a desk all day. But his appearance had undergone a serious change in the last year. He\u2019d chopped off his wavy dark brown hair in favor of a modified buzz cut. Now his blue eyes, framed with ridiculously long black eyelashes, were his most striking feature. He sported a neatly trimmed goatee which accentuated his leaner cheeks and the strong line of his jaw, both more prominent with his overall body weight loss. The man still didn\u2019t smile as much as he should, so her heart skipped a beat when he leveled a smile at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got an extra one of those for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtra what?\u201d Why was Gavin staring at her mouth? Why did she have the urge to lick her lips?</p><p>\u201cAn extra beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Yeah. Sure.\u201d Get it together, Ree. She reached into the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. When she turned around, Gavin was right behind her\u2014checking out her butt.</p><p>He blushed and stepped back. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t expect you to wait on me, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the beer and the opener. \u201cMaybe we oughta talk about our expectations.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night. Let\u2019s sit outside.\u201d</p> <p>He motioned for her to lead the way.</p><p>She flipped on the lights lining the walkway and lit the kerosene lamp on the table between the glider swing and her favorite rocking chair. She curled up in the rocker, setting it in motion as Gavin settled on the swing. The kerosene flame flickered in the breeze behind the glass chimney, throwing a golden glow against the house. Neither she nor Gavin said anything for a few moments. Normally silence didn\u2019t bother her, but tonight it did. \u201cSierra get settled in all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helped having her stuff already here. I have to admit I\u2019m happy each bedroom has its own bathroom. The girl is spoiled. She\u2019s never had to share a bathroom with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory and I shared a bathroom until I built Sage Creek. Even then, she came into my bathroom to get ready in the morning. Come to think of it, she still does that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucks that Sierra isn\u2019t willing to share any hair care tips with me.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cWas it her idea or yours to get the buzz cut?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin buffed the top of his head with his palm. \u201cMine. I started to see some gray and I\u2019m not ready to invest in Grecian Formula for Men, so I bought a pair of clippers and hacked it off. I save myself fifty bucks a month at the barber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks good. Really good.\u201d Feeling stupid for tossing out a compliment, she angled her head away from his prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I have to admit I didn\u2019t recognize you with your short hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that a lot in the past few days.\u201d Rielle felt his eyes on her, measuring her, but she couldn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a recent change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>More silence.</p><p>Rielle peered up at him, only to see him staring at her. \u201cGavin. Can I be completely honest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this situation going to work?\u201d</p><p>He stretched his arm across the back of the glider. \u201cI have no idea. I understand I sprang this on you. But as long as we\u2019re being honest, I\u2019ve owned this house and the land for almost two years. And yet, you still haven\u2019t made any plans to build your own place. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never believed you\u2019d really move here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve visited exactly four times and not at all in the last year. You\u2019ve never brought your daughter. So I figured if you planned to relocate to Sundance, it\u2019d be after Sierra went to college.\u201d She pointed her beer bottle at him. \u201cAnd you are wrong. I have been in contact with Chet and Remy West about my building plans. I just wasn\u2019t expecting to have to get started on the damn thing this fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re fine and dandy with us taking up residence here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d She exhaled a sigh. \u201cLook, I know you own the house. But it\u2019s been my home for six years, not just a bed and breakfast. I know every square inch of this place because I spent a decade designing it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s face was unreadable, but not formidable so she continued.</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better if you had thrown me out after you took ownership. But you didn\u2019t. I stayed on as if nothing had changed. Now I can\u2019t help the resentment that you two are invading my house and encroaching on my space. It\u2019s wrong; I know that. But as long as we\u2019re being honest I might as well lay it all on the line.\u201d</p><p>The only sounds between them were the squeak of the glider and the creak of the rocking chair.</p><p>Finally, Gavin sighed. \u201cThis is so fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. That\u2019s just the personal side. We haven\u2019t even talked about the fact I run all of my businesses out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusinesses...plural?\u201d</p><p>Maybe his shock about her owning multiple businesses pissed her off a little. \u201cYes. Businesses. In addition to selling organic produce, I sell honey. I handspin various fiber into yarn. I\u2019m at the end of my growing season so I can\u2019t abandon my plants\u2014that means using water from your well since I haven\u2019t drilled for one on my property yet. So regardless of what you decide for our personal living arrangements, on the business side, I\u2019ll have to be here every day. I\u2019ve made commitments, Gavin, and my word has always been the only thing I\u2019ve ever had of any worth.\u201d</p><p>He stopped the glider and rested his forearms on his thighs. \u201cI understand that, believe me. And despite your erroneous accusation, the living arrangement situation isn\u2019t solely my decision. So tell me what else you\u2019re committed to in your businesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe small bakery here closed three years ago. I stepped up to fill the need for fresh baked goods because I installed industrial ovens when I built this place. Three days a week I bake dinner rolls for Fields, the upscale organic restaurant in Sundance. I provide stone-ground wheat and rye bread to several other restaurants and grocery stores in the area. I can\u2019t just stop because then they\u2019ll assume they can\u2019t depend on me, and they\u2019ll quit buying all the other food stuff I supply, which is a lot and my main source of income.\u201d Rielle inhaled slowly, trying hard not to show the panic she felt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you formed a negative impression of me, but I don\u2019t plan to throw you out on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see that\u2019s almost worse?\u201d She leapt to her feet and paced, words spilling out unchecked. \u201cYou came here with Sierra to be a family. I get that. I\u2019m not your family and yet, under our current agreement, I\u2019ll be living in your house as if I am. You\u2019ll want to hang out, just the two of you. Fix meals together, watch TV, help with her homework, play games, invite your McKay relatives over. How can I live here without feeling like an interloper...in what\u2019s always been my home? On the other hand, how can I live here and not get to watch what I want on my TV, and sit on my furniture in my living room? I\u2019m just supposed to...what? Lock myself in my room?</p><p>\u201cNot to mention I\u2019ve always treated you like a guest at the B&amp;B or my boss. I\u2019m not in either of those servant or employee roles now. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to act around you. Or Sierra. Will she treat me like the hired help? Will you?\u201d</p><p>Strong hands circled her biceps, stopping her pacing.</p><p>Gavin loomed over her. \u201cDammit, Rielle, take a breath.\u201d</p><p>She froze. He had big hands. Warm. Not girly soft like she\u2019d imagined, but a little rough.</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake. Please quit looking at me like I\u2019m going to hit you.\u201d He gentled his hold and his thumbs swept the inside of her arms, but he didn\u2019t release her.</p><p>The crazy thing? She didn\u2019t want him to. How long had this man owned such a powerful presence? And why hadn\u2019t she noticed?</p><p>But she was aware of Gavin\u2019s intense gaze on her mouth. She self-consciously licked her lips. His avid eyes tracked the movement of her tongue.</p><p>That deliberate focus caused a falling sensation in her belly that she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Maybe ever.</p><p>\u201cRee?\u201d he said a bit hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cSorry. This panic has been building since you called with the news you were moving here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to put you on notice. I\u2019m not the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He dropped his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll need something stronger than beer if we\u2019re continuing this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. And since I\u2019m not waiting on you...\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cNeed me to show you where the liquor cabinet is in your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, smartass. And here I always thought you were so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She batted her eyelashes and he laughed. \u201cYou pegged me as a non-confrontational, go with the flow, peace, love and good vibes type, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You itching to prove me wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I already have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Point taken. But then again, we don\u2019t really know each other, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But I\u2019d really like to change that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious. You saw yourself in the servant and employee role. What role did you assign me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick-up-his-ass, my-way-or-the-highway ruthless business tycoon.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grinned. \u201cNot far off the mark. But I am looking forward to showing you a different side of me, and seeing that different side of you.\u201d</p><p>She was too. Way more than she wanted to admit to him and maybe to herself.</p><p>Rielle Wetzler was a dichotomy.</p><p>On one hand, given the serious financial bind she\u2019d wound up in a few years back, Gavin assumed she had no head for business and flitted through life like a paisley butterfly.</p><p>But hearing her talk about her businesses showed him not only was she on top of her game, she wasn\u2019t a pushover. In fact, she\u2019d thought through the repercussions of this living situation on a much deeper level than he had.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t lost track of their conversation until he\u2019d put his hands on her. Then like the village idiot, all he could do was stare into her pale green eyes and imagine taking a big bite of her full bottom lip.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t help matters when Gavin realized her pretty blush and bright eyes meant that she felt the surprising zing of attraction too.</p><p>He grabbed the bottle of Crown XR from his room and returned to the kitchen. He doubted Rielle drank whiskey on the rocks or even neat. He stirred Coca-Cola into her glass, topped his off with water and headed to the porch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle had moved to the glider.</p><p>He\u2019d barely sat down beside her before she launched into questions. \u201cWhat prompted the sudden move to Crook County, Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know from the McKays?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing beyond Sierra had some issues and you pulled up stakes, hoping to straighten her out.\u201d</p><p>Gavin gave her the rundown of Sierra\u2019s troubles. \u201cDid you ever deal with anything like that with Rory?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt strikes me as odd that the kids who have the most are usually the ones with sticky fingers. Rory kept a low profile throughout school and stayed out of trouble. It was hard enough for her being the granddaughter of hippies who were rumored to grow pot and live in a commune.\u201d</p><p>Rielle had mentioned those things before, as had the McKays. \u201cAny truth to the rumors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the commune? Yeah.\u201d She turned sideways and set her feet on the seat, near his thigh. \u201cMy folks let anyone down on their luck crash here. One time, I counted thirty people living in that run-down shack they called a house. Used to be a thick grove of scrub cedar trees blocking the shack from the road, thank God.\u201d She took a drink\u2014almost angrily. \u201cIt was cathartic to watch West Construction level that damn building with a bulldozer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. Does this house sit where that one did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. Rory and I lived there with my parents until she turned three. I\u2019d busted my ass making a cabin at the back of the property inhabitable, so we\u2019d both be somewhat free of their influence. I let Rory have it after I built the B&amp;B. She still stays there when she comes home. She\u2019s an adult and she deserves her own space.\u201d</p><p>Gavin knew she\u2019d only touched on her struggle to raise a kid on her own, when she was just a kid herself. \u201cHow\u2019d you support yourself as a young mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Rory started school I worked cleaning motel rooms so I was done by the time school let out. We\u2019d always grown our own food, so I just continued doing what I was taught. But I seemed to have extra so that same year I started selling the leftover produce to locals. The business grew so by the sixth year I didn\u2019t have to work at the motel. During that time I\u2019d gone from cleaning rooms to running the front desk to working in the sales and catering office. And I realized the perfect job for me would be running my own B&amp;B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you made that a reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. The one smart thing my parents did was buy this land. They paid cash for it thirty-odd years ago and no one ever questioned how or where they\u2019d gotten the money, so neither did I.\u201d Her bare feet had inched over until her toes rested on the outside of his thigh. She nudged him. \u201cHey, how\u2019d did I end up a topic of conversation? We\u2019re supposed to be talking about this screwed-up living arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin curled his fingers around her ankle to stop her from kicking him. Or maybe to keep her from leaping up as she was prone to do. Or most likely, he just wanted an excuse to touch her. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to know each other, which I believe is standard procedure before a man and woman move in together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, Gavin, you\u2019re making it sound so romantic,\u201d she said.</p><p>That brought up another point. \u201cSo we get all these living together specifics ironed out between us. Will it bother you if people in the community think we really are living together as a romantic couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give two shits what people think. I\u2019ve dealt with labels my whole life living in Sundance and I\u2019m still here, still doing my own thing. So maybe you oughta worry what people will think about you, the rich-tycoon-cum-secret-McKay-lovechild and your impressionable teenaged daughter, being shacked up with someone like me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed. Rielle was really trying to rile him and it wasn\u2019t working\u2014well, not in the way she\u2019d intended. This sexy opinionated woman riled him up in ways he\u2019d forgotten he could be riled. \u201cLike you, I could give a shit what folks say about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And what about Sierra? Do you care what kids at school might say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra might\u2019ve made some bad judgment calls recently, but she has a lot of me in her and she calls it like she sees it.\u201d</p><p>She toasted him. \u201cI wish Rory had been more like that at Sierra\u2019s age. Heck, I wish I\u2019d been more like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ready to hammer out specifics on divvying up shared living spaces?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cHit me with your best idea, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>Tycoon. Sassy little thing. \u201cHere\u2019s what I think will work. Since your bedroom is on the main floor, the great room is your space. We\u2019ll stay out of it unless you\u2019ve granted us permission.\u201d</p><p>Rielle said, \u201cThat sounds fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe upper living space is ours. We\u2019ll use the existing furniture until we buy new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe movers stashed your pieces in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Sierra, that stuff can go to a good home or to Goodwill. We\u2019ve decided to get new furnishings that fit with the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to share the kitchen in the morning. As far as food, we\u2019ll label everything in the fridge and freezer. Assign us cupboards to store canned and dry goods. That\u2019ll keep our food separate. Same goes for clearing out a spot for our small appliances and dishes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you hate the dishes I bought for the B&amp;B, you\u2019re welcome to use them, since I have place settings for twenty. Same for the silverware, cups and glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much care about dishes and stuff, so that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. When it comes to my baking pans, mixers, knives, pots and pans...those will be off limits. Since there are two dishwashers, we\u2019ll each have one.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cOur policy should be clean as you go because there\u2019s nothing I hate worse than coming into a kitchen piled with dirty dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass that along to my little mess maker,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhich goes to say we\u2019re responsible for cleaning our respective areas in the rest of the house too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The kitchen appliances are typical, no huge explanation is needed on how to run them\u2014even for a teenager and a longtime bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe washer and dryer are in the basement utility room and I don\u2019t have a specific wash day, so I\u2019ll work around your schedule since there are two of you and one of me.\u201d She paused. \u201cSierra does her own laundry?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI eat supper very early or very late so I\u2019ll be gone by the time you\u2019re ready to fix the evening meal.\u201d He must\u2019ve frowned because she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll be in the same area around the same time. I just wondered if you\u2019d be interested in sharing a meal with us sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled up in a sneaky smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check my schedule and get back to you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin was so charmed by this woman. Part prickly, part funny\u2014totally sexy. \u201cYou do that.\u201d Her toes spread out like a cat\u2019s claws and she made a soft purr when his fingers brushed her instep. \u201cHow\u2019s tomorrow night look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike leftovers.\u201d She propped her chin on her knee. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasta. I say that with vagueness until we\u2019ve checked out what the local grocery store carries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love any type of pasta. I\u2019ll contribute a salad and bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how easy that was? This living together stuff will be a breeze for us.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cYou say that now. How about if we revisit this conversation in a week and see what\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re putting cocktails on the terrace with me on your schedule for next Saturday night?\u201d he asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll have a date or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it hard to believe that men aren\u2019t lined up to take you out.\u201d His gaze roved over her face. \u201cEspecially if they saw you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWith the firelight from the lamp glowing on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do those smooth words slide off your tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He blinked. What the hell was going on with him?</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, thanks then.\u201d She pushed upright and scrambled back.</p><p>Gavin drained his whiskey and followed her into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got this somewhat resolved, Rielle. But the booze and the drive have made me a little...\u201d Loopy? Foolish? Melancholy? Hopeful?</p><p>\u201cHas made you what, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamble more than usual.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Sierra could not believe her dad was making her ride the bus home from school.</p><p>The school bus.</p><p>Who gets stuck riding the bus? Especially in high school?</p><p>Losers, probably.</p><p>Great way to start her school year.</p><p>Hoisting her backpack higher, she walked to the semi-circle where the buses were belching diesel. She started with the last one, searching for number one eleven. Some kid hung out the window of one thirteen and yelled out, \u201cI love you, Sierra!\u201d</p><p>She ignored the jerk, who was no doubt being sarcastic since she was the new girl, and kept her head down.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t been a total pariah, but being fresh meat in the small high school had made her a novelty. She\u2019d met so many people she couldn\u2019t keep them all straight. But she knew the novelty would wear off, probably within a week.</p><p>A shadow fell in step with her and she glanced over at the freckled redheaded cowgirl.</p><p>Marin Godfrey had taken it upon herself to befriend Sierra first thing in homeroom yesterday. They had two classes together and lunch, so Sierra hadn\u2019t had to sit by herself.</p><p>\u201cHey, Arizona. You took off fast after the last bell rang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss my bus since I didn\u2019t ride it yesterday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour bus is always in the middle. I\u2019m jealous. All the good people ride on your bus. That\u2019s the one everyone wants to be on.\u201d</p><p>Sierra wondered what good people meant.</p><p>Marin smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Perverts ride on my bus. Always trying to cop a feel. And the grade school boys are the worst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the school secretary wasn\u2019t bullshitting my dad? Everyone in high school really rides the bus home every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone, not every day. Like the jocks have practice after school. But everyone else? Pretty much.\u201d</p><p>Bizarre. Didn\u2019t any of these people have cars? In Arizona everyone she knew had a car and no one rode the bus. She didn\u2019t think her school district even had buses. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s a drama club meeting or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s an activity or a club meeting, it\u2019s held after supper, not after school, if it can be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe school is big on parental involvement and that means scheduling stuff when adults are done with work. Most the kids who ride the bus have chores to do after school anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chores. Such a foreign concept to her. After school let out in Arizona, she\u2019d flopped on her bed and napped or watched TV until her dad got home from work.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s no morning bus service,\u201d Marin continued. \u201cGotta get them early chores done. So what\u2019re you doing when you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my dad will grill me on how my second day of school went. If I made new friends. What I had for lunch. If I have homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better than cleaning the chicken coop.\u201d Marin pointed to the open door. \u201cThis one is yours. You\u2019ve got my number. Call me later if you want.\u201d She raced off.</p><p>Sierra reached the top step on the bus and the driver stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019re Sierra?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>The older lady laughed. \u201cDarlin\u2019, I know every kid on this bus and have for years, most their parents too. So it\u2019s nice to see a new face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Which stop am I supposed to get off at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird to last stop.\u201d Then the driver\u2019s eyes were on the mirror, watching someone behind her. \u201cJimmy Dale, don\u2019t you be messing with Liesl on the ride home, you hear me? Or I\u2019ll make you sit up front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Craftsman.\u201d</p><p>Sierra walked down the aisle. Little kids sat up front. A guy wearing a gray hoodie had claimed the last seat on the right. His athletic shoes hung off the end of the seat and he radiated a \u201cback off\u201d vibe. She chose a spot four seats up on the left.</p><p>Two girls from her history and math classes nodded at her they passed by, sliding into the seat opposite the hoodie wearer. A junior high couple sat two seats ahead and immediately started making out. Four guys she recognized from the lunchroom pushed and shoved each other, tossing out, \u201cHey, baby, we love you,\u201d all the way to the back of the bus.</p><p>At least the spot next to her had stayed empty.</p> <p>When the bus pulled out, she slipped in her earbuds and cranked her iPod, the universal leave-me-alone sign, focusing her attention out the window.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t an obvious signal in Wyoming; she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>She ignored it.</p><p>Less than thirty seconds later, a more insistent tap was followed by a loud, \u201cHey! I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>Sierra met the blue eyes of the dark-haired boy, about twelve, draped over the edge of the seat in front of her. He motioned for her to take out her earbuds. \u201cWhat? Am I in your seat or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Man, you\u2019re hot. Like really hot.\u201d</p><p>Awesome that the elementary set thought she was dateable. But if this kid tried to cop a feel like Marin had warned, she\u2019d deck him.</p><p>\u201cBet you can\u2019t guess who I am?\u201d</p><p>Her mind supplied a pain in the butt, but she said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he cajoled. \u201cJust one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, kid, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne guess,\u201d he repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Ky,\u201d came from the back of the bus.</p><p>Who had warned this kid off? She slowly turned.</p><p>The hoodie guy had removed his hood and was staring straight at her.</p><p>Oh hello, gorgeous. The guy was hot...beyond words actually, with long brown hair that nearly brushed his wide shoulders and dark scruff on his cheeks. He certainly didn\u2019t look like he belonged in high school.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Boone. I wasn\u2019t talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d the kid in front of her retorted.</p><p>Boone? Now that was a western name.</p><p>The kid tapped her shoulder again and she forced herself to quit gawking at the beautiful Boone. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow do you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue, little dude.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not that little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bein\u2019 a pain in the ass, cuz. She don\u2019t wanna play your game.\u201d</p><p>Next thing she knew, hot Boone from the back of the bus plopped in the seat across from her and smiled.</p><p>Oh. My. God. He had a killer smile. Pure bad boy. With dimples.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m Boone West. Who\u2019re you?\u201d</p><p>Sierra blinked.</p><p>\u201cSee? She don\u2019t wanna talk to you neither,\u201d the kid in front of her sneered.</p><p>That\u2019s when she realized she hadn\u2019t answered. \u201cI\u2019m Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s really a McKay,\u201d the kid crowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d echoed from about twenty people on the bus.</p><p>Great. Were they looking at her with scorn? Or envy?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I was tryin\u2019 to tell you. You\u2019re my cousin.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m Kyler McKay. You can call me Ky. There are lots of our cousins on this bus.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Boone had called Ky cuz. So did that mean... God no. Please don\u2019t let me be related to him. She glanced at Boone.</p><p>He was looking at her curiously. \u201cYou\u2019re a McKay? I thought you said your last name was Daniels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. It\u2019s a weird story. My dad found out a few years ago that Charlie and Vi McKay are his birth parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. The long lost McKay son. I\u2019ve heard about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Sundance is a small town, becomes even smaller with the West and McKay family connections.\u201d His stunning topaz eyes roamed over her face. \u201cBut no one told me about you.\u201d</p><p>Sierra blushed crimson.</p><p>\u201cWell, I knew you were gonna be on the bus. My mama told me to keep an eye out for you so you didn\u2019t get off at the wrong stop,\u201d Kyler said.</p><p>\u201cMine did too.\u201d Another boy the same age as Ky scooted next to him and leaned over the seat.</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Sierra asked.</p><p>\u201cAnton McKay.\u201d He jerked his thumb over his shoulder. \u201cOur cousin Hayden is up there with the little cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many McKays are there?\u201d</p><p>Kyler tapped his fingers. \u201cOn the bus? Me, Anton, Hayden, Eliza, Liesl, Peyton, Shannie, Gib, Braxton, Miles. So ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Boone laughed. \u201cThere are at least that many McKay kids that don\u2019t go to school yet.\u201d</p><p>Sierra blurted, \u201cSo am I related to you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m related to two branches of the McKay family tree because these guys\u2019 grandmas were Wests. But you and me? Not even distant kin.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>When Boone flashed her that mega-watt smile she about died. Had she really said that out loud?</p><p>\u201cSo what year are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSophomore. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenior. I didn\u2019t see you around today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because you were in the principal\u2019s office,\u201d Ky said with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me pound on you, boy. You remember the last time you mouthed off to me.\u201d</p><p>Ky scowled at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t hurt that bad.\u201d</p><p>Sierra bit back a smile.</p><p>Anton rallied to Ky\u2019s defense. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 up here anyway, Boone? Finding third graders to beat up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr smart-mouthed sixth graders. I\u2019m makin\u2019 conversation. Now turn around or I\u2019ll tell Mrs. Craftsman you were looking down Daphne\u2019s shirt.\u201d</p><p>Anton blushed. But he turned around.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you been here?\u201d Boone asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since Saturday. We moved from Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou here for good?\u201d</p><p>I hope not. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Boone rested his forearms on his thighs and leaned closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just...I don\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will soon enough, trust me. Half the school will wanna get to know you a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to take that.</p><p>The bus started to slow down. Boone tapped Ky on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll make sure Sierra gets off at the McKay bus stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKays have their own bus stop?\u201d Sierra asked Boone.</p><p>\u201cThe McKays could have their own bus.\u201d Boone stood and slung his backpack over his shoulder, flashing that dimpled grin again. \u201cSee ya around, McKay.\u201d On his way down the aisle he lightly tapped his younger cousins on the back of the head. They all complained, but she could tell they were happy to have his attention.</p><p>Aware that Kyler\u2019s and Anton\u2019s eyes were on her, Sierra tried really hard not to check out Boone\u2019s butt.</p><p>Maybe this riding the bus home thing wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>September...</p><p>\u201cNow that Sierra has started her second week at school and you have everything unpacked, what will you do this week?\u201d Rielle asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThought I\u2019d try to beat my high score on Grand Theft Auto,\u201d he said with a perfectly straight face. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably take more than a week, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll tackle Vision Quest. It\u2019s a bitch to reach the tenth level, but once you do it\u2019s worth it because the reward is an orgy. In full color. Better than porn.

As if I\u2019d believe you\u2019d lounge around all damn day playing video games. Aren\u2019t you buying up squares of land and putting houses and hotels on them, monopolizing the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did believe it, Miss Up-at-the-Buttcrack-of-Dawn-Every-Morning. I thought you knew me better than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. You\u2019ve blabbed all your secrets to me, remember? Since you\u2019re constantly underfoot pestering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve withheld a few secrets. It adds to my manly mystique.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cAs Sierra would say...you\u2019re a dork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou laughing at my jokes proves you\u2019re equally dorky.\u201d He reached over and brushed his fingers beneath her jawline. Her skin was so soft right there.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s pale green eyes were enormous as his fingers moved across her jaw. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...you had flour left from this morning\u2019s bake-a-thon,\u201d he lied to cover up his strange compulsion to touch her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He tried really hard not to stare at her ass as she retreated and busied herself refilling their mugs with the last dregs of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you really doing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet and Remy West are coming by this morning to show me the tentative plans for the four-car garage they\u2019re building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha. You almost got me twice today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed and then she demanded, \u201cWhen did you decide that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. They\u2019ve promised to get it done before the snow flies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere on earth are you going to put a four-car garage?\u201d</p><p>Gavin sipped his coffee, hating that their easy banter was about to end. \u201cOn the right side of the drive. The structure will be attached to the house and be accessible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the mudroom in the basement.\u201d Rielle looked as if she wanted to say something else but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAs long as they\u2019ll already be doing dirt work, we\u2019re revamping the front. Since this isn\u2019t a B&amp;B, there\u2019s no need for a full-sized parking lot. Adding a garage will fill the space and close it off, giving it a more residential feel, as well as adding symmetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering if you were making changes to it too.\u201d</p><p>Not just prickly, but pissy. Not that he was surprised. \u201cThe barn is new, and from what you\u2019ve told me and what I\u2019ve seen, largely unused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure aren\u2019t letting grass grow under your feet when it comes to making changes, are you?\u201d She slapped her hands on the counter. \u201cSpeaking of grass...please tell me you don\u2019t intend to lay sod across the entire length of the former parking lot? That\u2019d be a serious waste of natural resources. Water is as scarce here as it is in the desert. No one has groomed lawns in the country, Gavin, not to mention the deer and turkeys will rip it up\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his fingers over her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t go off half-cocked on environmental self-righteousness, hippie chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHippie chick?\u201d she mumbled beneath his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d prefer that to granola head or tree hugger.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cRee. I was trying for levity to make this easier on both of us. Yes, I\u2019m making changes, but not without help. I intended to ask if you had time to talk to a landscaper. You know everything about this chunk of land and I don\u2019t. I prefer the natural look. Maintaining a manicured lawn is the last thing I\u2019d ever do.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, dislodging his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you aren\u2019t completely an urban idiot with visions of becoming a hobby farmer, calling your riding lawnmower a tractor.\u201d</p><p>He murmured, \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re serious about hiring a landscaper, I know a local guy in Spearfish who is excellent and specializes in xeriscaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it. I\u2019ll tell the West brothers we have that part handled.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that now I wish you had been telling the truth about being locked away inside playing video games.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had no response for that as she walked away.</p><p>Dirt therapy worked better than scream therapy. Good thing because she wanted to scream her fool head off at Gavin.</p><p>The man drove her insane. Always so even-keeled. Matter of fact. Not to mention he was thoughtful, surprisingly funny and so unconsciously sweet that she just wanted to hug him.</p><p>And that annoyed the piss out of her.</p><p>The earth made a loud ching as the shovel blade connected with the crust. She put muscle into it, turning the soil over until dark chunks appeared. Rielle dropped to her knees and brushed the dirt from the clumps of blue fingerling potatoes. These were in high demand in recent years, so she\u2019d filled one entire bed with just this variety. Restaurants in Casper, Cheyenne and Jackson Hole had already placed orders. The entire crop was sold before she\u2019d harvested. That was a good feeling.</p><p>She stood and wiped her brow with the back of her glove. It was unseasonably warm for September\u2014not that she was complaining. The longer the sun kept shining, the better the chances were the last crop of heirloom tomatoes could ripen on the vine.</p><p>This year she might actually get to harvest everything before the first frost. Over the past three years she\u2019d tripled the size of her gardens. Specializing in organic vegetables had tripled her income. But she was too cheap to hire extra help, so she\u2019d rigged up a generator and the light allowed her to harvest at night.</p><p>Gavin constantly commented about her working too hard, but the irony was he ran two businesses and she knew he worked late into the night. He wasn\u2019t exactly a stuffed shirt either; he acted more relaxed now than he had when she first met him. But he was very matter of fact. Very methodical.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that what you like about him? He doesn\u2019t pussyfoot around an issue? He comes right out and tells you what he thinks and then gives you a chance to agree or disagree?</p><p>That was a refreshing trait. Most men tried to charm or cajole her, acting offended when their bravado didn\u2019t have the desired effect, either in business or personally. Which is probably why she didn\u2019t date. Too much bullshit.</p><p>How had the subject of dating and Gavin come up together?</p><p>Because face it, you\u2019re attracted to him.</p><p>Yes, they flirted constantly. But it didn\u2019t mean anything because they were... What exactly were they?</p><p>Roommates. Friends. Tied together by a business deal that each of them regretted on some level. The potential for more was there. The question was: Would either of them act on it? Or would they just keep it comfortable and remain at the friendly, teasing stage?</p><p>Pushing those thoughts aside, she got back to work.</p><p>Sometime later, she heard, \u201cHey, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to see Chet and Remy West hanging over the fence on the far side of the tomato garden.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for the West boys today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin suggested we come talk to you,\u201d Chet said.</p><p>She dropped her gloves by the tomato plant so she\u2019d remember where to pick up. \u201cThere are benches down here.\u201d She could use a break. Standing slowly, she set her hands on her lower back, then arched back to ease the strain.</p><p>Since her hands were full with two baskets of tomatoes, Remy opened the gate for her. He wasn\u2019t a tall man, but his bulked-up body made him seem bigger. With his curly dark brown hair, warm hazel-colored eyes and sweet smile, Rielle wondered why she\u2019d always turned him down whenever he\u2019d asked her out over the years.</p><p>\u201cPlants look great, Ree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo blight this year, thank heaven.\u201d</p><p>Chet peered in the basket of tomatoes. \u201cMa wants to know if you\u2019ll be at the farmer\u2019s market or if you\u2019ll be selling directly from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of both. Next Saturday I\u2019ll be at Spearfish Park. She can always call me or stop by. I\u2019m here most days.\u201d Rielle sat on the slate bench. \u201cWhy does Gavin think I need to talk to you guys? The house and the front section of property are his now and he can do whatever he wants with it.\u201d Including building a big damn garage. Would he fill it with boy\u2019s toys? A sports car? She tried to picture it, but Gavin didn\u2019t seem the flashy type.</p><p>Chet stared off into the distance. His height topped his brother\u2019s by an inch or two, but his physique was identical to Remy\u2019s\u2014brawny and muscle bound. His gaze met hers. His eyes were deep brown, almost black. His blond hair also held a hint of curl. If their eye color and hair color weren\u2019t complete opposites, Rielle would swear the men were twins. \u201cEverything is finalized on the addition and we\u2019ll start next week since we had a three-week hole in our schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems...coincidental the opening just happens to be the same time Gavin needs a project finished.\u201d</p><p>Remy shrugged. \u201cSometimes things just work out like they\u2019re supposed to. But that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Rielle twisted the top off the gallon jug of water and took a long drink before she answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter we got the phone call from Gavin, we revisited the building plans for your place since we hadn\u2019t looked at them in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the design is solid. We\u2019re able to design all the eco features you\u2019ve asked for. However...\u201d</p> <p>Chet and Remy exchanged a look, then Chet said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be very labor intensive, which we all knew going into this project. So we updated materials costs and reworked our original estimate...\u201d</p><p>She held her breath because this wouldn\u2019t be good news.</p><p>\u201cThe cost has gone up twenty percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe refigured it a couple different ways,\u201d Remy said, almost apologetically, \u201cbut the price didn\u2019t change.\u201d</p> <p>Due to her miserly ways, she could afford to pay additional costs, but she was kicking herself for putting this off. \u201cThank you guys. The cost of everything has gone up.\u201d She offered a wan smile. \u201cNot happy, but not surprised. So that\u2019s the worst of it?\u201d</p><p>Chet leaned forward. \u201cNope. With the building site location, and the time of year, and what\u2019s already on our plate, there\u2019s no way we can get to the project until next spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us takin\u2019 on Gavin\u2019s garage,\u201d Remy added. \u201cColby and Channing hafta wait for spring for the addition on their house too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve set a firm date for the start date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t blame ya for waiting. You were already taking care of a house, even if technically it wasn\u2019t yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Gavin about my building delay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s between us, Ree, you have our word,\u201d Chet said. \u201cAnd no matter what you decide, whether or not to proceed in the spring, and why or why not, it\u2019ll stay strictly between us.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp gaze moved between the brothers. \u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d back out?\u201d She bristled. \u201cI assure you, I may have had some rough times in the past, but I do have the money now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there, that wasn\u2019t what I was insinuating at all.\u201d Chet blushed and looked at Remy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insinuating something...worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just back up,\u201d Remy said. \u201cOne of Gavin\u2019s main stipulations for hiring us was to keep this project in line with your original plans for the B&amp;B outbuildings you didn\u2019t get to implement due to your financial situation at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin respects you. It\u2019s there every time your name comes up,\u201d Chet assured her. \u201cAnd we\u2019re to defer all the dirt work changes and landscaping to you. You have total control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur whole point is...even before we talked to Gavin, we believed you\u2019d be better off waiting until after calving season to break ground. A lot of things could change between now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things could change?\u201d she asked Remy suspiciously.</p> <p>Remy gave an embarrassed laugh. \u201cNow, Rielle, darlin\u2019, don\u2019t take this the wrong way. You are a damn attractive woman, but you don\u2019t date. We know you\u2019ve said no to all guys who\u2019ve asked you out, not just us. Now you\u2019re living with a man who saved your bacon a few years back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m interested in Gavin because he\u2019s rich?\u201d Goddammit. Was that what everyone in the area would think? She\u2019d assured Gavin it wouldn\u2019t bother her...but faced with assumptions, she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Both Chet and Remy burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cNo, but the man sure is interested in you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at them blankly.</p><p>Remy nudged Chet. \u201cTold ya she hadn\u2019t even freakin\u2019 noticed.\u201d</p><p>She had noticed how Gavin acted around her\u2014she\u2019d have to be blind not to see how he looked at her sometimes, stupid not to recognize the familiar way he touched her and a complete idiot to pretend to be unaffected by his attention. It just surprised her that Chet and Remy West had picked up on the undercurrent so quickly.</p><p>Or had Gavin said something to them?</p><p>No. Gavin wasn\u2019t like that. But as far as she was concerned, that topic was off limits. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m interested in is you guys taking some of these tomatoes off my hands. You can swing by your mama\u2019s house and earn major brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. You\u2019re a doll,\u201d Remy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd just for that, I\u2019ll send a loaf of bread home with you guys too.\u201d</p><p>Chet groaned. \u201cMan, I love your homemade bread. Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got any extra honey lying around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Chet,\u201d Remy said and smacked him in the back of the head. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a fuckin\u2019 mooch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mooch, asshole. I was gonna buy it.\u201d</p><p>Remy dodged Chet\u2019s retaliatory swat.</p><p>\u201cBoys. There\u2019s enough to go around. Let\u2019s head up to the house.\u201d She purposely didn\u2019t say my house.</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t appear until Chet and Remy were gone. He leaned against the porch support. \u201cI see you take pity on poor bachelors and send them home with food.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t shaken off the disappointing news yet. \u201cThe bachelors I like, yes. Why? You jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Gavin started down the steps. \u201cBut since you feed me on occasion, I get the better deal, since I\u2019m living with you and all. That seemed to interest them more than it should have.\u201d He stopped in front of her. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>The man had no concept of personal space. She considered saying something flip, but a soft, \u201cNo,\u201d slipped out and she dropped her gaze to the empty basket still clutched in her hands.</p><p>He took the basket from her. When she looked up, he curled his hands around her arms, moving closer yet. \u201cRielle. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest Construction can\u2019t start on my house until next spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the garage addition? Dammit, I told them I could wait if it would affect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it has nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>A calculating look entered his eyes. \u201cIf you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lightning fast Rielle placed her fingers over his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you assume anything and offer me money or I swear to God I will scream or...do something equally horrible to you.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled into a smile and he lightly nipped her fingers before she pulled her hand away. \u201cI like it when you get feisty. But if money isn\u2019t the issue, what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime. If they can\u2019t get started until spring, then that means I\u2019ll have to move into the cabin because I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want me living with you and Sierra indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>The immediate fierceness in his eyes made it hard to breathe. \u201cNow who\u2019s making assumptions?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any sign of mild-mannered Gavin. In fact, she\u2019d begun to wonder if that easy-going man had just been a figment of her imagination\u2014a pencil-pushing pushover she\u2019d never be attracted to, therefore she could keep him at arm\u2019s length. But this Gavin? No pushover. All man. All the time. And her attraction to him kept getting stronger every day.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. You are not staying in that cabin unless living with me is so heinous that you want to kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, I mean, you\u2019re not,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cGood. So we\u2019ll stick to the original plan. Because I think it\u2019s been working great.\u201d He grinned. \u201cSo, pity a poor bachelor. What\u2019s for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Rielle growled and smacked him playfully with the basket. \u201cYou\u2019re such a mooch.\u201d</p><p>But she made him lunch anyway.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Gavin strolled into the kitchen and poured himself a glass of iced tea. Then he peered over Rielle\u2019s shoulder, waiting for her to acknowledge him.</p><p>In the past few weeks he\u2019d gone out of his way to pester her\u2014not that she considered the attention of a smart, funny, sexy man a chore. Gavin was interested in everything she did workwise and asked a million questions. So Rielle returned the favor whenever possible. Showing up in his office to chat. Since the man lived on the phone, she got to hear him acting all professional and business tycoon-y. But he hadn\u2019t complained about her impromptu interruptions either.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>He stood so close the deep timbre of his voice vibrated against her skin and she fought a shiver. \u201cUpdating my notes on the new vegetable varieties I planted this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad year for squash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one? There are four genuses of squash: C maxima, C mixta, C moschata and C pepo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I get for trying to be funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquash is no laughing matter. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done something under...duress and wished you hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>That was random. But typical for Gavin. She kept typing. \u201cLike telling a stranger she can live in your house until spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, Ree. But I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. What did you say under duress? And who\u2019d you say it to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra. And I kinda, sorta, maybe promised...to buy her a car.\u201d</p><p>Rielle looked up from her laptop. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me this...why? Because you want the parent-to-parent lecture on not rewarding your child\u2019s bad behavior? The girl gets herself arrested and you\u2019re buying her a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Gavin distractedly scrubbed his hands over the razor stubble on his face.</p><p>She squinted at him. He always bounded down in the morning dressed and clean shaven. It was afternoon and he looked like a bum\u2014a hot bum, but nowhere near his usual put together self. \u201cGavin. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThis whole buying her a car business might seem sudden, but I had planned on buying her one in Arizona, I just hadn\u2019t told her. Then all that shit happened with her arrest. So as we\u2019re driving across country, I\u2019m encouraging her to talk to me, and she broke down completely. Crying about her mom leaving and how abandoned she felt, how stupid she felt that her new friends avoided her and her old friends dumped her, and berating herself for letting her grades drop. We were finally really talking about that long overdue emotional stuff...and it just slipped out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt just slipped out,\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cThat you were buying her a car. While she was crying and carrying on about how much her life sucked?\u201d</p><p>Gavin bristled. \u201cIn my defense, there isn\u2019t public transportation here, unless you count the one-way bus ride in the afternoon. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m buying her a brand new car. It\u2019s used.\u201d</p><p>And he wondered why Sierra acted entitled? Rielle focused on the document on the computer screen and scrolled down to the next page.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you talking to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my input. She\u2019s your daughter. You can give her anything she wants.\u201d Literally, since the man was reportedly worth millions\u2014if the conversations she\u2019d heard recently in his office were any indication.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m making a mistake?\u201d Gavin pressed.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter to you what I think?\u201d</p><p>Gavin leaned across the counter, forcing her to focus on him. \u201cBecause your daughter is a well-adjusted adult, attending grad school on full scholarship. You are an excellent parent and I can learn from you. So help me out here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLaying it on a little thick today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I need your input. I trust your judgment.\u201d</p><p>Good thing he hadn\u2019t flashed her that charming I-get-anything-I-want-because-I\u2019m-a-McKay smile because she hated that type of male manipulation. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll give you my opinion, just this one time.\u201d Rielle sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s backtrack. Before all that crap happened this summer, were you teaching Sierra to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went out a few times. She learned to park at the mall. We mostly stayed on residential streets. I had her drive on the freeway once and it freaked her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s never driven on a gravel road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Charlie has offered to teach her to drive after school and I\u2019ve agreed because I know he\u2019ll be more patient. Plus, he has the time to spare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good because I doubt she had to deal with adverse road conditions in sunny Arizona. Maybe you should have Charlie give you a few winter driving tips too.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cFunny. But what\u2019s your advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy her the car. But park it in the driveway. That\u2019ll be an incentive for her to bring her grades up and stay out of trouble. Riding the bus is good for her socially. Plus, she\u2019ll have a better appreciation when she\u2019s allowed to drive the car on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>Gavin studied her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn smart.\u201d He trailed his palm down the length of her bare arm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A tingle started at her nape and traveled to her tailbone. She reacted to Gavin\u2019s unexpected casual affection instinctively, rubbing her fingertips over the dark growth on his cheek. \u201cOoh, look out. The tycoon is going native. He\u2019s already forgetting to shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I\u2019m out of razors. Since you were a smartass\u2014\u201d Gavin scraped his stubbled cheek up and down her arm until she shrieked, \u201c\u2014you\u2019ll just have to put up with my manly scruff today.\u201d</p> <p>Oh yeah, I can think of a couple other places you can rub that manly scruff on me.</p><p>The way his eyes stayed locked on hers, she swore he\u2019d read her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve asked to borrow one from me, roomie,\u201d she teased, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure you\u2019re too manly to use a pink razor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I am. Hand it over. You can watch me shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. I\u2019m out of razors too. I haven\u2019t shaved my legs in a week.\u201d Not that she had a reason to.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gavin rotated her barstool and latched onto her ankle. \u201cLet\u2019s compare, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt my stubble; it\u2019s only fair I feel yours.\u201d His blue eyes held a wicked gleam as his palm slowly inched up the outside of her calf.</p><p>\u201cThis is...\u201d Crazy, sexy, hot. How long had it been since she\u2019d been touched with such teasing sexiness?</p><p>Forever. Maybe...never.</p><p>\u201cSee? I knew you were lying. Your skin is silky smooth.\u201d</p><p>Keep going. The hair gets a lot coarser higher up.</p><p>His hand stopped at the hem of her skirt. Keeping his eyes on hers, his fingers caressed the skin above her knee. \u201cNo hair here.\u201d</p><p>A rush of desire had her so dizzy she feared she\u2019d topple off the chair.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s hands followed the contour of her calf down to her ankle. Then he set her foot to the chair rung and stepped back, grinning widely. \u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d He wandered out of the kitchen, whistling.</p><p>That was weird. Sexy as hell, but weird.</p><p>Of course Boone West was working with his uncles on a day her hair looked like total dogshit. And she was wearing ratty sweats and no makeup. And she had cramps like a motherfucker that no dosage of Midol could cut. So she was cranky. Even her dad had told her to get a grip on her crap attitude before he\u2019d taken off with Ben. Uncle Ben. The thought of calling the intimidating Ben McKay Uncle Ben made her snicker.</p><p>Then Boone wandered into view again and Sierra sighed. He wore a black wife beater that showed more muscles than she\u2019d given him credit for. His skin glistened with sweat from lugging heavy tools and lumber. Watching him, she understood that Boone was no ordinary high school boy who would slowly morph into an adult male; he was already a man. A hunky, hard-working man and she had it bad for him, even when she knew there wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in the desert he\u2019d ever look at her with lust in his eyes.</p><p>Especially not today.</p><p>She tapped her fingers on the windowsill, considering her options. Stay inside and continue to spy on him from the big window? Then he wouldn\u2019t know she was having a bad everything day. Or should she casually wander outside and pretend to be shocked he was at her house?</p><p>So what\u2019s it gonna be, Sierra? Hide? Or seek?</p><p>When she saw his uncles\u2019 work truck heading up the driveway, leaving Boone all alone... Seek won out.</p><p>She resisted the urge to squeeze into a pair of skinny jeans and switch her sports bra for a push-up. Grabbing the half-full garbage bag from the kitchen, she sailed out the front door.</p><p>Sadie, Rielle\u2019s sweet German shepherd, trotted along beside her as Sierra strolled to the Dumpster. The hinges squeaked as she opened the metal lid and tossed the garbage in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to throw regular garbage in there, just building materials.\u201d</p><p>Sierra manufactured a surprised look before she wheeled around. Boone had crouched down to scratch Sadie\u2019s ears. Some guard dog; her tail was wagging furiously. \u201cOh. Hey, Boone. Sorry. I\u2019ll take it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me. You don\u2019t wanna get your clothes dirty. Mine already are.\u201d</p><p>Sierra froze when Boone sidled right up to her, close enough their arms and shoulders touched. His biceps rippled as he fished out the garbage bag. Then he jogged to the barn, tossed it in the plastic can and jogged back.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you worked with your uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when they need a gopher and wanna haul my ass outta bed at six a.m. on a Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be more than a gopher if they left you here by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m on clean up duty. They went to get supplies and lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they bringing food back for you?\u201d</p><p>Boone snorted. \u201cDoubtful. I was late this morning \u2019cause I worked until freakin\u2019 midnight and didn\u2019t have time to make my lunch.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGoing without lunch is supposed to teach me responsibility or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. It\u2019s irresponsible for them to expect you to work on an empty stomach. Mean too, since they\u2019re eating. I...ah...was about to make myself a sandwich and it\u2019s just as easy to make two.\u201d Had she really invited him in for lunch? Take it back before he can refuse.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His gaze swept the empty parking area, then those beautiful caramel-colored eyes locked to hers and her stomach flipped. \u201cIs your Dad or Rielle home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow.</p><p>She blushed and then pushed him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned to drag you into my bedroom. It\u2019d just be us having a sandwich in the kitchen. But whatever. Go ahead and starve.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed before Boone bestowed a grin that kick-started her heart. \u201cWell...since my virtue is safe with you, McKay, I suppose you can fix me lunch.\u201d</p><p>They started walking toward the house. \u201cWhy do you keep calling me that? I\u2019m not a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood don\u2019t lie. With the way you look and act, you\u2019re all McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as if it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but there\u2019s been bad blood between the Wests and the McKays over the years. No one talks about it, but some of it\u2019s still there even after intermarriage between the families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea. But there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know about this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything. I\u2019m totally unbiased.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cSays a West. So, if Chet and Remy are your uncles, who\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDax. He\u2019s the oldest. As I\u2019m Chet and Remy\u2019s only nephew, they feel it\u2019s their duty to teach me to do \u2018manly shit\u2019 like carpentry and cars and...other stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who teaches you how to do \u2018womanly shit\u2019 like make sandwiches and set your alarm? Your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sassy.\u201d Boone bumped her with his shoulder. \u201cMy mom lives in Gillette. I live with my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents got divorced when I was five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine never got married. My dad knocked my mom up when she was a senior in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Was he in high school too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope. He was nineteen. Old enough to know better, as he constantly preaches to me.\u201d Boone winked at her. \u201cWhich is why I usually avoid the temptation of being alone with hot females.\u201d</p><p>Was he saying she tempted him?</p><p>Get real, Sierra.</p><p>On the front porch, Sierra waited as Boone dusted off his clothes and kicked off his heavy soled boots. \u201cWhere can I wash up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe kitchen sink is fine. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>Sierra pulled out a package of roast beef, sliced smoked cheddar, yellow mustard and lemon basil mayo. She turned around, getting an eyeful of the muscles in Boone\u2019s back working beneath his tank top as he thoroughly scrubbed his arms and face. Her gaze dropped to his incredibly tight butt\u2014thank you, Wrangler jeans. He didn\u2019t notice her guilty look or flushed face when she handed him a towel.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Boone asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me if you want tomato and arugula on your sandwich.\u201d She sliced thick chunks of Rielle\u2019s homemade herbed oatmeal bread.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s arugula?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeppery lettuce.\u201d She gestured with the knife to a pile of greens. \u201cTry some.\u201d</p><p>Boone popped a piece in his mouth and chewed. \u201cI\u2019ll have that. And tomato.\u201d He leaned closer to watch her. \u201cSo do you like to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents got divorced when I was five and we ate out a lot, no matter which one of them I stayed with. By the time I was ten, I never wanted to eat another McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal. My Grandma Grace taught me some basics. Then dad and I enrolled in cooking classes that forced us to look beyond canned stuff, mac and cheese and spaghetti. I experiment with food because I know my dad won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy idea of experimenting with food is to put different taco sauce on frozen burritos.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sliced tomatoes. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you on the bus lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a job after school or I\u2019m studying at the library.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou work with your uncles during the week?\u201d She slathered mayo on the bread and placed it over the tomato.</p><p>\u201cNah. I work part-time as an EMT on the Crook County ambulance crew.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to be eighteen to be certified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI passed the course last spring after I turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he didn\u2019t look like a boy\u2014he wasn\u2019t one. She slid his sandwich onto a plate and set it in front of him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what that little shit Kyler said about me when I haven\u2019t been on the bus to defend myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned that you\u2019re...kind of mean.\u201d Not entirely true. Kyler said Boone had a bad reputation.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. What\u2019s he really say?\u201d</p> <p>So Sierra told him.</p><p>Boone grinned. \u201cI\u2019m back to being bad boy Boone, eh? Cool.\u201d</p><p>No explanation.</p><p>Sierra filled two water glasses and parked herself next to him at the breakfast bar. This was surreal. Having lunch with Boone West. She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. God. He was so hot.</p><p>\u201cHow you like livin\u2019 in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to like it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hanging out with Marin Godfrey, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is she a troublemaker or something?\u201d</p><p>Boone shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s cool. I saw you talking to Angie and Kara. Those two chicks have bad reputations. Don\u2019t go to any of the parties they invite you to, okay?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a country bumpkin waiting to taste her first beer. \u201cUmm, no. If I actually get invited to a party, I\u2019m going. And FYI, I went to parties all the time in Arizona. I\u2019ve probably seen more wild stuff than you have, Boone.\u201d An exaggeration, but he wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you go to those parties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. So I know what I\u2019m talking about when I tell you to steer clear.\u201d</p><p>She drained her water and felt him staring at her. She faced him and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d a little sharply.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get pissy with me. You\u2019re a pretty girl.\u201d His gaze slowly roamed her face. \u201cScratch that, you\u2019re a beautiful girl and I don\u2019t want to see the jerks and assholes taking advantage of you because you\u2019re new to town, looking for friends and a good time.\u201d</p><p>Had Boone really said she was pretty? Wait. He\u2019d said she was beautiful? Get out. And she looked like shit today.</p><p>\u201cSierra? Were you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yeah. Sure. Watch the parties. Got it.\u201d</p><p>After he finished his sandwich and the other half of hers, he said, \u201cIs that your Jeep Waggoner parked out front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet ride. I love those classic cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad says I\u2019m still learning to drive so he never lets me go anywhere by myself. He\u2019s being such a hardass about it.\u201d</p><p>Boone wiped his mouth with a napkin. \u201cHe should be. Driving on the gravel roads takes getting used to. We get all sorts of accident calls and that\u2019s before the snow and icy conditions start.\u201d</p><p>Talk about treating her like a kid sister. That wasn\u2019t the way she wanted him to see her at all. Maybe she should\u2019ve worn that stupid push-up bra.</p><p>He rinsed their lunch plates. Then he slayed her with his high-power grin. \u201cI\u2019d better get back to work before my uncles see that I\u2019m not starved to death. Thanks for lunch. It was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya around, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Sierra stood by the window, watching him walking away, a plan hatching in her mind. If she ever was at a party with him, she\u2019d show him that she could live up to the wild McKay reputation she\u2019d heard so much about.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care what the policy was before. My management policy is the tenant\u2019s problem gets addressed the first time they call, not the third.\u201d Gavin paced in front of his desk. \u201cThis bullshit has been going on since I bought the property three months ago? Leave Chris a message. I\u2019d better hear from him today, or he\u2019ll be in the unemployment line tomorrow.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>Jesus. He\u2019d been so distracted with Sierra\u2019s arrest and the custody hearing that he\u2019d let a few things slide in the transition to running his business remotely. Things he\u2019d deal with when he wasn\u2019t so pissed off.</p><p>Full of restless energy, he laced up his running shoes and hopped on his treadmill. At least he\u2019d put the anger to good use.</p><p>Gavin ran for an hour. Then he cooled down and lifted free weights. Last year his blood pressure had skyrocketed, forcing him to shed thirty pounds and take charge of his health. An exercise regimen, the right diet, the right medication and he felt like a new man. He even had a libido\u2014something he\u2019d never had much of until medical tests four months ago revealed low levels of testosterone.</p><p>At first he\u2019d scoffed at taking testosterone supplements. He\u2019d gotten by fine for years without them. But in thinking about how little interest he\u2019d had in sex over the years, he decided he had nothing to lose.</p><p>And thinking about sex...his thoughts drifted to Rielle. The woman made him insanely hard. Just sitting beside her at breakfast, he had the urge to pull her onto his lap and kiss the hell out of her, while running his hands down her muscled arms. Then he\u2019d hold her generous breasts before clamping his hand on her ass, bringing her pelvis against his so she\u2019d know exactly how hard she made him. He was getting a woody right now just thinking about her.</p><p>Stop. Time for a cold shower.</p><p>Then maybe he\u2019d wander down to the Garden of Ree and see what chores his too-tempting roomie had assigned herself today.</p><p>\u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>She pivoted in the dirt and faced Gavin. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just exploring.\u201d He sighed dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re bored.\u201d</p><p>His low, throaty laugh was seductive. \u201cThat too. I followed the road that winds around the gardens and it ended abruptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ends to deter explorers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are hilarious. So what are you ripping out, plowing up, or chopping down today?\u201d</p><p>Rielle peeled off her gloves and set them on top of the fence before she left the fenced garden. \u201cI\u2019m about to check my fruit trees to see how close I am to harvest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you what? Pick them, load them and haul them to a farmer\u2019s market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome gets sold locally, but the bulk goes to restaurants across the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a market for it outside of Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA much bigger market.\u201d</p><p>Gavin fell in step with her as she headed toward the grove of trees at the bottom of a small hill.</p><p>Rielle gestured to the orchard. \u201cThese are considered old fruit trees. They\u2019d been here thirty years when my parents bought the place thirty years ago. So they\u2019re sixty-year-old trees that\u2019ve never been treated with pesticide. That\u2019s incredibly rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just leave them be and let nature take her course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prune and water and use natural pest repellents. It usually works. But one year the trees were infested with some weird bug and had zero yield. I figured all the trees were done for because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t spray them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. The next year, the trees came back stronger than ever, no bugs. I chalked it up to nature knowing what the trees needed better than I did.\u201d</p><p>He walked alongside her. \u201cI am a clueless urbanite when it comes to trees\u2014with the exception of recognizing orange and grapefruit trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be cool to walk into your backyard and pick a grapefruit for breakfast.\u201d She touched a branch of the closest tree. \u201cThis is a pine sweet apple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of that variety.\u201d His eyes lit up. \u201cAh, this is the tree that lays the golden apples.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYep. I have two of these. Next in line are mountain pear trees, again a rarity. These two are the fussiest of all the trees; I never count on any kind of yield.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut when it does bear fruit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get five bucks apiece for them. They\u2019re so tiny, yet have such robust flavor. One chef in Chicago has a standing order to buy the entire crop. He\u2019s anxiously awaiting shipment because it\u2019s been two years since these suckers have bloomed.\u201d</p><p>Gavin whistled.</p> <p>\u201cThe next two trees are golden apricot. I sell the fruit to locals or find some use for it in my own cooking and canning. After those are the plum trees. The variety is sweet water pink, another rarity. The skin is such a deep purple it\u2019s almost black, but the flesh is a very pale pink. The fruit doesn\u2019t get big, and it tastes like a cross between a blueberry and a strawberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the going rate for a sweet water pink plum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix bucks apiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you sell them around here?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWyomingites won\u2019t spend that on a beer, let alone on a tiny piece of fruit. There\u2019s a Japanese fusion restaurant in San Francisco that takes the whole lot every year. My understanding is the chef slices a single fruit and plates it with single curls of white, dark and milk chocolate and charges twenty-five bucks for it.\u201d</p> <p>They kept walking and she began to feel self-conscious, blathering on about trees. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re interested in this? Or are you just being polite?\u201d</p><p>He stopped and grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m very interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never known anyone who makes a living off the land the way you do. I mean, yes, the McKays do, but in a different way. I\u2019ve watched you nurturing your garden, slaving to harvest, exhausted but exhilarated. It\u2019s something to behold. I don\u2019t think I could do it year in, year out, being at the whim of nature and the weather.\u201d</p><p>Rielle stood close enough to him to let his eyes draw her in. That vivid blue, the same blue all the McKays had, but his eyes seemed...brighter somehow. Truer. Something about Gavin said trust me. This was the first time she\u2019d ever had that gut reaction. Because she didn\u2019t trust easily, that made her attraction to him all the more acute.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing you this way,\u201d he said in his rough and compelling voice.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning covered in dirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being dirty suits me just fine, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. Had he really meant it that way? Yes, if the heat in his eyes was a sign.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say to that, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. He dropped her hand and pointed to the last two trees. \u201cWhat about those? Magic Mediterranean figs that taste like ambrosia and earn you a hundred bucks a pop?\u201d</p><p>In that moment the sexual tension vanished and everything went back to normal between them. She was glad for it, even when she had a pang of regret for being tongue-tied when he always came up with such sexy off-the-cuff comments. \u201cThose are just plain old red delicious apples.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut from sixty-year-old trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I don\u2019t sell many of those. I sacrifice them to the deer, hoping they\u2019ll gorge themselves on these first two trees and leave my other trees the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogical. But I see you\u2019ve erected some netting as extra insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mostly to keep the birds away. That\u2019s also why I\u2019ve let the chokecherry bushes get overgrown. It\u2019s a natural deterrent and a critter barrier.\u201d She ducked under the netting and beckoned to him. \u201cCome into my secret garden, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>A smiling Gavin followed her without question.</p><p>At the base of the plum tree, she pointed to a branch directly above his head. \u201cI can\u2019t reach that high, so I want you to pick that plum closest to the trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re letting me try a six dollar piece of fruit?\u201d His eyes took on a strange twinkle. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you, I don\u2019t have any bills smaller than a twenty on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI oughta charge you double for that crack. Go on. Pick it.\u201d</p><p>Curling his fingers around it, he tugged and promptly handed the fruit to her as if it was a bomb. \u201cIt\u2019s so small. And warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so luscious.\u201d Rielle held the fruit between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cI\u2019ll take the first bite so you can see how juicy and tender the pink flesh is.\u201d Keeping her eyes on his, she brought it to her mouth, using the very edges of her teeth to sink down through the skin. The instant the sweet juice hit her tongue she closed her eyes and moaned. Normally she limited herself to the damaged or near rotten fruit, not the perfect ones such as this.</p><p>When Rielle opened her eyes, Gavin was right there. He couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from her mouth. Her voice dropped to a sultry whisper. \u201cSee how the juice coats the pink flesh when it\u2019s soft and warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, I want a taste,\u201d he said, his voice a deep rasp. \u201cA full taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf this fruit?\u201d</p><p>His hot blue gaze locked to hers, broadcasting that he wasn\u2019t thinking about the plum. \u201cOh, I\u2019d take a full taste of that too.\u201d Holding her hand in place, he bent forward and sucked the other half from her fingers. \u201cMmm.\u201d After he removed the pit from his mouth, he nipped her fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I need another taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want to do right now? Lick every bit of juice off your lips. Then I want to suck it off your tongue. So when I kiss you the first time? I\u2019ll know the sweetness and heat is all you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had gone desert dry, but she eked out a soft, \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Just as Gavin started to close the distance, the bushes behind them rattled. They both jumped back and a deer bounded past.</p><p>Cheeks burning, Rielle retreated, ducking out of the netting.</p><p>Gavin caught her hand and spun her to face him. \u201cRielle. Stop. Don\u2019t run from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d</p><p>He quirked a brow. \u201cDid you suddenly remember you left muffins burning in the oven or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe I was running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you upset by what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>His handsome face reflected grim amusement. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re upset? Because I am. I\u2019m not much of a hunter, but if I would\u2019ve had a rifle, I would\u2019ve blasted that damn deer for interrupting us.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. I like to hear you laugh as much as I like to see you smile.\u201d His thumb swept across the pulse point in her wrist. \u201cI really like that you urged me to kiss you and I almost did.\u201d</p><p>She tried to jerk her hand away but he held firm. \u201cWhy are you determined to embarrass me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you determined to pretend this is nothing?\u201d he countered, his eyes serious. \u201cOr is almost kissing in the orchard like giddy teenagers normal for you? Because I have to admit, it\u2019s not normal for me. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>Buoyed by his confession, Rielle smiled at him. \u201cMe either. Come on.\u201d She walked closer to him as they strolled back to the gardens.</p><p>\u201cHow do you harvest all that fruit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a ladder, strap on a bag and start picking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean by yourself. That\u2019s dangerous work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s how it goes when you run your own business. When things need to be done, you just do them and don\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the fruit is ripe at the same time so it varies. I\u2019ll pick the plums on Wednesday and ship them Thursday. The pears look to have at least a week left. The apples, another two weeks minimum. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I volunteer my services as a fruit picker.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t get anything done with Gavin distracting her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have construction workers to boss around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI excel at multitasking.\u201d He pointed to a small structure at the top of the rise. \u201cWhat is that building used for? And is it on my property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes, it\u2019s on your property. It\u2019s a honey house.\u201d</p><p>As expected, his head whipped around and he flashed her a depraved grin. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place to process my honey away from the bees.\u201d She gestured to the stacks of white boxes in front of a cluster of chokecherry and buffalo berry bushes. \u201cI\u2019ll check my bees in the next couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking your bees... Is that like minding your p\u2019s and q\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever, tycoon. But no. It\u2019s a little more involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would you want to keep bees? Don\u2019t they sting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if provoked. At first I started a few hives because Wyoming joined an experimental subsidy program and it paid well, especially for a single mom. But I believe in the program and honeybees are essential in pollination of one third of the world\u2019s crops. I have a higher yield in my gardens because of the bees. The ranchers that plant alfalfa reap the benefits of my bees too. Win win, right? Plus, I get to sell the product and the byproducts.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cByproducts...plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honey and the beeswax. Have you ever tasted wildflower honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Does it taste different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And my honey tastes different from someone else\u2019s honey.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s hot mouth brushed across her knuckles. \u201cOf that I\u2019ve no doubt. And I can\u2019t wait to taste yours.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body heated. Was she having a hot flash? Or were his words just that sexually potent? Yeah. It was all him.</p><p>\u201cSo those stacks of white boxes scattered all over the property. Those are bee traps?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cBee traps. Those are the hives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquare hives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically they\u2019re called supers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you get the honey out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy pulling the frames. Then slicing the wax caps off.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cStill don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can go into explicit detail of honey production and harvesting or give you an overview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more the explicit type.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure you are.</p><p>Rielle detailed the process. Inside her honey house, she modeled her beekeeper suit and showed the smoker used to calm the bees before she opened the hive to check them. Then she showed him the spinning extractor that used centrifugal force to separate the honey from the wax comb. Lastly she pointed out the big buckets with spigots for bottling the honey.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with the bees in the winter?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at him. His eyes hadn\u2019t glazed over yet. She tended to be enthusiastic about beekeeping, especially to the uninitiated. \u201cKeep them in their hives.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked skeptical. \u201cThey don\u2019t freeze up here in the arctic north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always some loss. But honeybees winter well when they\u2019re properly protected will have enough honey to survive. I leave about seventy pounds of honey in each hive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much? Does that give you much of a harvest?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, I get at least that. Last year I ended up with ninety pounds from each hive. And with twelve hives...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, that\u2019s a whole lot of honey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. I bottle it, sell it locally, and send some to stores across the state that specialize in Wyoming-made items. Skylar at Sky Blue buys a lot to use in her beauty products. Honey production is my most profitable business. I do the least amount of work. It\u2019s a sweet deal.\u201d</p><p>Gavin groaned at her pun.</p><p>\u201cThanks for listening to me blather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. I\u2019m interested in your life and livelihood, Ree, but I haven\u2019t forgotten about that almost kiss.\u201d He started to move closer, but stopped to pull his buzzing cell phone from his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get Sierra from the bus stop. We\u2019ll pick this up later.\u201d</p><p>Break over, Rielle returned to work.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>October...</p><p>Rielle knocked on Gavin\u2019s office door.</p> <p>He answered with a terse, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She poked her head inside. \u201cIs it safe to come in? You sound grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Where the hell have you been the last four days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney harvest time, remember? What\u2019s put the wrinkle in your brow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of stuff. I\u2019m in a lousy mood. You\u2019d best trot your little self back downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Little self? Was he trying to start a fight with her? \u201cWhat happened that\u2019s got you locked in your office on a Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe idiot running one of my new properties somehow lost all the property maintenance records for the last three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost? Don\u2019t you have a backup copy?\u201d</p><p>Gavin paced behind his desk. \u201cYou\u2019d think so. But no one can find a backup. I\u2019ve had to walk him through every single step of searching programs and documents, which he should know how to do. I finally told him to take the tower to my computer guru to see if there\u2019s anything on the hard drive. But instead of taking it where I told him, he dropped it off at Best Buy because it was closer to his house. Now I suspect he purposely erased all the records because he knows I\u2019ll see shit hasn\u2019t been done on the property for a long time. I\u2019ve had nothing but problems with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy keep him on if he\u2019s such an idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome sob story from the previous owner about the guy trying to get custody of his kids from his ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would be a trigger for you to give him a chance,\u201d Rielle said.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of triggers...\u201d He made an exasperated noise. \u201cSierra pushed all my buttons today. Every. Single. One. Which hasn\u2019t happened for a while so I guess she decided we were overdue for a fight.\u201d</p><p>She watched him beat a path across the carpet. He looked damn fine in workout clothes; a gray sleeveless T-shirt that showed off his defined shoulders and biceps and navy-colored boxing shorts that hung off his lean hips. She imagined his back muscles bunching up and his biceps rippling when he smacked the heavy bag. His sweat-dampened shirt clung to his pectorals. Would his sweat carry the clean scent she associated with him? Or something more raw and masculine?</p><p>\u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>She snapped back to attention. \u201cAh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>I missed you. \u201cChet and Remy need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Maybe they\u2019ll tell me why this garage project is stalled.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered behind his desk. \u201cAfter seeing you so aggravated, I\u2019m offering you the ideal way to work off some of that frustration.\u201d</p><p>Gavin tilted his head. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>She fought a shiver at his very sexual once-over. \u201cYou offered your harvesting services. I\u2019m here to collect. It\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s a gorgeous day. Not many more left. The fresh air and sunshine will help you forget about your problems, if only for a few hours.\u201d She poked him in the sternum. \u201cAnd if you prove to be a good worker bee, I\u2019ll even fix you lunch.\u201d</p><p>He snatched her finger. \u201cFirst, don\u2019t poke me because I poke back. Second, thanks for giving me the chance to do your heavy labor so I feel better.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut you know what? I accept. I will expect dessert with my lunch. Something really sweet. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith one hand tied behind my back.\u201d She poked him again and ducked out of his reach. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done dealing with Chet and Remy, trot your little self down to the gardens.\u201d</p><p>After three hours of laboring in the dirt, Gavin sighed heavily. \u201cHow many acres of root vegetables did you plant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcres?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you harvest these with a tractor or something? This digging them up by hand shit really sucks.\u201d</p><p>Rielle leaned on her shovel. \u201cA tractor? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTractor, plow, rake, combine, whatever. I\u2019m tired. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And when did you turn into Sierra, complaining this sucks and that sucks?\u201d</p><p>Gavin threw down his spade, tore off his gloves and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I can take you making fun of my lack of vegetable ranching knowledge, but when you compare my attitude to that of a sixteen-year-old girl? Well, honey, it\u2019s on. Because I am all man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Flashing his teeth, he jumped over the spade handle and made a beeline for her.</p><p>She started to run but the soft, overturned dirt slowed her down. When she glanced over her shoulder, Gavin was gaining on her. She put on a burst of speed but it was too little, too late. His arms came around her waist, and he jerked her to a stop.</p><p>Rielle shrieked. She shrieked louder when he lifted her off the ground. \u201cGavin! Put me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re my captive.\u201d His warm breath teased her ear. \u201cWhat should I do with you? Turn you over my knee and spank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>His nose drifted along her neck. \u201cDamn, Rielle, you smell great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, ah...\u201d Shit. She couldn\u2019t think straight when his mouth was on her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHoneysuckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fits.\u201d He pressed a kiss on her neck. \u201cI\u2019d like to suckle some of your honey.\u201d</p><p>The words should\u2019ve sounded corny, but they were beyond sexy murmured in Gavin\u2019s throaty rasp.</p><p>He set her down and turned her around. He brushed something out of her hair and used the backs of his knuckles to outline her jaw. \u201cKnow something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you. Missing you the last few days. A little pissy about it if you want to know the truth. Wondering if you missed me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He kept stroking her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lousy worker bee. I kept looking over at you, trying to draw you into conversation and now that you\u2019re right in front of me...I can\u2019t think of a damn thing to say. These wide green eyes of yours draw me right in.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s your mouth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mouth what?\u201d she managed to whisper.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth is so lush. I could sink into it for days.\u201d</p><p>Rielle licked her lips.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou tempting me? Or challenging me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d She snaked her arms around his neck and pulled him down for a kiss.</p><p>The move caught him by surprise but it didn\u2019t take long for him to haul her against his body and sink into the kiss like he\u2019d warned. Opening his mouth to consume hers in a teasing, hot tangle of tongues. A kiss that changed from hungry to seductive to sweet and back to hungry.</p><p>Her head buzzed. If Gavin didn\u2019t have such a tight hold on her, she\u2019d have a hard time standing, he kissed her with such ferocity. Like she was air, water and light.</p><p>Gavin ripped his mouth from hers and said, \u201cHoly fuck.\u201d</p><p>That made her smile because she\u2019d been thinking the same thing.</p><p>His hands were on her face, tilting her head back. His burning gaze moved to her mouth. Then his lips were on hers again, giving her the sweetest, gentlest kiss. The wet glide of his lips and the possessive way his hand slid down to the back of her neck, holding her in place, was undeniably sexy.</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t know how long they stayed like that, body to body, mouth to mouth. By the time he released her, her panties were damp, her breathing was choppy and she considered tearing off her clothes so they could go at it, right there in the dirt.</p><p>She rested her face on his chest and heard his heart beating beneath her ear. His shirt was damp and she breathed in his scent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis changes things,\u201d he said softly, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know. Did you ever imagine this would happen when you saved me from the evil banking empire two years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But seeing you pushing that wheelbarrow the first day we arrived...\u201d</p> <p>She arched back to look at him. \u201cI was wearing a skintight tank top and no bra that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d Gavin grinned without shame. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve done my share of noticing lots of things about you.\u201d</p><p>Rielle couldn\u2019t keep from asking, \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how sweet your ass looks in those cargo shorts you always wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me blush.\u201d But she didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p> <p>His gaze turned solemn. \u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to tell you what\u2019s happening between us isn\u2019t just because it\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, happy\u2014hell, she was giddy\u2014Rielle rose to her toes and pecked him on the mouth. \u201cThank you for saying that, because that worried me too. The truth is, I like you. A whole lot. And what a bonus that you\u2019re an awesome kisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation in a beet field. That\u2019s me, Mr. Romance.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on his shirt. \u201cSpeaking of...I have to get these roots out of the sun. Then I\u2019ll make lunch.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t complain for the next hour as they transferred the beets, sweet potatoes and celeriac to the root cellar.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea this was here,\u201d he said, studying the earthen walls and rickety wooden stairs.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of the point.\u201d Rielle clumped the beets together on a long table. \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t aware of the underground missile silos all around Wyoming before they moved here. The missile sites are gone now, but it was an issue for them, so they started building a bomb shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of hippie is confusing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you can joke about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The word hippie? Or the way I was raised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. The word doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to me now as it did even two months ago.\u201d He wore a grimace as he handed her more beets. \u201cYou make me feel lazy and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to. Usually I\u2019m the hardest working person in the room. It boggles my mind, all the stuff you know how to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had formal schooling. It was haphazard at best. They taught me when they felt like it, what they felt like\u2014never on any type of schedule. They preached the idea that real life lessons don\u2019t come from books. While I agree to some extent, they didn\u2019t understand how much I craved books and knowledge. My mother did a somewhat normal thing and took me to the library in Moorcroft. I devoured every type of book I could get my hands on. I would\u2019ve given anything to have the regular kind of life I could only read about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would\u2019ve given anything for my dad to teach me something useful, like how to use a hammer. Or change a tire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that human nature? To wish for something different than what we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Gavin kissed the edge of her jaw, down the side of her neck and sucked the spot on her throat where her pulse pounded. \u201cRight now I wish we were in a room with a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo good for a bed of dirt, tycoon?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But I\u2019ll need food for strength before I get started on all the dirty things I want to do with you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cMaybe we should take a lunch break now or we will end up doing it in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>Lunch was deer sausage on wheat rolls with sliced tomato and goat milk cheese, sweet potato chips and cantaloupe. Gavin ate like she\u2019d served up a gourmet feast.</p><p>After he helped clean up the kitchen, he cornered her, bringing his body in line with hers, pressing her against the wall. \u201cI do believe I was promised dessert with this lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll give me a sec, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I want. And I can\u2019t think of anything sweeter than your lips.\u201d He connected their mouths in a kiss so hot she wondered if she had blisters on her tongue after he released her.</p><p>Then he kissed the side of her neck, one hand gripping her short hair, the other curled around her hip.</p><p>Her eyes closed and she stopped second guessing why her body went haywire at Gavin\u2019s slightest touch. Her bones seemed to melt as his mouth tasted her skin and his thumb feathered across her belly above the waistband of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be dangerous,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve started this, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to keep your hands off me.\u201d She slid her palms up his chest. \u201cBut we need to talk about it before Sierra gets here.\u201d</p><p>That gave Gavin\u2019s amorous attention pause.</p><p>Regretfully they both backed off.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to talk about. We\u2019ve kissed. I plan on kissing you a whole lot more. Will those kisses happen in front of my daughter? No. What happens between us isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business until we make it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>He crooked his finger at her and grinned. \u201cSo why\u2019re you standing so far away from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I heard a car come up the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your hearing that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived in the country forever and I am attuned to every nuance and change around me.\u201d She paused. \u201cOr Sadie barked.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019ll admit you were right. Being outside fixed my crappy state of mind. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She drained her water. \u201cI\u2019m heading back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is your busiest time of year, why don\u2019t you hire seasonal help?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t bristle. It\u2019s a legitimate question\u2014one your friends ask you too. \u201cBecause it\u2019s expensive. And like your issues with your employees, I have the same problem. For them it\u2019s just a job. For me, it\u2019s my livelihood. What I earn in a three month period has to sustain me for the rest of the year. I\u2019d rather be tired for a few weeks and know I did it right than trust someone else at this critical point and pay for it the rest of the year.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked as if he wanted to say something but thought better of it.</p><p>Good. Gavin might be a whiz at running his business, but she didn\u2019t need his unsolicited advice on how to run hers. \u201cI\u2019d better head out and see who\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have set hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo nine to five for ranchers.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cDad, Marin is here,\u201d Sierra yelled up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019m going to Quinn and Libby\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still spending the night at Marin\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God. You\u2019ve already talked to her parents about it.\u201d How embarrassing. Who did stuff like that? \u201cCan I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she bounded out the door she vaguely heard him say her midnight curfew still applied and she had to clean her room tomorrow. She hopped into Marin\u2019s Chevy Blazer and threw her duffel bag in the backseat. \u201cThanks for picking me up.\u201d She could not wait until she could drive and didn\u2019t have to beg for rides.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. So you ready for your first Tri-County football game championship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. How is it different from any other high school football game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s tailgating. And cowboys fighting. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d Marin cranked the radio and belted out the words to some annoying country ditty. Then she looked over at Sierra. \u201cI just love this song, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of country music.\u201d</p><p>Marin gasped. \u201cOh, Arizona, I\u2019m gonna love getting you countrified.\u201d She scrutinized Sierra\u2019s outfit. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the parka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freakin\u2019 cold here.\u201d Sierra paused, unsure. \u201cTruth: do I look ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. It won\u2019t be that cold out tonight, so leave it in the truck. Plus what you\u2019re wearing is cute!\u201d</p><p>Cute, but she\u2019d freeze her ass off. She should\u2019ve stashed a hoodie in her duffel bag. \u201cDid you finish the English assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I plan to write the report Sunday night. But we\u2019re not talking about homework tonight. We\u2019re gonna get wild.\u201d</p><p>Wild? Right. Wild for Marin meant using ketchup and ranch dressing on her fries. Not that Sierra didn\u2019t like her; she liked Marin a lot. They had fun together.</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019ve been here for almost a whole quarter. You got your eye on any guy at school?\u201d</p><p>Boone West\u2019s face popped into her mind. He was so unbelievably hot. Those smoky eyes. That hank of hair that fell just a little too far down his forehead. Sigh. That sweet and devilish smile. Not to mention his rocking body.</p><p>\u201cAh hah! I recognize that dreamy look,\u201d Marin accused. \u201cCome on. Spill it. Who?\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s thing for Boone wasn\u2019t up for discussion. Not only because she didn\u2019t have a chance with him, but she\u2019d die if Boone ever found out she was crushing on him. She hadn\u2019t told Marin about fixing lunch for Boone or how pervy she\u2019d acted, peeking out the window, watching him work those muscles. \u201cI saw this guy at the C-Mart the other day,\u201d she lied. \u201cHe was older. A total cowboy. He flirted with me a little and left before I asked his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame. I\u2019d like to know who he was so I could tell you all about him. Or tell you to avoid him.\u201d</p><p>That was another problem she\u2019d discovered living in Sundance. Everybody seemed to know everybody else\u2019s business. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get lucky and see him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So it\u2019s your turn. Ask me who\u2019s been flirting with me nonstop since the last FFA meeting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch Michaels!\u201d</p><p>Sierra turned down the radio. \u201cSeriously, Marin? You\u2019re just telling me this now?\u201d</p> <p>Marin bounced in her seat and squealed, \u201cYes! I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll come to anything, but we\u2019re on the same sales team, selling raffle tickets for the quilt fundraiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll be here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully Marin wasn\u2019t the type of friend to ditch her as soon as she hooked a guy. Sierra would never do that to a friend. Not that she\u2019d ever had a real boyfriend. She\u2019d kissed a few guys but none had been worth bringing home to her dad.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing after?\u201d Marin asked, tilting the rearview mirror so she could add a coat of lip gloss.</p> <p>\u201cHave you heard if anything is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave Darling is having a party at his house. But he\u2019s charging ten bucks a head to cover the booze and you have to pay even if you don\u2019t drink.\u201d Marin didn\u2019t drink, but she didn\u2019t preach about it.</p><p>The parking area was packed and Marin ended up parking in the pasture across the road.</p><p>Welcome to Wyoming. What would her friends in Arizona say if they saw her now?</p><p>What friends? She hadn\u2019t heard much from anyone except a few random Facebook comments and texts.</p><p>Sierra shivered as they walked toward the stands. A huge crowd had gathered for the game. When Marin stopped to talk to her parent\u2019s friends about someone with terminal cancer, Sierra turned away and looked around.</p> <p>That\u2019s when she saw him.</p><p>He stood beside the ambulance. Looking bored. Okay, looking awesome in his EMT uniform. But as she watched, she noticed he wasn\u2019t alone for long. A group of girls approached him. He smiled, flashing those dimples, but the girls didn\u2019t stick around. Then a group of cheerleaders from the rival high school sauntered up. Same routine: a quick smile, a fast chat and they were gone. When a couple of pretty, college aged women invaded his space, she expected he\u2019d pay more attention to them, but he didn\u2019t act any differently.</p><p>Weird. Boone West could have his pick of any girls or women he wanted. So why did he look relieved when they left?</p><p>Then Marin dragged her to the school cheering section. They squeezed in behind the band, standing with some people from her class. Immediately after the national anthem was the kickoff. Marin clapped along with a crowd cheer. \u201cThe cheerleaders are so much better this year than last year. The new coach is whipping them into shape. I\u2019m thinking of trying out for the squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the coach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome woman who used to live here and was a super-cheerleader in high school.\u201d Marin pointed. \u201cThat\u2019s her. The little dark-haired one with the clipboard.\u201d</p><p>Sierra squinted at the sidelines and saw a tall, dark-haired man beside the cheerleading coach. He seemed familiar. \u201cHey. I think I know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow him? Arizona, you\u2019re related to him. That\u2019s Tell McKay. He\u2019s your cousin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I related to every freakin\u2019 person in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about.\u201d Then Marin grinned. \u201cBut if the coach is doing your cousin, you\u2019d totally get on the team, no problem and as your bestie you\u2019d get me on too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Except I don\u2019t know the first thing about cheerleading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year? Neither did they.\u201d</p><p>Sierra laughed. But could she really see herself in a short skirt and a tight top, shaking pompoms and yelling at the crowd? Maybe. Might be fun. It\u2019d beat sitting at home watching her dad watch football and yell at the TV.</p><p>Mitch Michaels showed up after halftime. He kept turning around to talk to Marin, so Sierra decided to leave them alone for a little while.</p><p>She ducked under the stands and cut to where the food vendors had set up. Next to the ambulance.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t try to talk to him. You saw how dismissive he was with all the others. He\u2019ll be dismissive with you too.</p><p>Her feet kept shuffling forward even as her head screamed stop.</p><p>\u201cBoone?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up and his eyes zoomed to her. \u201cHey, Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay fits you better.\u201d</p><p>Okay. This was good. Just keep talking. \u201cHow\u2019d you get stuck working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered for this shift. It\u2019s probably wrong for me to hope I get to see some action tonight.\u201d He rubbed his hands together. \u201cA broken bone would be cool. Even a broken nose if it\u2019s gushing blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo then do you get to set the bone or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d He jerked his head to the uniformed guy talking to an elderly woman. \u201cHe\u2019s the head EMT. I\u2019m just the gopher, driver and the muscle if we have to load an injured person. The docs do all the real work. We just try to keep \u2019em alive on the ride to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a rush, racing around, dealing with life or death situations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a serious fuckin\u2019 rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially.\u201d Boone picked up his book and scooted over. \u201cSit down. Chill out for a bit. Unless you wanna get back to the game?\u201d</p><p>She about lost the ability to breathe when he pinned her with that hooded brown-eyed gaze. \u201cNo.\u201d Then she was sitting thigh to thigh, arm to arm and shoulder to shoulder with Boone West.</p><p>Be cool. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Boone flipped the book over and showed her the cover.</p><p>She read, \u201cMental Preparedness: Pushing Past Your Limits. Not what I\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What did you think I\u2019d be reading?\u201d</p><p>His tone had gotten sharp. \u201cI honestly had no idea since I don\u2019t know you. It could\u2019ve been a carpentry or medical book. Maybe a manual on how to keep the family peace on a school bus.\u201d</p><p>Evidently that was the right answer because he smiled. \u201cI forget you haven\u2019t been around forever to pass judgment on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho passes judgment on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone. A few years back, I got into some trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why Kyler made the crack about you being in the principal\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. My dad pulled me up by the short hairs before the stupid shit I was doing became dangerous stupid shit. He said he wouldn\u2019t let his only kid go down that path and waste a promising life. He sent me to forestry camp for the entire summer. Straightened me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I liked it. Part of the program was taking an aptitude test. I scored high on strategy. So I\u2019m working my way down the reading list my counselor suggested.\u201d He paused and swigged from a bottle of water. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I read? Nothing outside of assigned homework and even then only enough to pass my classes. Reading isn\u2019t really my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll bet you read cookbooks,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cMan. I still think about that sandwich.\u201d</p><p>So in a way he had been thinking about her. Cool. \u201cDo you read only during slow times on your shift? Or do you read at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost nights after I work I\u2019m wiped out and I just go to bed. But my dad is home this weekend and he mentioned hanging out.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t it just figure? There went her hope they\u2019d run into each other at a party tonight after the football game.</p><p>\u201cMy dad never says, stick around son, we\u2019re gonna drink beer and fix that piece of shit Mustang we\u2019ve been working on for four years. But last night he made a specific point of telling me to make myself available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that means?\u201d</p><p>Boone shrugged. \u201cMaybe old Dax wants to break it to me that he found himself a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally old. He just turned thirty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine having a kid right now like your dad did at your age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to ruin my happy buzz.\u201d He raked his hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019d be a freakin\u2019 nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. There was this girl in my class last year who got pregnant and kept the baby. Rielle got pregnant at sixteen and kept her daughter. Then there\u2019s my Grams who gave my dad up for adoption. Seems like you\u2019re screwed no matter which option you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if I\u2019da been better off if my mom had done that. No doubt Dax would\u2019ve been happy to be off the parenting hook. Maybe I would\u2019ve ended up with rich adoptive parents like your dad did.\u201d</p><p>Took a second for that to sink in. Then she stood in front of him and glared. \u201cThat was a shitty thing to say. How would you like it if you\u2019d been given up and found out years later that your biological parents ended up married anyway? Oh, then they had more kids together? But after my dad found out years later, he\u2019s come to this family to try and sort it out, where he\u2019s so obviously a McKay as you like to point out with me, but yet he isn\u2019t. He chose to face her choice every day instead of ignoring it and going about his...rich man business\u2014which is just another thing you assume and that pisses me off because my dad earned what he has by working his ass off. So I know this situation has to bother him because it bothers me.\u201d With her angry eyes locked to his the cold seemed to hit her all at once and she began to shake.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Boone\u2019s strong fingers circled her wrists, staying her retreat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking and I just said the first stupid thing that popped into my head.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his mouth. Lips that full should look girly, but didn\u2019t on him. Yet she couldn\u2019t help but think, pretty mouth; not so pretty words spilling from it.</p><p>\u201cSierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t expect me to forgive you for that total dick comment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Boone tugged her closer until the outsides of her legs were wedged between his knees. \u201cYou so mad you\u2019re shaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sierra could feel his body heat, but it didn\u2019t warm her; it caused her to shiver again.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him and saw real remorse in his eyes. \u201cI can see that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His fingers slid down and he clasped her small hands in his larger ones. He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d His assessing gaze moved across her upper torso. \u201cWhere\u2019s your coat?\u201d</p><p>I left it in the truck so I didn\u2019t make a bad fashion statement. Like she\u2019d admit that to responsible Mr. EMT. \u201cUh. I forgot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. Don\u2019t you know how fast it gets cold here?\u201d Boone released her hands and shrugged out of his flannel-lined corduroy jacket. Then he draped it around her shoulders, pulling it around her arms and chest. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Sierra stared at him, resisting the urge to sniff the inside collar of his jacket, where his scent was the strongest. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>Then he gently freed her hair from beneath the collar. Nothing about his movements was flirtatious, but her heart raced when his fingers brushed her skin. Especially when his hands smoothed her hair back from her face, slowly, from her scalp to the ends that stopped above the jacket pockets covering her breasts. \u201cYou warming up?\u201d</p><p>She was practically hot now. Mostly in the face. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll give it back before I go.\u201d</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cKeep it. I\u2019ve got another one in the cab. I\u2019ll swing by and pick it up sometime.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMaybe you can fix me lunch again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came over to talk to me. You\u2019re different than the girls around here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p> <p>\u201cI recognize that have-I-just-been-insulted? look. I definitely meant that as a compliment. I\u2019ve had more real conversations with you in the last few months than I\u2019ve ever had with anyone else in this town.\u201d</p><p>Sierra did a mental fist pump, but managed a droll, \u201cCool. I suspected you only wanted to hang with me to give your uncles the middle finger for being friends with a McKay.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNope. I like you despite your family heritage. You\u2019re funny. You don\u2019t bullshit me. You don\u2019t try that fake come-on crap.\u201d His voice rose an octave. \u201cOh Boone, you\u2019re an EMT? I\u2019ll play doctor with you anytime.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cLame, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally lame.\u201d Good thing she hadn\u2019t said it, because she\u2019d definitely been thinking it.</p><p>\u201cWest! We\u2019ve got an injury, let\u2019s go!\u201d the other EMT shouted.</p><p>Boone\u2019s boots hit the dirt. \u201cSee you around, McKay.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Back in the stands, Marin was so enamored with Mitch she didn\u2019t even notice that Sierra had returned, wearing a borrowed jacket. Not that she\u2019d tell her friend where she got it. Some secrets were just too good to share with anyone.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>\u201cRielle!\u201d</p><p>Gavin winced. Why couldn\u2019t Sierra walk downstairs instead of yelling down the stairs? He should install an intercom system.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rielle yelled back.</p><p>Then again, these two didn\u2019t need one.</p><p>\u201cCome up and watch a movie with us. I made popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there.\u201d</p><p>Sierra gave him a smug look. \u201cIt\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so cocky,\u201d he warned. \u201cI still say she won\u2019t want to watch the movie you picked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d She ripped open the bags of microwave popcorn and filled two bowls.</p><p>Rielle walked in. \u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>Gavin pretended not to notice how the V-cut of her T-shirt made her breasts look completely lickable. Or that her cargo shorts were too baggy and hung low on her hips, providing a peek of her flat belly. Or that her smile seemed to light up the whole damn room.</p><p>She frowned at the windows. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get used to those blinds. Makes it dark as a cave up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is perfect for watching movies,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get to pick?\u201d She looked at Gavin. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t Sunday night sacred football night?\u201d His love of sports baffled her.</p><p>\u201cI set the DVR to watch it later.\u201d</p><p>Sierra handed Rielle a bowl of popcorn. \u201cDad and I can\u2019t agree on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen Things I Hate About You or Seabiscuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely the one with Heath Ledger.\u201d</p><p>Sierra did a little happy dance. \u201cTold ya. And I want cherry.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s gaze winged between them. \u201cWhat\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bet on which one you\u2019d choose. Seabiscuit was Dad\u2019s idea. It\u2019s the best movie in the history of movies\u2014according to him\u2014and he\u2019s always trying to get me to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you\u2019ve never made it through the whole thing so you can\u2019t know how great it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it puts me to sleep.\u201d Sierra stretched out on the loveseat and asked Rielle, \u201cHave you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I fell asleep too. But Heath Ledger definitely keeps me awake.\u201d</p><p>Gavin put the disc into the DVD player. He turned around. Sierra had snatched the remote. \u201cWhere\u2019s my popcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sharing with Rielle.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be suspicious his daughter suspected something was going between him and Rielle if he didn\u2019t know how selfish Sierra was about her popcorn.</p><p>Rielle already had her feet on the coffee table.</p><p>He dropped beside her so they were hip to hip. He stretched his left arm across the back of the couch and grabbed a handful of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cYour new furniture is comfy,\u201d Rielle said.</p><p>\u201cI must\u2019ve sat on two dozen sofas until I found this one. It\u2019s a little bland bachelor-ish as the fashionista pointed out, but comfort is more important than style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely plenty of room for guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if we invite all the McKays,\u201d Sierra said.</p><p>Rielle laughed.</p><p>So while she watched the movie, Gavin covertly watched her. The curve of her smile. The way she grabbed a handful of popcorn, then ate it delicately\u2014a kernel at a time. He liked that she gradually snuggled closer to him. Not in an obvious lover\u2019s clinch that would raise Sierra\u2019s eyebrows.</p><p>When her eyes started to droop, he didn\u2019t jostle her awake. He let her sleep so he could watch her without guilt.</p><p>He brushed loose strands of her hair back. His gaze encompassed her face, from the frown lines between her eyebrows even in sleep, to the smattering of freckles across her nose, to her fantasy-invoking lips.</p><p>It was only a matter of the right timing until they became lovers. The spark between them had burned a little hotter every time they were together. As much as Gavin wanted that explosion, he was a patient man.</p><p>Rielle opened her eyes and blinked sleepily. \u201cSorry for crashing on you. Guess I was more tired than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra conked out too. You\u2019d think we were watching Seabiscuit.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and her gaze cut to Sierra sprawled on the couch. Then she tried to squirm away, but Gavin held her in place.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. She\u2019s snoring.\u201d Gavin kept stroking her cheek, gauging her reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Yet. But I can think of a whole lot of things I\u2019d like to do with you.\u201d He caressed her face. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d</p><p>Rielle blushed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201d His eyes searched hers, hating to see such wariness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause guys never say stuff like that to me. Even casually. Or jokingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019m not the guy who only compliments a pretty woman because I want to get into her pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not a player like the rest of the McKays?\u201d</p><p>Gavin wanted to laugh. If she only knew he spent more time on the bench than in the game. \u201cI\u2019ve been here two months. Have you seen me with a woman or five?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hand down to outline those lush lips. \u201cGoddamn your mouth drives me crazy.\u201d He leaned closer, intending to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cGavin, we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to anyway. Close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She looked unsure for a moment and then she lowered her eyelids, her long eyelashes dark against her skin.</p><p>Gavin breathed a sigh of relief that she hadn\u2019t balked. Since he wasn\u2019t any kind of lady killer lothario, he was completely winging it with her. Apparently she liked when he took charge.</p><p>He teased her mouth, using his lips to nibble on hers. Drawing his tongue across the seam of her velvety lips, feeling the edge of her teeth and the quick dart of her tongue.</p><p>Rielle opened wider on a soft moan, and Gavin dove into the wet warmth of her mouth. Immediately the kiss caught fire. She arched up to meet his plundering tongue, her breasts mashed to his chest. He pinned her right arm above her head and his hand drifted down to the outside of her breast. He caressed the generous swell, each stroke getting closer to her nipple.</p><p>At this angle his cock pressed painfully against his zipper. Gavin shifted slightly, cupping her whole tit in his hand. He broke the kiss, scattering tiny biting kisses to her ear. He murmured, \u201cI have to stop or I won\u2019t be able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her hand brushed his scalp, sweetly, tenderly and then she pushed him away and sat up.</p><p>Their gazes connected. She smiled. \u201cHeck of a goodnight kiss, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish it could be more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d She stood and stopped in front of Sierra. She gently pried the popcorn bowl out of her hand and set it on the coffee table. She pulled the edge of the blanket off the floor and draped it over her feet. Then she quietly disappeared down the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He remained there, not watching TV, just thinking about Rielle\u2019s sweetness and fire. A potent combination. And he\u2019d started to realize he wasn\u2019t such a patient man after all.</p><p>Gavin had been expecting Vi Tuesday afternoon, but the doorbell chiming like the clang of a dinner bell startled him.</p><p>He opened the door and saw she held a big box. He immediately took it from her. \u201cI could\u2019ve carried this in for you. There\u2019s fresh coffee in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>She unbuttoned her wool coat and unwound a vibrant scarf. \u201cIt is so damp out today. Coffee sounds heavenly.\u201d</p><p>After he dumped the box in the dining room, he saw Vi sitting at the breakfast bar, poking buttons on her cell phone.</p><p>The glob of dough on the marble countertop hadn\u2019t magically transformed itself into pie crust. He grabbed the rolling pin, determined to get the damn crust to roll out evenly before his snarky daughter returned home.</p><p>When the rolling pin squeaked, Vi glanced up and scrutinized the mess. \u201cYou\u2019re making a pie?\u201d she asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cAttempting to make a pie is more like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet. Sierra challenged me to bake a pie and I had to swear that I wouldn\u2019t get Rielle to help me.\u201d</p><p>She drummed her fingers on the counter. \u201cWhat kind of pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry. I don\u2019t have to make the filling from scratch. I\u2019m having a hard enough time with the crust. The dough is sticky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets that way after it\u2019s been at room temperature for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not necessarily my bad technique?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cNo. Throw it in the freezer for a few minutes and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d When Gavin turned around, Vi was giving him a thorough inspection. \u201cDo I have flour all over my clothes or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry. It\u2019s just...we\u2019ve never been in the kitchen together like this and I wondered if your...if Grace taught you to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I learned in a helluva hurry when my ex wouldn\u2019t touch the stove and Sierra\u2019s first word was McDonald\u2019s. Did you teach your sons to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cooked for the all the boys growing up. I figured their wives would cook for them after they got married. That worked for Quinn since he and Libby tied the knot pretty young. Chase...I suspect he ate fast food all the time he was on the road. Now he and Ava have a personal chef, which boggles my mind.\u201d Vi fussed with her ruffled shirtsleeves. \u201cHowever Ben is a good cook. He grills a mean steak. Sad to say he didn\u2019t learn that from me. I tend to char meat to the point it\u2019s inedible if I cook it over an open flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Gavin removed the dough from the freezer. He reached for the rolling pin, trying not to feel self-conscious that Vi\u2014who was probably a blue-ribbon-winning pie maker\u2014scrutinized his every clumsy move. When the dough gummed up yet again, he was tempted to whip the blob into the sink and flip on the garbage disposal, conceding defeat.</p><p>\u201cGavin, would you be offended if I offered to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. I\u2019d be grateful. And Sierra only said Rielle couldn\u2019t help me, so that leaves us both in the clear.\u201d</p> <p>Vi snorted and pushed up her sleeves. After she washed her hands, she tackled the dough like a pastry chef, expertly rolling out two perfect dough circles. \u201cIs the filling ready?\u201d She peered over the tops of purple zebra print eyeglasses. \u201cI assume Little Miss wants a double crust pie?\u201d</p><p>Little Miss was an apt description. \u201cYes, although technically, I think that should count as two pies.\u201d</p><p>She snickered and transferred the dough into the pie tin.</p><p>Gavin opened a can of cherry pie filling. Before he dumped it into the shell, Vi placed a hand on his arm. \u201cYou know what would jazz that up? Almond flavoring. I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s almond liquor in the bar.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the kitchen with a bottle of amaretto. She handed him a measuring cup and he stirred the liquor into the pie filling, then spooned the mixture into the pie shell and slid the pie tin across the counter.</p><p>He found her pie-making skills fascinating. His mother had never baked. Vi stretched the dough over the top, slicing away the extra and pinching the edges together. She brushed egg wash over the dough and cut three long slits in the top before popping it in the oven. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to covet things, but I really want an oven like this. And as long as I\u2019m making confessions, I haven\u2019t made my own piecrust in years. I buy the frozen ones. No one knows the difference.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grinned. \u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>Vi arranged the extra scraps of dough on a cookie sheet and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on each piece. \u201cThis will make a good afterschool snack. I know Sierra doesn\u2019t need the information for her history project for a while, but I thought I\u2019d bring it over early. If she wants more information on the McKays, she can ask Carson and Carolyn. They have all the family archives, dating back to when the McKays bought the first piece of land in Wyoming in the late eighteen hundreds.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cThe McKays have been here that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The McKay ranch is one of the oldest working ranches in Wyoming. Of course, the original land is a tiny cow pasture compared to what they own now.\u201d</p><p>He and Sierra shared the same love of history. She\u2019d been itching to get her hands on documented family history. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sierra will be in touch if she has any questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot to give her on the Bennett side. We moved a lot and my father was very clear on the evils of material goods because you couldn\u2019t take them to heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you mentioned your father was a preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe preferred the term man of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you had a rough upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear about it.\u201d That wasn\u2019t so hard to admit.</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll need something stronger than coffee to have this conversation.\u201d She poured a shot of amaretto into her coffee cup. \u201cElmore Bennett was a Baptist minister. We didn\u2019t travel to exotic locales spreading the word of God\u2014although Wyoming seemed exotic after living in the South. My father was a difficult man.\u201d She tossed the booze back. \u201cCorrection. My father was a pious man, but verbally abusive. He utilized the fire, brimstone and punishment part of religious teachings to keep us in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your mother like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe perfect preacher\u2019s wife. I don\u2019t think she had a thought in her head except for the ones my father put there. She loved me and my brother and sister, but she\u2019d always save her own skin first when it came to dealing with my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both are. Daddy died of a heart attack when Quinn was two. Mama lived with her sister in Mississippi after that. She wasn\u2019t in good health. I went to her funeral when Chase was a baby. I haven\u2019t seen my siblings since. I\u2019m the black sheep of the family.\u201d</p><p>Hard to believe. Vi McKay looked like a sweet-faced grandma, but there was an aura of tension surrounding her. A tension that Gavin suspected had a lot to do with him. \u201cWhy are you the black sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a young, unwed teenage mother who gave her baby up for adoption. I turned my back on the church I was raised in. Then I married a man my father hated.\u201d She waggled the empty glass. \u201cAnd I like to drink. It\u2019s taken me years to learn to deal with much of this stuff. But some of it...I\u2019ll never come to terms with it.\u201d</p><p>Ask her. Here\u2019s your chance to get answers to all the shit that\u2019s been bothering you since you found out the truth about your birth parents.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t force the words past his tightly closed lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable, Gavin, but I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here. And I won\u2019t push for more than you\u2019re willing to offer. I just...thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Vi. This is still overwhelming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it is.\u201d Vi smiled sadly and slid from the chair. \u201cOn that note, the rest of the McKays are asking about you and Sierra. Now that you\u2019re settled in, would you consider hosting a get together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...that\u2019s not really my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But it\u2019s something to think about. You could have them all over here for a few hours and be done with it. Now I need to get home. I have an urge to bake Charlie a pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this class.\u201d</p><p>Gavin glanced up from Kiplinger\u2019s magazine and looked at Sierra, sitting at the dining room table with papers spread out. Strange to see her there. She always did her homework in her room, music blasting from behind the closed door. \u201cWhich class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnatomy. Why do we have to memorize all the stupid muscle groups? It\u2019s not like I plan to be a doctor or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Sierra puckered her lips with distaste. \u201cNot unless you wanna take the test for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m prancing around pretending to be you, wearing sweatpants with Juicy written across the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. You said ass. I remember when you never swore around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy if cussing was the only bad habit you pick up from your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Sierra tapped her pencil on her notebook. \u201cHave you heard from Mom?\u201d</p><p>Speaking of someone with bad habits... \u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She called me at like three in the morning. Said she \u2018forgot\u2019 about the time difference.\u201d</p><p>Gavin waited for her to continue, understanding why she\u2019d chosen to study outside her room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a load of bull,\u201d she sneered. \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t care about anybody\u2019s life but hers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did she have to say?\u201d</p><p>The pencil tapping grew louder but she didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I was pretty groggy.\u201d</p><p>This was the worst part of having a teenage daughter: not knowing when to push her to talk or when to ease off and wait until she was ready to talk. He\u2019d given up predicting which approach worked better, because her responses were always mood dependent.</p><p>He slowly flipped through the magazine pages, not really seeing the text.</p> <p>Sierra slammed her notebook down. \u201cDo you know she didn\u2019t ask me anything about how I liked living here? No questions about school, or if I have friends, or if I\u2019m driving. Nothing. She went on and on about how fantastique Paris is. How fluent she\u2019s becoming. How she spends the days soaking up culture and the nights hitting the hottest clubs and restaurants with Vince.\u201d She pulled her knees up, wrapping her arms around her calves as she curled into a ball. \u201cI hate her.\u201d</p><p>Gavin moved to sit beside her, ignoring her closed off vibe, and gently rubbed her back. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just...she\u2019s so selfish.\u201d</p><p>He bit back the comment like that\u2019s news, and continued soothing her with the same soft touch he always used.</p><p>Several long moments passed before she spoke again. \u201cAnd wanna know what I really hate? That I know sometimes I act just like her. No wonder I\u2019m not making friends at school.\u201d</p> <p>Another prickly situation. Sierra became defensive when he offered suggestions or even tried to talk to her about her problem making friends. He didn\u2019t understand why it\u2019d always been so hard for her.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like her. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be. I won\u2019t let you be.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and looked at him. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. But understand that you might not like my methods of ensuring that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta be the taskmaster hardass in our family.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. So I came up with a surefire way for you to learn your anatomy terms.\u201d</p><p>A horrified look crossed her face. \u201cNo. No way. Don\u2019t even say it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cFlashcards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Making a set of flashcards will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not in third grade trying to memorize my multiplication tables,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He tugged on her hair. \u201cBut it worked. And it worked when you had to memorize all the state capitals. And it worked when you had to memorize musical terms. It\u2019s a tried and true method.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sighed. \u201cFine. But I don\u2019t have any index cards. And I doubt the stores in Sundance are open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey do roll up the sidewalks early.\u201d He stood. \u201cI\u2019d bet Rielle has recipe cards. I\u2019ll go ask her.\u201d</p><p>Rielle scrambled away from the swinging door. She hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop. She\u2019d been heading to her bedroom and stopped outside the door when she heard Sierra talking about her mom and hadn\u2019t wanted to interrupt.</p><p>Gavin strode in, lost in thought. But his focus changed the instant he set eyes on her. \u201cJust the woman I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis first.\u201d He crowded her, bent his head and kissed her in that sure and steady way of his. And just like every other time he\u2019d kissed her, her stomach bottomed out.</p><p>How long before these randomly stolen kisses pushed them to the next level?</p><p>Almost as if he\u2019d read her mind, his mouth drifted over her ear and he whispered, \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how soon? Because I\u2019m not busy right now.\u201d She sank her teeth into his earlobe.</p><p>Gavin groaned softly. \u201cIf my daughter wasn\u2019t sitting in the other room, I\u2019d take you up on that.\u201d Another whisper-soft kiss across her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve started carrying a condom in my pocket, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter put one in each pocket.\u201d Rielle gently pushed him back. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yeah.\u201d He scrubbed his hands over his face as if he was trying to remember. Good to see she wasn\u2019t the only one sexually frustrated. \u201cOh. Right. Do you have extra blank recipe cards we can use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I do.\u201d She grabbed her recipe file box from the pantry, rummaging through the mishmash of papers until she found an unopened pack of plain index cards. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help. If you don\u2019t need anything else, I think I\u2019ll head to bed.\u201d</p><p>Gavin set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just...\u201d Horny. Which is a totally foreign feeling. \u201cAntsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. But I don\u2019t want to rush this, Rielle. With the construction guys around during the day I get interrupted, or you get interrupted by your customers, or Sierra is under foot and we\u2019re hardly ever alone. Might sound corny, but I don\u2019t want anyone around or any distractions the first time we\u2019re together. I want it to be just you and me. Completely focused on each other.\u201d</p><p>This man was too good to be true. But had he come up with those parameters because he could tell how skittish she was? How little experience she had?</p><p>He stroked the side of her cheek. \u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d She lightly pecked him on the mouth. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cSo Vi suggested something to me yesterday and I immediately dismissed it.\u201d Gavin refilled Rielle\u2019s cup and Sierra\u2019s before topping off his. The kid had kicked her addiction to Starbucks, but she was still a morning caffeine junkie. \u201cBut then I got to thinking about it and I realized it\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have a family housewarming party.\u201d He knocked back a slug of coffee. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s hands tightened around her mug. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should get it out of the way tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d Sierra repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why? Is there something else going on?\u201d</p><p>She paused. Opened her mouth. Closed it. Then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd get this\u2014Vi believes I ought to invite all the McKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the McKays?\u201d Rielle repeated. \u201cAt one time?\u201d</p><p>Sierra snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe look on Rielle\u2019s face as she\u2019s thinking about Ky, Anton and Hayden playing football in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Gavin scowled at her. So much for his daughter backing his play.</p><p>\u201cThis is your house. If you want to have a party, have a party. But I will remove all my breakables out of the great room and any other areas the wild McKay clan might vandalize.\u201d</p><p>Vandalize? That was a harsh assessment.</p><p>\u201cWill this be a potluck?\u201d Sierra asked.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d He looked hopefully at Rielle.</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t want any part of this party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, Dad. I\u2019m sure Vi will pitch in and bring food since it was her idea. We\u2019ll just have munchies and drinks. Paper plates, plastic cups, easy stuff. Pick me up after school today and we\u2019ll hit Wal-Mart in Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>Why was Sierra being so helpful?</p><p>Stop looking for motives. You should be overjoyed she\u2019s pitching in and wants to be around her family.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d He glanced at the clock. \u201cBetter get your stuff. It\u2019s about time to leave.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Sierra was out of the kitchen, he leaned closer to Rielle. \u201cI\u2019ll help you move anything you want out of the great room. And I\u2019ll try to keep everyone in the kitchen and dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...thoughtful. Thank you. But if it\u2019s all the same, I won\u2019t stick around tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laid his hand on the side of her face. \u201cI\u2019d like it if you\u2019d stay. Not to keep the appetizers supplied, or pour drinks, or even to run herd on unruly McKay munchkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Because I\u2019m related to the McKays, but you know them way better than I do. I\u2019ll probably need you to prompt me on some names.\u201d Such a lie. Why don\u2019t you tell her the truth?</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d be a crutch.\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell to her mouth. The woman had the most enticing lips. He adjusted his hand and his thumb followed the swell of her lower lip. \u201cFuck. I want to take you to bed in the worst way.\u201d</p><p>Rielle shivered delicately.</p><p>The sound of heavy equipment rattling up the drive broke the moment.</p><p>Gavin retreated. Or tried to. Rielle wrapped her fingers around his wrist, holding his hand in place.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question. If I stay for the party tomorrow night, will I just be a crutch for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019d be a lifeline.\u201d</p><p>Rielle offered him a shy smile and pressed a soft kiss to the base of his thumb before she released his hand. \u201cThen I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Sierra yelled, \u201cDad! Come on. I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>Gavin kissed Rielle hard. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck had he been thinking, having a fucking party?</p><p>There were approximately ten billion people in his house and the majority of them were less than two feet tall. And yelling. Or crying. Or doing both.</p><p>In the kitchen, Vi sidled up with another veggie plate. \u201cScoot a cheek, son, so I can put these down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Have you seen my co-host?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>I wish. \u201cNo, Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I saw her, she was looking for Keely.\u201d Vi tugged him down and whispered, \u201cMaybe you\u2019d better track her down. Who knows what kind of wild ideas Keely is putting in her head. That girl was hell on bootheels from the time she was two years old.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for the tip. Can you keep an eye on this for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be my pleasure.\u201d She smiled at Ben and Ainsley. \u201cLook at all this food! Isn\u2019t it great Gavin and Sierra did this all themselves?\u201d</p><p>Ben caught his eye and mouthed, \u201cRun.\u201d</p> <p>Just inside the dining room, something smacked into Gavin\u2019s leg. And held on. The dark-haired boy looked up and him and grinned.</p><p>Jesus. All these kids looked the same. He couldn\u2019t remember this kid\u2019s name. \u201cAh, hey there, little guy. Thanks for the hug, but you gotta let go now.\u201d</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t budge. He grinned wider and held tighter.</p><p>Gavin figured if he started walking the rugrat would slide off.</p><p>No such luck. This kid had an iron grip. Like a bull rider. Had to be one of Colby\u2019s sons.</p> <p>Maybe he could bribe him. \u201cI\u2019ll give you candy if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, wiping his wet mouth on Gavin\u2019s jeans.</p><p>\u201cBeau,\u201d a male voice said sharply. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>The kid dropped his arms, looked up at Gavin and said, \u201cNow gimme candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d</p><p>Cord scooped the boy up, cocking him on his hip. \u201cSorry. He\u2019s a little ornery tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Ya think?</p><p>Cord\u2019s focus dropped to the wet spot on Gavin\u2019s knee. \u201cDid he bite you?\u201d</p><p>Bite him? What the hell? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. This one\u2019s a biter, much to his mama\u2019s dismay.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had no idea what to say to that.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, AJ wanted me to relay her thanks for the invite and she\u2019s sorry she couldn\u2019t make it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be when she has the baby. I wanted to tell you to swing by for a beer sometime. Our door is always open and if you need anything, just holler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Cord. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He skirted two girls chasing each other and a third twirling in place like a ballerina. He saw Dalton, leaning against the wall, a baby cradled in his arms while Brandt and Jessie were eating.</p><p>Dalton smiled. \u201cGreat party, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Glad you could make it. Where are Tell and Georgia?\u201d</p><p>Jessie answered, \u201cCheerleading tryouts for winter sports are at the school tonight. And of course Tell had to go and help, since he and Georgia are joined at the hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Vi said from behind him.</p><p>He turned around. Why was she following him everywhere? Then he saw her wiping down the opposite end of the table.</p><p>Don\u2019t be an ass. She\u2019s just being helpful.</p><p>\u201cI thought Sierra wanted to try out for cheerleading,\u201d Vi said.</p><p>That surprised Gavin. Sierra hadn\u2019t even mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cGeorgia would\u2019ve loved to have her on the squad.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t his daughter said something? Did she think he\u2019d say no? Just another reason he needed to track her down. Before he made it to the hallway, he was stopped five times. Once by Colby, who said pretty much the same thing Cord had. Ditto for Kane and Kade. Colt managed to repeat the offer before the girl child in his arms screamed like a banshee and he hot-footed it outside.</p><p>His gaze swept the great room where the McKay wives were clustered with still more kids. Libby winked at him and he smiled back. He\u2019d gotten to know her a little better in the last few months and she was such a sweetheart.</p><p>Carson and Carolyn each had their hands full with a dark-haired grandchild, but Carson invited him over to skeet shoot, which was unexpected. Calvin called out to Carson and he wandered away.</p><p>Gavin must\u2019ve looked overwhelmed because Carolyn reached over and rubbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know what you were in for with this bunch, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. The McKays are...a fertile lot.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd a loud lot. Just think, Cam and Domini aren\u2019t here with their six kids. Neither are Carter and Macie and their four kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have ten more grandkids?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn kissed the sleepy, dark-haired girl\u2019s head. \u201cYes, we are very blessed. And we all feel the same way about you, Gavin. Blessed to have you as part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Have you seen Keely? I heard she was with Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She scanned the room. \u201cHmm. I don\u2019t see Jack either. Those two probably snuck off somewhere. They\u2019re trying to have a baby and I swear Keely wants bragging rights that she got knocked up in the bathroom or something.\u201d</p><p>That was pretty...intimate stuff to share.</p><p>Carolyn chuckled. \u201cMy wild-child daughter loves to shock her father, her brothers and her cousins with that type of information, so I thought I\u2019d forewarn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got to find my daughter.\u201d</p><p>He walked past the guest bath and saw two boys filling squirt guns. He shook his head. \u201cTake \u2019em outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold ya, Gib.\u201d</p><p>Gib. Colby\u2019s oldest. Since the boy in the mirror looked nearly identical, they had to be brothers. When another, smaller boy leaped out from behind the shower curtain with a loud, \u201cRawr!\u201d Gavin jumped.</p><p>The boys broke into bouts of gut-holding laughter.</p><p>Then Gavin heard Sierra\u2019s laugh and he spied her at the end of the hallway chatting with Keely. He did a double take. Seeing them standing so close together the family resemblance was a little spooky. Same height, same dark hair, same build. Same sort of scheming smile.</p><p>Lord help him. So far boys hadn\u2019t started sniffing around his daughter, which made him wonder what the hell was wrong with boys these days because she was a beautiful girl; yet, he was damn happy she wasn\u2019t boy crazy like so many girls her age.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart, did you forget you were my co-pilot for tonight\u2019s festivities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like everyone had gone through the food line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVi is in the kitchen restocking everything. Go help her.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sighed. \u201cFine. See ya, Keely.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Sierra was out of sight, Keely said, \u201cShit. That was close.\u201d She opened the door to the spare bedroom and her husband Jack leaned against the wall just inside the doorway.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hair was a mess, his shirt was unbuttoned, his belt was buckled but his fly was undone. And he didn\u2019t seem a bit concerned that Gavin saw his state of undress.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She gave Gavin a sheepish look. \u201cWe, um, borrowed your room for a few minutes. Sierra was coming out of that room the same time I came out of this one. So I thought it\u2019d be best if Jack stayed hidden.\u201d</p><p>So they had snuck off for a quickie. In the midst of all this chaos? In a house filled with family members?</p><p>Yeah, Gavin planned to keep Sierra far, far away from Keely.</p><p>Keely was already focused on Jack, smoothing the wrinkles from his shirt. \u201cGQ, we have to straighten you up before you go out there. You look like you\u2019ve been rolling around in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr more accurately, on the floor.\u201d Jack made a low noise and wrapped his hand around the back of Keely\u2019s neck, pulling her closer. \u201cSince I\u2019m half-dressed...it\u2019s your wifely duty to get back in here and make sure I don\u2019t miss any buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was for you. This one? For me.\u201d She squeaked when he tugged her into the room.</p><p>The last thing Gavin heard: \u201cLock the damn door, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>At least someone was getting laid in this place.</p><p>He shot a look at Rielle\u2019s closed door. He knocked. No answer. He started back down the hallway. When he reached the entryway, Quinn walked in through the front door.</p><p>\u201cHey. I wondered what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enjoying the fresh air. You look like you could use some.\u201d Quinn smiled. \u201cDad\u2014Charlie\u2014is outside. I was getting him a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it to him.\u201d</p><p>Quinn reached into the cooler and pulled out a Miller Lite. \u201cHave at. Better see if Libby needs my help with the kids anyway.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grabbed another beer and stepped onto the porch. He took a second to breathe in the cool night air and take in the blessed quiet. He saw Charlie sitting on the steps and walked over, dropping beside him. \u201cMiller Lite, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d Charlie didn\u2019t hide his surprise. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d He quickly added, \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you have time for a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a break. I left the kitchen in Vi\u2019s capable hands.\u201d</p><p>Charlie twisted the top on his beer bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s in her element. Thanks for asking her to help. It means more than you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp? Hell, it was her idea.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI ain\u2019t surprised to hear that. So how\u2019re the West boys comin\u2019 with the garage? I couldn\u2019t see much of it in the dark tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do great work, but they had to stop for several weeks and finish another project. It\u2019s almost done. You should swing by during the day and check it out. They don\u2019t mind having people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. I guess my question is do you mind havin\u2019 me around?\u201d</p><p>Gavin released a slow breath. \u201cI\u2019ll admit even after being here a while I don\u2019t know how this living close to family thing works. What are the parameters? Do you just drop by Quinn and Libby\u2019s? And Ben and Ainsley\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to. Not so much anymore. We call first.\u201d He took another pull off his beer. \u201cVi...God love the woman, but she overstepped her bounds with Quinn and Libby from the moment they got married. Things went south for them for a while and they ended up mending fences. Quinn warned his mom to butt out. Then she made a pledge to all the boys she wouldn\u2019t try to control them, or guilt them, or nag them. And she\u2019s even stuck with that promise\u2014for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I showed up here and Vi said that situation with Quinn and Libby was a wakeup call for her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cVi had one of those moments where every damn thing you\u2019ve done wrong just smacks you square in the face. That\u2019s when she finally told me about you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t have the balls to ask if Charlie felt what Vi had done\u2014giving him up for adoption\u2014was wrong. Because one thing he\u2019d noticed about Charlie? The man had fierce loyalty. If he disagreed with his wife, he never said so in public. He held Vi in the highest regard. Whereas Gavin\u2019s father, Dan, was the complete opposite. While a shrewd businessman, he made a lousy husband, and Gavin\u2019s mother had turned a blind eye to her husband\u2019s many affairs.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna pretend I wasn\u2019t mad. I was mad as hell. And don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but my anger was directed at her\u2014not that she\u2019d given a baby up for adoption, but that it\u2019d taken her so damn long to tell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it have made a difference if she\u2019d told you ten years earlier? Twenty years earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that. Sweet baby Jesus her father was a mean bastard, so I never doubted for a second that shaming her into an unwed mother\u2019s home was solely his doing.\u201d Charlie tipped his bottle up and drank. \u201cI argued with her for even wanting to name our second son Bennett because I didn\u2019t want anything to do with that SOB.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve started doin\u2019 that old man rambling thing. I\u2019m sure this had a point, but I\u2019ll be damned if I remember what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked about your family policy on drop-ins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Policy. Well, remember that I ranched with Quinn and Ben, so we were at each other\u2019s places every day. Chase hasn\u2019t lived around here for any length of time since he started ridin\u2019 bulls. This thing with you...is a new situation for us. We don\u2019t wanna crowd you, but you oughta know that we both consider it nothin\u2019 short of a miracle that you\u2019re even here, livin\u2019 a few miles up the road from us. It\u2019s more than we ever had hoped for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear the reality won\u2019t match up to the hype.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean living in Wyoming? Or living around family?\u201d</p><p>Both. Neither. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I mean. I appear to be rambling too.\u201d He changed the subject. \u201cThe driving lessons with Sierra are going well?\u201d</p><p>Charlie smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it\u2019s a lot different teaching a girl to drive. I don\u2019t recall that I ever taught the boys much. They just seemed to know it. She\u2019s eager to learn, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe listens to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. The girl does ask a lot of questions. And she likes to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that\u2019s a different experience.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie looked at him. \u201c\u2019Cause Quinn is quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen is too, for the most part, unless it\u2019s one on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we all feel there\u2019s no reason to waste air sayin\u2019 something that don\u2019t need to be said.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed and half a dozen kids raced out.</p><p>Adam climbed onto Charlie\u2019s lap. \u201cBet your daddy doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re out here.\u201d Charlie looked at Gavin. \u201cThis boy wears his shoes out he\u2019s constantly on the go, aren\u2019t you, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGampa, I hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrama\u2019s probably got some cookies with your name on \u2019em, though I suspect your mama would rather have you eatin\u2019 carrots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookies!\u201d</p> <p>The door slammed again and Quinn clomped down the steps. \u201cAdam, what\u2019d I tell you about running off?\u201d</p><p>The boy started to cry and wouldn\u2019t let go of Charlie.</p><p>Gavin took that as his cue to leave. He was completely off balance anyway, in unfamiliar territory on so many levels. He needed something familiar to hold onto. And Rielle was the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>Where the devil was she? He hadn\u2019t seen her for at least an hour. No one waylaid him when he checked her room. No sign of her. He scoped out the ladies sitting and chatting in the great room. She wasn\u2019t here either.</p><p>Ainsley was in conversation with Libby so Rielle hadn\u2019t snuck off with her partner in crime for a drink. She wasn\u2019t helping Vi and Sierra in the kitchen, although it must\u2019ve driven her crazy leaving it to chaos.</p><p>Chaos. As someone used to solitude, she\u2019d want to go someplace quiet.</p><p>He snuck up the back stairs and opened the door to his bedroom. Everything in him settled, seeing her silhouette against the French door.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around guiltily. She hadn\u2019t heard Gavin enter. Right. She couldn\u2019t hear anything over the pounding in her head. \u201cOh. Ah. Hey. Bet you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m doing in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shut the door and silently leaned against it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There were just too many people. Too many kids. My God, what is it with the McKays? Are the women who married into the family having a contest to see who can pop out the most babies? And didn\u2019t it seem like all the babies were screaming at one time? Guess what, they were. I timed it. There was a two minute window when no kids were yelling. Two minutes. That\u2019s all. In the last two hours. So naturally a pause in the collective noise pollution was a signal for the adults to get louder. Laughing and chatting like they hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, when I\u2019m pretty sure they have some kind of crazy McKay gossip fest every couple of weeks.</p><p>\u201cThen there were all these toddlers and school age kids running around. Climbing on the furniture like monkeys. Did the parents make the older kids go outside? No. They let those adorable, monstrous children race up and down my hallways. Up and down my stairs. Around and around my dining room table like it was a race track. All the while these kids were dropping potato chips and fruit and spilling ranch dressing on the rugs. I tried to stay out of the way and embrace the kids will be kids philosophy, but I wanted to run screaming out of my own damn house. But I couldn\u2019t. So I came to the one place that\u2019s always been my refuge.</p><p>\u201cBut when I got up here, I realized, this place no longer is mine. This is your private space and I\u2019m sorry I violated it. But where am I supposed to go? So I stayed because I just needed a minute to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Rielle placed her hands on her cheeks. Her skin was on fire. Or maybe she was having a hot flash. Better that than a panic attack. She vaguely remembered her parent\u2019s advice about breathing techniques and visualization exercises to calm down.</p><p>Why the fuck couldn\u2019t she remember how to calm the fuck down?</p><p>Her heart galloped and her pulse throbbed...maybe she was having a heart attack.</p><p>She grabbed the bottle of whiskey off the dresser and swallowed two huge mouthfuls before she set it back down.</p><p>That didn\u2019t help. It just increased her feeling of burning up from the inside out.</p><p>Hot. Too hot. On fire. Can\u2019t breathe. Skin is suffocating. Must get out of my clothes so I can get air to my skin...</p><p>Rielle unbuttoned the top two buttons on the sheer white blouse and pulled it over her head, leaving her in a floral patterned camisole and a gauzy skirt that hit below her knee.</p><p>She waited for a sense of relief to settle in.</p><p>Nada.</p><p>I need to take all my clothes off. Nothing constricting my skin.</p><p>When her fingers curled around the bottom band of the cami and she started to pull it up her torso, a hoarse male voice barked, \u201cJesus, Ree. Stop.\u201d</p><p>She froze and glanced at Gavin, still plastered to the door.</p><p>Oh. My. God. In her panicked state of mind she\u2019d started to strip in front of him; she\u2019d forgotten he was even there. What must he think of her? Some crazy woman muttering and ripping off her clothes, sucking down his high-end booze after hijacking his bedroom to have a mental breakdown.</p><p>That\u2019s when she started to hyperventilate for real.</p><p>Spots danced in front of her eyes and she swayed.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Then Gavin was right in her face, holding her upright. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cRielle! Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo. Hot,\u201d came out whisper thin.</p><p>He shook her a little. \u201cGoddammit, what is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed. Air.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her against his side and flung open the French door, dragging her onto the balcony.</p><p>She vaguely heard the door bang and hoped he hadn\u2019t locked it, trapping them out here.</p><p>Gavin stood behind her, his strong hands firm around her upper arms, his mouth against her ear. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>Feeling lightheaded, she started to fall forward.</p><p>He made a grunting noise and placed her hands on the metal railing. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>The metal felt cool on her hands and some of the tension left her body, allowing her to sag against him.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Stay on your feet. Come on, honey. Smell that fresh mountain air? Suck it into your lungs.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and choked on the deep gulp of air.</p><p>\u201cThrough your nose. Nice and slow. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Rielle closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDammit, don\u2019t hold it in. Let it out so you can take more in.\u201d</p><p>Inhale like sipping water through a straw; exhale like you\u2019re blowing in a lover\u2019s ear.</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t know where that advice came from, but she focused on it. Practiced it. Used it. Imagined turning her head and breathing in the scent of Gavin\u2019s skin. Then angling her mouth up to send a stream of air across his ear.</p><p>\u201cJust like that. Good. Keep going. Breathe in slow.\u201d</p><p>Finally, after heaven knew how long, she was breathing almost normally.</p><p>Gavin still had hold of her. But instead of having a firm grip on her biceps, his palms skated up and down her arms, a barely there touch that sent goose bumps cascading over her flesh.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pressed back against him. \u201cMy breathing is better but I\u2019m still hot. I want to stay out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He was a talker, so she expected he\u2019d grill her on why he\u2019d found a near-hysterical woman in his room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he didn\u2019t. He just wordlessly stroked her. Soothed her.</p><p>No man had ever done that for her. Largely because she didn\u2019t allow it. She was self-sufficient with a capital S.</p><p>Rielle remained against his body, her back to his chest. Gavin was solid. Not ridiculously muscle bound, but toned. His expelled breath flowed across her bare shoulder and he kept up those teasing caresses.</p> <p>She tipped her head to look at him, but his eyes were squeezed shut. \u201cGavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you touch me.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers circled her wrists. \u201cSo it calmed you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her heart beat hard for an entirely different reason. \u201cBut it\u2019s also revving me back up.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider her response. \u201cSo what does that mean? Do you want me to keep on touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d His warm lips connected with the ball of her shoulder and he dragged a painstakingly slow kiss up the side of her neck, stopping at the start of her jawline. Then his breath tickled her ear. \u201cWant me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rielle turned her head and nuzzled his cheek. \u201cPlease, keep going.\u201d</p> <p>His deep groan reverberated through her entire body. Then his hands landed on her hips and he slid his palms up her belly and over her rib cage while his lips and tongue tasted the skin at the base of her neck.</p><p>She felt him bump his hips forward, showing her how hard he was. For her. She wiggled her backside and he sucked in a swift breath.</p><p>Gavin pulled the stretchy cami down, exposing her breasts. Then his hands were on her, his thumbs stroking her nipples, his mouth leaving biting kisses down the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>Rielle ground her ass into his erection, her breaths short once again, her skin on fire from where his hot mouth worked her, and that heat arrowed straight between her legs.</p><p>Then he spun her and pushed her against the side of the house, his wet mouth suckling strongly on her nipples, moving back and forth, squeezing her breasts as his tongue licked and laved the tips, and driving her insane with need.</p><p>Clamping her palms on his head, she stopped those deep sucks that made her breasts ache, and tilted his face up to look in his eyes. \u201cGavin. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne step ahead of you.\u201d He fished the condom out of his pocket and held it between his teeth as his fingers worked his belt. The sound of his zipper was loud in the still air. His jeans and boxers hit the pavement. He ripped open the package and rolled the latex down. His hands were on her ass and he panted, \u201cHang tight,\u201d in her ear.</p><p>A little squeak escaped as Gavin picked her up and pressed her back against the siding. Rough-tipped fingers followed the curve of her ass and the backs of her thighs, then the insides of her thighs.</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s mouth was attacking her neck as he maneuvered their lower halves. He bit off, \u201cMove the skirt.\u201d</p><p>Rielle couldn\u2019t think straight, but somehow she yanked the material up around her waist. Immediately something brushed over the crotch of her thong.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>He jerked the tiny scrap of fabric aside and took her mouth in a hungry kiss as he steadily fed his cock inside her and stopped.</p><p>Holy shit that burned. It\u2019d been a long time. She felt Gavin shaking and then all that hardness slipped back out fully and slammed into her again.</p><p>The fabric of her thong was stretched tight across her clit, the edge rubbing perfectly on that hot spot, so by his fifth thrust, she was coming.</p><p>Rielle came in silence as Gavin kissed her crazily. Her fingers digging into the back of his neck was the only outward change, because she\u2019d make damn sure nothing took this moment away from her.</p><p>A few more long, deep thrusts and Gavin\u2019s body stiffened. He broke the kiss abruptly, letting his head fall forward as a long, \u201cFuck,\u201d drifted from his mouth.</p><p>Breathing hard, bodies shaking, they remained locked together. Then he sweetly pressed his lips to her temple.</p><p>If they hadn\u2019t been so still, they might not have heard, \u201cDad? Are you up here?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed to be let down in case Sierra stepped onto the balcony, but Gavin rasped, \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d directly into her ear.</p><p>Loud knocks sounded on the bathroom door and Sierra raised her voice. \u201cDad? People are starting to leave. You need to come say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t move until he heard the bedroom door slam. He carefully lowered Rielle to the ground and eased out of her body.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath at the sudden stab of pain and Gavin finally looked at her. Guiltily.</p><p>He broke eye contact and yanked up his jeans, which he left unzipped and unbuckled because he still had to ditch the condom. \u201cSorry. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d Keeping her head down, she fixed her thong and straightened the layers of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cI... We\u2019ll... Dammit. We\u2019ll talk about this later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Rielle nodded.</p><p>After Gavin left the bathroom, she snuck back into the room and picked up her blouse. She checked herself in the mirror in case she ran into anyone.</p><p>Yeah, try and explain why you\u2019re coming out of Gavin\u2019s room looking like a train wreck.</p><p>That\u2019d feed the McKay gossip coffers for a few weeks.</p><p>Her mouth was a little puffy. Her hair a lot unruly, but besides that she didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d been fucked hard and fast against the wall on her balcony.</p><p>How could the best sex of her life also be the most humiliating?</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cI suck at sex.\u201d</p><p>Ben stiffened at Gavin\u2019s announcement and reined his horse to a stop. \u201cYou wanna explain that?\u201d</p><p>This would be one of the most embarrassing discussions he\u2019d ever had. Now that he\u2019d brought it up, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have. Maybe he\u2019d freaked Ben out.</p><p>The man had been a Dom in a sex club for a decade. Chances are high he\u2019s seen it all and done it all.</p><p>Gavin tried to get his horse to stop but the damn mare just kept moseying along.</p><p>\u201cGavin? Where you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere, but this horse won\u2019t obey.\u201d</p><p>Ben trotted up alongside Duchess and said sharply, \u201cJerk the rein back hard. She\u2019ll think she\u2019s in charge until you prove otherwise. Go on.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the reins much harder than before and Duchess immediately stopped.</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s the first step of mastering her. Get her to do exactly what you want with a combination of firmness and praise.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had a strange feeling Ben wasn\u2019t only talking about horses. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, back to your comment. Did some chick say you were bad in bed or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>When a moment of silence passed, where Gavin couldn\u2019t even look at Ben, Ben sighed. \u201cYou know I\u2019m the last guy who\u2019d pass judgment on anyone. I assume that\u2019s why you wanna talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Come on, Daniels, don\u2019t be a pussy. You\u2019ve been a pussy your whole life, which is why you haven\u2019t gotten any pussy. Own up to all you don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Remember when Dalton staged that intervention after the incident at the club and I said if I ever found my balls again and started dating that I\u2019d come to you for advice? Here I am.\u201d</p><p>Ben gave Gavin a considering look. \u201cI ain\u2019t much help on dating, but sounds like it\u2019s sex advice that you\u2019re after anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And I have to admit, this is so far out of my comfort zone I may as well be on another planet.\u201d He inhaled slowly. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to figure out a way to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want my help, I\u2019m gonna expect you to be completely honest about everything\u2014and I mean everything, Gavin. Good shit, bad shit, the shit that you\u2019ve kept bottled up inside, the shit you don\u2019t think anyone will understand, the embarrassing shit. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Gavin frowned. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf your sexual history,\u201d Ben clarified.</p><p>Seriously? Gavin wanted to ask why that was relevant, but seeing the hard set to Ben\u2019s jaw, he decided to start talking. \u201cThis\u2019ll probably shock a guy like you, but I\u2019ve never been that into sex. I had my horny teen years where I thought about sex twenty-four/seven and jacked off that many times every day. Got my first girlfriend, we had sex a few times but she wasn\u2019t that into it. Of course, at that age I never imagined it could be my lack of experience which caused that reaction in her.\u201d</p><p>Ben chuckled.</p><p>\u201cBy then I\u2019d started college. I focused on academics and when I wasn\u2019t in school, I worked for my dad, learning the real estate business. Prime time for my sex drive, right? Well, I was more interested in spreadsheets than finding a girl who\u2019d spread her legs. After I graduated, I was even more driven to prove myself. I didn\u2019t date, didn\u2019t do anything but work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your family encourage you to find a woman and settle down? God knows the McKays are all about that.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shook his head. \u201cMy dad married later in life, so as far as he was concerned, I was following in his footsteps.\u201d He paused. \u201cThen I met Ellen at a party. This young, gorgeous woman was all over me. It\u2019s fucking pathetic, but I\u2019d never been the guy the women look at and say I wanna get with him because he\u2019s so fucking fine. Ellen\u2019s attentions were beyond flattering; she slept with me the first night we met. Then she kept coming back for more. At that point in my life, having sex with her twice a week felt like I\u2019d hooked up with a nympho. I fell for her hard, not seeing her for the manipulative, psycho bitch she was. After dating six months, she told me she was pregnant. Even then I hadn\u2019t known I\u2019d been set up from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme guess. You did the right thing and married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I thought I\u2019d had it all. A job I loved, a hot wife who loved me and was pregnant with my child.\u201d His hands unconsciously tightened on the reins. \u201cBefore Sierra was even born Ellen demanded we buy a bigger house. I wanted to make my wife happy so I opened my wallet and she proceeded to empty it. Sounds corny, but when Sierra was born my world changed.\u201d Gavin remembered the instant the nurse placed the screaming and pruny-looking thing in his arms. He\u2019d also had a moment of anger, imagining his birth mother just handing over a helpless baby to a stranger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Focus on the here and now.</p><p>\u201cI never doubted that Ellen loved our daughter. But from the time we brought Sierra home from the hospital, I saw Ellen had no desire to learn to be a parent. If she couldn\u2019t deal with Sierra, she hired a babysitter or called my mom and went shopping. Then Ellen started screwing around on me. By the time Sierra was five, I\u2019d had enough of the bullshit and lies and divorced her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how was sex after you got married and after Sierra was born?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin shrugged. \u201cEllen claimed exhaustion a lot, which I forgave because I was tired too, so we were having quick, no-frills sex about once a month. Then it tapered off to once every two months and then the last year, no sex at all.\u201d</p><p>Ben cocked his head. \u201cDid it ever occur to you to cheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Any sexual urges I satisfied with my hand. And it wasn\u2019t like the ladies were propositioning me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t had sex since you were with your ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept with a woman at a weekend conference a few years after the divorce. Then after my mom died, there was a friend I ended up with for a few months, but she stopped calling. Now I look back and I wonder if it was because the sex sucked.\u201d</p> <p>Ben held up his hand. \u201cFirst off, the past is the past. None of that matters. Is there someone specific you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at around here that you wanna impress with your sexpertise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with her? Or you want to get with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been together.\u201d</p><p>That caught Ben by surprise. \u201cHow long\u2019s it been goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Gavin blushed and felt like an idiot for it. \u201cAfter I moved here, things started out slow, us talking and hanging out. Then we found an excuse to touch each other. Then we were making out like crazy whenever we were alone. And the night before last...we had sex. It happened so damn fast. Too fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Rielle complain?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cNo, but she\u2019s been avoiding me, probably because it lasted like a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou afraid she was disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. It was intense and spontaneous. I\u2019ve never acted that aggressive with a woman. I fucked her up against the damn wall. Outside. On the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rielle gave you the go ahead?\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes cut to Ben. \u201cCompletely consensual.\u201d</p> <p>Ben chuckled. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. Women love that shit. You getting her turned on and then fucking her hard and fast right where she stands. I\u2019ll bet Rielle was just shocked because you acted that way and she hasn\u2019t seen you in that role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse. I got put back into the \u2018Dad\u2019 role because Sierra came in right after the spectacularly fast finish.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cSierra caught you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe were on the balcony outside of my room and it was dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Was this the night of the McKay party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s where you were. I gotta say, bro. I\u2019m impressed. Getting some with all the family around.\u201d</p><p>The horses were getting restless. Ben urged his horse into a walk and Duchess followed.</p><p>Gavin tried to focus on the scenery; the crisp air and the shadows skittering across the ground as clouds clustered and broke apart overhead. Rielle would be outside, doing ten thousand things at once. \u201cThanks for bringing me out here, Ben. This is gorgeous country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you explored much of the land you bought from Rielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ree says the terrain is rugged and I needed a horse on the unbroken trails rather than an ATV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point. But I\u2019ll also remind you it\u2019s your land. The Wetzlers were always weird about letting people onto that section. It\u2019s yours now. You can do whatever the fuck you want with it. If you wanna clear all the damn trees and make a trail for four-wheelers, do it. If you\u2019re nervous about setting off alone, just call me. I\u2019d be happy for the chance to get a look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think on it and let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Let\u2019s head back.\u201d</p><p>They turned the horses around.</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019re waiting for my advice,\u201d Ben said after a bit.</p><p>\u201cDo you have some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Fake it \u2019til you make it. Next time you\u2019re with Rielle...act like you\u2019ve got the hot sex moves and she\u2019ll believe you\u2019ve got them. You will too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019ll work?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt already did once, didn\u2019t it? You have the woman so flustered about you going all caveman on her ass that she\u2019s hiding from you. That ain\u2019t the Rielle I know, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d Maybe. Hopefully. Fuck. How was he supposed to know?</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very convincing.\u201d Ben pushed up his hat a notch. \u201cTell me what your other option is?\u201d</p><p>Gavin blinked.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, please don\u2019t tell me you planned to confess your lack of sexual experience, hoping she\u2019d understand and you could discuss what to do about it.\u201d When Gavin didn\u2019t respond, but must\u2019ve looked guilty, Ben said, \u201cJesus, I can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe you were actually considering that! Screw that. You need to fuck it out, not talk it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t talk to her at all?\u201d Gavin said skeptically.</p><p>Ben muttered something. Then he sighed. \u201cTalking is important, especially in the type of sexual activities I prefer. But in your case? Save the talking for after. First, act like you\u2019re gonna rock her world in bed and then follow through with it. Besides, it\u2019s not like women come with an instruction manual.\u201d</p><p>No way could Gavin confess he\u2019d bought the book Amazing Sex for Dummies. And How To Go Down On A Woman. And Sex Secrets from Porn Stars. And Making Love 101. Ben would laugh his ass off.</p><p>\u201cCome on, bro, you\u2019ve got a guilty damn look on your face. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived my life by honesty is the best policy, Ben. This feels dishonest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re lyin\u2019 to her.\u201d He brooded for a moment. \u201cLemme ask you this; how do you feel when you see Rielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike stripping her bare and taking her right that second. Christ. All she has to do is walk past me and I\u2019m hard. I think about her constantly. Fantasize about all the things I wanna do to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake those thoughts reality. Let your lust for her be your guide. Women want spontaneity. They want the sole focus to be what the two of you are doin\u2019 to each other right at that moment. The rest is just mechanics.\u201d He held up a gloved hand. \u201cWith the exception of BDSM. That takes some skill if you wanna go that direction. Even if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s fun to dabble.\u201d</p><p>Dabble in tying Rielle up and spanking her ass? Yeah, that might be out of her comfort zone. Or...out of his.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for inspiration or ideas or whatever, watch porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just see Sierra walking in when I\u2019m taking notes on different positions.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAm I just kidding myself that this will work even if I do figure out how to rock Rielle\u2019s world? Do I smuggle Rielle into my room? Or sneak into hers? And doesn\u2019t it make me a hypocrite to tell Sierra to wait to have sex when I plan to fuck Rielle nine ways \u2019til Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it makes me a dick, but I\u2019ll point out that you deserve to have an adult relationship. You\u2019re forty-three. Sierra is sixteen. Different expectations, bud. Should Sierra find you and Rielle fucking on the countertop? Nope. Does that mean you and Rielle shouldn\u2019t fuck on the countertop? Nope. It\u2019s all about timing. Including when you and Rielle decide to tell Sierra that the two of you are romantically involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be another first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect it\u2019d be a first for Ree too. But if you\u2019re intimate with her, at least give her the courtesy of owning up to it. Don\u2019t treat her or what the two of you are doin\u2019 behind closed doors as a dirty secret.\u201d</p><p>Gavin considered that and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks. I really appreciate your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted his seat on the saddle and his ornery horse decided to take advantage of the slack in the reins. Gavin pulled Duchess to a stop with a firm tug and a sharp warning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Ben encouraged. \u201cIf she gets it in her head to lead, you show her who\u2019s boss right quick.\u201d</p><p>Again, Gavin understood his brother wasn\u2019t just referring to horses.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Needing fortification, courage, balls\u2014whatever, Rielle tossed back half the lemon-drop martini. \u201cI need some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not medical advice, because Doctor Monroe is not in tonight,\u201d Joely said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal. And slightly embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassing? Interesting.\u201d Joely sipped from her martini glass, shrewd eyes focused completely on Rielle. \u201cSpill it.\u201d</p><p>She blurted out, \u201cI had sex with Gavin Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend, are you serious?\u201d Joely grinned and lifted her glass for a toast. \u201cThat is awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t awesome? Explain that. In detail.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed. \u201cLong story short. Thursday night Gavin had a party for the McKays. I freaked out and hid in my former bedroom. Gavin found me and tried to calm me down. So we\u2019re out on the balcony and he\u2019s touching me and the next thing I know, he hoisted me against the wall and fucked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is bad...how?\u201d</p><p>Rielle angled across the table. \u201cIt was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you? Or him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor both of us. I had an orgasm within about fifteen seconds and I was so embarrassed about it I didn\u2019t make a sound. Then afterward, I realized I hadn\u2019t touched him at all. I just set my hands on his shoulders and let him fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets, I gotta ask this. Did Gavin notice you didn\u2019t participate very much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. We haven\u2019t seen each other since. And we live together so I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s avoiding me because I proved to be a lousy lay.\u201d She finished her martini and slid the empty to the edge of the table. \u201cOr worse, he immediately figured out how little sexual experience I\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>Joely held up her hand. \u201cHold on. Back up. Tell me how it played out from the time Gavin found you in his bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>As Rielle relayed the events, she remembered how awesome that buzz of sexual anticipation felt. How much she liked having Gavin\u2019s hands on her. His mouth on her. And how wet he\u2019d made her in such a short amount of time. She sent Joely a panicked look.</p><p>But Joely was deep in thought. Then she smiled. \u201cOkay. Let me put on my stethoscope for a bit. Hot, spontaneous sex isn\u2019t the norm for you. Let\u2019s talk about your sexual history.\u201d</p><p>God. No. This was exactly what Rielle was trying to avoid.</p><p>Wrong. This is exactly what you need.</p><p>Joely squeezed her hand. \u201cHey. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m thankful for our friendship, Ree, and I\u2019d be the last person to pass judgment on you. I want to help, \u2019cause, sugar, I think you need it.\u201d</p> <p>She blew out a slow breath. \u201cSexual history. Right. I got pregnant at sixteen the first time I had sex. The guy...\u201d Rielle closed her eyes. She couldn\u2019t even remember what he looked like. That guilt ate at her, this disconnect with the man who was the father of her child.</p><p>Cool fingers wrapped her fingers around the stem of a martini glass. \u201cDrink this. It\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Rielle opened her eyes and smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. We can get hammered tonight because I have designated drivers on call.\u201d</p><p>Not the first time Joely had mentioned that. After a minute, Rielle said, \u201cYou know I was raised by hippie parents with the live-off-the-land, make-our-own-way, screw-the-man attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds familiar. Wouldn\u2019t it be hysterical if your hippie parents knew my hippie parents? Or had spent time in the same peace, free-love and no nukes commune?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a total trip, man.\u201d</p><p>Joely laughed. \u201cKeep going. We\u2019ll compare notes later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur doors were open for anyone who would work for food and shelter\u2014very much a commune-like vibe.\u201d She allowed a small smirk. \u201cRumors flew that my folks grew pot on their funky little piece of land in McKay country. Untrue. They\u2019d grown it in California, and surprisingly, they had a profitable business. My mother, the smarter of my parents because she hadn\u2019t smoked all the profits and the product, sold their operation. We moved here when I was eight. They didn\u2019t believe in formal education so I was home schooled. None of the transients who crashed with us had kids, so I grew up isolated, from kids my own age and society in general.\u201d Feeling like a freak, she looked at Joely. \u201cWas it like that for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I lived in a commune where all kids were raised by the community. We called everyone mother and father. I had thirty siblings. We were dressed the same. We didn\u2019t even sleep in the same bed every night, lest we get attached to material objects. I had nothing of my own; everything was shared. But they did at least educate us, which allowed me to get the hell out.\u201d Sadness passed through her eyes. \u201cBut enough about that. This is about you. Keep talking.\u201d</p><p>Rielle hoped someday Joely would fill in the blanks of her life before she became Doctor Monroe. \u201cGiven that history you can imagine how a sixteen-year-old-girl, starved for attention, and just discovering sexuality, would react when an older guy started paying attention to me. Talking to me. Listening to me. Touching me. I craved that touch because my parents were unaffectionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith each other too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They had an open relationship. I remember seeing Mom sleeping on the couch when Dad was in their bedroom with someone else. Same with my dad sleeping on the couch when Mom was having a meeting with some dude in their bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it was equal opportunity \u2018meetings\u2019 for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d have picked up the basics on sex, but I was so damn na\u00efve. When \u2018John\u2019\u2014\u201d she made air quotes, \u201c\u2014kissed me and touched me and told me it was okay, it was natural, I believed him. But the night he came into my room and took my virginity? There wasn\u2019t sweet words or kisses or anything but the smell of pot smoke clinging to his clothes as he crawled on top of me.\u201d Rielle felt Joely\u2019s piercing stare, but she needed to get through this part to get to the heart of the matter. \u201cI ended up pregnant. I had no idea I was pregnant until about the fifth month and I kept feeling all this stuff going on inside me and I\u2019d put on weight. My mother figured it out. Four months later I gave birth to Rory, at home, with some whacked-out midwife and my mother in attendance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sugar,\u201d Joely said. \u201cYou were just a baby yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I loved my baby so much. She was perfect and all mine. I didn\u2019t have sex again until the night of my twenty-first birthday. I ended up doing it with some sweet-talkin\u2019 cowboy in his pickup. I went home with him afterward and we had sex again. I tried oral. Received oral. But it wasn\u2019t great. I thought there was something wrong with me and decided sex wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. Plus I had that whole \u2018young, single mother\u2019 stigma and I didn\u2019t want to have a reputation that Rory would have to deal with. The two other times I\u2019ve been attracted to a guy and we ended up having sex, it\u2019s always been a disappointment. So, like I said. I\u2019ve always figured it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a disappointment with Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in how I reacted. I was shocked because I\u2019ve never had an orgasm with a man during sex. During oral? Yes. I can get off by my own hand, so I know I\u2019m not incapable. I\u2019m just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInexperienced,\u201d Joely finished.</p><p>\u201cAt age forty. Gee, wouldn\u2019t you wanna get all up in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally would, if I didn\u2019t have a serious love of cock.\u201d</p><p>Rielle choked on her drink.</p><p>Joely grinned. \u201cI love shocking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. So, tell me, Doctor Love, what should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, do you want a sexual relationship with Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m writing you a script for birth control pills.\u201d She pulled a pad out of her purse, filled it out and passed it over. \u201cGet that filled tomorrow, you hear me? Use alternative birth control methods for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Doctor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think your inexperience will scare him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it already has. How do I convince him to give me another try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides getting on your knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely!\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat would work, trust me. But in all seriousness, come on to him. Tell him he made you come so hard that night you were speechless. Tell him you can\u2019t stop thinking about him. Tell him you want him. Then prove it. Seduce the fuck outta him.\u201d</p><p>Rielle considered that advice and polished off another martini. She had a decent buzz going. \u201cHow many of these have we had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. Each. And now that one is empty.\u201d She signaled to the cocktail waitress for another round.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardcore tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. Besides, you wouldn\u2019t have the guts to talk to me without a little liquid courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Now I\u2019m mulling over your advice and it\u2019s your turn to confess how Joely gets her jollies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious. Like you, I can only admit what I really want when I\u2019ve put away several of these babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna explain that?\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand through her short red hair. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it to myself. It\u2019s so fucked up. Every time I swear I\u2019ll never do it again...I do.\u201d She scowled over her shoulder. \u201cWhere the hell is my damn drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d When she had Joely\u2019s attention, she said, \u201cThis road runs both ways, girlfriend. I\u2019m as good at keeping confidences as you are. Any time you\u2019re ready to spill, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Ree, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d rather help other people than yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The cocktail waitress dropped off the martinis.</p><p>Joely plucked hers up. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m helping myself to another drink. Cheers.\u201d</p><p>Rielle knew the subject was closed. So they switched gears, talking about cooking and yarn, since Joely was an avid knitter. Then out of the blue, Joely said, \u201cSo what are you going to do about Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking your suggestion to seduce the fuck outta him.\u201d</p><p>Joely raised an eyebrow and grinned. \u201cGood. \u2019Cause sugar, he just walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>The Golden Boot was packed on a Saturday night. Gavin wasn\u2019t much into the bar scene, but sitting home by himself was borderline pathetic. He\u2019d headed to the closest honky-tonk to soak up some atmosphere after Ben and Tell both had mentioned a good local band played some weekends. But with the dark stage it didn\u2019t appear to be this weekend.</p><p>He found a spot at the bar and ordered a whiskey, neat. He felt a little out of place wearing jeans, a wool sweater and loafers amidst all the cowboy hats and boots, but no one glared at him like it was a hanging offense.</p><p>After ten minutes or so, the guy on his left struck up a conversation. He\u2019d just settled in when the guy\u2019s eyes locked on someone behind Gavin. He turned and his heart rate spiked at seeing Rielle. For the first time in two goddamned days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She offered him a little finger wave.</p><p>His new buddy from the bar gave him a huge grin and took off.</p><p>Rielle moved in. Right in. Slid her palms up his chest and snuggled her body into his. She tipped her head back and smiled at him. \u201cHey, roomie.\u201d</p><p>She looked so good and her sexy little body felt so good against his that he bent down and touched his lips to hers. She tasted like lemons and smelled like heaven. \u201cHey, yourself. Fancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely picked me up for a few cocktails. I was about to order coffee to sober up before the ride home. Then I saw you and thought I\u2019d ask if you wanna give me a ride?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to ride you like you wouldn\u2019t believe.</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t want to tear you away from anything...pressing.\u201d Keeping her eyes on his, she pressed her pelvis into his, adding a tiny grind of her hips.</p><p>Gavin instantly went hard.</p><p>But Rielle wasn\u2019t done. She dug her fingers into the back of his neck and pulled him closer to whisper in his ear. \u201cAre you avoiding me after the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you were since I might\u2019ve come across a teensy bit of a lousy lay.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cWhat? God no, Ree, I\u2019m the one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the secret I tried to keep from you. Why I might\u2019ve seemed so motionless and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me come so hard, so fast that I forgot how to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Gavin curled his hands on the side of her face and tilted her head back. \u201cHow much have you had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to give me the courage to talk to you but not enough to make me forget what I want to say,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to say to me, Rielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more of you. More of us. But naked this time. I wanna feel your hands on me. I wanna feel your mouth on me. God, Gavin, I\u2019m dying to feel every inch of your body rubbing on mine. Like at least four times tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Right. Now.\u201d Gavin didn\u2019t even finish his drink. He grabbed her hand and towed her out of the bar. He didn\u2019t stop moving until he reached his car.</p> <p>Then he pressed her against the passenger\u2019s side door and slammed his mouth down on hers. Taking the kiss that he\u2019d wanted for two damn days. Pouring passion into it. Licking and sucking and biting at her succulent mouth, then easing off. Stroking her tongue with his. Pulling back a fraction of an inch, feeling her stuttered breaths as he teased her with a soft, barely-there glide of his lips. \u201cRee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop kissing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you all you want, just not here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sierra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs staying over at Marin\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smiled. \u201cSo we have the house to ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night.\u201d He dropped another kiss on her mouth. \u201cGet in the fucking car before I throw you on the hood and fuck you right now and prove to you that you\u2019re nowhere close to a bad lay.\u201d</p><p>Rielle got in the car.</p><p>Gavin was giving himself a stern talk about being a man and lasting longer than one goddamn minute this time, when Rielle grabbed his right hand and shoved it between her legs. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me off. Please.\u201d She rubbed the side of her face on his arm and squeezed her thighs together. \u201cI\u2019m wet. Just from that damn kiss. Stick your hand in and see for yourself what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>His first thought was to tell her to keep her pants on; it\u2019d wait until they got home. His second thought was, what the fuck was wrong with him? Rielle was begging him to touch her. No woman had ever begged him.</p><p>That was fucking hot.</p><p>He briefly took his focus off the road. \u201cTake your jeans off.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Then she released a little moan and unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans. She shimmied the denim down her legs, revealing a tiny pair of pink panties. So unexpectedly girly. So unbelievably sexy.</p><p>When Gavin glanced up, he saw he\u2019d drifted clear into the other lane. This was too damn dangerous. He pulled onto the shoulder and cut the headlights. The lights from the instrument panel cast a golden glow over her half-naked body.</p><p>\u201cGavin?\u201d</p><p>He unbuckled and leaned over to run his fingertip over the lace band stretching between her hips. \u201cI want to see you. All of you. Off. Now.\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>This being in charge was heady stuff. \u201cLower the seat. Top button on the side. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth were digging into her lower lip; those beautiful pale eyes didn\u2019t venture from his face.</p><p>Gavin caught her scent; sweet honey. Like her hair, like her skin, like her mouth. He ran his index finger up and down her slit. \u201cYou are wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cOr...\u201d He swirled just the tip of his finger over her clit, backing off when her hips bucked up. \u201cMaybe I should make you get yourself off and I should watch.\u201d</p><p>He could almost feel the heat from the way her body flushed. So she had no problem being naked from the waist down, but masturbation made her tense. Gavin didn\u2019t blame her. Had the situation been reversed, his face would be cherry red if she demanded he whip out his cock and stroke it until he came.</p><p>\u201cOr...I could get you off with my mouth.\u201d He brushed his lips over hers after he heard her swift intake of breath. \u201cPut one foot on the door and one foot on the console. Spread your legs as wide as you can. That\u2019s good. Now slide up. That\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her ass was a little more than halfway up the back of the seat, which put her pussy within range. He leaned across the console, biting back a wince at the painful position of his cock. He breathed her in. Flicked her clit with his tongue. Just one time.</p><p>Rielle moaned.</p><p>Then he gave her one thorough lick, getting his first complete taste of her. Goddamn, she tasted so fucking sweet. He could suck up her cream all night. He worked her with his tongue, lips and teeth. Losing his mind in the fact that he was going down on Rielle, in his Lexus, on the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>He traced her hot folds with his tongue, top to bottom. He drew lazy circles, broad circles, stilling her hips with a firm push of his hands when she tried to grind upward.</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm?\u201d he answered, the sound vibrating against her blood-engorged tissues.</p><p>Her whole body quivered. \u201cPlease. I can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>He heard the words, \u201cHold on,\u201d rumble from his mouth in an animal-like growl. He grabbed her left ankle and swung her body around, almost clipping himself in the head with her heel as he wrapped her leg around the back of his seat. Slipping his hands under her butt, he pulled her closer and buried his mouth in her juicy sex.</p><p>She gasped when he wiggled his tongue inside her opening. After a few fast flicks over her clit, Gavin enclosed that swollen flesh between his lips and sucked hard.</p><p>Rielle exploded. She clamped her hands over his ears and wrapped her right leg around his shoulder, holding him in place while she came in violent waves against his mouth.</p><p>Gavin watched pleasure overtake her. It was one of the hottest experiences of his life.</p><p>When she finally went limp, he released his hold. He nipped the inside of her thigh, earning a sharp, surprised yip from her. Although his cock was smashed against his belly and constricted by his jeans, he took a second to burn the image into his brain. Beautiful, sated woman sprawled in front of him, bared to him fully, breathing hard and peering at him from beneath lowered lashes. He unhooked her leg from his seat, kissed the outside of her ankle and swiveled her around to face forward.</p><p>He did the same. Then he smiled at her as she just sat there, unmoving, sort of stunned. \u201cYou getting dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Although, I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t be wearing these clothes long when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a sure bet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Gavin kept hold of Rielle\u2019s hand on the drive home. Stroking his thumb on the inside of her wrist. Moving his palm up and down to rub the tips of his fingers between the webbing of hers. Then he brought her knuckles to his mouth. Kissing and nipping, drawing the backside of her hand across his goatee.</p><p>Rielle broke their handhold and twisted in her seat, rising on her knees. Leaning over the console, she placed her lips on his ear and said, \u201cYou always smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you keep that up I\u2019ll wreck the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019d wreck if I put my hand on your crotch. You can handle this, Gavin.\u201d She rubbed the side of her face over his. Her mouth would randomly connect with his cheek, the spot below his earlobe, the shell of his ear, his temple, above his eyebrow.</p><p>The sweet nuzzles and soft kisses fired his blood. It was damn hard not to close his eyes and just enjoy her attention.</p><p>Finally the turnoff was within view. \u201cRielle, honey, sit. I don\u2019t want you to go flying when I take the corner on two wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a hurry?\u201d she purred in his ear.</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and the soft, seductive sound burned a path through his ear canal straight to his dick. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Gavin parked in his usual spot. They both scrambled out and met in front of the car. His mouth crashed down, her arms circled his neck and he was lost to the kiss. He\u2019d thought passionate soul kissing was for teens and youngsters, so clearly he\u2019d never experienced that overpowering rush of need to have her lips on his. To feel her tongue stroking and sucking, mouths open to give and receive.</p><p>He\u2019d intended to clamp his hands on her ass and drag her closer to his body, but instead, he slipped his arm behind her knees and cradled her against his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle gasped. \u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>He started up the steps, but kept his heated gaze on her face. \u201cMight be over the top to carry you up the stairs to my bed. But I owe you a little romance for the way I fucked up our first time. So indulge me.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful green eyes softened and she brushed a kiss on his neck.</p><p>He opened the front door and cut down the hallway to the staircase. Sustaining a kiss was difficult as he scaled the stairs, so he filled his lungs with her honeysuckle scent. Tightening his hold on her until he had her in his bedroom.</p><p>She laughed when he kicked the door shut.</p><p>Gavin set her on her feet at the end of his bed. Then he indulged in a long, deep, slow kiss and by the time they broke apart, they were both breathing hard and he saw the pulse point in her neck pounding as rapidly as his heart.</p><p>\u201cStay right here for a second.\u201d He locked the door, turned on the lamps for ambient lighting and rolled the comforter to the foot of the bed.</p><p>She watched as he took four condoms out of the package and set the strip on the nightstand.</p><p>Then he was standing in front of her again. Gavin couldn\u2019t think of any pretty words as his fingers started with the top button of her blouse. Her gaze remained on his face but he didn\u2019t look into her eyes until her shirt hung open. He kissed her and pushed the soft fabric off and it fluttered to the floor.</p><p>He was used to seeing her in a camisole or tank top, so the lacy bra that matched her sexy underwear was a bonus. His finger traced the plumped curve from the top of her bra down to the deep valley of her cleavage, and back up the other side. He planted a kiss on her right breast.</p><p>A shiver worked through her.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cTake off your jeans, Rielle,\u201d as he nuzzled the abundant flesh.</p><p>She peeled them away.</p><p>\u201cNow your bra.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed and she tipped her head forward as her hands circled around to jerk on the clasp. Once the straps and cups loosened, he put his fingers under her chin and looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI got this part.\u201d</p><p>Rielle smiled shyly.</p><p>Gavin hooked his fingers inside the bra cups and pulled. The straps slid down her arms and the bra dropped to the floor. Her breasts were full, round, with dark rose-colored nipples. Just for a second, he forgot to breathe. \u201cGod. You\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d Then his hands squeezed as he buried his face in all that perfect white flesh.</p><p>She arched into him, her hand at the back of his head.</p><p>He dragged his mouth from side to side, teasing her. Rubbing the rim of his lip across the tight peaks.</p><p>A soft moan drifted from her.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s lips blazed a path up her throat to her mouth. He played with her breasts, squeezing and rubbing as he kissed her. She was so sweet and hot.</p> <p>Rielle rolled her hips, grinding into his erection. She moved her lips to his ear. \u201cYou still have your clothes on. I wanna feel your skin against mine, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>The former chubby guy part of him balked at the idea of getting naked with her, afraid she\u2019d be judging him.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t have started this if you have no intention of finishing it.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d finish it all right\u2014a spectacular fucking finish this time.</p><p>\u201cI want that too.\u201d His hands followed the contours of her breasts down to her hips. He squeezed once. \u201cHop up on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut.\u201d Indecision warred on her face before she boldly reached for his belt buckle. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me to undress you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She backed up and sat on the end of the bed.</p><p>Gavin kicked off his loafers, pulled his sweater and T-shirt over his head. Unbuckled, unzipped, he tugged his jeans down and ditched his socks. Wearing only his boxers, he moved toward her.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s eyes flicked over his body, zeroing in on his crotch. \u201cNaked, means naked.\u201d She gestured to his underwear. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still wearing underwear,\u201d he pointed out, stalking her.</p><p>She crab crawled to the center of his bed. \u201cI\u2019ll take mine off, if you will. But you\u2019ve gotta go first.\u201d</p><p>Right then Gavin wished he was packing a solid ten inches. But he was also just damn glad he could get a hard-on without the help of Viagra. He slipped his fingers beneath the waistband and dropped his boxers.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just weird to think that\u2019s been inside me and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin hadn\u2019t ever been the type to tease in the bedroom, so he wasn\u2019t sure what possessed him to grin and fist his cock, stroking it slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s more than ready to get reacquainted. Just as soon as you lose the panties.\u201d</p><p>She stripped and threw them over the end of the bed.</p><p>He walked to the nightstand, tore off a package and ripped it open, watching her eyes as he rolled it on. Then he climbed onto the bed and pushed her thighs apart, making room for himself.</p><p>Rielle laid flat on the mattress, as if expecting him to mount her right now.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she think that? You\u2019re wearing a condom.</p><p>Only so he didn\u2019t have to fumble with the damn thing at the moment of truth.</p><p>Gavin kissed the blond hair at the top of her mound. Her belly button. Her sternum. Then those perfect breasts were in his face again. He sucked on her right nipple. Played with the rigid point with his teeth and tongue. Making her squirm. He switched to the other side, worshipping her breasts as they deserved.</p><p>Her nails were digging into the back of his neck and she lifted her pelvis, trying to connect with something solid.</p><p>He looked up, seeing her face flushed and her breathing ragged. \u201cRee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. I\u2019m about to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust from me sucking on your nipples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019ve always been sensitive. And what you\u2019re doing...is really, really doing it for me, so don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He latched on with renewed vigor and she almost shot straight off the mattress. He pinched her other nipple hard, then palmed her pussy, while strongly suckling the taut peak.</p><p>Rielle cried out, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Gavin could feel the pulsing beneath his sucking lips and beneath his palm. He watched her face as she climaxed\u2014she was something lost in pleasure. Softer somehow. He wanted her so bad his balls ached.</p><p>As soon as she relaxed, he aligned his cock and propped himself above her.</p><p>She opened her eyes and rose up to kiss him, her hands sliding down to grip his ass, letting him know she was in the moment.</p><p>He eased in slowly, kissing her softly until they were fully joined. Staying right there, her pussy hot and wet and tight around his shaft.</p><p>Then he moved on her, in her, keeping a steady rhythm that allowed him to sustain the kiss.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s legs were splayed wide and her chest rose to meet his every rolling thrust. The cushion of her breasts rubbed against the thatch of hair on his chest.</p><p>Gradually he pushed into that channel a little harder. A little faster. His heart rate kicked up and sweat beaded on his brow.</p><p>Her lips slid free and she kissed his chin, the side of his neck, his Adam\u2019s apple, the hollow of his throat. She clamped both hands on his butt.</p><p>Fuck. This was so good. And with her biting his neck like that and blowing in his ear, he was already riding that edge. So he slowed to a stop and pressed his lips into her hair.</p><p>Rielle tipped his head to meet her gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s perfect. Being with you, is amazing. I just want to take my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that on my account, Gavin.\u201d She whispered a kiss across his lips. \u201cMove faster, harder, whatever you want. I\u2019m right here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin ramped up the pace. Rising into a pushup position to drive into her tight cunt harder. Faster.</p><p>She clung to him, frantically kissing his neck, undulating and arching beneath him with every snap of his hips.</p><p>Then he had that short warning tingle down his spine. He switched to short, quick jabs.</p><p>He groaned when his balls pulled up. His head fell back as his dick spasmed; each hot pulse shook him with a full body shudder. His hands curled into the sheet and he groaned again, longer, louder as the climax reached the apex. White and black spots danced behind his eyelids and a dull roar filled his head.</p><p>Yeah, that made up for the quickie on the balcony.</p><p>He looked down at her.</p><p>No smile. A somber face.</p><p>\u201cRee? Honey, what is it?\u201d Had he hurt her somehow?</p><p>She lifted up to kiss him fiercely.</p><p>Gavin nuzzled her ear. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>His stomach dropped.</p><p>Then she buried her face in his neck and he realized she was crying.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Embarrassed, Rielle tried to roll away from Gavin\u2014wishing she could crawl under the bed\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t allow it. He tucked her against his body, acting as if it were perfectly natural for a woman basking in the glow of two outstanding orgasms to be teary-eyed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t push her to talk; he just held her.</p><p>Once she regained control, she got brave enough to lift her head. \u201cThank you. That was the best sex I\u2019ve ever had. Well, except for the other night out on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why the tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I feel like a freak.\u201d She expected he\u2019d force her to look at him after that statement, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life as a single mother, Gavin. I don\u2019t have the sexual history most women do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you think that\u2019d be a problem for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s always been a problem for me,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Then he did tip her chin up to study her face.</p><p>\u201cThe tears caught me by surprise. I\u2019m so not a crier. But being with you...I got this rush of happiness, followed immediately by fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve talked about this before. But the instant I put my hands on you, I lose any coherent train of thought.\u201d Gavin\u2019s fingers traced the line of her spine and he smoothed his palm over her buttocks. \u201cSee? I already forgot what we were talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe being practically a forty-year-old virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. No more thinking you\u2019re a freak. You\u2019re perfect, Ree. And I\u2019m not exactly such a...\u201d He snapped his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly such a what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Gavin got up and ditched the condom. Then he took her in his arms again. \u201cThis is a clean slate for both of us. Nothing we did or didn\u2019t do before matters.\u201d His eyes glowed with pure male intent. \u201cSo if there\u2019s a position you\u2019re dying to try, or some fantasy you have, feel free to share and we\u2019ll act it out in explicit detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis feels like a fantasy, lying in bed with you after we had awesome sex.\u201d She fought a blush at confessing, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of quite a few things I\u2019d like to try with you.\u201d She brushed her mouth over the smooth section of flesh above his nipple. \u201cAnd you promised me four times tonight, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted me to fuck you four times. I never agreed because I don\u2019t promise what I can\u2019t deliver.\u201d</p><p>She loved it when the smooth businessman veneer slipped, revealing his raw masculinity. \u201cI like it when you say crude sex things.\u201d</p><p>Gavin flashed his teeth. \u201cSo noted.\u201d</p> <p>Rielle rolled and straddled his groin, sitting on top of him. She placed her hands by his head, leaning over him. \u201cKnow what else I like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s giving blowjobs.\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do that enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Give blowjobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, smartass. Laugh. I love to hear you laugh.\u201d He dragged his finger from the tip of her chin down between her cleavage.</p> <p>\u201cI laugh more with you than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso good to know.\u201d Gavin traced a circle around her nipple until it drew into a rigid point. \u201cNow you were about to tell me something else you liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing you. I get a little dizzy when you kiss me. I feel like a teenager saying that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and kissed her. After he thoroughly ravished her mouth, he murmured, \u201cDizzy yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. And hard. Grab a condom.\u201d</p><p>Rielle tore the package open, taking time to enjoy his every hiss and moan as she touched him.</p><p>\u201cPush back and lift up over me. I want to watch your pussy swallowing my cock.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as every inch of that hard shaft filled her, he reached for her. \u201cRide me hard. I want to see your tits bouncing. Oh yeah, just like that. Fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Who knew she liked a bossy, dirty-mouthed man in bed?</p><p>Rielle\u2019s internal alarm clock woke her up even on the weekends.</p><p>So...what to do, lying in the arms of a naked man, in the early morning hours?</p><p>Be bold like you were last night, putting his hand between your thighs in the car. Seduce him.</p><p>But what if he was one of those cranky morning guys? Grumbling about being woken up and thrashing away from her?</p><p>She\u2019d be better off surprising him with breakfast. Rielle pressed her butt into his groin and arched her spine away from his chest, expecting he\u2019d release her and turn over.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s throaty, \u201cMmm,\u201d rumbled in her ear, sending a shiver down her spine. \u201cYou going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it like five in the morning or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. Then he pressed a hot kiss on the side of her neck. \u201cSo if I let you up, what are you going to do? Wash windows? Knit socks for every needy kid in Crook County? Bake muffins for the rest home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ambitious enough for you?\u201d he murmured against her throat.</p><p>\u201cFunny. I\u2019m not always working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. You\u2019re always slaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are one of those busy worker bees in your hive. Mind focused on finishing one task so you can fly to the next one before your buzz wears off.\u201d</p><p>Did he think she was incapable of kicking back? \u201cThat\u2019s not all I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo prove it.\u201d His mouth teased her ear. \u201cLet\u2019s play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneypot.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cReally, Gavin? Honeypot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. This morning you are the queen bee and I\u2019m your drone, servicing your every need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that immediately after a drone mates with the queen bee midair his penis is snapped off and he plummets to his death?\u201d</p><p>Gavin went motionless. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. That is just plain nasty.\u201d</p><p>If Rielle hadn\u2019t felt both his hands on her body she\u2019d swear he was cupping his junk.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of nasty...how about if I do naughty things and make you forget everything except my hands and mouth?\u201d</p><p>Another shiver tightened her skin, but she managed a droll, \u201cWell, you can try...but my to-do list is pretty extensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ll be composing a to-do list while I\u2019m doing this?\u201d Gavin sank his teeth into her nape and pinched her nipples. \u201cOr how about this?\u201d Rielle gasped when he pulled her outer leg over his hip and stroked her slit.</p><p>His chest was hot against her back. His mouth was everywhere; on her neck, her shoulder, her ear. Then his fingers were inside her, stroking her. He murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re wet. I like that you\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>Rielle arched into him. \u201cYou\u2019re hard. I like that you\u2019re hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought.\u201d Gavin eased his fingers out and she heard the crinkling of a condom wrapper. He hooked his arm behind her knee, lifting it for better access to her pussy. The head of his cock circled the mouth to her sex and he slowly pushed his shaft inside. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d In this position she felt a deeper penetration. She felt stuffed full.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His tongue traced the shell of her ear. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling sweet and romantic right now, Ree.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of want, of anticipation, rolled through her and he felt it.</p><p>\u201cYou like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a naughty little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Gavin shifted his upper body and then his hand was tightly, almost painfully, gripping her short hair.</p><p>Rielle gasped softly. Wow. That was sexy hot, how he just held her head where he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. I don\u2019t have enough hands.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d He sucked on the skin behind her ear. \u201cI want to look down your body and see your fingers moving as I\u2019m fucking you.\u201d</p><p>She slid her right hand down her belly, following the rise of her mound to her clit. As soon as she started to stroke, so did he.</p><p>Sweetness became body-pounding passion as he thrust into her so hard the bed jiggled. His mouth found all her hot spots on her neck and shoulder and nape\u2014he zeroed in on the one that caused her to moan and try to twist away but he held her in place.</p><p>The combination of his deep, hard thrusts and the constant pressure of her fingers on her clit sent her headlong into orgasm. A throbbing, pulsing, blinding surge of pleasure.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s cock hammered into her and then he growled in her ear as his release followed on the heels of hers.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t opened her eyes or leveled her breathing when he whispered, \u201cSo...how\u2019s that to-do list coming?\u201d</p><p>Rielle and Gavin made breakfast together\u2014unlike other times they\u2019d cooked together. He continually touched her. Nuzzled her. Kissed her. By the time the bacon was finished, his sweet eroticism had her so worked up she would\u2019ve let him take her right on the counter. A shocking scene for Sierra to stumble upon on a Sunday morning.</p><p>Which was a pointed reminder she and Gavin needed to talk.</p><p>He rinsed the plates and refilled their coffee. \u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind, Ree?\u201d</p><p>Damn perceptive man. \u201cI\u2019m new at this morning-after stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You avoided me Friday and Saturday morning after our Thursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that, huh?\u201d</p><p>Gavin leaned forward, sliding his knee between hers and placing her left hand between his. \u201cThis conversation is about the start of something between us, not the end, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She sipped her coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s deal with the elephant in the room first thing. Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of me thinks that my sweet, but self-absorbed teen won\u2019t notice the change in our relationship. The other part of me thinks she\u2019s already sensed the shift in the last few weeks. Not that she\u2019s said anything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer suspecting we\u2019re involved and her seeing us groping each other on the couch...two different things.\u201d</p><p>He nipped the tips of her fingers. \u201cWill you let me grope you on the couch now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But my point is I\u2019d prefer to keep this between us for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You think it\u2019ll burn out?\u201d</p><p>Rielle set her hand on his cheek. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gavin kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide what I feel for you. I want you in my bed some nights. But I don\u2019t want you feeling like you have to tiptoe down the hallway so my daughter doesn\u2019t see you sneaking out of my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr see you creeping up the stairs from my bedroom at the crack of dawn,\u201d she countered. \u201cBut that does bring up my other point, Gavin. I want to spend time with you, but not at the expense of the time you spend with Sierra. And I don\u2019t want you suddenly inviting me to do family things. We both know she\u2019d resent that and me. I won\u2019t put you in that position, nor will I put myself in that position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout pissing you off, this is exactly why I\u2019ve avoided relationships. Why does it have to be so complicated?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rielle pressed her lips to his, coaxing his mouth to open to her kiss. She loved this intimacy. The give and take. The taste of him. The feel of his breath on her face, sometimes fast and short, sometimes soft as a sigh.</p><p>He eased off first, then kissed the corners of her mouth, the apples of her cheeks, her temples and between her eyebrows. \u201cSo we can only be like this...openly affectionate...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring the day when Sierra is at school. Or at night when we\u2019re alone.\u201d She gazed into his eyes. \u201cNot forever. Just for a little while. You\u2019ll know when the time is right to tell her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her? Not we\u2019ll tell her?\u201d</p><p>Rielle shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter. I\u2019m just a woman who lives here.\u201d She slipped her arms around his neck. \u201cWho is wildly attracted to her father.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWildly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d She nuzzled his ear. \u201cDid you happen to bring a condom with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I brought two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways prepared. I like that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee, I know you haven\u2019t been with anyone for a long time. I haven\u2019t been either. Can we skip the condoms?\u201d He caressed her face. \u201cI\u2019d like to make love to you without latex between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...talked to Doc Monroe last night, and she wrote me a prescription for birth control. But even if I get it filled today, it\u2019ll take a month for the pills to be effective.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had a pensive look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever get you pregnant. I had a vasectomy nine years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes searched his. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the divorce and dealing with Ellen using Sierra to manipulate me...I never wanted to give a woman that much power again or to do that to another child of mine. So I scheduled the procedure. I love my daughter. She fills my life with enough joy that I\u2019m content with having one kid. Are you all right with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean was I hoping to get pregnant at age forty when I have a twenty-four-year-old daughter?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cThat boat has sailed for me. But I already had one unintended pregnancy in my life. I wasn\u2019t keen on taking chemicals to prevent that from happening again at my age, but I\u2019d do it.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cSo I\u2019m very happy I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She hopped off the barstool. \u201cRace you to my room. Whoever wins gets to be on top.\u201d</p><p>The man had such a competitive streak. He nearly knocked her on her butt as he raced down the hallway and jumped on her bed.</p><p>But he let her be on top anyway.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s cell phone rang early Monday morning. \u201cThis is Gavin Daniels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGavin! Good to hear your voice. This is George Krebs. I\u2019m with the Bracken Investment Group?\u201d</p><p>He tried to put the name with a face but couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou have me at a disadvantage, George. Have we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, briefly, last year. At a Shout It Out fundraiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, my media coordinator at Daniels Development Group, handles donations for those events\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This call isn\u2019t about a fundraiser, but we do appreciate all your support. The reason for my call is...a little odd. So bear with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy understanding is you\u2019ve stepped down from the day-to-day running of Daniels Development Group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically I\u2019m still running DDG, but not from the Phoenix office. I\u2019ve relocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me why you\u2019re so interested in who has control of my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of our clients is interested in buying the Golden Valley property recently listed with DDG. I assume you\u2019re familiar with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery familiar.\u201d That was the last chunk of undeveloped land his father had purchased fifteen years ago, prior to his death. Gavin had been holding onto it, waiting to see what type of development sprang up in that section of Maricopa County. It\u2019d been completely unzoned at the time of purchase, which meant it could end up residential or commercial. Now the surrounding area contained medical complexes and high-end high-rise condos. With the possible shift in the commercial real estate market, Gavin had decided to list it right before they\u2019d left Arizona. And if his assessors were correct, the sale of this chunk of dirt would be the biggest financial payout of his career.</p><p>He inhaled a deep breath. \u201cSo what seems to be the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the listing agent. Our client has tried several times to get in contact with you, but your office staff at DDG has been very vague as to your whereabouts.\u201d He paused. \u201cHave any messages gotten through to you about the interest in this property? Because make no mistake; our client is very interested.\u201d</p><p>Gavin swore and paced to the window. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t heard anything and I apologize for that, George.\u201d Speculation about his diminishing role in his businesses could have serious financial repercussions, so he had no choice but to explain. \u201cFour years ago after my mother\u2019s death, I split DDG into two companies. Technically I\u2019m still the CEO of DDG, but in the last year I\u2019ve taken a more active role in Daniels Property Management. The DDG office staff apparently misinterpreted my personal contact instructions and I will get that handled immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll admit we were concerned you might have health issues, as one of our event planners mentioned you\u2019d lost some weight in the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was intentional, not health related. And to allay your concerns as to my whereabouts, I\u2019m currently living in eastern Wyoming, while my daughter finishes high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEastern Wyoming? Oh. That seems sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered I had family members in this area. I\u2019ve visited several times over the last few years and ended up buying land. Naturally, I wanted my daughter to be raised around family.\u201d That wasn\u2019t too far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that. But that still leaves me with what to tell my client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll apologize in person tomorrow for the miscommunication. Shall we meet in my office at DDG, say, around ten a.m.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect, Gavin. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for tracking me down. I\u2019ll call you at this number if I run into travel delays. If not, I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had known he\u2019d face last minute trips to Arizona when he\u2019d opted to move to Wyoming. He called his travel agent and winced when he heard the price for a ticket to Phoenix in the economy section would set him back fifteen hundred bucks.</p><p>A drop in the bucket if you can sell the land for the assessed value of thirty-five million dollars.</p><p>Gavin rearranged his schedule. He called Charlie and Vi, texted Sierra and left her a voice mail. Lastly, he dragged out his suitcase and picked three suits to get him through the week. The suits had been in dry cleaning bags since the movers had packed them in Arizona. Not much occasion to wear a suit and tie in Sundance.</p><p>Maybe there should be. You should take Rielle out for dinner when you get back from this trip.</p><p>Great plan. Ben had warned him not to treat Rielle like a dirty little secret. He\u2019d love to show her this wasn\u2019t a fling by taking their relationship public. But she\u2019d given him the impression she wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>Now he had to ask a huge favor. He tracked her down and the instant he saw her, he wanted her. So he dragged her to bed.</p><p>Afterward, being naked, tangled up with her, hearts pounding and flesh damp, he realized he didn\u2019t want to hide this affection he felt for her. He didn\u2019t want to hide anything from her.</p><p>Gavin kissed the small of her back. \u201cI could stay here all damn day, but I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over to face him, still modest enough that she\u2019d pulled the sheets up to cover her breasts. \u201cI saw your suitcases in the entryway before you carted me off to bed, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you a proper good morning and goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I did come two times so you got me coming and going.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLove that dirty mouth. I have to go to Arizona for business for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible land deal sale. Possible huge land deal sale.\u201d</p><p>Rielle cocked her head. \u201cHow huge? I\u2019m not asking for a spreadsheet, but I hear you wheeling and dealing on the phone, so I\u2019m interested how this came to pass.\u201d She poked him in the chest. \u201cYou always ask me for explicit details about my businesses. So I want you to know I\u2019m interested in your professional life as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Your real estate tycoon-y side formed you as a man. And since I like your man form...I want to know more.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cBasically, I\u2019ve been holding on to a chunk of land that\u2019s worth a lot of money. There\u2019s some confusion in my office as to why the potential client couldn\u2019t get in touch with me. So I need to straighten out office snafus and hopefully cash a really big check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than six bucks apiece for plums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say this land deal could be worth...five point eight million six dollar plums.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cWow. That\u2019s a plum sweet deal.\u201d</p><p>He groaned at her pun. \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t take Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You go make your bajillion dollars and I\u2019ll crack the whip on your daughter. Not that she needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Just bring me back a suitcase full of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d he supplied.</p><p>Rielle elbowed him in the gut as she rolled out of bed. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your money, Gavin Daniels. Bring me back a suitcase full of grapefruit and oranges. They want like four bucks a pound at the grocery store and I\u2019m too cheap to pay it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later he stood next to his car, saying goodbye to Rielle. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay staying with Sierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re okay with me letting her throw a Halloween party and providing an open bar and condoms for her friends, then we\u2019re good.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin tapped Rielle on the butt. \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Vi and Charlie are getting her to and from school. She\u2019s self-sufficient for breakfast and I cook myself supper so it\u2019s no biggie to make extra. You\u2019ll be gone what? Four days? She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking about her. I\u2019m asking about you.\u201d He caressed the side of her face. \u201cSierra can be a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to get me to change my mind?\u201d Rielle said lightly. \u201cBecause I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I feel I\u2019m taking advantage of you, especially after you gave me the whole, just because we\u2019re sleeping together doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m helping you parent your daughter speech.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI volunteered, which is different than you assuming I\u2019ll deal with childcare in your absence.\u201d Rielle stood on tiptoe and pecked his lips. \u201cGo. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Gavin kissed her longer. Hotter. Then sweeter. \u201cFor the thousandth time, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the thousandth time, you\u2019re welcome. Now go, before you miss your flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d After Gavin climbed in his car and buckled up, Rielle tapped on the window.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get sunburned.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>November...</p><p>The first three days with Sierra were almost too easy. She came home from school and retreated to her room until supper. She wasn\u2019t surly, just preoccupied with a school project.</p><p>So after Charlie dropped Sierra off Thursday, Rielle was surprised when she hung around the kitchen. In Rielle\u2019s experience with teens, that meant Sierra had something on her mind.</p><p>No reason you can\u2019t listen.</p><p>Sierra rested her chin on her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but it\u2019s cool that you know how to do so many things most people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I take that the wrong way?\u201d Rielle asked, stirring the bundle of raw wool soaking in beet juice.</p><p>\u201cBecause my mom was almost...proud of being helpless. She couldn\u2019t cook, she couldn\u2019t sew, she couldn\u2019t garden. She hired this Mexican woman and paid her cash to clean her house and wash her clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Rielle couldn\u2019t fathom that type of lifestyle. \u201cWhat did your mother do all day?\u201d</p><p>Sierra shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she went back to bed after she dropped me off at school. She watched TV or went shopping or to the salon or out to lunch with her friends or was at the beck and call of whatever boyfriend she had at the time.\u201d</p><p>Before Rielle asked specifics, Sierra said, \u201cSo I bet Rory can do all sorts of cool life skill stuff like that, huh?\u201d She pointed to the various jars of dye that held small bunches of yarn Rielle had opted to dip-dye.</p><p>\u201cI taught her how to cook, bake, garden, raise various things for food and how to make things to sell, if that\u2019s what you mean. Does she do any of it now? Very little.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s busy in grad school and her landlord frowns on her keeping bees, chickens and goats in her apartment.\u201d</p><p>Sierra snickered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think she\u2019ll get back to utilizing some of the skills she learned growing up, but I won\u2019t be upset if she decides homespun activities don\u2019t work for her. Heaven knows I don\u2019t do all the things my mom used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike raising chickens. I miss the fresh meat, but I hated butchering. And I never liked gathering eggs because chickens can be nasty creatures. At the time, selling organic eggs wasn\u2019t profitable. I didn\u2019t replace our dairy cow after Rory developed a milk allergy. I never sold any milk products; it was strictly for our own use anyway. As much as I like goats, I don\u2019t keep them, either for their angora or their milk. I love goat cheese, but goat milking is one of my least favorite things to do.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cI\u2019ve never milked anything.\u201d</p><p>Rielle twisted the wet bundle until the water ran clear. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. My mom used to make goat cheese, but Chassie Glanzer has a thriving business with excellent milk and cheese so I support her. Also, my mom handcrafted soap, but with Sky Blue creating unique products from natural ingredients, I\u2019d rather buy from them than make anything myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad\u2019s business philosophy too. No reason to compete with a business that\u2019s providing a service better than you can offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man, your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if you tell him I said that or that I was quoting him, I\u2019ll deny it,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cHe lives to explain things; in other words...lecture.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cYou sound like Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelling all of this\u2014\u201d she gestured to the piles of fiber, \u201c\u2014is how you get paid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I chose to make my living this way, in spite of some people believing being self-sufficient with self-sustaining products is an outdated concept. It\u2019s hard work and I know I\u2019ll never get rich. Growing up, Rory had to pitch in. If we didn\u2019t get a good harvest\u2014whether it was veggies, fruit, honey\u2014then we\u2019d have a lean winter, finance-wise and food-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got to spend time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. It wasn\u2019t all work. We had fun too.\u201d Probably not the type of fun Sierra knew\u2014shopping, mani-pedis, spa treatments and fancy luncheons.</p><p>Stop assuming and ask her. The admiring way she talks about her father makes it obvious her mother isn\u2019t the only one who influenced her life.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What did you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>Sierra pressed her finger into the poppy seeds on her plate, left over from her lemon poppy seed muffin. \u201cWhen I stayed with my mom, we did what she wanted. Sometimes she\u2019d let me choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you were with your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad worked a lot. But when he came home, he didn\u2019t flop on the couch and ignore me like a lot of my friends\u2019 dads did. He\u2019s a sports guy, but he taped all the games so we could do stuff together. Some fun, some that was supposed to teach me a lesson. Dad was big on learning life lessons.\u201d</p><p>That remark piqued Rielle\u2019s curiosity because Gavin had stuck to his guns with not letting Sierra drive until he felt she was ready. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was ten I begged for a puppy and he kept saying no. Finally after a year, he said if I proved to him that I could be responsible with an animal, he\u2019d let me have a pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolunteer at the animal shelter for two months. I learned to take care of all kinds of dogs and cats. I scrubbed cages. Emptied litter boxes. Helped with flea baths and combed matted fur. I fed the animals and filled water bowls and cleaned up after them. I saw what an abused and neglected animal looked like and acted like. It was so freakin\u2019 sad.\u201d</p><p>Not the type of parenting reaction she\u2019d expected from Gavin; Rielle thought he would\u2019ve given his daughter anything without restriction. \u201cDid you end up getting a puppy?\u201d</p><p>Sierra shook her head. \u201cLearning all that changed my mind. Especially when my dad said I\u2019d have to take my dog everywhere with me, even to friends\u2019 sleepovers, because he had a life that didn\u2019t entail babysitting my pet. Of course, my mom offered to buy me any kind of puppy I wanted, mostly to piss my dad off.\u201d</p><p>That behavior wasn\u2019t shocking after what Rielle had learned about Gavin\u2019s ex-wife. \u201cWell, for never having a dog of your own, Sadie is sure taken with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because she misses Rory, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I got Sadie after Rory went to college, so she\u2019s pretty much my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my dad said you had, like, a pack of dogs?\u201d</p><p>Rielle transferred the dyed fiber from the pint-sized glass jars into individual plastic grocery bags. \u201cThat was true the first time he stayed here. We had three dogs. Spuds died last year. Rory\u2019s dog, Jingle, is around if she is. I take care of Ben\u2019s dogs, Ace and Deuce, whenever he and Ainsley go out of town. So maybe that is a pack.\u201d</p><p>Sierra watched her tying off the plastic bags. \u201cNow what do you do with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeat it in the microwave to set the dye.\u201d She set two bags in the microwave and set the timer. \u201cThen it cools, I rinse it, spin out the excess water and hang to dry. The immersion batches on the stove are left to cool to room temp. Then I rinse it, spin out the excess water and hang to dry. Sense a theme?\u201d She pointed to the piles of raw, combed wool. \u201cThat is called wool roving. Sometimes I dye it whole, or tie it off and tie-dye it. But this batch I\u2019m hand painting. It\u2019s a messy process and I like to use several different colors. The dyed fiber looks weird, but once I spin it into yarn, it is amazing. I can\u2019t keep it in stock and I have ten batches to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working with several stores over the years who know my quality is good and I\u2019m not afraid to experiment with different fibers, so that keeps me in a higher paying niche market. I also sell directly to experienced knitters I\u2019ve met over the years. I supply all sorts of different spun and dyed fibers to a woman who knits projects specifically for publication in how-to books. It\u2019s cool to see the patterns she creates from the yarn I\u2019ve hand-dyed and spun.\u201d</p><p>Sierra peered in the pot. \u201cThat\u2019s a really pretty color. It would be so awesome to wear something you\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got so much of this burgundy hue; I\u2019ll keep some and work on a project over the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you teach me how to knit?\u201d Sierra blurted. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy, but if you\u2019re just sitting by the fire some night, maybe I could watch you and take notes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle was absurdly touched by the request. Sometimes when she looked at Sierra she saw a privileged, world-weary teen. But other times, like now, she saw a sweet girl who was eager to learn something out of the norm because it interested her. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVi won\u2019t get upset? I know she likes to do crafty type activities with you.\u201d</p> <p>Sierra shook her head. \u201cGrams crochets, just like my other grandma did. It doesn\u2019t interest me because you can knit much cooler things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ve still got a pair of beginner\u2019s knitting needles around someplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>Rielle took the bags out of the microwave, checked to see if all the dye had been absorbed and set the bags on the cooling rack. Then she put in the next two bags and set the microwave timer.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re big on the barter system, so you have to let me teach you to do something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSierra, that\u2019s sweet, but not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair\u2019s fair. And there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m good at, because I\u2019ve been doing it since I could hold a brush.\u201d</p><p>Please. God. No.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a makeover!\u201d Sierra jumped off the barstool. \u201cThis is gonna be so awesome!\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cWell, I need to finish setting the dye in the last two batches. And clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take me ten minutes to get my stuff together anyway. Then I\u2019ll meet you in your bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>The enthusiastic teen was through the swinging door before Rielle could reply. How did she tell Sierra she wasn\u2019t interested in a makeover?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d always considered herself lucky that Rory hadn\u2019t forced her love of all that girly stuff on her. Although...Rielle could admit her new hairstyle had made a world of difference in how she viewed herself.</p><p>What did she have to lose except for a few hours? Nothing.</p><p>But she poured herself a big whiskey Coke anyway before she wandered down the hallway.</p><p>Sierra had already set up in Rielle\u2019s bathroom. She pointed to the toilet. \u201cSit. Get comfy.\u201d</p><p>Rielle sat, drink in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your makeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrawer on the right. There\u2019s not much.\u201d</p> <p>Sierra cleaned Rielle\u2019s face with a warm cloth, which was really weird. She asked questions about Rielle\u2019s skincare regimen, which consisted of washing her face with Ivory soap and moisturizing with Lubriderm lotion.</p><p>Surprisingly, that didn\u2019t earn a heavy sigh like it would\u2019ve from Rory.</p><p>Rielle kept her eyes closed and took the occasional sip of her drink as Sierra discussed skin tones, the best way to mask her under eye circles and cultivate the natural look. Which prompted her to ask, \u201cSo not wearing any makeup isn\u2019t an acceptable natural look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine when you\u2019re working outside, as long as you\u2019re wearing skin protection with at least thirty SPF.\u201d She smeared something beneath Rielle\u2019s eye. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to look like you just whipped off your gloves and sun hat when you go to town, do you?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what Rielle had always done. So she deflected. If Sierra was anything like Rory, she\u2019d love to talk about boys. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard you mention any cute guys at your school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to avoid talking about guys around my dad. He gets a little uptight and lecture-y about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad isn\u2019t here. Since you\u2019re avoiding my question, is there some guy you\u2019re interested in?\u201d</p><p>Sierra sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy. He\u2019s nice and funny and bossy and kind of quirky. I see him at the library or around school and we talk and stuff. But he\u2019s made it clear that he just wants to be pals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Rielle stayed still as Sierra\u2019s fingers dotted something cool on her cheeks, nose and forehead and gently smoothed it in. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the new girl catch guys\u2019 interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo guys offered to break up with their girlfriends to go out with me. But I don\u2019t need any more crap from the girls at school.\u201d</p><p>Rielle opened her eyes and looked at Sierra. \u201cAre you having a hard time and can\u2019t talk to your dad about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Close your eyes. Well, I mean yes. Girls at school aren\u2019t mean, they just ignore me. Marin is fun and we have a great time together, but now she\u2019s got a boyfriend. Two other girls ask me to do stuff, but they both drive and I feel like a...loser because they\u2019d have to pick me up and bring me home. I\u2019m thinking about asking my dad if I could be home schooled.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cGod, no, Sierra, don\u2019t do that. Home schooling sucks. Trust me. My parents didn\u2019t give me a choice. And if you think it\u2019s tough not being able to drive, imagine how much harder it\u2019d be if you didn\u2019t see anyone but your dad, me and your grandparents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes closed,\u201d Sierra reminded her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t consider home schooling Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a single second. I won\u2019t say her school years were easy, especially not after she started middle school and hit the six-foot-one mark, making her taller than all the girls in her class and most of the boys. But she had a couple of good friends, she earned the highest GPA in her graduating class and she\u2019s socially well-adjusted. Without making generalizations\u2014because I know what that\u2019s like\u2014home schooled kids are awkward in normal society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not awkward and you were home schooled,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cReally? You sure? I can\u2019t even put on my own damn makeup.\u201d</p><p>Sierra snickered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also forty. An old forty.\u201d Sierra dragged something wet close to her lash line and Rielle flinched.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Geez. I\u2019m not gonna jab you in the eye unless you do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Sierra lightly brushed Rielle\u2019s entire eye area and she tried not to wiggle because it tickled.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you knew what it was like when people made generalizations. What did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a baby at sixteen. So people around here assumed I was a slut. Or that I was on food stamps and all sorts of government assistance because I was the daughter of pot-growing hippies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Really? People said shit like that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>Sierra touched the apples of Rielle\u2019s cheeks with a soft brush. \u201cPeople are assholes. You\u2019re not any of those things. They should follow you around one day and see how hard you work.\u201d</p><p>Again, she was reminded Sierra was a lot more observant than she\u2019d given her credit for.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>Sierra grinned at her. \u201cLooking good, Ree. Time for mascara. I can\u2019t stand when someone else puts it on me, so I\u2019ll let you put it on yourself, just as long as you can do it without the mirror so you don\u2019t ruin the big reveal.\u201d</p><p>The big reveal. Funny girl. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Sierra slapped a blue and neon pink tube in Rielle\u2019s hand. \u201cStart at the lash line. Sweep up twice. Then only touch the very tips of your lashes. That really makes them pop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be lucky if I don\u2019t pop out my eyeball doing this without a mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha. You\u2019re funny and not nearly as cranky as you like to think you are.\u201d</p><p>That caught Rielle\u2019s attention. \u201cCranky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Thinking you\u2019re old. Acting like such a hard-ass. Like you\u2019ve got no time for anyone. But I see you with my dad. You smile a lot. So does he.\u201d</p><p>This intuitive kid reminded her so much of Rory at age sixteen she ached, missed her insightful, stubborn and sweet daughter. She finished with the mascara. \u201cNow can I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Last thing. Lipstick.\u201d</p><p>Rielle groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m painting your lips with goopy stuff. Now pucker up. Hold it.\u201d She outlined Rielle\u2019s mouth with a thick pink-colored pencil. \u201cYou have the most perfect lips. My mom pays a fortune to have full lips like these.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou need to play them up. Even if you just put on hydrating shimmer gloss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Sierra, no offense, but I don\u2019t even know what the hell that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee. Stop talking, you\u2019re smudging it. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>Guess finishing her drink was out of the question.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Sierra peered at her like she was a science experiment. \u201cOkay, I lied. There is one other thing I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your hair spray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the sink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes again. And umm...tell me if I pull too hard.\u201d</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Sierra fogged the bathroom with hairspray and Rielle bit back a cough. The kid did pull and twist her hair harder than she was used to. Well, with the exception of Sunday morning when Gavin had become that sexy hair-pulling beast who drove her insane with lust.</p><p>Probably not something she should be thinking about with the man\u2019s daughter right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cAll right. You\u2019re done with this phase.\u201d</p><p>This phase?</p><p>Sierra pulled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo peeking until I tell you.\u201d She spun her forward and to the right. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Rielle mentally practiced her wow face, hoping it reflected in the mirror before her what the fuck? face. She slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>And her wow face was real.</p><p>Sierra hadn\u2019t caked on makeup, or given her a look that was too old, too young, or too sophisticated. The effect was very natural. Like Rielle always looked, but better. More polished.</p><p>\u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Rielle met Sierra\u2019s gaze in the mirror. \u201cYou were right. This really makes my eyes pop. And I love the lip color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the prettiest eyes. Kind of like all the green things you grow are reflected in them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squeezed Sierra\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you. You are a miracle worker.\u201d</p><p>Sierra squeezed her hand back a little harder than Rielle expected. \u201cStop saying shit like that. Now. What do you think of the hair?\u201d</p><p>With her hair spiked every which way it sort of looked like she\u2019d stuck her finger in an electric socket. But it worked. Conveyed a hip, edgy vibe without it seeming like she was trying too hard to be hip and edgy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funky, but you need to have a different way to fix yourself up, for when you go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like it.\u201d She touched the top. \u201cIt\u2019s easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as easy as what you do now. And when you\u2019re feeling really daring? I\u2019ll show you how to curl it so you look like an angel.\u201d</p><p>Now that she\u2019d pay to see. \u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that.\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s hands landed on her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t get defensive on the next phase. Bear with me.\u201d Then she steered Rielle toward her closet door.</p> <p>\u201cOh hell no. You are not rifling through my closet, Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. You are.\u201d</p><p>When Rielle tried to spin around, Sierra held her in place in front of the full length mirror. \u201cWe are doing this. First, pick ten or fifteen pieces of clothing you love. Mix it up between jeans, pants, skirts, tops, shorts, dresses and sweaters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, pick as many accessories as you want. Belts, scarves, leggings, shawls, jewelry.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019d be easy since Rielle had few of those items. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ve gotta check something and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She was overcome with guilt opening the closet door because she\u2019d packed so much shit in here after relocating from the upstairs master bedroom. Most of it she didn\u2019t wear, but couldn\u2019t part with because it was so damn ingrained in her not to be wasteful.</p><p>Then she felt resentful she was letting a sixteen-year-old fashionista boss her around.</p><p>But she\u2019s hit the mark with the makeover so far. Admit you\u2019re having fun. What else would you be doing? Working? Moping because you miss Gavin?</p><p>That put Rielle into the spirit of the moment and she tracked down her favorite pieces.</p><p>Sierra returned with a half-full garbage bag. The girl didn\u2019t actually believe Rielle would throw away her clothes like on those TV shows?</p><p>\u201cShow me whatcha got.\u201d</p><p>Sierra nodded approvingly at the pieces Rielle had chosen. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done in the garden, or taking bread into town, or selling your stuff at market, what do you wear?\u201d</p> <p>Work clothes. Sometimes the same jeans or shorts she\u2019d worn picking fruit or veggies. She\u2019d wash her hands and put on the first clean T-shirt she could find. She flopped back on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to stop dressing like a bum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You\u2019re hiding behind grungy clothes.\u201d Sierra leaned over her. \u201cLet me help you change that. It\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. And you won\u2019t have to buy anything new unless you want to. We\u2019ll work with what you already have. So what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say, amen, sister, it\u2019s way past time,\u201d echoed from the doorway.</p><p>Rielle sat up and her mouth dropped open. \u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh. But I have to admit when I decided to come home and surprise you, the last thing I expected was to see you getting a fashion makeover.\u201d</p><p>She hurled herself off the bed and hugged her daughter. \u201cWhat a great surprise! I was just thinking about you and here you are. So how long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll weekend.\u201d Rory hugged her back, but her focus shifted. \u201cHey. You must be Sierra. I\u2019m Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Wow. You look exactly like your mom. And she, uh, talks about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Rielle noticed Sierra acted nervous, twisting her fingers in the plastic garbage bag handles.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sure you guys have stuff to talk about so I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>But Rory stepped in front of her and shook her head. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re staying. After I snuck into the house, I listened in the hallway and I have to admit I\u2019m impressed that you\u2019ve accomplished something I\u2019ve been trying to do for years.\u201d She mock whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ll be my hero if you can get rid of all the tie-dyed clothing.\u201d</p><p>Rielle flapped her hand at Rory, but she and Sierra were too busy laughing to notice.</p><p>\u201cSo the makeup and hair is your doing?\u201d Rory asked Sierra.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Ree is gonna teach me to knit and I wanted to teach her something useful. This is the only thing I can do that can be considered a skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what? Sixteen? Plenty of time to develop other skills.\u201d Rory settled cross-legged on the bed. \u201cPretend I\u2019m not here and finish what you started.\u201d</p><p>Since she so rarely got to see Rory, Rielle wanted to blow off the fashion show. But she wasn\u2019t surprised her thoughtful daughter wouldn\u2019t let Sierra feel left out.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here goes.\u201d Sierra used the pieces Rielle had chosen and put together a dozen different outfits. All casual and unique without being weird. She changed an outfit from professional to funky just by mixing and matching accessories.</p><p>With the back and forth between Rory and Sierra, Rielle started to feel like a third wheel, even when she was amused by their fashion banter.</p><p>Finally, Rory asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff I had in my closet I never wear,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d like any of it, or if she\u2019d think it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo young for her,\u201d they finished at the same time.</p><p>Was she really that predictable?</p><p>Rory\u2019s gaze zipped over Sierra. \u201cIt\u2019d probably fit me better than her anyway. How tall are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive ten.\u201d Sierra fished out a few items at a time, trying each piece with each outfit to see if it\u2019d add impact. A slim fit white rayon blouse went into the keep pile along with a tweed jacket and a butter-yellow-colored turtleneck.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to get rid of this stuff?\u201d Rory asked, fingering an orange sequined tank top.</p><p>\u201cTake it if you want it. A hand-me-down is recycling\u2014the responsible, green thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Rielle grinned. \u201cOoh, Rory, she totally has your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is awesome, because I\u2019m gonna be the belle of Laramie in this tank top on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d She pawed through the bag. \u201cWhat else do you have that\u2019s too young for my mom?\u201d</p><p>Rory ended up with more clothes from the bag than Rielle did. Her thoughts drifted and she wondered what Gavin would think if he was here, seeing how well their daughters were getting along. She missed him, more than she imagined she would and she didn\u2019t know how to feel about that. She had a sense of unease that Gavin hadn\u2019t thought about her at all since she hadn\u2019t heard from him, but she knew he\u2019d kept in contact with Sierra.</p><p>\u201c...with a strap-on.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to her daughter\u2019s and both Rory and Sierra laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening to us at all,\u201d Rory complained.</p><p>\u201cSorry. What?\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s gesture encompassed the bed. Then she shook her finger at Rielle. \u201cI\u2019d better not see you heading to town in your gardening clothes. You aren\u2019t a bag lady. You are an entrepreneur. You have several chic outfits to choose from. And you need to own the fact you\u2019re still young and hot.\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed. \u201cYeah, Mom, she\u2019s got your number too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy work here is done for tonight.\u201d Sierra bowed and slipped out of the room.</p><p>Rielle hugged Rory again. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink and you can tell me all about Gavin Daniels.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. How had Rory known she\u2019d gotten involved with Gavin? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin and Sierra. They\u2019ve been living here months. Are you ready to move into my cabin yet?\u201d</p><p>Not even close. In that moment, Rielle decided not to tell Rory about her relationship with Gavin. Luckily, her daughter was easily distracted. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who I ran into at the hardware store last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Connor? The cute guy who installed the replacement electrical line in the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Definitely some electricity there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should say that, because he asked about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rory went off on a tangent and Rielle had a reprieve.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>After four days attending to business in Phoenix, Gavin was damn glad to hit the wide open spaces of Wyoming. He called Charlie, letting him know he\u2019d fetch Sierra from the bus stop. He\u2019d missed his daughter, but her random texts amused him.</p><p>He\u2019d missed Rielle too. It was a new feeling, missing a romantic partner. Missing the whole of her, the way she smiled at him, their conversations, the way they\u2019d end up twined together. He hadn\u2019t texted or called her. Would she be annoyed with him?</p><p>Maybe you oughta ask Sierra for advice since you\u2019re acting like a teenaged girl.</p><p>Gavin waved at the assorted McKays, huddled in big pickups at the bus stop as they waited for their kiddos.</p><p>Sierra hustled to the car, fighting the fierce Wyoming wind. He remembered when his little girl threw herself at him, assuring him she\u2019d missed him. In recent years he\u2019d considered himself lucky if she even acknowledged him in public.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you got back until later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI switched to an earlier flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed a wisp of her dark hair from her cheek. \u201cMe too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cIn this wind? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed and pulled onto the highway. \u201cI imagine Charlie let you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day. I practiced parallel parking, which he says I rock at. Then we had hot chocolate and pie at the diner before we drove home on the back roads. He\u2019s so sweet and funny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not awkward?\u201d</p><p>Sierra frowned at him. \u201cWhat? Spending time with Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. At least he wants to spend time with me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shot her a sharp look. \u201cWas that a dig at me?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGod, Dad, paranoid much? I just meant if it wasn\u2019t for the McKays, I\u2019d never get to see anyone or do anything. It sucks being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to get around.\u201d</p><p>Never failed\u2014she found a way to poke at him about the fact she still wasn\u2019t driving on her own. He knew better than to take the bait. \u201cHow was school this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrappy. I got a hundred percent on my math quiz and blew the curve for the rest of the class so my classmates are pissed at me. Which is probably why I\u2019m spending another Friday night alone. Yay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever feel guilty for using your brain, Sierra. I\u2019m proud of you for getting the top grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone I know when you were home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust the people in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even mind listening to Manny complain about the heat and everything else.\u201d She sighed. \u201cCan I go with you next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when that\u2019ll be.\u201d He glanced at her again, seeing that brooding look settle on her face. \u201cBack up. Why don\u2019t you have plans for this weekend? Is there something going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact I don\u2019t have any friends except Marin and she\u2019s busy all the time? Besides the fact the weather always sucks so I can\u2019t drive? No. Besides that, everything is awesome.\u201d</p> <p>And...there was the sarcasm. He counted to ten. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you just say if not for the McKays\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead between the lines, Dad,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAs much as I try to convince myself everything is fine, it\u2019s not. When you\u2019re gone it just reminds me that I want to go home. I hate it here.\u201d</p><p>She hated it today. Didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d hate it tomorrow. Or next week. She changed her mind as often as her nail polish color.</p><p>Gavin parked in front of the house to unload his luggage, which included a token he\u2019d picked up for his daughter. Surly girl would probably throw it at him, so he\u2019d save it.</p><p>\u201cSo what? You\u2019re not talking to me now?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to argue with you, when you\u2019ll pick apart anything I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you know I\u2019m right. Not that you ever listen to me.\u201d She scrambled out of the car and...yep. Slammed the door hard enough to rock the entire frame.</p><p>Welcome fucking home.</p> <p>Screw that. He wouldn\u2019t let her shitty attitude sour the fact he was glad to be home.</p><p>Gavin left his suitcase in the entryway and hung up his coat. He loosened his tie on his way to the kitchen, searching for Rielle.</p><p>He pushed open the swinging door and there she was.</p><p>His damn heart skipped a beat. His stomach performed a happy flip. His cock stirred. He needed to wrap himself in her warmth, softness and light.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Ree, you\u2019re looking mighty tasty today.\u201d</p><p>She flashed him an unsure smile. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be here later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d He stalked her until her back connected with the refrigerator.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He pressed his body to hers, curling one hand around her face and the other around her hip. He whispered, \u201cI missed you,\u201d against her lips.</p><p>\u201cGavin. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Then he took her mouth. Kissing her with pent up need, proving his desire for her with every hot and hard stroke of his tongue. Losing himself in the rush of her lithe body arching against his. Filling his senses with her taste, her scent. Swallowing her sexy little I-want-you-now moans that drove him fucking insane.</p><p>\u201cBed. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>She needed convincing? Fine. He\u2019d convince the hell out of her. He growled, cranking up the intensity of the next kiss. Sliding his hand into her hair and pulling slightly, angling her head, to dive deeper into the soft draws of her mouth.</p><p>The sound of a loud, pointed throat clearing came from behind him.</p><p>Gavin froze. Then he lifted his mouth and his gaze collided with hers.</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>His hands fell away and he slowly turned around.</p><p>A blonde amazon version of Rielle gave him a little finger wave.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Or was she just giving him the finger?</p><p>\u201cGavin. This is my daughter, Rory,\u201d Rielle said behind him.</p><p>He\u2019d just attacked Rielle in front of her daughter? Classy.</p><p>Wait. Did Rory know about them?</p><p>Rielle slipped her arm around his waist and rested her head on his chest. That move shocked the heck out of her daughter.</p><p>Guess that answered that question.</p><p>\u201cSo, you two are...dating?\u201d Rory asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been involved\u2014together, dating, whatever\u2014since he moved in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m living with him,\u201d Rielle said evenly.</p><p>Annoyance crossed Rory\u2019s face. Her posture remained belligerent. \u201cOh, we\u2019re playing the word definition game. Fine. So, technically what you\u2019re really doing is sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Sierra\u2019s business? Should I ask her if you two share a bed every night? Or is she in the dark too? Or maybe that\u2019s why she was making you over? So you\u2019d be what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you just said that. What is your deal, Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy deal? Really, Mom? You don\u2019t understand why I\u2019d be upset that you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having sex with Gavin Daniels? And apparently it\u2019s more than sex? It\u2019s some kind of...relationship?\u201d</p><p>Rielle stiffened, but she didn\u2019t move away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t tell you everything that goes on in my life, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. That\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to tell since I\u2019ve never known you to be involved with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I don\u2019t tell you because you blab any damn thing that pops into your head, regardless if it\u2019s my personal business,\u201d Rielle shot back.</p><p>Rory had the grace to look embarrassed, but it didn\u2019t last long. \u201cOuch. All this secrecy does is make me wonder if you didn\u2019t tell me about you and Gavin because you\u2019re ashamed about what this really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, you know what it really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA convenience.\u201d</p><p>Gavin ground his teeth together, understanding how difficult it must be for Rielle to hold her tongue when Sierra got mouthy with him.</p><p>\u201cWrong. You want to know why I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Because it proves me right? That he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Rielle warned.</p><p>\u201cJust like the rest of the McKays,\u201d Rory finished. \u201cHe\u2019ll fuck anything that walks like it\u2019s his due and then he\u2019ll walk the fuck away. That\u2019s really the guy you want to have a relationship with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Gavin said to Rory. \u201cI don\u2019t know what chip you have on your shoulder about the McKays, and frankly, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise there,\u201d she interrupted with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cBut I do care that you think you can waltz in here and pass judgment on your mother, when to be blunt, you don\u2019t know fuck-all.\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t chastise him, nor did she jump in and apologize for his harsh response.</p><p>\u201cThis is just fucking great. He\u2019s already got you under his thumb.\u201d Rory pushed off the counter. \u201cScrew this. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Rielle planted all five feet five inches in front of her six foot tall daughter. \u201cCool off that hot head of yours, Aurora Rose. You don\u2019t get to go off on a tear, do you hear me?\u201d Rielle drilled Rory in the chest with her index finger. \u201cI slaved making your favorite supper at your request, so you damn well better have your butt parked at the dining room table at six-thirty, wearing a goddamned smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it just be you and me? Or will they be here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gavin and Sierra will be here, since it\u2019s a family dinner in their house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Rory tried to sidestep Rielle.</p><p>But Rielle wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cYou will be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I would, all right? Jesus. Move. I gotta get my dog.\u201d Rory all but stomped off.</p><p>Gavin wasn\u2019t aware he held his breath, waiting for the door to slam, until it actually did\u2014with enough force to rattle the dishes in the cupboard. He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cGlad someone sees humor in this.\u201d</p><p>He circled his arms around Rielle. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be impressed that Rory can slam the door harder than Sierra, or scared my daughter won\u2019t outgrow this stage and she\u2019ll be testing door hinges for the next seven years.\u201d</p><p>Rielle smiled wanly. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since Rory has reminded me of her door-slamming expertise.\u201d</p><p>Gavin ran his hand down her back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I hate fighting with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be the day,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSierra lit into me the second she got in the car today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered what triggered her spectacular door slam. And why she\u2019d ignored me when I called out to her, after we\u2019d had so much fun last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra insisted on making me over. Rory showed up and the two of them conspired against me. They got along surprisingly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting Rory this weekend?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gotten around to telling me why she showed up out of the blue, which is probably why she acted so bratty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat on a barstool, bringing Rielle between his legs, close to his body. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You know what it\u2019s like to have an only child. They expect immediate attention. That hasn\u2019t changed even when she\u2019s in college. Last night, she had to share me with Sierra. She assumed she\u2019d have my undivided attention today, but Ainsley needed to talk so I met her in town for a long lunch. Then you show up and kiss the shit out of me, throwing her mommy and me world into turmoil. She won\u2019t have my total focus this weekend. That\u2019s never happened to her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her about us?\u201d</p> <p>Rielle smoothed her palms over his cheeks. \u201cNot because I was embarrassed. But...\u201d She outlined his face with her fingertips, from his hairline to his jawline, to the curve of his lips. \u201cYou really are a handsome man. Such a McKay.\u201d</p><p>Gavin growled. \u201cAnswer. The. Question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Rory about you, because I have so few things that are mine. Not in an ownership way, but in a personal way. I\u2019ve lived my life as an open book with her. I don\u2019t regret that.\u201d Rielle caressed his face. \u201cSo what you and I have? I\u2019ve never had. I don\u2019t want to share it with her or anyone else, because it belongs only to us.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Gavin fell in love with her. He couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from this beautiful and complex woman who had swooped in and stolen his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou look so serious,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, honey, you said everything right.\u201d He brushed his lips up the strong line of her jaw, to the sweet spot in front of her ear. \u201cHave I mentioned that I missed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. But you can tell me again.\u201d</p><p>Following the curve of her hips, he grabbed two handfuls of that sexy ass. \u201cI thought about our goodbye in the wee small hours of Monday morning. A lot.\u201d He blew in her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fucking turn-on when your body is squeezing me so hard I can\u2019t even fucking breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re more than just body heat and movement beneath the sheets in the darkness.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cI thought about how perfect it feels when I slide into you. When I hear that catch in your breath and I know in that moment, you\u2019re only mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been reading books on how to seduce a woman with pretty words, tycoon?\u201d Rielle turned her head and nipped his ear lobe.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod yes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s hands squeezed her butt, urging her closer. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Their lips connected and he forced himself not to inhale her. He forced himself to temper his explicit words with the tenderness and sweetness of his kiss.</p><p>A whoosh sounded, followed by, \u201cSeriously? God. Get a room!\u201d Then stomping, followed by another whoosh.</p><p>Rielle pulled back. \u201cAnd Rory breaks the moment yet again. Have you told Sierra about us yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I guess I\u2019d better do it now.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick this up later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p> <p>Rory and Sierra conspired together to keep their parents apart.</p><p>Sierra desperately required Gavin\u2019s help with biology homework. On a Friday night. For two hours.</p><p>Then Rory demanded Rielle\u2019s help to find a specific knitting pattern. Sifting through pattern books and printouts lasted two hours.</p><p>Consequently, dinner was served later than she\u2019d planned. When Gavin offered to help, Rory made a comment about him helping himself to another make out session with her mother while the food got cold.</p><p>Rielle and Gavin were seated across from one another. Too far away to even casually touch\u2014obviously intentional. And Rory insisted they eat each course separately, reminding her mother that the goal was to enjoy the food it\u2019d taken her so long to prepare.</p><p>The appetizer course\u2014a caramelized apple and onion tart topped with brie\u2014was followed by the chopped salad course and ended with chicken and noodles\u2014Rory\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Every time Rielle glanced at Gavin, that hungry look entered his eyes. A look that said he\u2019d only be satisfied if she was his four-course meal. He\u2019d barely touched his wine. She knew his gaze was on the clock as often as it was on her.</p><p>Rory and Sierra left them alone while they prepared the dessert course. As soon as the door swung shut, Gavin shot out of his chair.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s heart rate spiked when he moved in behind her with deliberate leisure. He set his hands on her shoulders. His thumbs lazily stroked her collarbone. Shivers spread into gooseflesh, traveling down her belly and her spine.</p><p>He pressed his warm mouth to her ear. \u201cI want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, please.</p><p>\u201cThese girls can try and keep us apart, but they have to go to bed sometime. And as soon as that happens? You will be naked, underneath me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, almost desperate to feel her lips on his skin.</p><p>But he stayed her movement, his hand sneaking up to cup her chin, holding her in place as he licked the shell of her ear. \u201cRemember that every time you look at me. Imagine my mouth sucking on your nipples. Imagine my hands on your ass as I\u2019m thrusting into your hot cunt.\u201d</p><p>Rielle just about came right then.</p><p>Gavin was back in his seat by the time Rory and Sierra returned with the strawberry lemon shortcake. They chattered, seemingly oblivious to the increased sexual tension.</p><p>\u201cSo Sierra and I were talking about our after-dinner plans,\u201d Rory said as she set a dessert plate in front of Rielle.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it\u2019d be fun to have a game night,\u201d Sierra added, sliding a slice of shortcake in front of her father.</p><p>\u201cHow about Scrabble?\u201d Rory asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather play Clue,\u201d Sierra countered.</p><p>They argued the merits of various games. Rielle cut into her dessert but she couldn\u2019t eat a bite. Her mouth was too damn dry from the heated gazes the wicked man across the table kept throwing her way.</p><p>\u201cMom? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Rielle looked over at Gavin. The lust in his eyes made her stutter, \u201cI d-don\u2019t know.\u201d Breathe, idiot. \u201cGavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I up for playing a game? Absolutely.\u201d He wrapped his lips around a strawberry on the end of his fork and sucked it into his mouth.</p><p>She was so flustered she dropped her knife.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>No mistaking that for anything but sexual tension now.</p><p>Then Rory tossed her napkin on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. You two wanna blow off our plans for family night, because you want to lock yourselves in the bedroom? Knock yourselves out. But I won\u2019t stick around to hear the headboard banging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory! What a rude thing to say.\u201d Her cheeks burned as she glanced at Sierra\u2014even her mouth was open in shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed back to Laramie tomorrow. But tonight, I\u2019m going to town.\u201d A calculating look crossed Rory\u2019s face. \u201cCome on, Sierra, let\u2019s go out.\u201d</p><p>Sierra looked even more shocked. \u201cAh, sure.\u201d She pushed back from the table.</p><p>\u201cJust where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Gavin asked Sierra.</p><p>\u201cOut. With Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s that?\u201d Gavin demanded from Rory.</p><p>\u201cThe Golden Boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll let my sixteen-year-old daughter go to a bar with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a restaurant. Do you think that\u2019s worse for her than being in this house, listening to the two of you get it on?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s curfew is midnight. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Rielle waited until the front door slammed before she looked across the table at Gavin.</p><p>His steely-eyed gaze was focused entirely on her.</p><p>\u201cDid they really think we\u2019d pitch a fit about them leaving when we haven\u2019t been alone for four goddamn days? Did it even cross your mind to ask them to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The lustful glimmer in his eye served as a warning. He\u2019d have her stripped, bucking beneath him, lost in the pleasure his body brought to hers if she didn\u2019t snatch control right now.</p><p>Rielle pushed back from the table and moseyed over to him. Gavin watched her with the heavy-lidded gaze that caused her pulse to skip.</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind, Ree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She straddled his lap and fingered the collar of his black dress shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll admit disappointment you took off that sexy tie. I had plans for it.\u201d She pressed an openmouthed kiss on his neck. \u201cYou ever been restrained, tycoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be fun.\u201d Rielle sucked on his throat, then whispered, \u201cImagine how the silky fabric would feel floating over your skin. On your chest.\u201d She eased back far enough to slide her hands down his pectorals. Then lower. \u201cOn your belly.\u201d When she found his hard shaft through his dress pants, she stroked it. \u201cWrapped around this. Such softness against hardness. Coolness on such heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Rielle kissed him. Slowly. Savoring him. Licking and sucking on that pouty bottom lip. Her hands clamped onto his head as she rolled her hips. She cranked up the intensity, making his tongue chase hers. Trapping his head as she ravished his mouth. She broke free and arched her back.</p><p>He blinked at her abrupt departure, but the sleepy haze of lust remained in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUndress me,\u201d she said softly. His palms slid down her back. \u201cTake off my camisole.\u201d</p><p>A soft groan escaped after he tossed the stretchy top to the floor and her breasts were shoved under his chin.</p><p>\u201cYou want to touch me, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Then his hot mouth enclosed the peak of her nipple. Another groan reverberated against her flesh as he suckled more strongly. His hands caressing, plumping the globes together to better access the tightened tips. He\u2019d push them apart, licking and burying his face in her cleavage. His fingers pinching and twirling her nipples, skating close to the edge of pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle wanted to leap over that dividing line between pleasure and pain right now. \u201cGavin. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, don\u2019t make me stop.\u201d He scraped his whiskered cheek over the hard nub. \u201cI love your tits. I could spend all night seeing how many times I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>She bit the shell of his ear harder than he was used to. He froze. \u201cDo that to me.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze snapped to hers. \u201cIs that really what you want?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your mouth on me harder. Use your teeth.\u201d</p><p>A sexy growling noise escaped and then it was on. Gavin unleashed the beast. Lashing tongue and sucking lips interspersed with hard nips. Each time he used his teeth, she swore her skin would give way to the bite. Then he\u2019d back off. Nuzzle and nip. Tease and tantalize. Rendering her so wet and needy her thighs were soaked.</p> <p>His deep whisper in her ear sent a tingle down her spine. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here but us, Ree,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cNo need to be quiet. I want to hear you come.\u201d He bit down on her right nipple, using the perfect erotic combination of pressure, suction and air to propel her higher and hurl her off the ledge, straight into bliss.</p><p>Her orgasm was beyond explosive. She gasped, shocked that the insistent tug of his mouth on her nipple traveled in an electric line straight to her clit. Her pussy muscles clenched and she held on through each forceful throb.</p><p>After the last pulse faded, she realized she\u2019d dug her fingers into Gavin\u2019s biceps so deeply her hands had cramped. Her vision was still a little spotty when she looked at him.</p><p>He smiled cockily.</p><p>Pushing upright, she unlocked her fingers from his arms. \u201cSorry. I hope I didn\u2019t leave marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you did.\u201d Gavin placed a kiss on her palm and the tip of each finger. \u201cBecause that would be fucking hot as hell. Looking in the mirror in the morning and being reminded of this.\u201d</p> <p>For claiming not to be a smooth talker, Mr. Daniels certainly could teach his sweet-talkin\u2019 McKay cousins a lesson or two. Rielle unbuttoned his shirt. \u201cYou look good in black.\u201d She undid the last button and peeled the fabric down his arms. \u201cBut you look even better like this.\u201d She curled her hands around his rib cage and strummed his nipples with her thumbs.</p><p>\u201cYou going to let me take you to bed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I decided I\u2019d better teach you a lesson about snatching control when it\u2019s not yours to take.\u201d She pinched his nipples.</p><p>Gavin sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cHoney, I didn\u2019t take control, you lost control the instant I put my mouth on you. No shame in that.\u201d He drew a line across the tops of her breasts.</p><p>Rielle knocked his hands away and shimmied down his thighs, dropping to her knees.</p><p>His body went rigid.</p><p>She flicked open the button on his dress slacks and unzipped him. \u201cStand and take off your pants. Boxers too.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stood so fast he knocked the chair over.</p> <p>She bit the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>Then he was completely naked. Were her eyes deceiving her, or was Gavin a little unsure about being stripped bare in front of her, with all the dining room lights on?</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be. He was all man, wonderful sexy man, and she\u2019d do everything in her power to assure him she liked what she saw. \u201cYour body rocks my world, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis old thing?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. Odd to think she\u2019d never had the opportunity to explore her lover\u2019s reaction to her touch. Sexual encounters prior to Gavin had been done quickly and in darkness.</p><p>Time to change that. She\u2019d learn every inch of him, learn what he liked, learn what made him shake with need. Starting here and now. Her hands followed the outside of his thighs; the crisp hair on his legs abraded her palms. She mapped the hard, defined quads. His slender hips were a frame for his flat belly. She probably could\u2019ve gone on in more detail, but that pretty cock, directly in front of her face, distracted her. Thick, smooth and hard, rising out of the dark, curly tufts of hair between those impressive thighs.</p><p>Rielle glanced up and saw Gavin watching her with molten eyes. She licked him from root to tip in one long, slow, wet swipe.</p><p>\u201cJesus. This might kill me, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she flicked her tongue beneath the cockhead. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019d better hold on to something solid. Brace yourself against the table.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shifted, keeping his stance wide and his hands gripping the table\u2019s edge. He wore a look of hopeful panic, which amused her. Maybe the book she\u2019d read had it right; men cared less about a great oral technique than great enthusiasm.</p><p>She enclosed the base of the shaft in her right hand and lowered her mouth over the tip. The taut skin was smooth against her tongue. She sucked, getting a little taste of the glistening wetness leaking from the slit.</p><p>\u201cDamn. That feels good.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if I do something you don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I can promise you I\u2019m gonna like it all, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well...I probably won\u2019t swallow since I\u2014\u201d just tell him the truth, \u201c\u2014haven\u2019t done it before. You okay with that?\u201d</p><p>Gavin blindly reached behind him and came up with a napkin. He passed it to her. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d</p><p>Rielle kissed the crown. Then she let the head pass between her teeth. Over her tongue until the shaft filled her mouth and her gag reflex kicked in. She backed off and started again, sucking him in a little deeper with each pass.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>She circled her right hand around the base, stroking up to meet the downward plunge of her mouth. She flattened her free hand against his abdomen. Intoxicating to feel those muscles rippling beneath her touch.</p><p>Her mouth created so much wetness as she eagerly worked him over that liquid flowed down and coated her hand. She began to move faster.</p><p>The slipperier sensation had Gavin bumping his hips away from the table, into her face.</p><p>She liked this. No, she loved it. All of it. The intimacy. His trust. Her power. And those sexy, manly hisses and moans.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Don\u2019t stop. A little faster. Like that. Goddamn, Ree, what you\u2019re doing to me.\u201d</p><p>For a split second it seemed as if his cock lengthened. Then his hips snapped three times and he released a long groan.</p><p>Salty, wet heat splashed on her tongue and she held it in her mouth until Gavin\u2019s body stopped twitching. She slipped the head free from her mouth, trying to discreetly spit into the napkin. That seemed messier than just swallowing. Good thing to remember for next time.</p><p>When she glanced up, he was peering down at her, a goofy smile on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t suck.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>A moment passed and he cradled the side of her face in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her immediate denial got stuck in her throat. The way he looked at her made her feel beautiful. Made her feel wanted. Made her feel so very feminine.</p><p>Gavin slowly ran his thumb over her lower lip. Her tongue darted out and licked the pad. His thumb slipped inside, closer to her teeth. Her tongue traced the contour of his thumb as he stroked the wet inner flesh, back and forth. Such a sexy, intense moment and she found herself nearly breathless, imagining what would happen next.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She rolled to her feet and began to pick up their clothing.</p><p>His hand on her arm stopped her and she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>Then he clasped her fingers in his and led her to her bedroom. Gavin made love to her with the intensity she craved. Pushing her higher with each hard thrust. Seeming to know exactly what she needed.</p><p>And after they were spent, basking in the pleasure of skin on skin and lazy kisses, she understood what he gave her was so much more than hot sex.</p><p>While they\u2019d been naked together, nothing else mattered.</p><p>But after they left the bedroom, the situation with Rory and Sierra put them at odds. The clock read twelve forty-five and the girls weren\u2019t home. Neither of them answered their cell phones.</p><p>Gavin muttered about car accidents, serial killers and rednecks.</p><p>While Rielle understood Gavin\u2019s concern, if he pushed her, she\u2019d point out Rory was twenty-four. She didn\u2019t have a curfew. And if Gavin hadn\u2019t wanted Sierra tagging along with Rory, then he should\u2019ve said something. Might be harsh\u2014and she wasn\u2019t complaining at all about their alone sexy time\u2014but he\u2019d been more concerned about getting off than where his daughter was off to.</p><p>Part of her wanted to go to bed. Gavin\u2019s discussion with and discipline for his daughter were his business, not hers. But the mothering side worried for Rory and always would, demanding she wait up to see her daughter\u2019s face. And yeah, Rielle wanted to make sure Sierra was all right too.</p><p>At one-thirty, Gavin quit pacing and grabbed his coat from the coat tree.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find them. To alleviate my worry that they\u2019re in a ditch somewhere or shitfaced and neither one is capable to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one at the Golden Boot will serve Sierra.\u201d When Gavin opened his mouth to argue, she held her hand up. \u201cRory is a bartender in a college town, used to dealing with underage drinking. She won\u2019t buy drinks for herself and pass them to Sierra, nor will she let her drink. So I\u2019m one hundred percent sure at least your daughter is sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be a lot more reassured if I could talk to her.\u201d He swore. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they answering their goddamned phones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re both pissed off at us and that\u2019s what people do when they\u2019re mad, Gavin. Ignore the person who made them mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not concerned about this at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No. Rory is an adult. A responsible adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my daughter isn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle held his gaze. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have let her go out with mine.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s mouth tightened, but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Headlights shone through the window.</p> <p>She breathed a sigh of relief. Their conversation had been headed toward dangerous ground and she didn\u2019t have the mental energy to deal with it right now. She recognized the vehicle as Rory\u2019s truck since the engine continued to sputter after it\u2019d been shut off. A truck door slammed. Just one, not two. The porch floorboards creaked. The handle on the door moved as if the person was testing to see if it was locked.</p><p>The door opened and Sierra stepped inside.</p><p>Sierra wasn\u2019t surprised to see her father glaring at her in the entryway. She removed her gloves and scarf, hung up her coat and kicked off her boots. She jammed her hands in the pockets of her jeans. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d Gavin demanded.</p><p>\u201cI left it in the car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019re surgically attached to the damn thing. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It was loud in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I called you. You could\u2019ve texted me if it was too loud.\u201d</p><p>Sierra lifted her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t answer because I was having an awesome time. Talking to you would\u2019ve ruined it. I already knew I\u2019d be in trouble.\u201d Her eyes met Rielle\u2019s. \u201cRory told me to tell you she had too much liquid fun tonight. I dropped her off at her cabin and put a garbage can by her bed just in case she gets sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sierra. I appreciate you looking out for her.\u201d Rielle looked at Gavin. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She felt his angry and surprised gaze following her but she didn\u2019t turn around. He could deal with his daughter now; she\u2019d deal with hers in the morning.</p> <p>Rielle wasn\u2019t surprised to see Rory in the kitchen at seven a.m. making breakfast. Even as a small child, she\u2019d been quick to anger, but she\u2019d mend fences just as quickly. They\u2019d never stayed mad at each other for longer than a day, but she had the niggling feeling this conversation would test that theory.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Rory said. \u201cCoffee\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Rielle poured a cup and sat at the breakfast bar. She eyed the bacon sizzling in the skillet and watched as her daughter expertly cracked four eggs. Then she dropped the bread into the toaster, flipped the hash browns and set out two plates.</p><p>\u201cWant fruit too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is good.\u201d Rielle sipped her coffee. \u201cHow bad\u2019s the hangover?\u201d</p><p>Rory shrugged. \u201cDigesting grease and salt will give my body something to do rather than trying to expel the excess alcohol in my system.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWho\u2019d you run into last night that made you get your drink on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is he? I haven\u2019t seen him in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man drives me insane. I almost got into a fistfight with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say that pissed you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t he say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you two were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were. Until we weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Cryptic.</p><p>Rory dished up the hash browns and bacon. The toast popped up, she buttered it and sliced it before adding the eggs to the plates.</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve been an awesome short order cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t pay as much as bartending.\u201d She ripped off a piece of bacon. \u201cOr a master\u2019s degree in Ag Management.\u201d</p><p>They dug in. Rory didn\u2019t chatter through the meal like normal.</p><p>Once the dishes were cleared and they\u2019d refilled their coffee, Rory spoke. \u201cSo you\u2019re really with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Rielle squeezed Rory\u2019s forearm. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m here for you. I will talk to you about anything you want. Except for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so secretive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nosy? I\u2019ve never grilled you about the guys you\u2019ve dated. So what gives you the right to do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t like you, Mom. Because I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>The frayed end of her patience began to unravel. \u201cYou know what? You should\u2019ve been worried about me years ago. When as a young woman I never went on a date, never had a boyfriend\u2014not one man passed through my door or your life during your growing-up years. I was one hundred percent devoted to being your mother. I did a damn good job raising you. But that part of my life\u2014seeing myself as a mother first\u2014is over. It has been for a while and I\u2019ve needed to move on from that. Now I have.\u201d</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t look up from her coffee when she asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means my relationship with Gavin is not up for discussion with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that having me at sixteen fucked up you having a normal life.\u201d</p><p>Rielle slammed her coffee cup on the counter. \u201cFor Christsake, Aurora, you think that\u2019s a fair thing to say to me?\u201d</p><p>Her pale skin colored. \u201cProbably not. But that\u2019s the way you make me feel sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Rielle demanded. \u201cWhen have I ever acted like you were anything but the absolute joy and light of my life? Never. And don\u2019t let your jealousy that you might have to share my affections with someone else now distort the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying tough shit, suck it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. You are a twenty-four-year-old woman, Rory. Your reaction to your mother having a boyfriend is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Rory was completely taken aback.</p><p>\u201cMy relationship with Gavin won\u2019t ever affect my relationship with you. Unless you let it. Your choice.\u201d Rielle slid from the barstool and walked out.</p><p>An hour later, she\u2019d reached the bottom of her pile of logs to split. Even though it was still snowing, she\u2019d gotten so hot she\u2019d ditched her jacket and only wore a thermal shirt.</p><p>If anyone asked, she\u2019d blame her wet face on sweat. So what if a few frustrated tears leaked past her defenses while she was working out her aggravation.</p><p>\u201cRee?\u201d</p><p>She let the blade fall before she looked at Gavin. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it safe to approach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re in a bad mood and wielding an ax?\u201d</p><p>She offered a sad smile. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>Gavin moved in closer. \u201cYou and Rory had words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the little snot say something nasty to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But she shoveled the walkway. And swept a path to the garage and the barn.\u201d He gestured to the pile of chopped wood. \u201cLike mother, like daughter. Literally working off a mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore productive than drinking,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>Gavin framed her face in his hands. \u201cDo you want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Gavin. I don\u2019t want to talk about my kid or yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I was hoping to hear.\u201d He tugged her hat off and pushed his fingers through her damp hair.</p><p>\u201cI probably smell like sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d His thumbs stroked her cheekbones. \u201cI watched you out here. So strong and determined. You\u2019re beautiful and it\u2019s bizarre that seeing you whack the shit out of stuff turns me on.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed.</p><p>Gavin fastened his mouth to hers; the kiss was sweet and steady\u2014like a first kiss. Maybe it was the first time he\u2019d kissed her with such exquisite tenderness. He\u2019d shown her passion. Playfulness. Lust. He\u2019d flirted and teased. But this soft and slow meeting of tongues showed her another side to him and another side to herself. She accepted that he could comfort her, he could offer his support and it didn\u2019t make her weak or needy for wanting it.</p><p>Rory watched her mom from the upstairs window. Kissing Gavin. But it was more than that. Just by their body language she saw that her mom trusted him.</p><p>Before her mother had stormed off this morning, Rory had tried to get her to recognize that she was making the same mistake she had at age sixteen, falling for the first guy who paid attention to her.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s inexperience with men scared her. This wasn\u2019t a casual situation with Gavin. They lived in the same house. Of course the temptation would be there, but Gavin Daniels didn\u2019t seem like her mom\u2019s type.</p><p>Had she ever thought about the type of man her mother would be attracted to?</p><p>No. She\u2019d spent her life seeing her mother as...sexless. Selfless. More an earth goddess than a sex goddess.</p><p>But the way Gavin had kissed her mom\u2014her mom!\u2014yesterday afternoon had caused her jaw to drop. Not only the passion between them, but the familiarity. Rory realized she didn\u2019t know that part of her mother at all.</p><p>And when she\u2019d demanded an explanation, she hadn\u2019t gotten one. Which again, wasn\u2019t how her mom usually acted. She couldn\u2019t believe her mother hadn\u2019t told her about one of the biggest changes in her life...well, ever.</p><p>Rory knew she was being a brat. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Gavin specifically that she had a problem with. Maybe she was bugged by the idea of her mom being with any guy\u2014and that was stupid and childish and she didn\u2019t know what the fuck was wrong with her. She was just so...mad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the fiery looks of hatred you\u2019re sending my dad won\u2019t start his hair on fire from up here,\u201d Sierra said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking laugh riot a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still pissed off about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Especially after Sierra told her she\u2019d accidentally seen them making out weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Can\u2019t you at least admit they look happy?\u201d</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cOr don\u2019t you want your mom to be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m not teary-eyed that she\u2019s making out with your dad in the clearing while snow falls around them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sierra snorted. \u201cNo. Because you picked a fight with her first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned around, startled that Sierra nearly looked her in the eye\u2014few women were her height. \u201cNo, I tried to have a discussion with her. But she won\u2019t talk to me about this, when we talk about everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk about everything with her?\u201d Sierra asked skeptically.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I call bullshit on that.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIn fact, I know it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Rory folded her arms over her chest, her posture equally argumentative.</p><p>\u201cI was there last night, remember? Listening to your drunken rant.\u201d</p><p>Ah fuck. Goddamn Jaegermeister.</p> <p>Sierra wore a smug look. \u201cRielle doesn\u2019t know what happened between you and Dalton, does she?\u201d</p><p>Rory felt her cheeks heat up. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Did you tell your mom how many guys you\u2019ve slept with in college? Or their names? Or whether you went into the date expecting it\u2019d be the start of a relationship and not just a one-night stand?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. Closed it. How the hell was Sierra so freakin\u2019 observant? She was a spoiled sixteen-year-old kid.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to your mom about a lot of things, Rory. But you draw a line with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you so pissed off that she\u2019s doing the same thing with you? Do you really want explicit details about what sex is like between her and my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww. No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is your fucking problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fucking problem is him,\u201d she lied, embarrassed to tell her the real issue. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Sierra rolled her eyes. \u201cAssume much? And don\u2019t give me that crap about him being a\u2014\u201d she made quotes in the air around the word, \u201c\u2014McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think you were a West with the big chip you\u2019ve got on your shoulder about the McKays.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes turned shrewd. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s validity in the Wests\u2019 point of view. Seems the McKays screw everyone over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe point is, you assume that my dad will screw your mom over. But you know what? I\u2019ve never thought for a single second that your mom might be a gold digger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you even say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my dad has money. Your mom doesn\u2019t. Maybe she seduced him.\u201d</p><p>This girl was on some serious crack. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. My mom is not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? And my dad is not some asshole heartbreaker.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cSo much for our agreement last night to stay out of it,\u201d Rory said.</p><p>\u201cI tried to, but you won\u2019t let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m done. So is that why you\u2019re following me around this morning? To be all smug and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowing you around?\u201d Sierra snorted. \u201cAs if. I tracked you down to make sure you were still gonna bring up that thing before you left.\u201d</p><p>Rory played dumb. \u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing we discussed last night where you tell my dad that he\u2019s retarding my social development in Sundance by not letting me drive? Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely.\u201d</p><p>Sierra looked annoyed. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But remember you told me I could say it however I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that before or after you told Dalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Gavin asked sharply.</p><p>When had he snuck in?</p><p>Of course Gavin gave Rory the evil eye, not his precious Sierra.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? We\u2019re about to demonstrate our favorite cage fighting techniques. Sierra was bragging about a couple of illegal moves and I called her on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy money is on Sierra.\u201d He flashed his teeth. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night?\u201d Rory supplied. \u201cFine. Sierra was my designated driver. And since I don\u2019t have a curfew, I wasn\u2019t ready to leave at midnight. Her lateness is my fault.\u201d But she wouldn\u2019t apologize for it. \u201cHowever, during my chat with your daughter, I found out a few things that concerned me more than her missing curfew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as why you\u2019re basically keeping her a prisoner out here. You\u2019ve lived here almost three months? And you haven\u2019t taken her to the Golden Boot? Or to Ziggy\u2019s? Or to the Twin Pines? The only reason she went into Dewey\u2019s was to sell raffle tickets with Marin. Those are the hangout spots for everyone in this town, even teenagers.\u201d</p><p>Gavin studied Sierra but she was picking her fingernails.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what high school is like in a small town. I do. Most kids in her class have been in the same class since kindergarten. They won\u2019t welcome her with open arms because she\u2019s new. But any time she brings it up\u2014asking when she\u2019ll finally get to drive\u2014you shut her down. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re dangling her car as some sort of reward, or not letting her drive as some sort of punishment, but the truth is she\u2019s being ostracized...because of you.</p><p>\u201cShe goes to school and she comes home. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s been to three football games. She\u2019s not in any school clubs. You don\u2019t belong to a church. How are the kids supposed to get to know her when the only time they see her is at school? And you scheduled a family party on the one night of cheerleading tryouts so she couldn\u2019t even do that.\u201d</p><p>Gavin wasn\u2019t glaring at Rory; his sole focus was on Sierra. He crossed the room. \u201cSierra. Sweetheart? Can you look at me please?\u201d</p><p>Sierra raised her head.</p><p>\u201cIs what Rory\u2019s saying true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked baffled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything to me before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did! Last week and every week. But you never listen to me. You think every time I bring it up it\u2019s only about me driving and it\u2019s not. Since we moved here we hardly ever do anything. We cook here. We watch movies and TV here. We don\u2019t go out to eat and we used to go out all the time in Arizona. We used to go out and do things. You don\u2019t even let me go grocery shopping with you anymore. You work from here. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve become a hermit and you expect me to be one too. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not. Get your coat. We\u2019ll go into town for a late breakfast and we\u2019ll talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that always the first question out of your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee! This is exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>They argued all the way down the stairs.</p><p>After they were gone, Rory returned downstairs and whistled for her dog. Jingle trotted over. She patted Jingle\u2019s head. \u201cYou ready to hit the road, mutt?\u201d</p><p>Jingle barked.</p><p>Sadie loped over to see what the barking was about.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re really leaving?\u201d her mom asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that\u2019s gone on, it\u2019s probably best.\u201d She looked up at her mother, leaning against the wall in the dining room. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me throwing a tantrum. Or punishing you. I have some stuff to work through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. But why did you come home this weekend? Is there something else going on you wanted to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I probably shouldn\u2019t have come anyway. If I get back in time, I can pick up a shift at the bar and I can always use the extra cash.\u201d She regretted the words right after they left her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, if you need money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Rory slipped her coat on and zipped it. She patted her pockets to make sure she had her gloves. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get to Laramie.\u201d</p><p>Her mom hugged her tightly. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Rory closed her eyes. Her mother was so tough and strong and proud. And yet fragile. Sometimes she came off brusque, but Rory knew it was only because every day of Rielle Wetzler\u2019s life had been filled with purpose. Work to accomplish. But beneath that life-toughened demeanor was a tender heart. She hid it well, masking that vulnerability with grit. Rory\u2019s gut clenched with fear that her mom would show those soft parts of herself to Gavin and he wouldn\u2019t appreciate them. Or worse, that he\u2019d somehow destroy them and destroy part of her mom in the process. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and really scrutinized her mother. It sucked that little snot Sierra was right. Her mom did look happy. Very happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Do I have woodchips on my face or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rory fingered the short ends of her mom\u2019s hair and smiled. \u201cSo is Ainsley gloating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you if you cut your hair, you\u2019d hook yourself a man. It appears she was right.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but there\u2019s nothing in these boxes that I can use for my report,\u201d Sierra complained.</p><p>\u201cYou did call Vi and thank her, right?\u201d Then a thought occurred to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her this information is worthless, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Dad, way to think so highly of me. I\u2019m not a completely thankless brat.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of brat... Gavin held his tongue and waited for his daughter to continue.</p><p>\u201cWhen I called Vi to say thanks, after like the millionth time you reminded me, she asked if she could pick me up at the bus stop tomorrow and take me to Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Amelia\u2019s birthday is coming up and she wants me to help her shop for presents. She needs my advice, since she hasn\u2019t ever really shopped for girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin wasn\u2019t surprised that Vi had asked, but that Sierra wanted to go. \u201cYou sure?

When have I ever turned down a chance to go shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides, I like Vi. She\u2019s super sweet and her texts are really funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You text with Vi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. How else am I supposed to stay in touch with her? It\u2019s been two weeks since we had \u2018the talk\u2019 and I still don\u2019t get to drive anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Point out the weather has been shitty. But anything he said would increase her combative attitude today. \u201cFine. Go. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll call her.\u201d</p> <p>When she left the dining room table, Gavin said, \u201cForgetting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. I can\u2019t do anything right today.\u201d She backtracked and picked up her empty pie plate and stomped to the kitchen.</p><p>Gavin yelled, \u201cPut it in the dishwasher, and don\u2019t leave it in the sink.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a cupboard door slam.</p><p>So naturally he yelled, \u201cAnd clean up your damn room.\u201d</p><p>Rielle exited the swinging kitchen door, holding a plate. \u201cIs it safe to come out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch safer now that the teen terror is headed to her dungeon.\u201d He eyed the plate. \u201cWhat\u2019re you having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hot guy I know made this delicious peach pie. But I\u2019m willing to share.\u201d</p><p>He scooted his chair back and patted his thighs. \u201cSit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want a taste of you and the pie.\u201d</p><p>She straddled him. \u201cYou just want me to feed you.\u201d</p><p>His dick stirred the instant that delectable body was close to his. \u201cMaybe. Take a bite.\u201d</p><p>Rielle sliced off a chunk, popped it into her mouth and chewed. \u201cNot bad, tycoon. You are getting much better at this pie baking stuff. I liked the cherry better. Maybe we should go into business together.\u201d She cut another bite and held the fork to his mouth.</p> <p>After Gavin swallowed, he took the plate from her. \u201cI\u2019ll feed you. Open wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just like saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t add whipped cream. Because you know how much I like seeing white stuff on your lips.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. And smacked him on the shoulder. \u201cGavin Daniels, you have such a dirty mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. It goes well with my dirty mind.\u201d He latched onto her butt, pulling her pelvis closer. He traced her full bottom lip with his tongue, then he gently sucked the succulent flesh, tasting the tang of peaches and the sweetness of Rielle. \u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d She rocked forward into his erection.</p><p>\u201cYour room,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI\u2019ll eat the pie off you and then I\u2019ll eat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me crazy when you put those images in my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But I\u2019m still not hearing yes.\u201d Gavin dragged openmouthed kisses down her neck.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, seriously?\u201d Sierra complained.</p><p>Gavin tried to discreetly remove his hands from Rielle\u2019s ass.</p><p>But Sierra wasn\u2019t done stating her opinion. \u201cYou guys have two rooms you could be doing that in, not here, where I have to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your tone and think very carefully about the next thing that comes out of your mouth,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cHow is this my fault? I just came back down to get my stupid notebook so I can finish my stupid homework and find you two like... What. Ever.\u201d She snatched her notebook and stomped off.</p><p>Rielle scooted back onto his knees. \u201cWell, that was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather we were still sneaking around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She traced the edges of his goatee. \u201cWe have to remember to restrict our displays to the bedroom when your daughter is home. But god, when you touch me the flame just ignites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s turn it down to simmer for now.\u201d He kissed her once more and helped her off his lap. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, getting busted playing grab-ass made my dick deflate. I probably won\u2019t be able to get it up at all tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. I can give you a hand with that. Later.\u201d Rielle pulled him to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and watch TV so Sierra doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re going at it in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a college\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s all you watch. And you yell at the TV. Like you yelling at the players or the coaches or the referees will make a difference.\u201d</p><p>The woman had no concept of the responsibilities of a sports fan. Loud indignation about lousy calls and shitty plays were his right.</p><p>Hopefully she\u2019d fall asleep, like she always did, during one of her blasted cooking shows and he could catch the day\u2019s highlights on ESPN.</p><p>He offered her a charming smile. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Sierra burst into the kitchen, shopping bags hanging from both arms. \u201cDad! You have to see all the totally awesome stuff I got today.\u201d</p><p>Vi trailed behind her, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey, Vi. Looks like you guys had a productive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have time for a drink?\u201d</p><p>Vi appeared taken aback by Gavin\u2019s question. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrown and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have one. Light on the Crown since I\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>Rielle skirted the pile of shopping bags, intending to duck out of the kitchen, but he circled her wrist, stopping her. \u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. So stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Gavin mixed Vi\u2019s drink and poured a soda for Sierra. \u201cAll right, sweetheart, tell me about your day and show me what you got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we went to the toy store. There were so many awesome fun toys it was hard to pick one. So I got Amelia a Gloworm because I remembered how much I loved mine.\u201d</p><p>That caused a pang. Didn\u2019t seem that long ago Sierra was dragging that dirty, well-loved Glo-worm everywhere.</p><p>\u201cThen we went shopping for girl clothes at the western store. Omigod the stuff is so cute. You should see the tiny jean skirt with pink leggings and a button-up western shirt with lace edging. And she\u2019s getting matching pink cowgirl boots with rhinestones!\u201d</p><p>Sierra was talking enthusiastically about all the things they\u2019d bought...for someone else?</p><p>\u201cWhich leads me to this.\u201d Sierra flipped the lid off a shoebox, taking out a pair of pink cowgirl books with rhinestones on the toes and dark pink leather decorating the shaft. \u201cAren\u2019t these the coolest boots you\u2019ve ever seen? I wanted some so bad...\u201d She squealed and leaned over to hug Vi. \u201cThank you so, so much, Grams, for buying them for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d</p><p>Gavin went motionless. Since when did Sierra call Vi...Grams?</p><p>Since Vi started buying things for her.</p><p>\u201cI cannot wait to wear these to school tomorrow. Marin will be so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bottoms have a slick finish so make sure you scuff them up first,\u201d Vi warned.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Sierra hugged her boots. \u201cIt is insane how much I love these things already.\u201d</p><p>Vi laughed.</p><p>Sierra tossed the box on the floor and snagged another bag. \u201cThen we went to this boutique called Sweet Repeats that sells the funkiest things. Jewelry, clothes, scarves, jackets.\u201d She grinned. \u201cCheck this out.\u201d She held up a black suede jacket with fringe on the underside of each sleeve. \u201cLook at the metal studs on the lapels and down the front. It\u2019s bad-ass, but doesn\u2019t make me look like a thug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can wear black with anything,\u201d Vi pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI will wear it with everything, I promise. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Vi had bought her a fucking leather coat, too?</p><p>Sierra pulled out yet more things Vi had purchased for her.</p><p>A pair of jeans with rhinestones on the rear pockets and the front pockets.</p><p>A fur-lined vest.</p><p>A long-sleeved thermal shirt the same pink as the boots with Cruel Girl emblazoned across the front.</p><p>A bag overflowing with bangles and baubles.</p><p>\u201cAnd last, but certainly not least...\u201d Sierra unwrapped a cork bulletin board. She piled two stacks of fabric and two spools of satin ribbon on top of it. \u201cA memory board for my room. We\u2019re gonna fancy it up next week, huh, Grams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. As long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with your school work.\u201d</p><p>Sierra jammed all her new items back in the bags and hugged Vi. \u201cThank you so much for today. I had a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Vi brushed the hair back from Sierra\u2019s face. \u201cI did too. We\u2019ll do it again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Gotta put my stuff away!\u201d Sierra announced and raced from the room.</p><p>Gavin swallowed a gulp of his drink. \u201cWell, that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taking Sierra out and buying her everything she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this a problem for you? Because I didn\u2019t ask your permission to buy my granddaughter a few things?\u201d Vi held up a finger to stop his protest. \u201cYes, Sierra is my granddaughter. You may still have a problem with our family ties, but she doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t expect her to have your issues with the situation, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is it a coincidence, that she started calling you Grams after you bought all that shit for her?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSierra has been calling me Grams for months. Never in front of you, because she\u2019s been afraid of how you\u2019d react. Now I see that her fear was justified.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Sierra come to him with this name change business? \u201cAnd because she\u2019s accepting of the family tie, that gives you the right to try and buy her love or affection or attention or whatever it is you want from her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vi skewered him with a hard look. \u201cThat gives me the right to spend my own damn money however I see fit. I bought gifts for my other granddaughter, so it\u2019s only fair I do the same for Sierra. And don\u2019t forget, you wouldn\u2019t let us buy her anything for her sixteenth birthday. Then today she sees me buying things for Amelia\u2019s birthday? How do you think that made her feel?\u201d She jabbed her finger at him. \u201cExactly like you do. Like you aren\u2019t really part of the family. Like some family members matter more to me than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you move here, Gavin, if you didn\u2019t want your daughter to be part of our family? You expect her to stand at arm\u2019s length like you do? She is not you. You are her father, but you shouldn\u2019t have the only say in whether we can build a relationship. Doesn\u2019t what she wants matter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, trust me; she\u2019ll be your BFF if you keep buying her things every time you\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason Sierra could possibly want to spend time with me? That\u2019s bullshit. You\u2019re making horrible assumptions about her. And about me. That girl is not shallow, and yet I suspect sometimes you treat her like her mother. So you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when she acts exactly how you treat her.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to buy her love. I\u2019m not fostering a relationship with Sierra to get to you either, because if I thought I could buy your love? Son, I would\u2019ve gladly paid the price the day you came looking for us. As far as today? I won\u2019t apologize. I won\u2019t let your paranoia and distrust ruin the wonderful afternoon that I got to spend with my granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other without speaking.</p> <p>Gavin knew Vi had several legitimate points, but he was still pissy.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with this right now.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he went looking for Rielle that he realized she\u2019d witnessed the whole scene...and he\u2019d left her in the kitchen.</p><p>Rielle should\u2019ve snuck out when she had the chance. Maybe she still could. But one look at Vi\u2019s miserable face and she knew she wouldn\u2019t. Especially after Vi drained her drink. \u201cWant another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have the whole damn bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo drink? Or to smack Gavin upside the head?\u201d Rielle asked lightly.</p> <p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Vi studied the ice cubes in her glass. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the wrong.\u201d</p><p>A statement Rielle let lie.</p><p>\u201cI keep hoping he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. However, it may take more time than you think it should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing pushy, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Gavin has his own way of thinking.\u201d Rielle didn\u2019t say more. She wouldn\u2019t violate the trust he\u2019d placed in her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being ridiculous if he believes I was trying to buy Sierra\u2019s affection. When he lived in Arizona, I followed his parameters. But then he moves here, down the road from us, and I\u2019m still supposed to wait for him to give the green light so I can get to know Sierra? Or she can get to know me? Gavin sure doesn\u2019t have a problem with Charlie spending time with Sierra, or that Charlie buys her food and little tokens every damn day. But he objects when I do essentially the same thing? That feels a lot like punishment and a little like manipulation.\u201d</p><p>Rielle agreed. \u201cSo you, or Charlie, or both of you haven\u2019t brought any of this up with Gavin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re aware of Gavin\u2019s boundaries. Before he moved here we kept contact casual because we were afraid if we pushed too hard, he\u2019d cut off all contact with us.\u201d Vi\u2019s chin trembled, but she firmed it.</p><p>In that moment Rielle clearly saw the family resemblance between mother and son and her heart broke for both of them.</p><p>\u201cDoes he want me to apologize for giving him up for adoption?\u201d Vi asked softly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this sounds simplistic, but have you sat him down and tried to explain to him what you went through? What it really meant to be pregnant at sixteen? How you felt during the pregnancy and after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since he first came to us and I was in such a...state of shock that I don\u2019t think I explained myself very well. He hasn\u2019t brought it up since and I\u2019m afraid to.\u201d Vi looked at her. \u201cHave you talked to him about your life as a pregnant girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. But he doesn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s...vague to him. Like watching a forgettable TV movie of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re different sides of the same coin, aren\u2019t we? You kept your baby; I gave mine up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were so nice to me and Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of guilt? Maybe. Nothing against your folks, Ree, but I got the feeling they saw Rory as a mistake. I admired you for doing what I couldn\u2019t. So part of me always wondered if I\u2019d kept Gavin, if some woman would\u2019ve taken the time to make sure I was okay.\u201d</p><p>From the moment they\u2019d met Rielle had seen behind Vi\u2019s brusque nature to the sweet thoughtful woman beneath. It hadn\u2019t escaped her notice that a lot of people said the same thing about her being so prickly, which was probably why she and Vi had always gotten along so well. \u201cI appreciated those random visits. Not because you brought over a bag of groceries, but because you spent time with me and listened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish I could\u2019ve done more. But I was happy that you broke free of your parents\u2019...mold, for lack of a better word, and raised Rory how you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory had as normal a childhood as I could give her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the gist of this? Gavin doesn\u2019t know how thrilled I was to get to buy Sierra a pair of pink cowgirl boots? Every girl her age needs something frivolous. When I was her age I had the world on my shoulders and I\u2019m happy that she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Rielle reached for her hand, her heart hurting for Vi. \u201cGavin lashed out before he thought it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should consider it a good sign that he cared enough to get pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a healthy way of looking at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask...does he talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout his relationship with you and Charlie? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he does open up to you about other things?\u201d Vi clarified, \u201cI don\u2019t want specifics. I just want to know that he\u2019s finally got a woman in his life who cares about him like he deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about him. He knows that. He\u2019s just adrift in a lot of aspects of his life. And his ex-wife really did a number on him so he doesn\u2019t trust easily. Even with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I was happy when Sierra told me about you and Gavin. You two are good for each other. But between us, I won\u2019t tell him that, in case he gets it in his fool head to rebel against my approval and break it off with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. And I won\u2019t tell him he was acting like an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, go right ahead and tell him that part.\u201d</p><p>After Vi left Rielle heated up a plate of leftovers. One thing that hadn\u2019t changed in their relationship was separate mealtimes. She\u2019d done that intentionally\u2014it\u2019d be easy to get into the habit of cooking for him and Sierra and horn in on their family time.</p><p>Gavin was frustrated by Rielle\u2019s \u201cseparatist\u201d attitude. But Sierra needed that alone time with her father. Just the two of them, cooking together and catching up on their days.</p><p>Rielle found Gavin upstairs, watching a game. She plopped down beside him. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Still a little pissy if you want to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I trot my little self downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. But if you expect me to be charming and witty? Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She ran her hand over his short, bristly hair. \u201cSometimes I like a broody man. It\u2019s a different kind of sexy.\u201d</p><p>He expelled a disbelieving snort.</p><p>\u201cYou could drag me into your bedroom, using terse commands while having your wicked way with me. No talking. Just intense sex. Fast and demanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to get me hard, Ree? \u2019Cause it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>She angled her head to place a soft, sucking kiss on the skin below his ear. \u201cI\u2019m not busy now, Mr. Hot Brooding Man.\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s music drifted down the hallway. Rielle shifted back so Sierra didn\u2019t see her mauling her father.</p><p>Seconds later, Sierra appeared. \u201cI\u2019m starved, Dad. What\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t thought about it. I could heat some soup. Or there\u2019s lunch meat for sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for something like pork chops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fix that tomorrow night.\u201d Gavin lifted a box off the floor. \u201cMust be your day to get presents. This came from your mom while you were shopping with Grams.\u201d</p><p>A snarky remark from Gavin? He was pissy.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Sierra grabbed a pocketknife from the bar. She carefully slid the tip of the knife along the airmail tape covering the box. As soon as she opened the flaps, a heavy perfume poured out.</p><p>Rielle sneezed.</p><p>Sierra offered an apologetic smile. \u201cSorry. Mom loves spritzing perfume on everything.\u201d She excitedly pulled out wrinkled sheets of white tissue paper dotted with black images of the Eiffel Tower. Then she stopped. A bewildered look settled on her face.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>Rielle watched the girl struggle to get control. Sierra tipped her head down but not fast enough; Rielle saw two tears plop onto the tissue paper.</p><p>Then she reached into the box and angrily threw a handful of material on the coffee table.</p><p>Upon seeing the contents, Rielle\u2019s stomach dropped and she shot Gavin a sideways glance.</p><p>He appeared calm, but the air around him vibrated with fury.</p><p>Sierra handled each piece of lingerie. A black peignoir, sheer except for the lace edging and the tiny, strategically placed pink bows. A pair of matching G-string panties. The next piece she held up was a short white bustier with what looked like padded cups. Another pair of panties to match. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one said anything. Rielle expected Sierra to explode with the drama sixteen-year-olds were prone to. But she just shoved the lingerie back in the box.</p><p>\u201cSierra, sweetheart. Can you look at me, please?\u201d Gavin said gently.</p><p>She glanced up. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t know me at all, does she? This is what she sends me from Paris? Not perfume or chocolates or even something tacky like a plastic Eiffel Tower, but something she likes?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin was on his feet, pulling Sierra to hers, hugging her. He murmured to her, comforting her as he led her downstairs.</p><p>As bad as she felt for Sierra, this was another reminder that Gavin had a higher priority than spending his free time with his live-in girlfriend. He needed to stay focused on raising his daughter. He also needed to deal with his hot and cold attitude toward Vi. That attitude didn\u2019t extend to Charlie, as far as she\u2019d seen.</p><p>Rielle realized she\u2019d been lax in keeping in contact with Rory since the incident a few weeks back. She returned to her room and called her, expecting to settle in for a chat, only to have that parental gut wrenching worry as her level-headed daughter sobbed hysterically. School stressed her out. Her landlord was a prick. Her best friend in the Ag program was taking a job in Brazil. They\u2019d overscheduled her at the bar. After Rielle calmed her down, she promised she\u2019d spend the weekend in Laramie. She packed, made last minute phone calls and forced herself to sit at her spinning wheel and finish a few odd projects rather than pace and fret about her daughter.</p><p>A few hours later Gavin knocked on her door. She let him in only after she\u2019d promised herself to resist the heated way he looked at her that always made her clothes fly off.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t any sign of her insistent lover. He dropped into the chair next to the bed. \u201cSorry I bailed on you before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo worries. Sierra is your priority, as it should be. She had upheaval in her life today so it\u2019s natural she\u2019d need her dad. I assume she\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He dry-washed his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck Ellen was thinking, giving a sixteen-year-old fuck-me lingerie. Jesus. How oblivious is she?\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t comment, just let him ramble and started winding loose yarn into skeins.</p><p>\u201cPlus, there wasn\u2019t a note, or anything personal.\u201d He slumped back in the chair. \u201cSierra hasn\u2019t talked to her mom since that phone call, what...? Last month? I mean yeah, half the time I think Ellen is psychotic and she\u2019s manipulative and Sierra is better off. But Sierra misses her and it\u2019s cruel how Ellen just cut Sierra out of her life.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t see the parallels to his relationship with Vi, so she kept her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cI told Sierra she didn\u2019t have to write her mother a thank you note for an inappropriate gift. But now I\u2019m thinking if we let it slide, Ellen will see it as acceptable and send her more of the same\u2014or worse.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled more yarn.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll have Sierra call her tomorrow from my office so I can hear what she says.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra is your kid, Gavin. You know what\u2019s best for her, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pissed off at me too?\u201d He released a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left you with Vi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Vi. I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019d be better if you asked her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You are mad. Are you so damn busy fussing with your knitting you can\u2019t even look at me?\u201d</p> <p>Rielle glanced up. \u201cA, I\u2019m not knitting. B, I\u2019m not mad at you. How you handle your family business is your business, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I fucked up with Vi today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, meaning I don\u2019t want to get involved. I\u2019ve been neighbors with the McKays for years, and that hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I won\u2019t jeopardize that because I\u2019ll still be neighbors with them when I build my new place.\u201d</p><p>That reminder angered him. \u201cSo you have no opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did I\u2019d keep it to myself. Look, we\u2019re roommates and lovers. It\u2019s not my place to offer you advice or suggestions on how to deal with your family or to play referee when things don\u2019t go your way.\u201d</p><p>His mouth flattened. \u201cThanks for letting me know where I stand with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. You don\u2019t get to get pissy with me. I like you. I like spending time with you, naked or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. We agreed to continue to lead our separate lives. We agreed that if we each had free time, we\u2019d try and spend it together.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stood and started unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cFine. I\u2019m free right now. Let\u2019s fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Didn\u2019t you just tell me this is all we are? Fuck buddies? So come on.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never seen this side of him and she didn\u2019t like it. \u201cNot interested. Now get out of my room.\u201d</p><p>His shirt fell open. \u201cOh, so you can proposition me, like you did upstairs three hours ago? But I can\u2019t proposition you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fuck is not a proposition. It\u2019s a demand, said in anger, just to be a dick.\u201d She tossed the yarn winder aside. \u201cKnow what? I don\u2019t have to put up with this shit. Get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? This approach has worked for you in the past. No pretty words, no foreplay, just ripping our clothes off and fucking on the floor like animals. What\u2019s different now, Rielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now. And fuck you for coming in here and taking out your shitty day on me. And double fuck you for taking something that\u2019s good between us and twisting it into something ugly.\u201d</p><p>The stark realization of how asinine he\u2019d acted hit him. \u201cGod. Rielle. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>When he moved toward her, she recoiled. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we talk...?\u201d</p><p>She vehemently shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s best if we take a break. I\u2019m leaving for Laramie tomorrow to see Rory anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? Since when?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he sighed.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Please drive safe and I\u2019ll see you when you get home.\u201d He walked out and quietly shut the door.</p><p>After living in each other\u2019s pockets for the last couple months, a cooling off period would do them both good.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Gavin hung over the top of the wooden corral, watching Quinn drive cows into a semi-truck as Dalton and Tell pushed the cattle into the loading chute. Ben was on horseback culling from the corralled herd, while Brandt\u2014also on horseback\u2014chased down the runaways and drove them back to the penned area.</p><p>He\u2019d been surprised when Charlie had called, inviting him to watch them loading cattle to take to auction. He\u2019d been curious about how the auction process worked differently than sending cattle to a feedlot.</p><p>With temps in the low teens and the gray skies spitting snow, he bundled up, figuring this weather wouldn\u2019t faze hardcore ranchers like the McKays.</p><p>But Gavin also wondered if Charlie had issued the invite to chastise Gavin for the argument he\u2019d had with Vi. An argument they hadn\u2019t resolved.</p><p>During a lull in the action, Quinn wandered over to the corral. The man was sweating despite the frigid air temp. \u201cDad, I might need a hand in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Quinn flashed Gavin one of his rare grins. \u201cEver ridden in a fully loaded cattle truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need someone to ride with me. And since the old man is retired, he\u2019s no help, sitting at home with his feet propped on the coffee table having Mom wait on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI done my share of cattle sale runs, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back from the sale barn tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but it\u2019ll be late. And the weather and road conditions are flat out gonna suck.\u201d Quinn crossed his arms over his chest as if expecting Gavin to refuse. \u201cYou up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Do I have to help unload cattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Ben and Tell will be in the truck behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I was hoping I\u2019d get my own cattle prod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d Quinn wandered back to his post when Dalton yelled for him.</p><p>\u201cSo it looks like all the McKays help each other throughout the year?\u201d Gavin asked Charlie.</p><p>\u201cCarson has enough hands with his boys that he hasn\u2019t needed much help. Same with Cal\u2019s twins. None of them wanted to deal with Casper so he made his boys do everything on their own. Same with me\u2019n Quinn and Ben and Chase if he was around. Brandt, Tell and Dalton increased the size of their herd and bought more land after Luke died so Quinn and Ben have been helping them and they help us.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt works out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask about the bad history between Casper and your brothers?\u201d</p><p>Charlie remained quiet for so long Gavin suspected he was dodging the question. Then he scratched his chin with the back of his gloved hand. \u201cI wish I could say there was some defining moment when it all fell apart, but it ain\u2019t that simple. As twins, Carson and Calvin have always been two peas in a pod\u2014no one was surprised when they married sisters.\u201d A ghost of a smile appeared. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t happy they were West sisters but that\u2019s another story. Anyway, I think Casper had middle child syndrome. Dad had high expectations for his oldest boys and Mom doted on me as the youngest because I was a sickly kid. Casper got lost in the shuffle. He became a wild man and took hell raisin\u2019 to a new level. Hard to look at him now and see it, but Casper had the type of good looks and charm the ladies loved.</p><p>\u201cWe were all shocked when he married Joan Tellman. I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t a supportive brother to Casper then, because that was right around the time Vi moved away. I moped for a few months. Then I thought; screw it, I\u2019m the last single McKay and I\u2019m gonna cut loose. I screwed any woman who\u2019d have me, figuring that\u2019d erase Vi from my mind, but it never did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen my dad had a heart attack. He recovered but couldn\u2019t head up the ranch. He put my oldest brothers in charge, moved out of the ranch house, giving it to Carson and Carolyn\u2014and we set him up in a trailer between Carson\u2019s and Calvin\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second. Were you living in the house with your dad when he had the heart attack?\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. \u201cI was the one who found him out in the yard. At first he refused to go to the hospital. Swore he\u2019d rather die on McKay land. I called Casper and we got Dad loaded up and hauled to town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sounded like a tough old bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jed McKay was an asshole or an angel, depending on your point of view and the day. Anyway, we\u2019d just bought this place, a couple thousand acres on the far south end of McKay land with two houses. Casper and Joan claimed one place and I took the other. Around that time, Casper had turned into a raging asshole. Everything changed in the family dynamic because I felt that Dad and my brothers were punishing me, making me live by Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Casper know you felt that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Another year passed and Dad had another heart attack. He couldn\u2019t live by himself. Logically he should\u2019ve moved in with Casper and Joan. But Dad refused and insisted on living with Cal and Kimi. Casper took it as Dad would rather live with a West family enemy than live with him. Made him even more bitter and I didn\u2019t blame him. Meanwhile, we\u2019re all workin\u2019 the ranch and Carson is buying land up closer to where he lives. Ticked me and Casper off because we knew we\u2019d never get to use those grazing areas and technically, the acreage belonged to us too. Then our neighbors the Burkes wanted out of Wyoming and didn\u2019t offer the land to us first. Not only is that an unwritten western tradition, but the Burkes sold it to a couple from out of state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wetzlers,\u201d Gavin inserted.</p> <p>\u201cYep. They were an odd lot. So I gotta be honest, even though it\u2019s been a long time comin\u2019, I\u2019m happy the biggest chunk of that land is finally in McKay hands.\u201d Charlie shot him a sideways glance. \u201cSo to speak.\u201d</p><p>As much as the McKays had wanted that section and the discord it\u2019d caused when he\u2019d bought it, no one had approached Gavin on utilizing it. And he was such a greenhorn he had no idea how to offer it.</p><p>\u201cFor a few years me\u2019n Casper worked together. That\u2019s why I\u2019m more tolerant with him than Carson or Cal. Then Vi returned to Wyoming. I hadn\u2019t seen her in four years and I knew the reason I hadn\u2019t found a woman to share my life with was because I was waiting for her to come back.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t know what to say. He wouldn\u2019t have believed Charlie was capable of telling him something so intensely personal.</p><p>\u201cMost people think they know what kind of woman Vi is. She\u2019s bossy, nosy and opinionated. But that ain\u2019t what I see. That ain\u2019t who she is with me or to me. Back then or now.\u201d Charlie scratched his chin again. \u201cProbably TMI as Sierra would say, huh?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly.</p> <p>\u201cI know you and Vi had words, Gavin. Alls I\u2019m gonna say is you need to figure out a way to deal with it and her because I hate to see my wife hurtin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always been so protective of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Wasn\u2019t your...\u201d</p><p>Gavin watched the rancher struggle to ask about the man who raised him.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Dan the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad had a lot of great qualities. But being a protective husband wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Charlie didn\u2019t respond. He just kept focused on Quinn and Ben\u2019s activities.</p><p>So Gavin kept talking. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t faithful to my mother. As a kid I didn\u2019t know. When I started working for him, I noticed he took long lunches. Wasn\u2019t smart, but I followed him. He\u2019d gone to some woman\u2019s apartment. When I confronted him he told me all men cheat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Charlie spat. \u201cI\u2019ve been married to Vi thirty-eight years and not once, even when we hit rough patches, did I consider climbing into another woman\u2019s bed. A man loves a woman, he loves her. Period. He cares for her and he protects her. Not because that\u2019s his job but because he oughta want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It was a point of contention for us up until the day he died. His excuse, or explanation, or whatever, was that as long as he provided for my mother, she didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I saw it hurt her, but she never told him to stop. Never threatened to leave him.\u201d Gavin poked at loose splinters on the wooden post. \u201cWhen I found out my wife was cheating on me? I was more pissed off than hurt. I knew it wasn\u2019t my goddamn fault that she cheated. My mom was the most vocal person in encouraging me to divorce her. She said cheaters don\u2019t ever reform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were close to Grace?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape his notice that Charlie didn\u2019t refer to Grace and Dan as Gavin\u2019s mom and dad. He obviously considered Gavin his son, not theirs, which was fucked up on a number of levels that neither of them had begun to address in the last two years. \u201cYes. Not to get off on a strange tangent, but my adoption was more her idea than his.\u201d</p><p>Charlie looked at him sharply. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was forty and my dad was forty-eight when they adopted me. He was busy running his...affairs\u2014\u201d Charlie snorted, \u201c\u2014and having a baby gave her something to do. I never felt neglected or anything growing up\u2014I had a great childhood\u2014it\u2019s just an observation I made after I had a child of my own and was so much more involved in raising her. Like I said, my dad had a lot of great qualities, but he wasn\u2019t much of a family man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen in my opinion, he wasn\u2019t much of a man,\u201d Charlie said.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Quinn shouted, \u201cI need that help now.\u201d</p><p>Charlie slipped through the gate without another word.</p><p>Gavin wasn\u2019t as bothered by the conversation as he feared he\u2019d be. Charlie deserved to know what kind of father Dan Daniels had been to him. Not that Charlie could do anything about it and Gavin wasn\u2019t looking for reassurance that Charlie would\u2019ve raised him differently. The best thing Gavin had learned from his father was that he never wanted to be that type of father to his own child. And maybe some small part of Gavin wanted Charlie to know he was more like him.</p><p>He noticed when Charlie spoke to his sons and nephews, they listened. He remembered being so rapt with his father, hoarding his pearls of wisdom. Thinking the man could do no wrong. After learning his dad had continually cheated on his mother, Gavin wondered if he cheated in business too\u2014which led Gavin to diversify the business after he\u2019d inherited it.</p><p>Once the semi was loaded and closed up, Quinn parked it down the road and backed up the other semi-trailer to the loading chute. Took less time to load cattle into the second one than the first.</p><p>Quinn motioned him over. \u201cYou\u2019re riding shotgun. Ben and Tell are ready to roll.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked over to see if Charlie wanted to speak to him before he left, but he was helping Dalton with the horses.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019d said everything they needed to say.</p><p>Sierra stood at the kitchen island fixing a snack when she heard a series of thuds on the front porch. She slipped into the dining room and glanced at Sadie, curled up, snoring in her doggie bed. Did that mean she knew who was at the door at seven on a Saturday night, so she wasn\u2019t worried for Sierra\u2019s safety?</p><p>Or...Sadie was a lousy guard dog.</p><p>The heavy wooden door in the foyer didn\u2019t have a peep hole. As she weighed her options about checking out the noise, two raps sounded.</p><p>\u201cS-s-sierra, it\u2019s B-b-boone.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door quickly. \u201cBoone? Omigod! What are you...you\u2019re covered in snow.\u201d She grabbed the lapels of his coat and jerked him inside, and they nearly tumbled to the floor.</p><p>Boone righted himself. Then he was shaking really hard as he leaned against the door and it slammed shut. \u201cTh-thanks. S-s-sorry if I interrupted s-s-something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Her gaze swept over him. He didn\u2019t move. His eyes blinking drowsily.</p><p>\u201cBoone? Have you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I...d-d-damn.\u201d His teeth chattered like crazy.</p><p>After all her dad\u2019s lectures about frostbite and the dangers of hypothermia, Sierra recognized the signs immediately. She didn\u2019t think; she just acted. She tugged off Boone\u2019s gloves. His hands were as hard and cold as icicles. Her gaze moved to his face. He wore an Elmer Fudd hat which covered his head and ears. It also had a pull-down face mask so only his eyes and lips were visible. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have opened the door if you\u2019d had this over your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-s-smart ch-choice.\u201d</p><p>Sierra placed her hands on his cold cheeks and he made an odd noise, so she snatched them back. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll leave your hat on.\u201d She unzipped his coveralls. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to move if you want to get out of these clothes and warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cK-k-kay.\u201d Boone leaned forward.</p><p>She stripped the coveralls off his arms and then pulled them to his ankles. \u201cKick them off.\u201d</p><p>He fell back against the door as he kicked the wide-legged coveralls aside.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d She ran to the linen closet for bedding, grabbing a heavy wool blanket and a down comforter. She wrapped the blanket around his shoulders, gathering the edges in front of his chest. \u201cCan you hold on to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll t-t-try.\u201d</p><p>Sierra dropped to her knees and brushed the snow off the laces of his work boots. It took several tries until the frozen leather would cooperate.</p><p>Boone shifted feet so she could pull the boot off.</p><p>She curled her hands around his foot. At least his socks weren\u2019t wet and his feet weren\u2019t blocks of ice. By the time she\u2019d finished removing the second boot, he\u2019d stopped shaking so hard. She stood and eyed him. \u201cYou warmed up enough to walk to the fireplace?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because I can\u2019t carry you.\u201d She smirked. \u201cAlthough, I could probably knock you over and drag you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p> <p>He followed her into the living room. She dragged a chair directly in front of the fireplace and ordered, \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Boone sat.</p><p>She tucked the comforter around his front side. He watched her every move without speaking, his eyes locked on her face, and it made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow about if I make you hot tea.\u201d She practically ran to the kitchen. Her face was on fire, forcing her to rest her forehead on the cold marble to cool down. Okay. She\u2019d acted like it was no big deal...while she\u2019d freakin\u2019 stripped Boone West.</p><p>The water took forever to heat. She grabbed a teabag from Rielle\u2019s cupboard and squirted a bunch of honey into the hot water in case the tea tasted like crap.</p> <p>Back in the living room, she noticed Sadie had parked herself in front of the fire, her happy little doggie mug resting on Boone\u2019s feet. His eyes were closed.</p><p>She nudged his shoulder. \u201cBoone. You\u2019re not supposed to sleep if you\u2019ve been chilled.\u201d</p><p>He mumbled, \u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>She shoved him harder. \u201cBoone. Wake up right now or I\u2019ll call your ambulance buddies here to haul your cold ass to the hospital and wouldn\u2019t that be embarrassing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a mean streak, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Good. He knew who she was. Sierra was peering directly into his face when those long lashes lifted. He gazed into her eyes so deeply her belly fluttered. Man. He had the prettiest eyes, even when they seemed slightly vacant.</p><p>\u201cYou want a hot drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Upon returning she saw Boone had stirred, removing his hat and lowering the comforter to free his arms. He stroked Sadie\u2019s fur.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She handed him the water.</p><p>He gulped a couple mouthfuls and wiped his lips with the back of his hand. His eyes were more alert. \u201cHow\u2019d an Arizona girl recognize hypothermia symptoms and know treatment procedures?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dad has been grilling me on this since the first week we moved here. He, ah, knows I\u2019d probably walk out in the snow in flip-flops, without a coat, so he\u2019s been horrifying me with worst-case scenarios. I\u2019d tell him that I remembered everything and helped you, but he\u2019d gloat too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man, teaching you that stuff. Most people who move out here don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d He took another drink of water. \u201cIs your dad around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he went to an auction with my uncles and Rielle is in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d be here. Didn\u2019t see any cars when I walked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalked up? Did you have car trouble or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was riding my motorcycle home and the gas gauge must\u2019ve broken or something because it said I had half a tank when I left town.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou were riding your motorcycle in this weather? Why?\u201d</p><p>He looked directly at her. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>What? Didn\u2019t everyone have a car?</p><p>\u201cThe bike quit about a mile from here and I pushed it to your barn because I remembered seeing cans of gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You pushed your motorcycle a mile, in the dark, in subzero temperatures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. While I filled the tank outside the barn, exhaustion set in and I sort of...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhased out,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long.\u201d Boone squinted at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s seven-thirty? I left Sundance at four.\u201d</p><p>Sierra got right in his face. \u201cYou are lucky you aren\u2019t dead, Boone West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. I was confused when I woke up but I remembered I had to tell you I\u2019d borrowed some fuel. Didn\u2019t want anyone to think I stole it.\u201d He smiled and lightly bumped his forehead to hers. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to add to the bad blood between the Wests and McKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughtful. Except can you imagine how much worse it\u2019d be if you\u2019d been found dead on McKay land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your name was Daniels,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She whapped him on the shoulder. \u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I hang my coveralls over the chair so they dry out before I head home?\u201d</p><p>Of course tough guy Boone would ride his motorcycle home after a close call with hypothermia. But she wouldn\u2019t have his stubbornness on her conscience. \u201cSure. But before you leave here, promise me you\u2019ll call your dad or your uncles or someone, and tell them exactly which way you\u2019re going, so if your bike breaks down again, they\u2019ll know where to look for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could skip all that shit and you could just give me a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised my dad I wouldn\u2019t go out of the house under any circumstances except for fire.\u201d God. Boone probably thought she was such a baby.</p><p>Warm fingers lifted her chin. \u201cHey. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he removed his hand, she blurted out, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always trying to feed me.\u201d He patted his stomach. \u201cDo I look like I need fattening up?\u201d</p><p>No, you look perfect. But maybe you should lift your shirt anyway so I can see your six-pack abs just to make sure.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not hungry you can come into the kitchen and watch me eat because I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwist my arm. I\u2019ll put another log on the fire.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou can cook me up some bacon and some beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know...that\u2019s a line from that Tompall Glaser song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of him. Is he local?\u201d</p><p>Boone shook his head. \u201cHe was with the Outlaws. Your musical education is sorely lacking, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Sierra heated leftover angel hair pasta with basil cream sauce in the microwave. Boone watched as she diced a tomato and grated parmesan. She gestured to the cupboard with her knife. \u201cYou wanna grab plates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She divided the pasta in half, and sprinkled cheese and tomatoes on each pile. \u201cDig in.\u201d</p><p>Boone wound a good-sized bite around his fork and popped it in his mouth. \u201cThat is fantastic. Eating here is like dining at a fancy restaurant. You should be a chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to do after high school. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>Sierra wasn\u2019t as hungry as she\u2019d thought and Boone ended up polishing off her plate of pasta too.</p><p>\u201cThanks for an outstanding meal. I feel like I oughta leave a tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if you do the dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d He cleared the plates. When he opened the door to the dishwasher, she said, \u201cNope. Not that dishwasher. This one.\u201d</p><p>Boone frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one is Rielle\u2019s; this one is ours. I know it\u2019s weird, but we had to divide the kitchen space and set boundaries after we moved in.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of pointless now that my dad and Rielle are sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How do you know? Did you catch them goin\u2019 at it?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNo. They\u2019re more discreet than that, except I catch them making out all the time. My dad has never had a girlfriend, which is weird when you think about it.\u201d She\u2019d wondered if he was gay. And she\u2019d tried several times to let her dad know she\u2019d be fine with it if he preferred men.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was seeing someone in Arizona he never brought her home when I was there.\u201d She rinsed the dishrag and hung it over the sink divider. \u201cMy dad\u2019s actually been a lot happier since we moved here. I wonder how much of that has to do with her.\u201d After Rory\u2019s little come-to-Jesus talk, he\u2019d started doing more things with her outside the house. That\u2019d taken some of the sting out of her feeling of isolation, but not all. She felt Boone staring at her and she looked up. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you asked if he\u2019s practicing safe sex?\u201d</p><p>Sierra laughed. \u201cThat\u2019d go over well.\u201d</p><p>Boone wandered into the great room, inspecting Rielle\u2019s funky furnishings. \u201cSo if your dad didn\u2019t date, what about your mom? You said your parents divorced when you were five, right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d remembered that? \u201cUh-huh. My mom? She\u2019s a flake.\u201d</p><p>He whirled around and grinned. \u201cHey, so\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Did your mom spontaneously bail to France with her twenty-eight-year-old boyfriend? And she\u2019s lying about her age, swearing she\u2019s just a few years older, when it\u2019s a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met her boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Sierra shook her head. \u201cGet this; she told him I\u2019m her sister. If my dad knew that he\u2019d lose his mind. Even when my dad annoys me, he\u2019s always acted like he wants to be around me, not because he has to take care of me.\u201d Not always the case with her mom. Her mom was fun and smiles when they were doing what she wanted, which was most of the time. So it made no sense why Sierra missed her so much, but she did. Especially after she\u2019d called to confront her mom about the package of lingerie she\u2019d sent as a gift. Her mom had cried and apologized and swore she\u2019d make it up to her. And Sierra believed her\u2014even when her dad made cracks about lowering her expectations.</p><p>\u201cAt least you had one good parent. Both mine sucked.\u201d Boone sat across from her. \u201cMy dad was always gone. When I was a kid and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always lived with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I lived with Mom until third grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she get married or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything changed when my dad found out...\u201d He clenched his hands into fists and he looked at the floor. \u201cFuck. Never mind. Forget I said anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unnerved by his abrupt mood swing to anger, Sierra waited for him to explain, but he stayed quiet, almost closed off. \u201cWhat did he find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you being abused?\u201d</p> <p>His head snapped up. \u201cBelieve it or not, I would\u2019ve preferred that \u2019cause I could have fought back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now after that remark, you\u2019ve got to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoone. Some part of you wants me to know if you mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I did. It\u2019s just so fucking...embarrassing,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI never talk about this shit. Why do I just spill my guts every freakin\u2019 time I see you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re friends.\u201d She scooted next to him. \u201cBecause everyone needs someone to talk to and you can trust me. I promise whatever you share with me will stay between us. So tell me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Another moment passed. Boone didn\u2019t look at her when he said, \u201cMy dad found out that I couldn\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed hard at his confession.</p><p>\u201cI was eight years old and I couldn\u2019t read a single word. My mom played dumb, but the truth was she was either drunk or high and she didn\u2019t give a shit, hell, she didn\u2019t know where I was half the time. Dad felt guilty, which made him mad, so he caused a big stink with the Moorcroft school board, railing against lazy teachers just passing me when I was illiterate. He had no idea I was a problem child and the teachers couldn\u2019t wait to get me the hell out of their classroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he find out you couldn\u2019t read? Did your mom tell him? Or did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Aunt Carolyn figured it out when we were at a West reunion. God. I wanted to die because I knew I was stupid and then everyone else would know it too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she single you out and embarrass you in front of your whole family?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He finally looked up at her and smiled. \u201cYep, you\u2019re definitely a McKay with how indignant you just got on my behalf. Aunt Caro did too. She read my dad the riot act. I\u2019ve never heard her swear like that. She even threatened to petition the court for temporary custody of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you end up living with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for the summer while my dad got his shit together. She and my Aunt Kimi and my cousin Keely worked with me. They were patient and understanding\u2014everything my mom and dad weren\u2019t. I learned a lot, but not enough to make up for all I\u2019d missed in first, second and third grade. So I repeated third grade in Sundance. Which is why I\u2019m graduating at age nineteen instead of eighteen.</p><p>\u201cMy mom got herself cleaned up after she stopped getting child support payments. By the time I was in fifth grade I was bouncing back and forth between them. But even during those years when I lived with my dad, my grandparents or uncles ended up stuck with me since my dad wasn\u2019t around. Then my mom married, had another couple kids. I\u2019ve more or less been on my own since I was fifteen.\u201d</p><p>Sierra put her arm around his shoulders, resting her cheek on his bicep. \u201cOkay, West. You win the shitty parents contest.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cHowever...I saw your name on the honor roll for last quarter, Mr. Four Point Oh. You\u2019re not so dumb after all.\u201d She closed her eyes when she caught a whiff of his cologne. Tempting to rub her face against his soft flannel shirt and purr like a kitten.</p> <p>What are you doing? Back off. Don\u2019t be stupid and act like you\u2019re making a move on him.</p><p>Sierra slowly sat up. \u201cThanks for telling me, Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about you, McKay, that makes me trust you. Which is weird because I don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because I fed you that first time. You keep coming back like a stray dog.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cBut since I spilled an embarrassing secret, you gotta do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. And my rules...rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Unless you\u2019re Little Miss Perfect Princess who\u2019s never done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his thigh. \u201cPerfect. Princess. As if. I\u2019ll tell you if you promise not to tell anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Those warm fingers were on her chin again, turning her to face him. Then she was looking into that handsome face of his and getting trapped in those gorgeous golden-brown eyes of his. \u201cYou can trust me, okay? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a bunch of guy friends I drink beer and bullshit with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about girlfriends?\u201d just slipped out.</p><p>\u201cNone of those either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen girls all over you at school and the games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t take any of them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s because I\u2019m...fuck, why are you so nosy, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be disappointed if I wasn\u2019t. So what\u2019s the deal?\u201d As soon as she said it, she hoped to God that beautiful, hot Boone West wasn\u2019t about to confess that he was gay.</p><p>His topaz-colored eyes searched hers. \u201cThe truth? I can\u2019t afford a girlfriend. I live with my dad, but he\u2019s never fucking there. He reminds me that I\u2019m an adult and I have to pay for everything myself. Even working part-time means I\u2019m full-time broke. I don\u2019t even have a goddamn car, so it\u2019s not like I can pick up a chick on my bike when it\u2019s twenty degrees below zero.\u201d</p><p>Sierra exhaled the breath she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone asks\u2014and some girls just don\u2019t get the hint that I\u2019m not interested\u2014I tell them I\u2019m seeing a woman who lives in Casper.\u201d He shrugged and dropped his hand from her face. \u201cNot an original lie, but one that usually works.\u201d He gave her a light butt on the head. \u201cNice distraction, but you still owe me an embarrassing fact about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning to knit and I really love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not embarrassing. So quit hedging and lay the real dirt on me.\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cI was put in juvenile for shoplifting and had to go to teen court.\u201d</p><p>Boone whistled. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She told him. Her face flamed, as it always did, when she thought about how stupid she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bottle of perfume.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. \u201cWould your dad have bought it for you if you\u2019d asked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. My mom definitely would\u2019ve coughed up the cash. Of course, it would\u2019ve been money she\u2019d gotten from my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dare from my friends. They said I was too much of a goody-goody. Then they showed me the stuff they\u2019d taken. So I tried to prove I was badass by stealing something. God. I was so fucking gullible and I got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell the cops your friends were ripping off stuff too?\u201d</p><p>Sierra shook her head. \u201cWhen the mall cops couldn\u2019t get a hold of my mom or my dad, they called the real cops who put me in juvenile detention. With all these kids who had serious problems.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cA fifteen-year-old busted for prostitution, a twelve-year-old who\u2019d passed out in the park after she\u2019d nearly died from alcohol poisoning and a girl who assaulted a cop as a gang initiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did they leave you in the holding cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hours before my dad showed up. It was horrible. And I said really awful things to him. I was just scared and took it out on him.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe got the best shot in though, when he sprang the surprise move on me in front of the magistrate.\u201d</p><p>Boone grinned. \u201cBet that went over well with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like he was purposely trying to ruin my life. My mom had ditched me. The people I\u2019d tried to impress with my klepto ways? They lied; they\u2019d bought all the stuff they\u2019d supposedly stolen. Then those fuckers had the balls to tell me that they didn\u2019t want to be associated with a juvenile delinquent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Sierra. That\u2019s harsh. So do you hate that your dad made you move to Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSome days it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Like right now. \u201cBut others...it sucks. It hasn\u2019t escaped your notice that I\u2019m home on a Saturday night.\u201d For the third Saturday night in a row.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were hanging out with Marin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. Until she got a boyfriend. I mean, we still see each other at school, but she\u2019d rather be with him on weekends. And I can only tag along out of pity so many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. Right. Haven\u2019t any of the guys in our school asked you out?\u201d He paused and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. They\u2019re all boneheads. Or cowboys. You\u2019re better off at home.\u201d Boone stood. \u201cNow that I know all your secrets, I gotta head out so I can spread them far and wide.\u201d He ducked when she swatted at him. \u201cKidding. But I do need to hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving until you call your uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe my cell phone is warmed up. The cold sucks the battery life to nothin\u2019.\u201d Boone reached into the pocket of his coveralls and pulled out an older model cell phone with an antenna. \u201cJust enough juice to make a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the house phone and save your battery life.\u201d She snagged the portable receiver from the hallway.</p><p>He kept his eyes on hers as he waited for someone to pick up. \u201cChet? Ha ha, asshole, no, I ain\u2019t in jail. Fuck you. I am having problems with my bike though.\u201d Pause. \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m on my way home. Out Burner Road. I had to stop in at Rielle\u2019s place and warm up after my bike crapped out. Okay. Yeah, I\u2019ve got it with me but it shuts down.\u201d Pause. \u201cI will. God. I said I would. Bye.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>Then he started putting his clothes back on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I get your number?

But I suppose I could make an exception to the person who saved my life.\u201d He rattled off the number.</p><p>She added him to her contact list. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not interested in dating, remember?

He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to date me, beautiful girl. Trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>Sierra couldn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t speak. She barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cBesides. We\u2019re friends. Now that we know each other\u2019s secrets, maybe I\u2019ll swing by some Friday night and we can do each other\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>She found her voice. \u201cWith the hat hair you\u2019re sporting? No way, dude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou crack me up.\u201d He slipped on his hat and gloves.</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll call me when you get home. Or text me. Something that lets me know you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. See ya around, McKay.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to stand on the porch and watch him take off, but remained inside by the door, listening for the sound of a motorcycle starting. She heard a high pitched whine and then the sound faded.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>December...</p> <p>The week after Thanksgiving Sierra entered Gavin\u2019s office, phone to her ear, stopping in front of his desk. \u201cNo, Mom. I don\u2019t get to decide that. It\u2019s between you and Dad. Hang on, he\u2019s right here.\u201d She handed him her phone. \u201cYou need to talk to her now.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s entire body tensed. \u201cFine. But stick around.\u201d Then he steeled himself for the conversation. \u201cHey, Ellen. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter speaking with our daughter? My blood pressure, merci.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Now she casually sprinkled French words into conversation? She was probably wearing a damn beret. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so why don\u2019t you fill me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Sierra to come to Paris for her Christmas break and she didn\u2019t seem very excited. That hurts because I haven\u2019t seen my only child since June. So have you spent the last few months turning my daughter against me, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>Stay calm. \u201cNot at all. You have to admit the come to Paris for the holidays invitation is a little out of left field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not out of line,\u201d she retorted. \u201cThe court awarded you full custody, but I do have the legal right to request holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you also realize you\u2019ve had her for every holiday this year? And her birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had her for Christmas the last five years! I only get her for one day on Thanksgiving, and then you pick her up at the crack of dawn to go shopping the next day. This is the first year I haven\u2019t had to share her on her birthday since she was five years old.\u201d He felt Sierra staring at him and his face heated. Dammit. He\u2019d sworn he wouldn\u2019t do this in front of her.</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever. But consider this my unofficial request. I want Sierra to spend Christmas with me. In Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really expect me to put our sixteen-year-old daughter on a ten-hour flight to France...by herself?\u201d</p><p>Sierra leapt up and leaned across the desk, her eyes beseeching. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t let her guilt you into it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a baby. She\u2019s flown more times than most kids her age. Don\u2019t you remember she flew to New York by herself when she was twelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t by herself. That was a school-sponsored event with adult chaperones, so there\u2019s no correlation to this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we could take this issue to our attorneys.\u201d Ellen sighed. \u201cOr we could save the legal fees and you could fly to Paris with her, and back to the U.S., since you\u2019re so concerned about her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What would I do in Paris for a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most romantic city in the world, I\u2019m sure you could come up with something.\u201d She trilled that mean, annoying laugh. \u201cOh right, for a second I forgot who I was talking to. Gavin Daniels\u2014the man without a romantic bone in his body.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she blithely continued on, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the point, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sierra\u2019s break is two weeks, not one week, so I\u2019d expect her here for the entire time. Plus the travel days. I intend to show her more of Europe than just France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her where her boyfriend will be,\u201d Sierra demanded. \u201cAnd if he knows I\u2019m her daughter and not her sister.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? When had that happened? Why hadn\u2019t Sierra told him?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Sierra saying?\u201d Ellen demanded. \u201cHas she changed her mind? Tell her we\u2019ll have a wonderful time together.\u201d</p><p>Ellen spoke so loudly Sierra had heard every word.</p><p>This back and forth bullshit hurt his ears and his head. Nothing would be resolved today anyway. \u201cLook, Ellen, let me talk it over with Sierra and we\u2019ll figure something out. I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can, all right?\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cAll right. She\u2019s my daughter too, Gavin. And don\u2019t think for a second I don\u2019t miss her, because I do.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>Fuck. He wished he could just be pissed off at Ellen for being unreasonable, but she had a point. This was the longest she\u2019d been away from Sierra. Granted, it\u2019d been Ellen\u2019s choice, but he felt he should at least try to find a way for them to spend time together.</p><p>He handed Sierra\u2019s phone back.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dad, don\u2019t make me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra, sweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even considering this!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me drive into Sundance by myself but you\u2019d send me halfway across the world by myself? That makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother. She has a right to see you.\u201d Gavin glanced up to see that I\u2019ll argue this to death stubborn set to his daughter\u2019s chin so he tried a different approach. \u201cShe misses you. And I know you miss her too. So think about that before you say or do something rash.\u201d</p><p>Sierra made an exasperated sound and stormed out.</p><p>He turned to the window and opened the shade. The sunshine reflecting off the snow made everything blindingly white. From this distance the pristine view looked like an old-fashioned scene from a vintage postcard.</p><p>Maybe it was silly and sentimental, but he\u2019d been looking forward to their first Christmas in Wyoming. The snow covered pine trees and the chilly air made everything more festive. Add in all the upcoming McKay family parties and for once he wasn\u2019t dreading the holidays.</p><p>Sierra had spent the last five Christmases with Ellen, leaving him to face the day alone. After his mother died the pity invites for Christmas dinner tended to piss him off\u2014to the point he morphed into Scrooge the week before to stave off said invites.</p><p>He\u2019d never been that big on holidays anyway, not even when his parents were alive, save for the few times he had Sierra all to himself on Christmas morning. Seeing her eyes light up when she saw her gift from Santa and the piles of presents from him. The two of them lazing around all morning in their pajamas, playing with her new toys and eating Christmas candy for breakfast.</p><p>Eventually they\u2019d get ready for Christmas dinner at his parents\u2019 house. Sierra dolled up in a fancy holiday dress\u2014the more taffeta, lace and velvet the better, with matching shoes and hair ribbons.</p><p>Gavin remembered combing the tangles from her snarled hair and her explicit instructions on where to place the barrettes, headband or ponytail holder. Her instructions had amused him, because he\u2019d been putting her hair in a ponytail or pigtails since she\u2019d turned two.</p><p>Now she was sixteen. Sometimes he wondered how that\u2019d happened so fast, her change from a sleepy-eyed toddler dragging her favorite Tigger blanket, to the eye-rolling teen with her hand out for the car keys.</p><p>Arms snaked around his waist. Body heat and his lover\u2019s sweet honeysuckle scent surrounded him. Rielle placed a kiss between his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cI heard Sierra\u2019s door slam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just lost in thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I called your name but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and held her face in his hands, kissing her deeply. When he eased back, she wore the secret smile that was an instant aphrodisiac. He seriously considered sweeping everything off his desk and taking her right there.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that look in your eye, tycoon. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to take a raincheck, since there are four loaves of cranberry orange hazelnut bread and eggnog spiced pumpkin bread baking in the oven that will require my attention shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Hot bread sounds almost as good as hot sex.\u201d He kissed her again, with a little more zeal, letting his hands wander to fondle her breasts. When Rielle emitted that sexy squeak, he grinned at her. \u201cSorry. Just a self-reminder that nothing compares to sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are tempting me to just let the damn bread burn.\u201d</p><p>He had a brilliant idea. \u201cRee. What are you doing for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at the abrupt subject change. \u201cSame thing we do every year. Put up a tree, bake and eat until my jeans are too tight and hang out by the fireplace with Rory, chugging hot chocolate or wine...depending on the day. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to go to Paris with me for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat? Paris? As in Paris, France?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI sure wasn\u2019t talking about dragging you to Paris, Texas,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Doesn\u2019t that sound romantic? You and me strolling along the Seine? Kissing on the Eiffel Tower? Checking out the handmade goods at the markets? Sipping wine by candlelight in a cozy caf\u00e9? Rolling around in a big bed in our hotel suite?\u201d</p> <p>A couple long seconds passed before she said, \u201cGavin. I\u2019m...stunned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then say yes. We\u2019ll spend two weeks together, just the two of us. You\u2019ll be pampered like you deserve. You won\u2019t have to lift a finger or do anything but relax.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cYou work too damn hard, honey. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><p>Rielle stepped back. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a trip like that.\u201d</p><p>He tried to curb his offense, but his words came out clipped. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to pay your way. I was inviting you as my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your guest?\u201d The look in her eyes and her tone made the word guest sound like whore. \u201cThen definitely not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d She threw up her hands. \u201cWho suggests a Christmas vacation in Paris? Who can just set aside two weeks and go play tourist? Maybe you can, but I sure as hell can\u2019t. I have responsibilities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go. You act like you\u2019re the only one in the world with a job, Ree. Like the entire state of Wyoming will fall into ruin if you\u2019re not around to do your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it\u2019s not. You work like a dog. Everybody takes time off once in a while. You never do. So excuse the hell out of me for wanting to give you something you\u2019ve never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? You want to show me all I\u2019ve been missing by taking me to a place I\u2019d never be able to afford to go to on my own. Well guess what? I don\u2019t care about any of that. I never have and I never will.\u201d She clenched her hands into fists. \u201cDon\u2019t try and change me, Gavin. I am who I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with me trying to change you, or seeing it as an opportunity to rub it in your face that I have a bigger bank account than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then how come you got so pissed off when you thought Vi was trying to buy Sierra\u2019s affection? How is offering to take me on an all-expenses-paid trip to France any fucking different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a helluva lot different, but you\u2019re too busy...\u201d Goddammit. Take your own advice. Stop and think before you say something you can\u2019t take back. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if you\u2019d take that damn chip off your shoulder once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Just as soon as you take that silver spoon out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>They were both angry. Breathing hard. Neither willing to back down.</p><p>The timer on her watch started to beep. She spun on her heel and left the room without a word.</p><p>He shouted, \u201cNice talking to you.\u201d</p> <p>That was mature.</p><p>He paced. Then he slumped against the wall. Was he really such a bad guy for wanting to spend some alone time with the woman he loved? Not that he\u2019d told her that.</p><p>Would he ask her to drop everything and go to Paris with him if he wasn\u2019t going for Sierra?</p><p>No.</p><p>Good thing that hadn\u2019t come up, because it did put his offer in a different light.</p><p>Trying to get any work done in this frame of mind would be pointless. He changed clothes and ran five miles on the treadmill. Then he beat the crap out of his heavy bag until he could hardly hold his arms up.</p><p>After a long shower, he felt calmer. In a better frame of mind to tackle the problem, because it wasn\u2019t going away, no matter how much he wished it would.</p><p>Paris.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>Didn\u2019t Gavin know her at all?</p><p>When had she ever let anyone pay for anything she hadn\u2019t earned?</p><p>Never.</p><p>Being intimately involved with him shouldn\u2019t earn her a trip to France, for Christsake.</p><p>Rielle placed the loaf pans on the cooling racks and loaded the next batch of bread into the oven. She glanced at the time. Noon. Where had this day gone? She set her watch and tackled the stack of dirty dishes.</p><p>Paris.</p><p>Besides, she didn\u2019t have a passport. She angrily scrubbed the dishes. It was mortifying to admit that she\u2019d never been on an airplane. She\u2019d never been anywhere. She and Rory had taken a camping trip to Yellowstone once. She\u2019d been to Denver a number of times. She\u2019d driven into the Rockies. She\u2019d visited the farm and range land in Nebraska. Same with the Black Hills and the prairie in western South Dakota.</p><p>So she couldn\u2019t see herself buying luggage and boarding a plane that\u2019d fly over the ocean when she\u2019d never actually seen the ocean.</p><p>That is not Gavin\u2019s fault.</p><p>Maybe she did have a chip on her shoulder.</p><p>Or worse, maybe she had the fear if Gavin took her someplace sophisticated, she\u2019d embarrass him with her wide-eyed wonder. Maybe he\u2019d realize that if she couldn\u2019t live in his world even temporarily, then he couldn\u2019t live in hers either.</p><p>Damned if she did; damned if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Once the dishes were done, she updated her short to-do list. This was the slow time of year for her.</p><p>Gavin knew that. Was that why he\u2019d suggested taking a trip now? Because he understood how hard she\u2019d be working again in another few months?</p><p>Possibly. But she didn\u2019t believe it was a coincidence that Sierra\u2019s mother was living in Paris and all of a sudden he planned a trip there. Was he trying to prove something to his ex-wife by inviting Rielle along? Especially since Sierra had mentioned her mother\u2019s boyfriend?</p><p>Another three hours passed. She was thinking it odd she hadn\u2019t seen Sierra or Gavin in the kitchen looking for food, when Sierra walked in.</p><p>Rielle smiled. \u201cI wondered if you were so engrossed in your homework you forgot to eat.\u201d</p><p>Sierra shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cYou feel sick?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, but not before Rielle noticed she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Then Sierra threw her arms around Rielle and sobbed.</p><p>Caught off guard, because this was unlike Sierra, she rubbed circles on the girl\u2019s back, trying to soothe her.</p><p>It must\u2019ve worked because Sierra sighed. \u201cThanks for the hug, Ree. I\u2019m just having a shitty day.\u201d</p><p>Welcome to the club. \u201cYou\u2019d probably feel better if you ate. I made a loaf of pumpkin bread. Would you like some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Sierra watched from the breakfast bar as Rielle sliced two pieces and poured a cup of milk.</p><p>A small smile played on Sierra\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re feeding me milk and cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen me bake cookies?\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cNo. I guess I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I suck at cookies. I burn them. Or I undercook them. Or they\u2019re too big. Or too small. Or they\u2019re too squishy. Or too hard. So I\u2019ll stick to baking breads, rolls and muffins.\u201d</p><p>Sierra pinched off a corner of the bread and popped it in her mouth. \u201cMy dad used to eat a big blueberry muffin and a banana every day for breakfast. It drove me crazy because he never ate anything else. If he couldn\u2019t have that then he wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. But I\u2019ve yet to see him eat a single muffin since he\u2019s lived here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on his diet anymore. Now he eats cereal or yogurt. Or something else disgustingly healthy.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed.</p><p>Sierra broke off a couple more bites. Then she said, \u201cI heard you guys fighting earlier.\u201d</p><p>She blew across her cup of tea. \u201cDoes your dad know you overheard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s been locked in his office.\u201d Sierra looked up. \u201cMy mom wants me to come to Paris for Christmas. He won\u2019t let me fly alone. So that means he\u2019d be stuck in Paris for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>She made a noncommittal noise.</p><p>\u201cMy mom...she can be such a bitch to him. She basically said he\u2019d be better off not going to Paris since he doesn\u2019t know the meaning of romance and wouldn\u2019t know what to do with himself.\u201d</p><p>Was that why Gavin had asked her? To prove his ex-wife wrong?</p><p>\u201cI know he asked you to come with him. I know you said no. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d say no. I mean, you\u2019re already with him and it wouldn\u2019t be like you\u2019d be doing anything different there than you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>Insightful little thing.</p><p>\u201cI think you have the wrong impression of him. I mean, since he\u2019s got money you\u2019d think he\u2019d be going cool places all the time. But he\u2019s always working and he\u2019s never taken a two-week vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never taken a vacation with anyone besides me either. So it\u2019d be a big deal if he did go, especially if he went with you. And just so you know, if you don\u2019t go, he\u2019ll be there by himself. I\u2019m not saying that to make you feel guilty, I\u2019m telling you because I think he deserves to have fun. He should get to be in Paris with someone he cares about. So I\u2019m just asking you to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra?\u201d Gavin\u2019s voice echoed in the kitchen. He held his phone to his ear. \u201cYour mom is on the line. Come up to my office so we can talk about a few things and get this finalized.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Rielle knew it was too late. Her pride was keeping her from experiencing something amazing. Her pride was also making her question the motives of a man who meant more to her than she\u2019d ever imagined and who needed her support, not her suspicion.</p><p>Rielle, you are a stubborn, arrogant fool for treating Gavin like you did. Buck up and apologize.</p><p>She heated another cup of tea and peeled a tangerine, arranging the crescents around a slice of pumpkin bread. She headed upstairs and waited in the family room as she sussed out what she intended to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ten minutes later Gavin\u2019s office door opened. Footsteps faded down the hallway to Sierra\u2019s room and her door closed. She hadn\u2019t slammed it. That was a good sign.</p><p>Rielle took a deep breath and knocked. She expected to hear, \u201cCome in,\u201d but Gavin answered the door.</p><p>He peered down the hallway almost as if he was disappointed to see her. \u201cRee? Hey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you might be hungry so I brought you a snack. And tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. Sure. I could eat.\u201d He grabbed the tray from her, and slid it on his desk, but didn\u2019t invite her in.</p><p>She followed him anyway and shut the door behind her. Her heart hammed like crazy when he turned around, surprised to see her there. No excuses. Just say it straight out. She marched up to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the way I acted earlier. It was wrong, I was wrong and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin rested his backside on the edge of his desk and crossed his arms over his chest in a go on posture.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to explain because I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll come off sounding like an excuse. There isn\u2019t any excuse for the defensive way I acted and the accusations I made. I was shocked by the invite. Of course because it\u2019s me, I wasn\u2019t immediately thinking of all the fun and romantic things we could do together. I immediately thought, I don\u2019t have a passport. I\u2019ve never been on a plane. You would be so cool and sophisticated and I\u2019d stick out like a country bumpkin. During the panicked stage, I only thought of myself and how I\u2019d feel. I shoved aside the thoughtfulness and sweetness of even being asked to spend two weeks with you in Paris.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about your comments about the differences in our financial situations?\u201d</p><p>Rielle twisted her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that pride of yours that can fill an entire room?\u201d Gavin stood up and stalked her. \u201cWhat about the fact we\u2019re lovers, we\u2019ve been lovers for several weeks and you still won\u2019t let me do things for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, umm, let you buy pizza the other night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny other time, that would make me laugh. But the fact I have to explain to you just how ridiculous that statement is, is a big part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to splitting costs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your daughter. With your friends. Not with a lover. And as your lover, I\u2019ve earned the right to do some things for you. Things that will make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Her back hit the door. How had that happened? \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Gavin braced his hands beside her shoulders. \u201cI want to take you out for dinner tomorrow night and you\u2019ll let me pay. For everything.\u201d</p><p>She started to shake her head but stopped when he made that growling noise. \u201cUm. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to turn over the log splitting and wood hauling duties to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He waited and then answered, \u201cBecause you\u2019ve always done it by yourself, right? Well, guess what? No more. It will now fall under the realm of my household responsibilities. And the first time you ask me if I\u2019ve filled the wood box? I will put you over my knee and paddle your ass.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cWe clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now there will be more things that occur to me, and we\u2019ll discuss them, just as long as you understand some of the no thanks, I don\u2019t need your help bullshit is gonna stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it really mean that much to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee. It means everything to me. I\u2019m tired of waiting for your permission to let me be the man you need. Accept that if we\u2019re together things are going to change.\u201d</p><p>Gavin was so close his body-heat-warmed cologne drifted into her nose until her entire being filled with his scent. She wanted him. No niceties. No foreplay. Just thinking about him yanking her jeans down and driving into her made her wet. Wet and achy. Wet and achy and wanting.</p><p>\u201cRielle.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d drawn out her name to three syllables. Her gaze snapped to his. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p><p>Those blue eyes glittered. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? You said you wanted to do things for me.\u201d</p><p>His focus dropped to her mouth as she licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cProve it. There\u2019s something you can do for me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and sank her teeth into his bicep. Then she rubbed her face against that smooth, hard flesh. Her tongue traced the crease in the crook of his arm. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Gavin used one hand to lock the door and the other to pull her mouth to his in a ravenous kiss.</p><p>Her head spun and her blood coursed faster, pooling like liquid fire in her pussy and throbbing in her nipples. She thought he\u2019d shove her against the door, but he brought them to the floor, his mouth hungry on hers as he tried to unzip her jeans. And his jeans. At the same time.</p><p>She broke the kiss. \u201cYou do yours, I\u2019ll do mine.\u201d</p><p>Then they were naked from the waist down and neither bothered with the top half.</p><p>Levering himself over her, he kneed apart her thighs. He rolled his pelvis, rubbing his shaft over her mound. Then he canted his hips and plunged inside her fully. He groaned, \u201cJesus you\u2019re wet,\u201d against her throat.</p><p>\u201cI know. Get busy and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeat that last part again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love to hear you say that.\u201d He held her hands above her head and rammed into her over and over. His eyes locked to hers. Leaning closer to bestow a kiss that made her thoughts sweetly muzzy, even as he pounded into her flesh like a pile driver.</p><p>The quietness between them heightened the intensity. Heat and breath and bodies in motion. Each thrust drove them closer to the top. Each kiss brought them closer to each other.</p><p>When Rielle couldn\u2019t take any more, when she felt the tingling zip in her tailbone and her vaginal muscles tightening around his cock, she arched, coming hard with a gasp she couldn\u2019t contain.</p><p>Then Gavin\u2019s lips were on hers, absorbing the sound. He pumped into her faster; his deep groan rumbled in her mouth as he followed her over the edge.</p><p>Sometime later\u2014several minutes at least\u2014sprawled on her body, he murmured, \u201cI never want to move,\u201d and started kissing her neck in that distracting way.</p><p>\u201cYou have to so I can breathe. You are one solid man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re such a delicate flower.\u201d He pushed up and his perfect lips were curled into a very sexy, very satisfied male grin. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I brought you a snack. But I\u2019ll bet your tea is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot woman or hot tea. I\u2019ll take the hot woman every time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Just to prove his point, Gavin made supper and didn\u2019t allow Rielle to help. He forced her to sit at the breakfast bar with a whiskey Coke, and the stack of catalogues she\u2019d been stockpiling but hadn\u2019t made time to read.</p><p>After he\u2019d thrown the sliced potatoes, kielbasa and onions in the pan, he poured himself a drink and sat beside her. She was idly flipping through a beekeeper\u2019s supply catalogue.</p><p>\u201cSee anything you can\u2019t live without?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so far. It\u2019s crazy how much the prices have increased since last year. Since there isn\u2019t a local supplier, I\u2019m stuck paying premium prices and shipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit, I find beekeeping a lot more fascinating than I used to.\u201d</p><p>Rielle batted her eyelashes. \u201cBecause I explained it so well or because I look so completely sexy covered up in the beekeeper suit holding a smoker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be the latter.\u201d He snatched her hand and kissed her knuckles. \u201cSo honey, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She rotated on her barstool. \u201cIs this about how hot it was when you threw me on the floor and fucked me senseless in your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He allowed a wolfish smile. \u201cBut it was fucking amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is I finally know what heart-pounding passion feels like. It\u2019s a first. You say that I don\u2019t let you do things for me. Without sounding mushy, what you give me when we\u2019re alone together is something I\u2019ve never had before.\u201d She kissed the back of his hand. \u201cSo thank you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the booze had loosened her tongue, but he was grateful she was finally opening up to him. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You do know it\u2019s the same for me, right?\u201d His eyes searched hers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had this with anyone else. I don\u2019t want to go too fast or push too hard because I\u2019m used to getting things my way, on my timeframe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with sarcasm. \u201cReally? I never noticed that about you, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a smart mouth. But I am serious, Ree. I don\u2019t want to screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you. Because I\u2019m right there with you in trying to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now onto the other thing we need to discuss. Christmas. Or more accurately Christmas vacation.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pull back.</p><p>Encouraged, he laid it all out there. \u201cThe Paris trip is off. For a number of reasons; the biggest one was that Sierra didn\u2019t want to go. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll force my daughter into a situation she doesn\u2019t want to be in. But she also needed to understand her mother has every right to spend time with her. So we arrived at a compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll spend Christmas here as planned. Then three days after Christmas, Sierra and I will fly to Arizona. Ellen will fly over from France and she and Sierra will spend two weeks together in Scottsdale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great compromise, although I\u2019d bet you\u2019re paying for Ellen\u2019s plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>Of course Rielle would pick up on that. \u201cThat\u2019s a much cheaper solution than us going to Paris.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Rielle looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come to Arizona with me. Not for the full two weeks, but just a week. Rory will only be here for a few days over the holiday, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019d have to sacrifice time with her to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to point out that this is me listening to you, not immediately saying no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe can be taught.\u201d He grinned. \u201cEllen has made it clear that her time with Sierra does not include me. I need to go to Phoenix, not only to make sure Ellen actually shows up, but to handle year-end business. I own a piece of property we can stay in, meaning no hotel costs. I have a company car to use, meaning no rental car costs. So the only upfront, out-of-pocket expense is the airfare.\u201d</p><p>Rielle broke eye contact and sipped her drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to pay your way, since this is my idea, but I know how...independent you are, so I\u2019d agree to you buying your own plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I let you pay for everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But what\u2019s left to pay for? Food? Gas? Sex toys?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cSuch a naughty side to you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin curled his hands around her face, forcing her to look at him. \u201cPlease. Say yes. I want this time with you.\u201d</p><p>Indecision warred on her face. She closed her eyes and inhaled a long, deep slow breath. Then she opened her eyes. \u201cOkay. Yes. I\u2019ll come to Arizona with you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, a little too enthusiastically because his dick immediately got onboard. But he couldn\u2019t help it. He was as excited as a kid on Christmas morning.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually getting on an airplane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold your hand the entire time. I promise.\u201d Gavin brushed his mouth over hers. \u201cThank you, Ree. You have no idea what this means to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to understand that,\u201d she murmured. Then she pulled on his wrists until he released her. \u201cDo you smell something burning?\u201d</p><p>Gavin bailed off the stool and checked the pan. The potato pieces on the bottom had built a dark crust, but it wasn\u2019t ruined, thank God, because he\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>Sierra wandered in and wrinkled her nose. \u201cDad, are you burning supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved between him and Rielle. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee and I were just discussing the Arizona trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not yelling at each other so I assume everything is worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Rielle is coming with us.\u201d</p> <p>Sierra grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. Two whole weeks in the desert?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cJust one week. You\u2019ll fly back the following week. No way to get around you missing a couple of days of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn.\u201d She paused. \u201cWait. You\u2019re letting me fly back from Phoenix by myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a direct flight.\u201d</p><p>She pumped her fist. \u201cNow I can put that fake ID to good use and get snockered on the plane.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cSnockered? Since when do teens use that term for being drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince my dad doesn\u2019t like the term shitfaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word would he prefer?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cIllegal underage drinking,\u201d he and Sierra finished simultaneously.</p><p>Sierra snagged the barstool next to Rielle and sifted through the pile of catalogues. \u201cCool. Are you choosing things for your Christmas wish list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a Christmas wish list.\u201d</p><p>Sierra gasped dramatically. \u201cSeriously? Why not?\u201d</p><p>Rielle shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s only been Rory and me, except for when my parents were alive but they didn\u2019t celebrate Christmas, so there\u2019s been no need for a list. I knew what Rory wanted and I was happy with whatever she gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s different now, because we\u2019re here. I\u2019m giving you a gift so I\u2019ll need ideas. And I know Dad will buy you something, so you\u2019d better give him some guidelines or you\u2019ll find a new pickup or something in the driveway on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>Rielle aimed a laser-sharp gaze at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Gavin leaned across the counter and flashed his teeth at her. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>When her eyes widened he knew she\u2019d remembered their earlier conversation.</p><p>Oh, Little Miss I-Make-My-Own-Way wanted to argue. She\u2019d point out that Christmas wasn\u2019t about the presents, blah blah blah. Bull crap. This was the only time of year he could buy her anything he wanted and she\u2019d have no choice but to suck it up and accept it with a smile.</p><p>\u201cStop smirking at me, Gavin Daniels. I\u2019ll make a damn list. But you get to pick one thing from it, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Sierra, sweetheart, why don\u2019t you show Rielle how to make a wish list, since you\u2019re an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>As he watched Rielle and Sierra laughing together, oohing and aahing over the catalogues Sierra had dragged over, he had a sense of rightness that he was exactly where he needed to be.</p><p>Gavin finally understood why Christmas was referred to as the holiday season\u2014parties, school and family events started at Thanksgiving and stretched through Christmas. Living in Arizona, with the temperatures in the seventies, wreaths, holiday decorations and twinkling lights hung from cacti, Santa sporting a pair of board shorts and fake Christmas trees, he\u2019d never felt that holiday spirit for a day, let alone for an entire month.</p><p>But in Wyoming, things were a lot different. First of all, every household in the McKay family had some type of holiday get together at their place. He didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d missed out on longstanding family traditions when Quinn told him that most of these family holiday gatherings had just started in the last few years.</p><p>So far he and Sierra had spent time with every one of his cousins and their wives and children. Cider and cookies at Cord and AJ\u2019s, which was also a celebration of the birth of their daughter, Avery. All six of Cam and Domini\u2019s kids put on a holiday play at their house, followed by a feast of Ukrainian treats, most of which were eaten by their rowdy brood.</p><p>Since Carter and Macie lived out of town, they combined forces with Carolyn and Carson at their place for a cookie decorating party. Kade and Skylar opted to hold their shindig at the Sky Blue plant, along with Kane and Ginger, and Colt and India. While the adults gorged on appetizers, Keely spearheaded a Christmas ornament craft session for the kids. She\u2019d enlisted Sierra\u2019s help, and Gavin was delighted to see his daughter having fun with glitter, glue and pinecones and the ten billion McKay offspring.</p><p>Brandt and Jessie, Tell and Georgia and Dalton hosted a Rocky Mountain oyster feed at the fire pit in Brandt and Jessie\u2019s backyard. At Colby and Channing\u2019s place, Colby hitched up the team of Morgans to a hay wagon. Carson, Cal and Charlie loaded up the kids for a redneck sleigh ride across snow covered pastures. Gavin wondered if Sierra would think it was lame and refuse to go, since she was the oldest kid by several years, but she\u2019d surprised him once again. In fact, Charlie had told him that Sierra was the one who\u2019d started the Christmas carol sing-along and handed out hot chocolate.</p><p>Vi and Charlie assisted Quinn and Libby with their annual fruitcake throwing contest. Which was such a weird tradition Gavin had to ask Ben about it. Evidently the first year Quinn and Libby had Adam, Libby had tried out a new fruitcake recipe that was so bad Quinn wouldn\u2019t eat it. They had a big fight and in a rare fit of anger, Libby had thrown the fruitcake at her husband. He\u2019d taunted her, saying she had terrible aim, so she challenged him to see how far he could throw the dense fruitcake. The story spread through the McKay family and the following year everyone brought fruitcake and joined in the contest.</p><p>Ben and Ainsley had an adults only cocktail party. No one was surprised that Keely volunteered her babysitting services for all the McKay offspring that night. But everyone was shocked when Jack announced her pregnancy.</p><p>As much fun as Gavin had at the festivities the past few weeks, getting to know his family a little better, something was missing.</p><p>Rielle.</p><p>He\u2019d invited her to the first McKay family event since everyone in the gossipy McKay family knew they were in a relationship. But Rielle had demurred. Her reasons were sound; she\u2019d be an intrusion in Gavin and Sierra\u2019s family time. It made sense, but he still missed her.</p><p>Sometimes he felt theirs was a relationship borne out of their odd living arrangement. Rielle kept that dividing line in place, doing her own thing. She\u2019d decorated her part of the house by herself. He and Sierra put up an enormous Christmas tree and added decorations from years past, plus new ones they\u2019d found at the community bazaar.</p><p>But other times, when he and Rielle were alone, there was no her space or his space, just their space.</p><p>\u201cDad, come taste this,\u201d Sierra yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>Vi had come over to make candy with Sierra. His relationship with Vi had returned to how it\u2019d been before their fight. But now Vi cleared every purchase and activity with him before she mentioned it to Sierra, which wasn\u2019t a snarky way to poke at him, but it gave Vi an excuse to call him up and chat whenever she wanted. Strange that he didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>Upon entering the kitchen, he saw globs of brown on wax paper, a pan of peanut brittle and chocolate balls topped with fancy red and green icing. \u201cWhat am I trying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGram\u2019s caramels. They\u2019re the best thing ever.\u201d Sierra held a square up to his lips. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth. Buttery vanilla goodness melted on his tongue. \u201cOkay. Wow. Those are incredible.\u201d He shook his finger at Vi. \u201cAnd you\u2019re taking them all home because I will sit down in front of the game and eat the entire batch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save some for Christmas dinner.\u201d She wiped a section of the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re still planning on coming over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I wish you\u2019d let us bring something.\u201d</p><p>Vi looked him in the eye. \u201cHaving you both there with us and the rest of our family is more than enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our family. She didn\u2019t push, but she clearly stated, at every opportunity, that they were family.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said what you and Sierra are doing on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided. Although I\u2019ll bet Little Miss will try and convince me to open presents on Christmas Eve instead of Christmas morning.\u201d</p> <p>Vi frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a tradition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sierra\u2019s been with her mom the last five Christmases. She spends part of Christmas Eve with me. Then I drop her off at Ellen\u2019s that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, we\u2019re doing the same thing we always do. Drinking eggnog, cooking a batch of chili and watching Santa Claus is Coming to Town.\u201d Sierra grinned. \u201cThen maybe we\u2019ll open up a present or ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have plans with Rielle and Rory?\u201d Vi asked.</p><p>Gavin shook his head.</p> <p>She paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I find that strange.\u201d</p><p>Me too.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Rielle...let\u2019s get this mess cleaned up so she won\u2019t have a fit that we destroyed her kitchen,\u201d Vi said.</p><p>That rubbed Gavin the wrong way. \u201cMaybe it seems like Rielle\u2019s kitchen, but I do own this house. So technically it\u2019s my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you cleared that up,\u201d Rory said walking past him, overloaded with grocery bags.</p> <p>Shit. \u201cHere, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Just let me know when I can come back into your kitchen and put everything away,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cRory. That\u2019s uncalled for,\u201d Rielle said behind him. Then she too walked past with bags, and she too refused his help. \u201cAnd Gavin is right. This is his place.\u201d She smiled at Vi and Sierra. \u201cBut I do appreciate having a clean spot to work in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just finishing up,\u201d Vi said.</p><p>\u201cNo rush. I\u2019ll put the stuff in the refrigerator. Rory and I planned to have a glass of wine first anyway.\u201d</p><p>Then they were gone.</p><p>Sierra mumbled, \u201cMerry freakin\u2019 Christmas,\u201d and started to load the dishwasher, humming Christmas tunes.</p><p>Gavin leaned against the counter where Vi was dividing all the goodies into Christmas tins. \u201cLike I said, Gavin, I find this situation strange.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, it is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in a serious relationship with Rielle?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Yes, they were taking things slow. Normally he\u2019d be fine with that; after all, they had their own lives and interests. But Gavin had almost an obsessive need to define what was growing between them.</p><p>The hit and miss nights they spent in each other\u2019s beds caused some annoyance, even when he understood she had to be up at the crack of dawn three mornings a week.</p><p>Rielle got along well with Sierra. She didn\u2019t comment on his parenting practices and she never inserted herself into the time he spent with his daughter. Most men would consider it an ideal relationship: smoking hot sex whenever he wanted, a woman who made no demands of a commitment, and her complete disinterest in the fact he had money. But he wanted more.</p><p>\u201cThis is what she wants,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Vi\u2019s eyes took on a defiant gleam. \u201cWhat about what you want?\u201d</p><p>Such a...defensive and motherly thing to say. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. Rielle and I...we\u2019ve both done our own thing. It\u2019s been her and Rory for so long neither of them knows any other way to be. It\u2019s sort of the same for Sierra and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re adapting. You\u2019ve embraced all the McKay craziness more than I ever thought you would.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed his arm in such a loving manner, he nearly hugged her. He missed the easy rapport he\u2019d had with his mother. Her sweetness and generosity. Vi was nothing like her...and yet she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about that\u2019s put such a melancholy look in your eyes?\u201d Vi asked.</p><p>Gavin hedged. \u201cHow much I\u2019m looking forward to having Christmas dinner with the crazy McKays.\u201d</p><p>That answer pleased her. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat around two. And open presents afterward.\u201d</p><p>His smile froze. \u201cPresents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little untraditional, I know, but Quinn and Libby want to spend Christmas morning with their children. Chase and Ava are staying in Kane\u2019s trailer, and for the life of me I can\u2019t figure that one out. Ben and Ainsley are feeding cattle so Quinn can be home with his family. So we open our gifts to each other late.\u201d</p><p>He was so screwed. He\u2019d bought a gift for Vi and Charlie, but no one else.</p><p>After he carried Vi\u2019s boxes out to the car, he returned to the kitchen just as Sierra started the dishwasher.</p><p>She looked up at him and smirked. \u201cSo, you forgot to buy presents for your brothers, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. I didn\u2019t know there was a mandatory present thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. It\u2019s Christmas. Presents are always part of that. Which means you also need to buy gifts for their wives. Oh, and their kids.\u201d She flat out laughed at his panicked expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a shopping expert, remember? We\u2019ll get you loaded up in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have all of your shopping done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>How? He hardly ever let her drive anywhere\u2014even after she\u2019d passed her driver\u2019s test two weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat. And if we can really get this done in one night, I\u2019ll even let you drive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Gavin and Sierra spent Christmas Eve stuffing themselves with chili, snacks and cookies. He even listened to the music on her iPod as they played her favorite board games. Including Candyland, which amused him, because she used the same strategy as she had at age six, which allowed him to win.</p><p>She\u2019d been so excited to open gifts that he\u2019d let her open them all. The number of presents under the tree from her surprised him. Fun, thoughtful, sweet items that proved she at least listened to him some of the time. His favorite was the hat she\u2019d knitted for him in ASU colors. He\u2019d had no clue that Rielle had taught her how to knit. It must\u2019ve taken her hours. He immediately put it on and refused to take it off. Even when his head was sweating. Even after she called him a dork.</p><p>Her favorite gift was the set of Jeep keys he\u2019d wrapped up with his promise that she could drive whenever she wanted\u2014weather permitting\u2014as soon as they returned from Arizona.</p><p>Afterward, she snuggled up to him on the couch and they watched Christmas movies. In a few years, this too would change between them. College. Boyfriends. Eventually a home and family of her own. It made him a little sad even as it reinforced his determination that he\u2019d never let her get so far adrift from him again. As he looked at his bright, beautiful daughter he felt the bond between them had strengthened over the past few months, and he\u2019d made the right decision moving them here.</p><p>Around eleven he kissed her forehead. \u201cBetter get in bed, girlie, or Santa won\u2019t come tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. Santa? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And he told me he was partial to those frosted cookies you made yesterday, so feel free to leave those out with a glass of milk.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cOkay. But I might skip the carrots for the reindeer this year.\u201d She hugged him. \u201cNight, Dad. Merry Christmas. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas. Love you too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutstanding meal, Mom. I think you\u2019ll have to roll me to the Christmas tree,\u201d Chase said, suppressing a burp.</p><p>\u201cWe should all go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Everyone groaned at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on dish detail,\u201d Ainsley announced.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Ava chimed in.</p><p>\u201cMe three.\u201d Libby looked at Quinn. \u201cYou wanna put the kids down for a short n-a-p?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He lifted Amelia from her high chair. \u201cCome on, baby girl. Let\u2019s get you tucked in.\u201d</p><p>Thumb in her mouth, she nestled her head in the crook of her dad\u2019s neck.</p><p>Gavin remembered those sleepy toddler days with more fondness than they probably deserved. Sierra hadn\u2019t ever been an easy child.</p><p>Thump. Adam raced behind the dining room chairs and jumped in front of Quinn. \u201cDaddy, where you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a quiet, special place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, sport. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 you forgot how to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be quiet,\u201d Adam insisted.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you have to tiptoe like this.\u201d Quinn demonstrated. Then he dropped his voice. \u201cCan you whisper like this?\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded again and tiptoed down the hallway after him.</p><p>Libby smiled. \u201cThat man can always get Adam to take a nap no matter how cranky or wild the kid is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be a McKay family thing. My dad had to trick me into taking naps too,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cThe one I remember best was the magical trip to la-la land. He made it sound like unicorns would prance around me and I could chase butterflies to my heart\u2019s content and the entire place was made of candy. I could hardly wait to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked every time too.\u201d</p><p>Sierra dropped her arms over the back of his chair and leaned down to hug him. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to revisit la-la land now if it\u2019ll get me out of doing the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>The women headed to the kitchen while the men adjourned to the living room. Charlie passed out cups of eggnog.</p><p>Gavin listened while Charlie, Ben and Quinn talked about ranching stuff that he had no clue about.</p><p>Then Chase butted in. \u201cNo offense, guys, but that\u2019s enough talk about the damn cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna talk about, Chase? Bull riding?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. I wanna hear about Gavin\u2019s trip to Arizona in a few days. Anything interesting going on with your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee none of you want to hear me drone on about the real estate market. But yeah, I\u2019m tying up some year-end loose ends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can run your business in Arizona from here,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cDon\u2019t you gotta be there checking to make sure people get their shit done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did for a long time. It\u2019s a well-known fact that I\u2019m generous with performance bonuses. Money is always an incentive to ensure the job gets done right.

But I gave Ellen two choices for Sierra\u2019s Christmas break: come to the U.S. to see her daughter or stay in Paris and not see her daughter.\u201d He sipped his drink. \u201cSo she\u2019ll be in Scottsdale.\u201d</p><p>Ben rested his forearms on his thighs, as if he intended to settle in for a long chat. \u201cAinsley said we\u2019re watching Sadie while you and Rielle are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cSo you\u2019re still seeing Rielle?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>Quinn laughed softly. \u201cThose responses sound like what I\u2019d say. And Ben\u2019d say. And Dad\u2019d say. Chase on the other hand...he\u2019ll blab every thought that pops into his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you. I can keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>Ben coughed, \u201cBullshit,\u201d into his hand.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Charlie warned. \u201cYou\u2019re getting off track. I believe Gavin was about to tell us what\u2019s going on between him and Rielle.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stared at Charlie. \u201cWhy you throwing me under the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn. So start talkin\u2019. And one word answers ain\u2019t gonna cut it,\u201d he warned. \u201cBecause I know you like to talk. That\u2019s where Sierra gets it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much to tell. We\u2019re living together, yet separately and she\u2019s got all these boundaries. The weird thing is sometimes I think those boundaries are smart, other times they drive me crazy. But I convinced her to take a break where there\u2019s no work, no\u2014\u201d he looked over his shoulder, \u201c\u2014kid. Nothing but us. So we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>Charlie said, \u201cCan I give you some advice?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked at him, surprised by the offer. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been neighbors of the Wetzlers for years. I don\u2019t know how else to put this, but her parents were off their damn rockers. Their ideas about agriculture and sustaining the land were archaic at best, unrealistic at worst. Damn child laborers, that\u2019s what they were\u2014and yes, that\u2019s coming from me, who worked you boys hard. I always felt sorry for her, even as a child before she ended up pregnant as a young girl. Course, after Vi found out, she went out of her way to check on Rielle and Rory. Vi...she knew a little something about bein\u2019 pregnant at that age. Although, I never understood why she was so concerned about Rielle and that baby until she told me about you.\u201d</p><p>How was he supposed to respond to that?</p><p>\u201cEven now, Rielle won\u2019t let up on herself because she doesn\u2019t know how. Anyway, my advice to you is to spoil the shit out of her while you\u2019re in Arizona. Not to flash your cash, but to show her that goofing off is the reward for hard work and everyone deserves a break. It ain\u2019t gonna be easy, but I believe she\u2019s worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>Ben, Quinn and Chase gaped at one another. Then Quinn said, \u201cAh, Dad? How much rum did you put in that eggnog? I\u2019ve never heard you offer us advice on women.\u201d</p><p>Charlie shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s because none of you ever needed it.\u201d</p> <p>The ladies returned from the kitchen and paired off with their partners, leaving Gavin relieved he hadn\u2019t brought Rielle because Sierra would be the odd one out in her own family.</p><p>\u201cWho wants wine?\u201d Vi asked. Ainsley and Libby raised their hands. Vi looked at Ava. \u201cAva, sweetheart? What about you?\u201d</p><p>Ava shook her head.</p><p>Chase blurted, \u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s pregnant!\u201d</p><p>Amidst the congratulations, Ben leaned over and muttered, \u201cI told you he can\u2019t keep a damn secret.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you due?\u201d Vi asked.</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d Ava stood and turned sideways, smoothing her hands over her perfectly flat belly. \u201cSee? I already look pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Libby choked on her wine.</p><p>Ainsley said, \u201cHate to break it to you, Ava darlin\u2019, but I look more pregnant than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue, wife,\u201d Ben half-snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd with that...Vi, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time we open gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for pie?\u201d Sierra asked.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pumpkin. That\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand out those presents, girlie,\u201d Charlie advised.</p><p>Then the kids were up and the dignified unwrapping ended.</p><p>Gavin got a huge kick out of Adam and Amelia. Such funny and friendly kids. Amelia even crawled right up into his lap.</p><p>When he caught Sierra\u2019s eye, she smiled. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re good with little girls.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes his daughter said the sweetest things.</p><p>Gavin noticed Vi\u2019s strange expression. She hadn\u2019t received a gift from him and was too polite to ask if anything remained under the tree. \u201cVi?\u201d he said above the din.</p><p>Charlie whistled for quiet.</p><p>\u201cMy gift to you is in the garage,\u201d Gavin said to her.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find out,\u201d Charlie said.</p><p>They traipsed to the garage. He pointed to a blanket-covered box in the far corner. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d He and Charlie exchanged a grin.</p><p>Vi pulled the blanket back and beneath it was an industrial oven like Rielle\u2019s. She gasped and whirled around. \u201cThis is mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you wanted one, and Charlie said your oven was on its last legs. We all know he\u2019s too cheap to spring for that kind\u2014\u201d laughter, \u201c\u2014so I said I\u2019d buy it for you if he\u2019d put it in.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him.</p><p>Crap. Maybe he had gone overboard.</p><p>But she marched right up to him and threw her arms around him. \u201cThank you, son. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Then she whapped him on the arm. \u201cSo sneaky, just like your father. Do you know one time he let me think he\u2019d forgotten to buy me a birthday present? Then as I got ready for bed I found a wrapped box in my makeup drawer next to my cold cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrams, that\u2019s such a sweet, romantic story.\u201d Sierra put her arm around her shoulder. \u201cIs it time for pie yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra, is that all you can think about?\u201d Gavin asked, exasperated. What was wrong with her? It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t just stuffed her face with an entire plate of homemade candies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I remember teenagers\u2019 stomachs being bottomless pits. And that\u2019s what grandmas do best right? Fill you with sugary treats and send you home all hyped up on extra sugar.\u201d She patted Sierra\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll even put extra whipped cream on your pumpkin pie, punkin.\u201d</p><p>Sierra shot him a smug look. \u201cGrandma makes the best homemade pie crust. You could learn a thing or two from her.\u201d</p><p>He caught Vi\u2019s eye and grinned. \u201cYou know what? I already have.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t get home from Charlie and Vi\u2019s until nine o\u2019clock. Sierra hauled her presents into her room, leaving Gavin at loose ends. He paced in front of the windows, too restless to even find a classic sports game on TV.</p><p>Then Rielle walked toward him, looking like a damn dream, holding a bottle of wine and two glasses. \u201cCare to join me in a glass of Christmas cheer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. But this first.\u201d Gavin kissed her. Hotly, sweetly, teasingly, pouring everything he\u2019d been feeling into one long kiss before he eased back to stare into her eyes. \u201cMerry Christmas, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a helluva Christmas kiss, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. Been a long two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. I\u2019m glad you tracked me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sierra?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn bed, tuckered out from Christmas festivities.\u201d He nuzzled her temple, and her honeysuckle scent teased his nose. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a movie. A Christmas night tradition with her friend Addie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can invite you to drink that wine in my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I have another present for you in my room.\u201d</p><p>Rielle looked him. \u201cYou already gave me a kick-ass gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe extra-large electric honey separator wasn\u2019t too boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve wanted one for so long. It\u2019s perfect. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry; I probably should\u2019ve waited to open it until you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. I loved the sweater by the way. It fits perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the color would bring out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin led her into his bedroom and locked the door behind her.</p><p>She settled against the headboard, setting the wine and glasses on the nightstand.</p><p>He tossed a package next to her on the bed. \u201cOpen it. And not with, Gavin you shouldn\u2019t have, or Gavin I thought we agreed on one gift.\u201d</p><p>Rielle pulled the silver ribbon free from the green tissue paper and a red bikini rolled out. \u201cA swimsuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you had one and the house we\u2019re staying in has a pool. To be completely blunt, this bikini is as much a present for me as it is for you. Because you will look fantastic in it lying on a chaise in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow I\u2019ll have you all to myself for two weeks. I cannot wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>Gavin pressed a kiss in the hollow of her throat. Then on the side of her neck. Then on her jaw. He murmured, \u201cCan we be done talking for now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>As they deplaned in Phoenix, Rielle decided her first plane ride hadn\u2019t been that bad. The whiskey Coke had helped.</p> <p>Sierra had been bouncing off the walls since dawn. She jabbered a mile a minute, reminding herself out loud of things she wanted to tell her mom. She could scarcely sit still and as they pulled into the circular driveway, Sierra leapt out of the car and raced up the cobblestone-paved sidewalk and barged right into the house through the gigantic front door.</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t get a glimpse of Ellen, but then again she\u2019d been too busy gawking at the house and landscaping.</p><p>The sprawling stucco structure was enclosed by a six-foot-high fence on all sides, save for the wrought iron gated entrance. The front area didn\u2019t have grass, but reddish-colored stones bordered by larger flat white rock. Bushes were spread out along the base of the house and disappeared around the side. Off to the left were half a dozen fruit trees, the bottom of the trunks painted white, which was weird. She didn\u2019t see cacti but groupings of different varieties and sizes of palm trees.</p><p>Mind boggling to consider that Gavin had lived here at one time and that he could afford to just give this ostentatious house to his ex-wife.</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t stay inside long. His smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes when he returned and said, \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the place we\u2019re staying as upscale as this?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her knuckles. \u201cNo. Ellen insisted on buying the house before Sierra was born. She kept it in the divorce settlement and we use her address since this area has a much better school district than where I moved. It\u2019s an enormous house for two people, but the property value quadrupled in the last sixteen years. Ellen isn\u2019t allowed to sell it until after Sierra graduates from high school and if she does, she\u2019s forced to use my real estate company as the listing agency. It\u2019s the only way I could ensure my daughter had some stability.\u201d He realized he hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cThe house we\u2019re staying in is pretty typical for Phoenix. Three bedrooms, three baths, two-car garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept it has a pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, all the houses down here have a pool. This one is heated, however. Not all are. Because heaters definitely aren\u2019t needed in the summer.\u201d</p><p>Houses and scenery scrolled by as she looked out the car window. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. Just a few hours ago we were brushing the snow off the car. Now the sun is blinding me and I\u2019m actually hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. I cannot wait to see you in that bikini.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes. Thirty if we hit traffic.\u201d</p><p>Shopping centers. Medical centers. Office buildings. More strip-malls. Every once in a while she\u2019d see a grove of citrus trees\u2014an oasis in the inner-city sprawl. She lost track of the number of golf courses. The huge swath of green among the dusty hues of the desert was a little surreal.</p><p>Gavin turned off the busy highway onto a residential street. With as many twists and turns as they\u2019d taken, she\u2019d never find her way out of this urban maze. He stopped at a gate and punched in a code.</p><p>A gated community? So much for his claim it was just a typical Phoenix house.</p><p>After more winding streets, he pulled into a driveway and parked in front of a garage. Most of the stucco-covered house was hidden behind a variety of trees.</p><p>\u201cRee?\u201d He turned her face toward him. \u201cYou all right? You went from chatty to silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to absorb all this, Gavin.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her softly. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and get unpacked.\u201d He unloaded the suitcases and dragged them up the front steps.</p><p>A cool blast of air and the scent of lemon Pledge greeted her in the cavernous foyer. But the darkness made her claustrophobic, so she immediately crossed the room and opened the blinds and draperies.</p><p>The living room was connected to the kitchen through an arched doorway. The d\u00e9cor had southwest flavor, tiled floors, plain white walls, a Navajo influence in the rugs and the couches. The sliding glass door in the dining room opened to a brick-paved patio. Curious, she stepped outside.</p><p>Patio furniture was arranged around the large, kidney-shaped pool. Wide steps and a handrail accessed the shallow end. The deep end was marked at nine feet. The ledge surrounding the pool was trimmed with cerulean blue tiles. To her right, beneath a permanent awning, sat a picnic table and chairs. A firepit took up one corner of the yard; citrus trees lined the other side.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s arms came around her and he kissed her neck. \u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might be dreaming. This is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and see the rest of the house.\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t pay much attention to the spare bedrooms or bathrooms. The master bedroom was roughly the same size as her old room. The master bath was fancier, boasting a steam shower in addition to the glass-walled shower, a double vanity and built-in cabinetry in every nook and cranny.</p><p>She returned to the bedroom to see Gavin putting away his clothes. She still couldn\u2019t wrap her head around the fact they\u2019d be here for a week. Alone. Just the two of them.</p><p>Gavin picked her up and threw her on the bed. Then he was on top of her. Kissing her with ferocity. Grinding his pelvis into hers, his cock already hard. His mouth moved to her ear. \u201cLet me have you.\u201d</p><p>Usually she\u2019d jump right on that idea, but not this time.</p><p>He sensed her hesitation and pushed up to look into her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The timing on this feels off. Like hey, we\u2019re here alone, let\u2019s fuck first thing and get it out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pressure. This is supposed to be fun. Relaxing. I saw you bent over that suitcase and well, I\u2019m a guy. I wanted to pull down your jeans and fuck you just like that.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI thought I was being polite and gentlemanly by throwing you on the bed first.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cTell you what. Can I take a raincheck on that for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He pressed his lips to hers and rolled off the bed. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d His very male, very possessive gaze started at her feet and ended at her chest. \u201cYou put on the bikini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But I\u2019d better see you in a Speedo too, bucko.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shuddered. \u201cNo Speedo for me ever. But I will put on my swimming trunks if it makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery happy.\u201d</p><p>Then, like a complete chicken, Rielle undressed in the bathroom and didn\u2019t come out until she knew Gavin was gone. Since she\u2019d forgotten a cover up, and had no intention of prancing around in a bikini all damn day\u2014no matter what Gavin wanted\u2014she snagged one of his button-up business shirts from the closet and slipped it on before she headed to the kitchen.</p><p>His drink stopped halfway to his mouth when he caught sight of her. \u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to keep my hands to myself when you\u2019re looking that goddamn sexy in a bikini and wearing my shirt?\u201d He groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re evil, Ree. Pure evil.\u201d</p><p>This man knew exactly what to say to her. She kissed him, using the distraction to swipe his drink and take a sip before she handed it back. \u201cMmm. Whiskey. So this place comes equipped with booze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent my assistant a list. She brought everything over when she checked the house yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many minions do you have to do your bidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmployees,\u201d he corrected. \u201cNo minions. It\u2019s not like I demanded she prepare a gourmet feast for us. She just picked up a few things at the store for me. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my first glimpse into your world, isn\u2019t it? A reminder that we live in two different worlds.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her against his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same world, in the same place right now and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Rielle let him kiss her, wanting the familiarity of his touch to shut down the doubts that\u2019d begun to plague her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a whiskey Coke? Or a beer? Or a whiskey Coke minus the whiskey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey on the rocks would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? There\u2019s chips and salsa or I could make you a salad.\u201d</p><p>Rielle put her hand on his arm. \u201cGavin. I don\u2019t expect you to wait on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. I plan to wait on you, cater to your every need, fulfill your every desire, so by the time we leave here, you\u2019re used to it.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh until she realized the man was dead serious.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>They carried their drinks by the pool and settled into the chaise lounges. With the sun warming her body and whiskey buzz, she drifted into that happy place of marginal awareness. She heard Gavin chuckle beside her and she let herself go completely under.</p><p>A rough fingertip stroking her arm brought her out of her relaxation. She stretched and sighed. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour, I guess. I dozed off myself. Would you like another drink?\u201d</p><p>Rielle peered at him over the tops of her sunglasses. \u201cYou trying to get me drunk and take advantage of me, tycoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But add Coke to mine this time.\u201d</p><p>After Gavin returned to the kitchen, Rielle decided to take a dip in the pool. She floated on her back; the water muffled all noise except for the sound of her deep breathing. She stared up at the pale gray sky. Odd to think a sky that color in Wyoming meant snow. She dropped to her feet and noticed Gavin watching her avidly.</p><p>\u201cI set your drink on the table. There\u2019s a towel there for you too.\u201d</p><p>Rielle smiled at him. \u201cDon\u2019t want your shirt to get wet?\u201d</p><p>His phone rang and he frowned at the number. \u201cSorry, I have to take this call.\u201d He abruptly disappeared into the house.</p><p>Was Sierra already having issues with her mother?</p><p>She snagged a chair by the picnic table. The air temp had cooled, and she let her head fall back, closing her eyes. This drinking and napping in the afternoon stuff was pretty cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A warm kiss landed on the center of her chest. Another one on the top of each breast. Gavin placed kisses along the triangles of her swimsuit top. Then nuzzling and sweet kisses weren\u2019t enough. He yanked the material aside. His hot, wet mouth encircled her cold nipple and he began to suck.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moaned and arched back. Then she remembered they were outside. Surrounded by neighbors. \u201cGavin. Stop. People might see us. Or hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Forget about everything but this.\u201d He flicked his tongue across her nipple.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from crying out.</p><p>\u201cUntie your top.\u201d</p><p>Not a request. She tugged the strings free and he flung the scrap of material away.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s mouth was everywhere. On her nipples, on her neck, on her belly. His fingers stroked her skin when his mouth was busy elsewhere.</p><p>She squirmed. If she tried to touch his head or his face, he made a growling noise that put her hands right back on the arms of her chair.</p><p>When his mouth opened over her mound and he sucked, her hips bucked. His hot breath teased the sensitive area between her hipbones. \u201cRielle. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, she noticed he\u2019d slipped into the alpha male role. Gavin wasn\u2019t always like that, which made it so much more potent when he was. She watched as his fingers loosened the knots on her string bikini bottoms and they fell away.</p><p>He pressed the tip of his finger against her clit and rubbed circles around it before dragging his finger down her slit to the opening of her pussy. \u201cWet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re blushing or if you\u2019re sunburned.\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed that you like the way I touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tease me about how I react. Especially when there are probably people around listening to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you doing this now? Out here in the open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can.\u201d Gavin chuckled confidently and kept stroking her pussy. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my mouth on you, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to torture you. By the time I\u2019m ready to let you come, you won\u2019t give a damn who hears you scream.\u201d</p><p>That comment made her wetter yet, but she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we shall. Hook your legs over the arms of that chair. I want to see every inch of your cunt.\u201d</p><p>Bossy man. Ooh, and dirty words too. She shifted into position, her heart speeding up.</p><p>\u201cPlay with your nipples. The only place I want to see those hands is on your tits. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He held her drink to her lips. \u201cWet your mouth now, because your throat will be really dry after all the yelling you\u2019re about to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty damn sure of yourself, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>For just an instant, Gavin\u2019s confidence faltered. Then he flashed her the most wolfish, most feral male grin she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cYep. Drink up.\u201d</p><p>Rielle knocked back half the liquid in one swallow.</p><p>Gavin drained the remainder. Then he dropped to his knees and put his cold mouth on her belly button. Then keeping his eyes on hers, he fished a piece of ice out of her drink and popped it into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His response was to clamp that half-moon shaped sliver of ice between his teeth and trace her slit. When he reached the opening to her pussy, he pushed the ice into her channel, holding it there.</p><p>Her hot tissues clamped down on the ice and his tongue. She gasped. Then his tongue was stroking inside her. Hot. Cold. Hot.</p><p>The ice started to melt. Gavin licked, lapped and slurped, while he emitted hungry noises.</p><p>She just about lost her mind.</p><p>No. Stay in control. Don\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you taste so fucking good. Tart like honey and warm like sunshine. I could do this all day.\u201d He glanced up at her. \u201cTug on your nipples. I know how crazy that gets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. It.\u201d</p><p>Rielle pinched hard enough she let out a whimper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He dragged his mouth between her hipbones, gifting her skin with sucking kisses. He nipped the inside of her thighs from her knee to the outer curve of her ass. Not soft nibbles, but with enough force she held her breath, waiting for, wanting the next sting. He licked the crease behind her knee.</p><p>She started to shake. Soon she might beg.</p><p>He just laughed. Pulling back the skin above her clit, he blew a stream of hot air across her swollen tissues, but his mouth never connected with her sex.</p><p>A frustrated noise escaped her.</p><p>\u201cFeel like screaming yet?\u201d he murmured against her lower belly. \u201cOr do you intend to be stubborn?\u201d</p><p>Rielle bit her lip and groaned.</p><p>Gavin kissed straight down her mound, stopping above her clit. He lifted his face and looked at her. Waiting.</p><p>Her head, her body yelled, please please please! Give him what he wants, but her vocal cords weren\u2019t cooperating.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are begging me. But not your mouth.\u201d He rapidly flicked the swollen nub with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>Her entire body broke out in chill bumps. She canted her pelvis and she moaned, hoping that was enough verbal encouragement.</p><p>He suckled her clit so thoroughly she felt the press of his teeth against her flesh. Then he stopped.</p><p>\u201cPinch your nipples. Imagine me using my teeth on them. Like this.\u201d He pulled her pussy lips into his mouth and bit down, releasing the sharp bite of pain that only increased her pleasure.</p><p>She felt more cream sliding from her pussy and a scream rising in her throat.</p><p>\u201cUse those hands, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>She began pinching the tips with her thumb and forefinger, matching the rhythm of her blood pulsing in her throat. Her mouth was dry. She licked her lips but it didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Gavin tormented her. Licking and sucking. Fucking her pussy with one finger, then two, and finally with his tongue. Driving her to the edge of bliss and then yanking her back.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t make a sound, he started over from the top.</p><p>When his naughty tongue rimmed her anus, her face heated. The swirling, teasing wetness brought the sensitive tissues alive. She felt like a total pervert for liking it and she tried to scoot away.</p><p>He warned, \u201cDon\u2019t. Move. Again.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s soft kisses on her pussy and rough caresses broke her last thread of control.</p><p>Rielle surrendered to him completely, wondering why she\u2019d tried to retain any control, when his every touch, every lick, every kiss, everything he did to her...was exactly what she wanted. She let loose a long, deep moan.</p><p>His eyes were dark with triumph. Then his face was between her breasts and he captured a nipple, making more of those greedy male noises. \u201cWrap your arms around my neck and hold on.\u201d He lifted her out of the chair.</p><p>As soon as they were face to face, his mouth took possession of hers. The kiss was a war of wills until her spine met a solid surface and Gavin\u2019s upper body pressed hers flat.</p><p>His hands moved between them to grip his cock. Teasing her clit with the flared head until she writhed. Then he poised the tip against her opening.</p><p>The pause before that first thrust was excruciating, her body was strung so tight.</p><p>His breath was hot on her ear. \u201cRee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScream.\u201d His lips, brushing the shell of her ear, set a jolt of electricity zipping through her. \u201cScream. My. Fucking. Name.\u201d He slammed into her so hard the table rocked beneath her.</p><p>She screamed as the orgasm steamrolled her. Her nails dug into the back of his neck. Her legs locked around his flexing hips. The waves crashed into her, receded, and crashed into her again until she was adrift. Awash in pleasure.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s thrusts were relentless. He buried his shaft deep one last time, spilling his seed inside her, whispering her name against her throat with such ferocity, it was as powerful as a scream.</p><p>Later, as they were entwined together, lazing in bed, Gavin asked, \u201cSo what would you like to do tomorrow? We can stay here and do exactly what we did today. Except more lounging in the pool. And more sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin Daniels. We\u2019ve had sex three times today.\u201d After he\u2019d fucked her mindless by the pool, they\u2019d ordered Chinese. He\u2019d convinced her to let him check the scores on the bowl games. When she complained about being bored, she found her head in his lap with her mouth around his dick. He\u2019d spun her around, burying his face in her pussy and...wow. Now she understood the appeal of sixty-nine. Then the man had dragged her to the shower and fucked her standing up, using the handheld shower massager in a whole new way. \u201cWhat are my other options besides nonstop sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go into the desert. See all the touristy stuff. Have lunch at my favorite hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. Or we could golf. Or we could visit a spa. Or we could go to an outlet mall or one of the billion places to shop in Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>That gave Rielle an idea. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not one for shopping, but is there a farmer\u2019s market close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you aren\u2019t supposed to be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think me checking out the varieties of seasonal fruit and vegetables in Arizona could be considered working.\u201d She poked him in the chest. \u201cBesides. You\u2019re working while we\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two days.\u201d His fingers pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cWhat else are you burning to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might sound weird, but I want to see the house you grew up in and where you went to school.\u201d</p><p>Confusion crossed his face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen where I grew up. It shaped me. And I\u2019m betting where you grew up shaped you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I would like a desert tour tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Although they spent some nights sleeping in the same bed, would being together every night for the next two weeks change things? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoney. The gears grinding in your brain are keeping me awake. What are you thinking about?\u201d Gavin asked sleepily.</p><p>He\u2019d probably think she was neurotic if she told him the truth. She hedged. \u201cJust wondering if it was hard for you to leave Sierra with her mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that woke me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. This day has been epically long and I realized I hadn\u2019t asked how that had gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllen was as happy to see Sierra as Sierra was happy to see her. I wonder how long that joy of being reunited will last.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s different being here now than it was before. I was only a phone call away if Sierra needed me. In the last seven months since Ellen has been in France, I\u2019ve dealt with all Sierra\u2019s major trauma and minor drama without Ellen\u2019s input or interference. I worry even if Sierra needs me, she won\u2019t call. Not knowing what she\u2019s doing for the week I\u2019m not here will drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a limb. So much of my life, so much of who I am, is being a parent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand how that is, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, which is why you won\u2019t think it\u2019s strange that I keep looking over my shoulder thinking she\u2019ll barge in on us. Or expecting to hear her ransacking the kitchen at midnight for snacks. Or that she\u2019ll plop beside me on the couch to show me some bizarre video on YouTube.\u201d His hand tenderly brushed her spine. \u201cBut my selfish side is happy for the chance to be alone with you like this. No kid, no responsibilities. Just us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I called Rory and told her I arrived safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory still isn\u2019t happy we\u2019re involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because, like she pointed out, I\u2019ve pretty much lived like a nun the last twenty-four years, with the whole abstinence and poverty thing.\u201d</p><p>Gavin chuckled. \u201cSo her beef isn\u2019t because I\u2019ve got McKay blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She claims she\u2019s worried I\u2019ll get my heart broken, but the bottom line is she\u2019s selfish. She doesn\u2019t want to share me with you. Sierra is more mature than Rory when it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because Sierra lives with us and sees us together every day. She did say she had a great time with Rory the night they went out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRory\u2019s protective streak toward Sierra surprised me. Did you know they\u2019re texting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I can only hope Rory has a positive influence on Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin. Sierra has been a model child, for the most part, since you moved to Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, she was away from her mother\u2019s influence. I\u2019m a little fearful of how Sierra will act after two weeks with Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Rielle rolled until she was on top of him. \u201cWorrying won\u2019t change anything. If I can take a break from work, you can take a break from parenting. So how about if I try and take your mind off it?\u201d</p><p>Gavin sighed. \u201cWell...you can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be thinking about your ex-wife when I do...this?\u201d Rielle reached down and jacked his shaft.</p><p>And no surprise Gavin lost the ability to think about anything by the time she finished with him.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>A week in Arizona with Rielle had been one of the best times of Gavin\u2019s life, ranking next to the Disney World trip he\u2019d taken with Sierra the year she\u2019d turned nine.</p><p>He gave Rielle props for embracing the vacation mindset. She let him choose their daily activities\u2014where they went, what they did, where they ate. But she couldn\u2019t stop working completely. She cleaned the pool every morning before swimming laps.</p><p>After a few hours at the office had become more than half the damn day, he\u2019d been a little tense walking in the door. Rielle noticed immediately, fixed him a drink and suggested he change into swimming trunks and come out to the pool.</p><p>He\u2019d expected a fun, sexy swim. He hadn\u2019t convinced her to have sex outside on the deck or in the pool since the first night. But she\u2019d spread out a puffy blanket poolside and offered him a massage.</p><p>The warmth of the day, the strong drink and the sensation of Rielle\u2019s oil-slicked hands on his arms, shoulders and back should\u2019ve relaxed him. But his dick got so hard it dug into the concrete decking.</p><p>Then she turned him over and started on his front. Massaging every inch of his upper torso with coconut-scented oil. His jaw, his neck, his chest, his hands. Even his earlobes. When she\u2019d told him to ditch the trunks, he\u2019d happily obliged. She used that slick hand to jack his cock as she rubbed her mouth, teeth and her tits all over his chest. She sucked his nipples, bit his neck and stroked him until he squirted all over her hand and his belly.</p><p>When he\u2019d found his mind, he\u2019d opened his eyes to see her licking his come off her fingers. And then his stomach.</p><p>That was almost enough to make him hard again. She dove into the pool; he chased her. After hot and sexy water games, he\u2019d carried her to the blanket, positioned her on hands and knees and fucked her from behind until she\u2019d screamed.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>The next day Gavin drove her by the house he\u2019d grown up in and the condo he\u2019d lived in after the divorce. Then he\u2019d shown her the schools he attended, the golf club where he and his dad played.</p><p>Rielle seemed melancholy after his trip down memory lane. He told her to dress up and he made reservations at the see-and-be-seen restaurant in Phoenix. They ran into a few of his colleagues, who invited them for a drink in the bar. Rielle attempted to retreat into her wallflower persona, but Gavin wouldn\u2019t allow it. She was beautiful, smart, funny and an interesting woman. She made him happy and he wanted her\u2014and everyone else\u2014to see it. And for her\u2014and everyone else\u2014to understand she was his.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take her on a tour of his office building until after his employees were gone for the day. Partially because he didn\u2019t relish getting stopped a million times about business issues. But he also wanted her to see the city lights from his office window. Wanted her to know how many nights he\u2019d spent up here alone. Working. Wondering if he\u2019d ever have a life beyond the walls of this room.</p><p>Gavin had an almost desperate need for her\u2014needing to meld his past and his future. He\u2019d taken her against the glass window, looking down on the urban sprawl, her feet straddling the floor air conditioner vent. Cool air blew over the hot tissues as his cock slowly tunneled in and out of her wet pussy. Rielle was always ready for him, always eager. She had no idea what a turn-on that was, so he told her. Showed her. Shared his life and thoughts with her in ways he hadn\u2019t known he was capable of.</p><p>She requested they stay in their last night, cooking together and dining outside. He\u2019d scrounged up candles, placing them everywhere in the backyard, including floating some in the pool.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t made love, but it was still the most romantic night he could remember.</p><p>Early January...</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>Come on, come on. \u201cDammit. It\u2019s not working. Try a different play. God. I cannot believe they called that one twice in a row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. This is third down.\u201d The quarterback faked a handoff and then passed for six yards for first down. \u201cYes! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d He tossed a handful of popcorn in his mouth, eyes on the game. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you putting him in? He can\u2019t block for shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin. Sierra\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She comes home tomorrow.\u201d He watched the handoff and the running back bobbled the ball. It bounced downfield until someone took his head out of his ass and covered it. \u201cLucky save.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey, just a sec.\u201d It\u2019s a wonder they won any games with the lousy plays they\u2019d been calling this season. They didn\u2019t have a running game, so it made zero sense why they\u2019d tried that one\u2014</p><p>\u201cGavin, I\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That got his attention. He turned around.</p><p>A naked Rielle leaned against the door to his bedroom.</p><p>Man, he loved her body. Small and compact, with sculpted arms and shoulders. Her muscular torso flowed into flared hips and strong thighs. And those tits. He couldn\u2019t get enough of those.</p><p>A whistle blew on the screen and he turned around to see what\u2019d happened. The camera zoomed in on the ref. \u201cIntentional grounding. Five yard penalty.\u201d</p><p>The calls in this game had been lousy.</p><p>The quarterback threw a long pass only to get picked off at the twenty-yard line. \u201cFuck.\u201d He took a long pull of his beer.</p><p>Rielle sauntered in front of the TV. Naked. \u201cSo. You wanna score with me?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the clock. Three minutes remained in the third quarter. If he could hold her off that long, then he could give her the kind of hard, fast fuck she liked. Tons of commercials and sportscaster bullshit played between quarters anyway so he wouldn\u2019t miss much of the fourth quarter.</p><p>\u201cI saw that! For just a split second you were torn between staying on the couch and watching football or taking me to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I always want to take you to bed. Always. But Ree. Honey. It\u2019s the last game before playoffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your team is winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. But there\u2019s a chance they can come back...\u201d He angled his head, trying to see around her. What the hell was that penalty flag about? Jesus. Was it on the damn defense? Were they seeing the signals at all?</p><p>Rielle walked off. The door to his bedroom slammed.</p><p>No misinterpreting that signal.</p><p>Why the hell did she have to pick right now for a tumble? Couldn\u2019t she wait another seventeen minutes and twelve seconds until the game ended?</p><p>Really? A stupid football game is more important than hot and dirty sex with the woman you love? You\u2019re an asshole.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Gavin scrambled off the couch and paused in front of his bedroom door, opening it cautiously in case Rielle decided to throw some shit at him\u2014which he deserved. But the bedroom was dark and quiet and he didn\u2019t see her. \u201cRielle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d came from beneath the covers.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and reached for the blanket-covered lump, but he jerked his hand back at the last minute when he heard a muffled sound. He heard it again. Sounded like a...sob.</p><p>Shit. Was she crying?</p><p>Gavin pulled the covers back and she curled into a little ball, further away from him.</p><p>You\u2019re an asshole.</p><p>\u201cRee. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d He put his hand on her butt and rubbed. \u201cWe could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I will not be a quick fuck during a break in your stupid football game.\u201d</p><p>Tell her it\u2019s not the end of the quarter yet.</p><p>He should\u2019ve earned some points for walking away from a game in progress, right?</p><p>You\u2019re an asshole.</p><p>\u201cPlease talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Rielle pushed up and glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t do this seduction stuff. And whenever I try, I feel like a total idiot because it doesn\u2019t have any effect on you and I\u2019m never doing it again. So go away.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dipped to her chest. Damn. She\u2019d already put on her nightgown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Now you\u2019re staring at my tits when they\u2019re covered up, but you couldn\u2019t be bothered when they were bouncing right in front of your face? Get. Out.\u201d</p><p>Man. He\u2019d fucked this up. \u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve spent a lot of years by myself, watching football games uninterrupted. And I didn\u2019t handle...you wanting my attention, in the best way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d</p><p>Anything he said would likely piss her off, so he kept his stupid mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m upset?\u201d</p><p>Do not say because I didn\u2019t drop everything and fuck you.</p><p>Luckily, she jumped right in and answered. \u201cYou are so smooth. Seducing me with words. You\u2019ve got all the hot sex moves and you know a hundred ways to turn me inside out. You intimidate me sometimes, Gavin.\u201d</p> <p>That brought him up short. \u201cI intimidate you...sexually?\u201d</p><p>Rielle blushed but she didn\u2019t look away. \u201cYes. You know I don\u2019t have\u2014didn\u2019t have\u2014much experience before we got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re amazing in bed!\u201d</p><p>Gavin felt cocky even when he wanted to laugh. Time to come clean. From the bottom drawer of his armoire he took out the four books he\u2019d hidden. \u201cYou have no idea how happy it makes me that you think I\u2019m amazing in bed. Despite what you think, that\u2019s not because I have some type of...McKay sexual history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I knew from the first time I kissed you we\u2019d end up in bed. And I wanted to make it good for you, Ree. I wanted you to think I was amazing in bed and I might be the same kind of sex stud my brothers and cousins are rumored to be.\u201d Gavin tossed the four how-to sex books on the bed. \u201cSo I bought these. I read them cover to cover and hoped like hell I could remember anything when I finally got you naked with me.\u201d</p><p>Rielle stared at the books, frowned and looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Gavin blushed. \u201cI had to read up on how to be a good lover. Because before you? I didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid these books help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. But being with you...my instincts took over. Your body, your eyes, every sexy little moan you made taught me what I needed to do to be the lover you want. The lover you deserve. The lover I\u2019ve always wanted to be, but I\u2019ve only ever been with you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Way to throw it all out there, loser.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Gavin Daniels, I love you.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t some macho stud in bed before I met you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>That made no sense...and yet perfect sense because this was Rielle. \u201cYou are one weird-ass woman, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Grinning, he said, \u201cSo...you love me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Even though you are a pain in the ass sports fanatic. Who ignores a naked woman for football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He kissed her. \u201cAnd just so we\u2019re clear. I\u2019m in love with you too.\u201d</p><p>He stripped, ripped away the covers completely and crawled on top of her.</p><p>\u201cGavin. Don\u2019t you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He smoothed his hands up the insides of her bare thighs. \u201cGoddamn. I\u2019m already hard. You\u2014\u201d his mouth meandered down her throat, \u201c\u2014have cast a spell on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d She groaned. \u201cYes, put your mouth right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do like that,\u201d he murmured, teasing the spot with his teeth and tongue.</p><p>\u201cI love that.\u201d Rielle moaned again. \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those hot spots I wasn\u2019t even aware I had.\u201d</p><p>Gavin mouthed the tip of her breast through the thin fabric of her nightgown.</p><p>Rielle hissed and arched back, thrusting more of her breast into his hot mouth.</p><p>He sucked her nipple through the sheer fabric. Then switched sides, lost in the way she clung to him and how much he loved having her nails digging into his back.</p><p>But he wanted her naked.</p><p>\u201cLift up so I can take this off.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him with sweet fire. Then she pushed him away with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo watch your game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I\u2019m as hard as a fucking two by four.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanna watch it. And from now on, I won\u2019t seduce you on game day, at least until the game is over.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cRielle Wetzler, you are the perfect woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin slipped on his sweat pants. \u201cYou really don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here, waiting. I\u2019ve got some good reading material. Who knows what new things I\u2019ll learn when I\u2019m flipping through your sex books?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Late January...</p><p>Freedom could be spelled one way: C-A-R.</p><p>God. Her life had gotten so much better in the last month since she could drive.</p><p>No more begging rides.</p><p>No more sitting around doing nothing.</p><p>No more waiting for Marin to toss her a few scraps of friendship. She made her own fun and her own friends.</p><p>She\u2019d met a lot of people at house parties the last four weekends, when she, a lowly sophomore, became the undisputed beer pong champion. She preened at the comments about living up to the McKay reputation.</p><p>Sierra Daniels had arrived.</p><p>Her transformation had started during Christmas break, when her mom had lifted her curfew, handed her the keys to her Escalade and told her to have fun. Wasn\u2019t it proof of how awesome she was that so many people from her old school wanted to hang out with her?</p><p>Amazing how many friends you have when you\u2019ve got wheels and booze, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>She shoved that bullshit thought aside. People liked her. And she liked herself.</p><p>Her dad hadn\u2019t wanted her to go out tonight, but that was too bad. After all the times she\u2019d sat at home by herself since they\u2019d moved to Wyoming, it served him right to spend a night or two alone. Besides, if Rielle had been around this weekend, he wouldn\u2019t have even noticed she was gone.</p><p>\u201cSierra!\u201d Kara yelled from across the room. \u201cCome here, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>Sierra weaved through the crowd, saying hi to some people, hugging others. She\u2019d heard the buzz around school after she\u2019d started going to parties that she wasn\u2019t the stuck-up rich girl that people thought.</p><p>\u201cThis is the one I was telling you about,\u201d Kara said to the guy sitting next to her, who was probably five or six years older than her. \u201cSierra, Tyler. Tyler goes to Vo-Tech in Gillette.\u201d</p><p>A college guy. A cute college guy. Although he did appear a little rough around the edges. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Kara. She is hot.\u201d Tyler lifted a bottle and drank.</p><p>\u201cSierra just moved here from Arizona,\u201d Kara added.</p><p>\u201cNo shit. A buddy of mine is working construction down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Is that what you\u2019re going to school for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m in auto mechanics.\u201d He cocked his head and his brown-eyed gaze flicked over her, from her boots to her eyes. \u201cI like things that go fast.\u201d</p><p>Cheesy line, but he was obviously interested. She\u2019d flirt. No harm in that.</p><p>Kara mouthed, \u201cLater,\u201d and ditched her.</p><p>\u201cSo, ah, Tyler, how\u2019d you hear about the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround.\u201d He eyed her cup. \u201cWhatcha drinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer. Why?\u201d</p><p>He waggled a bottle of Jack Daniels. \u201cI\u2019m willing to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>Tyler grinned. \u201cSmart girl. Why don\u2019t you do a couple shots with me and we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sierra drained her beer and tossed the cup aside. She snatched the bottle from him and drank. Somehow she withheld a shudder. Jesus. That stuff tasted like shit. The Crown XR her dad drank was way better.</p><p>He laughed and grabbed the bottle back. \u201cEager. I like that.\u201d He tipped the bottle, somehow keeping his gaze on her chest while he guzzled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I was here last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I had to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. It was a great party. Been a lot of great parties lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been to all of them?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t got a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice.\u201d He knocked back another slug. \u201cSo if you ain\u2019t workin\u2019, what do you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been stuck at home for a few months without wheels, so it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had any fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019re in luck, \u2019cause I can think of a whole lotta ways we can have fun together tonight.\u201d He passed the bottle back to her. \u201cDrink up.\u201d</p><p>Sierra held her breath and managed to swallow another mouthful. But she didn\u2019t stop the shudder this time.</p><p>\u201cGets better by about the fifth shot. After that, you won\u2019t know what you\u2019re swallowing.\u201d</p> <p>Her warning bells went off. Especially when he wrapped his fingers in the necklace she wore and tugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you all night.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cHeard some things about you. You\u2019ve got a nice ass, pretty face too.\u201d He kept putting pressure on her necklace chain, giving her no choice but to move closer to him.</p><p>Her brain warned her to tell him that he was choking her, even as she feared he was fully aware of what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cNow. How about we talk about payment?\u201d</p> <p>Two shots in a row made her head spin.</p><p>Stupid, Sierra. What is wrong with you?</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t make her legs or arms work.</p><p>\u201cWanna hear your options?\u201d</p><p>No. I want you to let me go. \u201cI could just pay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m wantin\u2019 something else. Your money is no good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut mine is. I figure she drank maybe five bucks worth of Jack.\u201d A hand waved a five dollar bill between her face and Tyler\u2019s. \u201cSo consider this payment in full.\u201d</p><p>Boone.</p><p>Oh God, Boone was here. She didn\u2019t know whether to be happy or embarrassed.</p><p>Tyler released her necklace. She sucked in a deep breath and snapped back against Boone\u2019s chest.</p><p>But Tyler didn\u2019t notice, he was too busy glaring at Boone. \u201cWhat the fuck is your problem, West?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one, Ty. Just watching out for my girl.\u201d He tucked the folded bill in Tyler\u2019s shirt pocket. \u201cWe square?\u201d</p><p>Sierra remained frozen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with her? Bullshit,\u201d Tyler spat. \u201cKara didn\u2019t say nothin\u2019 to me about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause Kara doesn\u2019t know. No one knows.\u201d Boone dropped his arm over Sierra\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOur families would have a shit fit if they knew we were together.\u201d Then Boone\u2019s hot mouth teased the skin below her ear. \u201cRight, sugar bear?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said the words loud enough for Tyler to hear. But her tongue seemed to be stuck to the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull that silent treatment crap with me,\u201d Boone warned Sierra testily. \u201cTell you what. You don\u2019t get pissed off at me for bein\u2019 late and I won\u2019t get pissed off at you for drinking with another guy. \u2019Cause you know how jealous I get, baby.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s gaze moved between them. He looked ready to kill Boone. And maim her.</p><p>Boone twined his fingers in her hair and pulled her head back in a move that showed his displeasure she hadn\u2019t answered him. Then he put his mouth on her ear and whispered, \u201cFor Christsake, Sierra, act like we\u2019re together or Tyler will fuck me up, and then he\u2019ll fuck you.\u201d</p><p>That snapped her out of it. \u201cSorry, Boone. Don\u2019t be mad.\u201d Sierra turned her head and buried her face in his neck.</p><p>Boone sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s a big fuckin\u2019 cocktease when she\u2019s been drinking.\u201d He offered Tyler his hand. \u201cNo hard feelings?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed before Tyler shook Boone\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you got here in time. Me\u2019n her were about to have us a private party. You\u2019d better keep a tighter leash on her. Most guys ain\u2019t as understanding as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d Boone curled his hand around her hip and squeezed. \u201cAny bedrooms open so Sierra and I can...talk?\u201d</p><p>Tyler laughed. Then he yelled, \u201cJimbo. Clear out my bedroom so these two can fuck and make up.\u201d</p><p>His bedroom? Omigod. This was his house?</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Boone dropped his free hand to her ass and kept his arm around her neck, almost in a headlock as he maneuvered her through the crowd.</p><p>Sierra felt everyone staring at them, but she kept her gaze on her feet. Even that didn\u2019t keep her from stumbling. She heard laughter and Boone\u2019s grip tightened.</p><p>He steered her into a bedroom and slammed the door behind them.</p><p>The shots hit her the same time as the reality of the situation. She tripped over something on the floor and Boone caught her before she fell.</p><p>He pushed her against the door, bracing her shoulders, and got right in her face. \u201cWhat the fuck were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is goddamn obvious, Sierra.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Look at me. Keep those eyes open because the room will start spinning and I don\u2019t wanna deal with you being sick as well as being stupid.\u201d</p><p>Stupid. She hated being called stupid. And it stung hearing it from him. \u201cI\u2019m not that drunk.\u201d Sierra put her hands on his chest and shoved him as hard as she could.</p><p>Boone wasn\u2019t expecting it and he stumbled back two steps.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone. I don\u2019t need you to fucking babysit me, Boone.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his hands into fists at his sides and stared at her. \u201cWhat the hell do you think would\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d left you alone with Tyler Larkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve figured something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after he fed you more booze, dragged you into his bedroom and raped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRape. Sex without consent,\u201d he snarled. \u201cTyler doesn\u2019t fucking care if you\u2019re conscious.\u201d</p><p>She felt sick. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he did it to a friend of mine. They were drinking and then the next thing she remembered was waking up with him on top of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Then Boone was face to face with her again. \u201cI told you to stay away from Kara. And I heard you\u2019ve been here, at her brother Tyler\u2019s house for the past two weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was his house.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Tyler was her brother.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned hard. \u201cYou just showed up at some random person\u2019s house and started drinking with strangers? Jesus. Sierra. You\u2019re smarter than that. Why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fucking sick and tired of sitting at home by myself all the time, okay? No one in this godforsaken town wants anything to do with me. So when Kara and Angie asked me to hang out, I said yes. I thought maybe I\u2019d meet other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to meet the people they hang out with,\u201d he snapped. \u201cFor Christsake, Tyler is twenty-three. He\u2019s been in jail. The only people who are around him are his loser jailbird buddies and his sister\u2019s high school friends who don\u2019t have any other place to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAre you one of his loser friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. I showed up because I heard at school you were here last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. I haven\u2019t seen you in school for weeks, so I doubt you heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only need one credit to graduate so I\u2019m only there for one class in the morning, so yeah, I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you give a shit what I do anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I also heard you\u2019re some kind of party girl now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t need to head down this road again, Sierra. Making bad choices like you did in Arizona.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was right. But he had no idea how alone she felt. And it wasn\u2019t like he called to check up on her like he\u2019d said he might. He had no business judging her anyway. They weren\u2019t anything to each other.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she slumped against the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your good deed, protecting me from Tyler. Thank you. You\u2019ve made it clear I\u2019m a fucking idiot. So go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to what? Leave you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a car.\u201d</p><p>Boone\u2019s hands were on her arms. \u201cYou think you\u2019re gonna drive after you\u2019ve been drinking? Bullshit. What the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>She twisted out of his hold. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna leave right now, asshole. I\u2019ll be sober enough to drive in a couple of hours. I\u2019ll just hang out until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself. Do you really think Tyler will let you hang out? Especially after I convinced him that we\u2019re together? What exactly do you think the people out there think we\u2019re doing in here? Talking?\u201d he half-sneered.</p><p>She opened her mouth to deny it, but Boone was right. \u201cFine. You can stay in here with me. That oughta add to your stud reputation. That you banged me for two solid hours.\u201d</p><p>Boone blushed. Then he got pissed off. \u201cRight. Because that\u2019s all I give a shit about. My reputation as some kind of stud. Even if we stay in here, that doesn\u2019t deal with the problem when we leave the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to act like we\u2019re together at least a little while, so Tyler doesn\u2019t track me down and beat the fuck out of me for pulling one over on him. That\u2019s the kind of guy he is. Making him look stupid turns him psycho.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cDammit. This is the last thing I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Meaning, I\u2019m the last one you wanted to be tied to\u2014in reality or even pretend.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Boone? Fuck off. You don\u2019t have to act so disgusted that people will think we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Boone whirled around. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think? That being with you would be an embarrassment to me? God. You are drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. If we\u2019re a couple at school the news will spread like wildfire through the McKay and West families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will have a very loud and public breakup on Monday morning. Or better yet, let\u2019s have a big fight now. Want me to scream and storm out?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus.

The road conditions were shitty an hour ago. They\u2019ve gotta be worse by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ride your bike here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you expect to get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you expect to get home?\u201d he countered. \u201cOr did you tell your dad you were spending the night someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My curfew is midnight.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s only nine thirty. Give me your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in my coat.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cWhen we get out there, go ahead and act like you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be an act,\u201d she flashed her teeth at him.</p><p>Boone jammed his hands into her hair and messed it up. He popped the button on his jeans. Then he pulled her shirt down her arm, exposing her bra strap. \u201cThere. At least it looks like we\u2019ve been going at it.\u201d</p><p>Her head pounded and she just wanted to leave.</p><p>He held out his hand for hers and opened the door.</p><p>A few catcalls greeted them. She\u2019d just slipped on her coat when Kara and Angie sidled up to her. \u201cOmigod, Sierra. Why didn\u2019t you tell us you were with Boone West?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him, too tired to come up with something clever. \u201cBecause our families will freak out. So don\u2019t tell anyone. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our secret. We promise.\u201d They exchanged a conspiring look.</p><p>Sierra allowed Boone to tuck her against his side as they left the party.</p><p>Fierce winds smacked her in the face, stealing her breath, and she jerked away from Boone. Immediately vertigo hit; she swayed and fell on her ass.</p><p>Boone picked her up without comment. He shoved her in the passenger seat and buckled her in.</p><p>The drive was tense and the visibility horrible, as Boone repeatedly pointed out. After a bit, he said, \u201cYour car runs like crap. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Been like that a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still driving it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that or sit at home.\u201d</p><p>Boone muttered.</p><p>As soon as they hit the cut-across to the paved county road, he drove faster. He probably couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of her. But given the weather and the fact he didn\u2019t have his bike, Boone would be stuck at her house. What would her Dad think?</p><p>He\u2019ll be pissed you\u2019ve been drinking.</p><p>Snow swirled and blew over the windshield. It made her dizzy and she wanted to close her eyes. Why was it taking so long for the car to warm up?</p><p>A loud bang sounded and the car wobbled.</p><p>She glanced over at Boone to see both his hands clamped on the steering wheel. His feet intermittently pumped the brakes. She saw his horror when they picked up momentum and the road seemed to buckle and snap.</p><p>She was jerked forward as the front end connected with a solid object, throwing snow on the windshield before the world went dark.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Gavin glanced at his cell phone when it rang at eleven-thirty. That\u2019d better not be his daughter calling to say she\u2019d be late coming home. Again.</p><p>The caller ID was a restricted number so he was tempted to ignore it, but he answered, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin? This is Cam.\u201d</p><p>Why the hell would Cam McKay be calling him this time of night? Then it hit him. Cam was with the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s been in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>He sank into the closest chair. The words registered, yet not. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. She\u2019s in the ER now. Look, the roads are nasty and there\u2019ve been a lot of accidents. Do you have a four-wheel drive vehicle that\u2019ll get you into Sundance?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the phone. \u201cWhat? I need a four-wheeler to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s take this slow.\u201d Cam asked a question. Gavin answered. Cam asked another question. Gavin answered again. Cam asked, \u201cIs Rielle there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s in Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay to drive?\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cGavin, stay on the line.\u201d</p><p>Sierra. Ask him what\u2019s going on with Sierra before he hangs up.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>Dead air for what seemed like forever.</p><p>Then a click. \u201cI called Ben. He\u2019ll be there in five minutes to get you.\u201d</p><p>That registered. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of calling his brother? It also registered he hadn\u2019t asked if his daughter was all right. \u201cWhat can you tell me about Sierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to stay on the line with you until Ben arrives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cam. Thanks. I\u2019m...I\u2019ll...I need to get myself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. See you in a few.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t get himself together. He was absolutely numb. What if she was...? He squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn\u2019t think the word, let alone say it.</p><p>Every second felt like a day. He slipped on his cold weather gear. By the time he\u2019d pulled on the hat Sierra had made him, a vehicle barreled up the driveway and he scooted out of the house and into Ben\u2019s big rig.</p><p>Ben whipped a U-turn in the drive. Then they were on the highway leading to Sundance. \u201cAny word on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just that she was in an accident.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the cab as Gavin stared out the window into the black night. He finally said, \u201cCam said the roads are bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here. But I flipped on the road condition report. Guess it\u2019s worse by Moorcroft. Was that where she was tonight?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he know?</p><p>Because as soon as she\u2019d gotten those keys she was gone. He\u2019d been relieved the issue of her not driving wasn\u2019t an issue between them anymore, so he\u2019d been lax asking her specifics on where she was going, what she was doing, and who she was doing it with.</p><p>Some parent. No idea where his kid had been, no idea how the fuck he\u2019d deal with it if something bad had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Rielle?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cTrade show in Denver with Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until I know...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSame with Sierra\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s err on the side that everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying. But if anything happened to her, I\u2019d lose my fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t think that way.\u201d</p><p>It was hard not to. \u201cSorry that Cam got you out of bed. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight when he called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I wasn\u2019t in bed. I called Mom and Dad. They\u2019re a little slower on the draw, but they\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t long before they were in town. Gavin unbuckled his seatbelt the instant they turned into the hospital parking lot.</p><p>Ben pulled up to the front. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll see you inside.\u201d</p><p>He nearly fell on his ass when his boots connected with the slippery ground. He righted himself and headed through the ER doors. A woman not much older than Sierra managed the front desk.</p><p>\u201cSir? How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra Daniels. I\u2019m her father. I need to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the staff know you\u2019re here. In the meantime, you\u2019ll need to fill out all the paperwork on this clipboard\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Gavin had already started down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cSir! You can\u2019t just go back there.\u201d</p><p>Watch me.</p><p>He stopped short of yelling her name as he passed by hospital rooms. He reached another desk and the woman behind it was no pushover. She got in his face. \u201cYou cannot barge back here.\u201d</p><p>He loomed over her. \u201cMy daughter was in a car accident and I\u2019ve no idea if she\u2019s even okay. Please, just give me any kind of information\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing a CT scan on her right now.\u201d</p><p>Gavin whirled around. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlan. The EMT who brought her in.\u201d He raised his hand to forestall Gavin\u2019s question. \u201cBefore you badger me to tell you more, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>He turned the other direction quickly.</p><p>A male in surgical scrubs moved toward him and Gavin\u2019s heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Roger, the ER nurse. Before I can tell you anything you need to fill out the forms. There are a few questions we need answers to on Sierra\u2019s health history.\u201d He pointed to the small waiting room. \u201cThe sooner you get the bureaucratic portion done, the sooner we can treat your daughter and the sooner you can see her.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grabbed the clipboard and pen. His eyeballs pulsed with anger. This was bullshit. It\u2019d be faster if they just asked him the fucking questions. He glanced at the clipboard. The words on the paper blurred into black blots.</p><p>Get control.</p><p>Five excruciating minutes later he handed in the paperwork. Then another five minutes before Nurse Roger appeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you back to see Sierra. Two things you should know. Sierra admitted she\u2019s been drinking tonight.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s stomach dropped even as his blood pressure skyrocketed. Sierra had been drinking and driving?</p><p>\u201cYou can yell at her about poor choices another time. I need you to be focused on the positive side of this. Like she wasn\u2019t behind the wheel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She wasn\u2019t driving?\u201d As much as that relieved him, it also had him demanding, \u201cThen who the hell was driving?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger put his hand on Gavin\u2019s arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am calm. Who was driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>Since when did Sierra have a boyfriend? As he looked at Roger. \u201cYou said two positive things. What\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wore her seatbelt. She only ended up with a broken collarbone and didn\u2019t go through the windshield.\u201d</p><p>White spots danced in front of Gavin\u2019s eyes and he swayed.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there. Let\u2019s sit down for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. Just...no one\u2019s told me anything about what happened or how it happened or that she had...\u201d Broken body parts. He managed a hoarse, \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the doctor discuss that with you. You\u2019re ready to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Roger walked to a room at the end of the hallway.</p><p>With each footstep Gavin\u2019s heart beat faster. His mouth was so dry he couldn\u2019t swallow. His gut churned. His pulse pounded in his eyes, in his ears, in his throat. Hospital sounds morphed into brutal silence in his head, making him feel like he was underwater.</p><p>Then he was beside her and he almost wept at seeing the most precious thing in his life lying in a hospital bed attached to an IV. Her dark hair was pulled back, showing the paleness of her face against the white pillow. Bruises dotted her face, jaw and neck. Her lips were reddened, cracked and chapped. Her right arm was strapped in a sling and resting on her belly. She wore a hospital gown. The left side of her body from her shoulder down was covered with several blankets. He was as afraid to touch her as he was afraid not to touch her.</p><p>Roger said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can get closer.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin murmured, \u201cWhy\u2019s she covered up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypothermia. She was really chilled when they brought her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was she out in the elements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>His heart leapt at hearing her voice. \u201cSierra-bear. I\u2019m here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened. Tears immediately poured out. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know I was stupid... I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d He held her face in his hands. She was so cold. \u201cWe can talk about all that other stuff later. I\u2019m just happy you\u2019re mostly all right.\u201d He swiped away her tears with his thumbs and kissed her forehead. He let his lips linger, needing to reassure himself she was breathing.</p><p>\u201cBut I need to know if Boone is okay.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin pulled back and looked into her pain-filled eyes. \u201cBoone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoone West. He was driving.\u201d</p><p>Boone West. Why did that name sound familiar? Right. The punk-ass kid who\u2019d worked on the garage with Chet and Remy West. If that little fucker was responsible for the accident it didn\u2019t matter if he was all right because Gavin was going to fucking kill him.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend is okay,\u201d Roger said. \u201cHe\u2019s being checked out in another room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend,\u201d Sierra whispered.</p><p>\u201cEven if he was, he wouldn\u2019t be after this,\u201d Gavin snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at him. He wouldn\u2019t let me drive because I\u2019d been drinking. It\u2019s not his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot his fault,\u201d Gavin repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital after he wrecked your car. That puts him entirely at fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Daniels,\u201d Roger warned.</p><p>Gavin clenched and unclenched his fists. He wanted to inflict pain on that kid for the pain Sierra was suffering through. Somehow, he got control. He touched Sierra\u2019s good shoulder, but she flinched anyway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. That hurts.\u201d More tears slid down her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d Gavin looked at Roger. \u201cHave you given her anything for the pain?\u201d</p><p>Alan shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a minor and we couldn\u2019t administer anything until you arrived. Plus, it\u2019s too risky with alcohol in her system. She\u2019s on an IV to clear it out faster. Meantime, we\u2019re putting an icepack on the injury every thirty minutes until it\u2019s safe to give her pain meds.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He felt so helpless. He wanted her to stop hurting now.</p><p>A white-coat-wearing doctor came around the curtain. He said, \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Abernathy,\u201d to Gavin, but he focused on Sierra. \u201cHow are you feeling, young lady?\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cStupid.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI hear that a lot in here, trust me. Let\u2019s talk about your injury. You in pain?\u201d</p><p>Sierra nodded.</p><p>\u201cScale of one to ten, ten being the highest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>The doctor jotted that down. \u201cHow about your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts really bad. So does my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour entire body will feel like that for several more days, sorry to say. But I\u2019ll point out that you\u2019re lucky. The accident could\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201d He gently patted her good shoulder. Then he faced Gavin. \u201cYou\u2019re her father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right to it. The CT scan revealed a mild concussion, which is actually good news. I expected a little more head trauma since the airbag didn\u2019t deploy.\u201d</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>\u201cHer clavicle sustained a fracture. A little worse than a hairline fracture, not as bad as a multiple fracture. Given her age, I\u2019d say she\u2019ll heal completely in twelve weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have to wear the sling the entire time. She can probably remove it after three weeks and only wear it at night for the next four weeks. But any activity that requires her to put pressure on that part of the body? Minimum amount of rest is twelve weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other treatment will she need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re keeping her overnight. Unless something unexpected shows up from the accident, I\u2019ll release her tomorrow. She\u2019ll need rest. I\u2019ll write a script for pain meds. She\u2019ll need to see her regular doctor in two weeks just to make sure everything is healing properly. She\u2019ll need physical therapy at some point.\u201d</p><p>His thoughts were racing as he tried to process it all. \u201cWhat about school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call. But since she is right handed, and she won\u2019t be able to use that hand or arm for the first two weeks, I suggest she remain at home. My other concern is an accidental fall. Sidewalks, parking lots and roads are dangerously icy this time of year. For her, even a minor fall could cause major damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Abernathy motioned to Roger. \u201cStart her on Demerol.\u201d They conversed in medical jargon.</p><p>Gavin kissed Sierra\u2019s forehead. \u201cI love you. We\u2019ll get you fixed up, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stay here overnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just want to make sure you don\u2019t have other injuries.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. But I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d leave you alone when you\u2019re hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just...I thought you\u2019d be mad. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. Why don\u2019t you close your eyes? I know you\u2019re in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Roger took him aside. \u201cWe\u2019re moving her into a regular room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA private room,\u201d Gavin insisted.</p><p>\u201cDoes your insurance cover that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll let them know. Once she\u2019s in her room we\u2019ll start the pain meds.\u201d</p><p>Gavin watched as they lifted Sierra from one bed to the next. He followed behind two nurses and one orderly as they wheeled the bed down the hallway and into a small room.</p><p>After hooking Sierra up to more machines, Roger injected the pain meds into her IV and spoke to her softly. He ditched the used surgical gloves and stopped in front of Gavin. \u201cThis stuff works pretty fast. But I\u2019ll be back in ten minutes to check on her.\u201d</p><p>Gavin hauled the chair beside the bed and held Sierra\u2019s hand between his, finally able to take a breath. Finally believing she\u2019d be okay.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>God, that made his heart hurt. She hadn\u2019t called him that in years. \u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes, she stopped stirring. Her breathing slowed.</p><p>Roger returned and discreetly checked on her, without disturbing her. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep. I know you\u2019re staying here tonight and that\u2019s fine. But there\u2019s a waiting room full of people asking for you. It\u2019s late and she can\u2019t have visitors, so could you please deal with them?\u201d</p><p>Gavin sent Sierra an anxious look.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out. I promise she won\u2019t know you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He took a minute to compose himself before he left the room.</p><p>Charlie and Vi jumped up the instant they saw him. Ben was standing next to Cam, still in uniform. Quinn threw the magazine he was reading on the table and stood.</p><p>Vi rushed forward and put her hands on his face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d He inhaled and told them Sierra\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cThe pain meds just kicked in so she\u2019s asleep. I\u2019m staying with her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything we can do?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need someone to bring my car tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr one of us could pick you up when you\u2019re ready,\u201d Charlie offered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be beholden to anyone. Ben understood that. He said, \u201cI can drop it by in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The three people sitting in the back of the room approached the group. Gavin recognized Chet and Remy West. His gaze narrowed on the taller young guy standing between them with a blanket dangling from his shoulders.</p><p>That fucker Boone West. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved quickly, latching onto the kid\u2019s jacket and hauling him up until they were nose to nose. \u201cYou have a fuckload of nerve being here when you\u2019re the reason my daughter is in the fucking hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Chet said sharply.</p><p>Gavin shook Boone. \u201cDon\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGavin,\u201d Ben said in that listen to me voice. \u201cLet him go.

But he didn\u2019t back off.</p> <p>Neither did Boone. \u201cHow is Sierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you think she is? She\u2019s got a broken collarbone, a concussion and she\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>A petite redhead bulled her way between Gavin and Boone, her focus on Gavin. \u201cBack off. Sit your ass down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely Monroe. I\u2019m Boone\u2019s doctor. And if you shake him like that again, I\u2019ll have Cam arrest you for assault. He was also in the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not in a goddamned hospital bed so it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong. He doesn\u2019t have health insurance, which is why I\u2019m here as a favor to his uncles. Checking to make sure he doesn\u2019t need to be hospitalized. He also had hypothermia and he refused to leave until he saw you and knew how Sierra was.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had no response for that.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d Cam pointed at two chairs facing each other. \u201cGavin. Take a seat. Boone, you too.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t argue. Neither did Boone.</p><p>\u201cNow, Boone, why don\u2019t you tell Gavin what you told us.\u201d</p><p>Boone aimed his face at the carpet.</p><p>Probably out of guilt that the kid couldn\u2019t even look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cNo rush,\u201d Cam said.</p> <p>Chet and Remy stood behind him; each had a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThe sooner you get this over with, the sooner we can get you to our place, get you warmed up and doped up so you can rest.\u201d</p><p>Boone nodded and winced slightly. \u201cI showed up at a party and Sierra was there. She\u2019d been drinking.\u201d</p><p>Gavin listened as the kid detailed what\u2019d gone on. His stomach pitched when he heard the word blowout. \u201cYou were driving Sierra\u2019s car and you had a blowout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how the accident happened, although her car was running like shit before that so it could\u2019ve been a combination of factors. I was driving about forty-five when the right front tire blew. I stepped on the brake and the back end skidded out on the ice. I managed to get the car slowed down but we still hit the ditch at thirty miles per hour. My airbag deployed. Sierra\u2019s didn\u2019t. At the angle we hit, the passenger\u2019s door got wedged open.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling took root. \u201cIt\u2019s twenty degrees below zero outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once the powder from the airbag cleared out, I saw Sierra was unconscious and I knew we were in the middle of fucking nowhere...\u201d Boone paused to take a breath. \u201cI shoved my airbag aside and hoped like hell Sierra had stashed a cold weather emergency kit someplace. I crawled out and opened the rear hatch. I found the thermal blanket and tucked it around her as best as I could after I checked her vitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVitals?\u201d Gavin repeated. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an EMT. She came to when I was checking her and I suspected between the impact and seatbelt, she\u2019d broken her collarbone. My cell phone was dead so I found hers and called the ambulance line directly. They were en route to the hospital from another accident. Given our location, I knew it\u2019d be thirty minutes before the ambulance even reached us.\u201d That\u2019s when Boone looked Gavin in the eye. His eyes filled with guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The instant that tire blew I knew we were gonna crash. I tried to...\u201d</p><p>This kid that he\u2019d accused of hurting his daughter had actually saved her. Saved her. Saved her from drinking and driving. Saved her from hypothermia. Saved her by being an experienced driver. Because if Sierra had been behind the wheel? She probably wouldn\u2019t have known what to do during a blowout. It might\u2019ve been hours before anyone found her...in subzero temperatures, alone, injured...she wouldn\u2019t have made it long.</p><p>The horror of the situation hit him anew and he started to lose it. His body shook. He couldn\u2019t breathe. He wanted to laugh, scream and cry all at the same time.</p><p>Then Vi was tugging him to his feet. Telling everyone he needed some air.</p><p>He clutched her hand, followed her blindly as she led him to another small waiting area. She placed her cold hands on his cheeks and got right in his face. \u201cGavin,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... What if... She...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you and me here. Go on, son, and let it out. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin broke down, crying quietly, silently. His body trembling as he curled into her and let her hold him up. His thoughts bounced between being grateful that Sierra was all right and being paralyzed with fear about what if scenarios now that he knew the truth.</p><p>He began to regain control when his gratitude overtook his fear. He squeezed Vi before he released her. \u201cThank you.\u201d He could barely look her in the eye. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tough front only lasts so long and then those tiny cracks start to appear. No one else saw it, if you\u2019re worried about that, but I recognized it.\u201d She fussed with his shirt collar.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Gavin expected her to say because I\u2019m your mother, but her answer surprised him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the same way. I never want anyone to see me as weak. Even when a few tears don\u2019t make you weak, they make you human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here. I...\u201d Just say it. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I needed anyone and apparently I do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cAlong those lines...please let us help you when Sierra comes home. She won\u2019t be a happy camper bound up and homebound and the more people who show her they love her and want to entertain her, the better. Plus, it\u2019ll keep you two from being at each other\u2019s throats for the duration. I know the two of you butt heads frequently.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now I know you\u2019re chomping at the bit to check on her, so I\u2019ll send the people in the waiting room home.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cNot that I\u2019m meddling or telling you what to do, but you owe that boy an apology.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. He acted like such a jackass. Assuming. Blustering. He owed Boone West more than he could ever repay him.</p><p>He\u2019d deal with that another day. He had a long night ahead of him.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Rielle couldn\u2019t get in touch with Gavin. After a couple of hours she tried Sierra\u2019s cell. No answer.</p><p>When another couple hours passed and still no word, she couldn\u2019t shake the bad feeling. She called Ben and Ainsley\u2019s house. Ben answered. \u201cRielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Ben. I can\u2019t get a hold of Gavin or Sierra. Have you seen them since yesterday morning?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cSierra was in a car accident last night.\u201d</p><p>Her breakfast threatened to come back up. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcussion, broken collarbone. She had to stay overnight in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Gavin all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...\u201d Ben sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s really shaken up. He won\u2019t ask you to come home, Ree, and I ain\u2019t messing in your business, but he needs you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to drop Rory off in Laramie and I\u2019ll be there late afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey oughta be home by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Rory came around the corner with four huge bundles of fleece. \u201cHave you ever worked with Alpaca? This stuff is priced really low.\u201d She noticed the change in Rielle\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra was in a car accident last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital, but she\u2019s coming home today. So I need to get back to Sundance right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything you bought today packaged and ready to pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Maybe tell Jim at Good Seed to step on it. I added to the order yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Rory dropped the bundles on the counter. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried, but you have to make sure you bought all the supplies to get you through spring planting before we leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m good. I wanted to comparison shop kit greenhouses, but that can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your seed order and meet you at the truck.\u201d</p><p>The Natural Age Trade show filled the gigantic convention center. Some vendors had to take space off the main site. Navigating the aisles took time even when she wasn\u2019t looking for specific items. Since Jim\u2019s display was on the other side of the arena, she knew it\u2019d be an hour before they\u2019d get to leave. She paid for her fiber and picked up greenhouse brochures as she passed by on her way out the door.</p><p>Worried sick about Sierra, and Gavin, and facing a drive where she\u2019d do nothing but worry more, Rielle knew this would be the longest day ever.</p><p>Rielle pulled into the driveway at dusk and saw Vi\u2019s car. Good. At least Gavin had some help and support.</p><p>Her purchases would be fine left in her truck overnight. She hunched into the collar of her coat as she climbed the stairs.</p><p>Sadie whined when she came inside. \u201cWere you a good girl?\u201d She gave her a thorough rubbing and petting.</p><p>Vi came around the corner. \u201cI was hoping that was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding up. He\u2019s exhausted. I don\u2019t think he slept a wink last night at the hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle scratched behind Sadie\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he gets some rest. How is Sierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGroggy. She\u2019s been out of it most the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I should know that he won\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell you more than he told me.\u201d Vi reached for her coat. \u201cThere\u2019s a casserole in the oven. If you need anything, please call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably be seeing a lot of me,\u201d Vi warned before she headed outside.</p><p>Shivering, Rielle closed the door behind her. It was much colder here than in Denver the last three days. She scaled the stairs two at a time. The TV was on, but the game wasn\u2019t as loud as usual. She crossed to the couch and saw Gavin stretched out. Poor guy looked tense even in sleep, but she was glad to see him resting and she didn\u2019t want to disturb him.</p><p>Turning to go, she heard a hoarse, \u201cRee?\u201d</p> <p>She backtracked and crouched beside him. \u201cHey. I heard it\u2019s been a rough day.\u201d</p><p>Gavin dry-washed his face. \u201cYeah. Hard to believe it hasn\u2019t even been twenty-four hours since I got the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in pain, so we\u2019re keeping her pretty doped up for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Rielle grabbed his hand and kissed his knuckles. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I was.\u201d</p> <p>She waited for him to say, better now that you\u2019re here, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cCan I get you anything? You hungry? Vi cooked supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d He sat up and put his feet on the floor. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ll probably bring it up here so I can listen for Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay. I\u2019ll bring it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She returned a few minutes later with a plate piled with ham and potato casserole and a slice of seven-grain bread. He\u2019d given her such a weird vibe she hadn\u2019t brought up a plate for herself.</p><p>\u201cThat looks great.\u201d He dug in immediately. One eye on the food; one eye on the game.</p><p>He\u2019s hungry and tired and stressed. Don\u2019t read anything into this.</p><p>Rielle started toward the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eating with me?\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t want to assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease assume that I\u2019d like to eat with you whenever possible, okay?\u201d</p><p>That mollified her. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The meal was quiet. Afterward, Gavin pushed back his plate and sighed. \u201cThis has been a fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Gavin relayed the events in a clipped tone and finished with, \u201cI have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shouldering the blame for Sierra\u2019s mistake? She went to that party, knowing it was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue. I\u2019ve been letting her drive wherever the fuck she wants, in this shitty weather, on these shitty roads, and I couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the maintenance on her vehicle in the last month when she\u2019s been driving all the time? Making sure her vehicle was safe? I should\u2019ve just bought her a new goddamned car instead of a used one. That is totally on me.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cWhat the hell has been so goddamned important in my life that I let that slide?\u201d</p><p>Rielle had a pang of guilt. Since Sierra had become mobile, she and Gavin spent all their free time together. Did he blame her?</p><p>\u201cSorry. Wishing I would\u2019ve been more attentive is Monday morning quarterbacking and totally fucking pointless.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cAnyway, would you mind sticking around to listen for Sierra while I take a shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Do I just check on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a bell to ring when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cA bell? Like a bell an English aristocrat uses to a ring for her servants at tea time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A cowbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave a sixteen-year-old a cowbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn gave it to her,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI told him I\u2019m buying Amelia bagpipes for her next birthday.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGo take your shower.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t try to steal a kiss or pat her ass\u2014so unlike him.</p><p>After the shower kicked on, the sound of a cowbell drifted down the hallway.</p><p>Rielle knocked before pushing open the door. \u201cSierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee? Where\u2019s my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just jumped in the shower. Something you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drink of water.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the water bottle off the dresser. She couldn\u2019t help but smooth Sierra\u2019s dark hair back from her pale face. \u201cHow you feeling, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore. I can\u2019t move without it hurting.\u201d She struggled to sit up and Rielle adjusted her pillows. \u201cThanks. I thought you were gone until Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided I was needed here. So make me feel needed. What can I do to help you?\u201d</p><p>Sierra rested against the pillow. \u201cEverything. I\u2019m helpless. It\u2019s hard to even go to the bathroom. My right hand is useless. How can I wash my hair or even comb it with one hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to your dad about this?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDid he hire a home health aide to assist you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. He thinks it\u2019s his job to take care of me.\u201d She started to cry. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff I don\u2019t want him to help me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, I don\u2019t blame you. Do you want me to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you help me?\u201d she asked in an unsure voice.</p><p>Rielle impulsively kissed Sierra\u2019s forehead and wiped her tears. \u201cOf course. Anything you need, just ask.\u201d She rubbed a small section of Sierra\u2019s hair between her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I combed out a girl\u2019s hair. That said...payback will be sweet for the funky hairstyle you gave me.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a wan smile even through her tears. She winced. \u201cI can tell it\u2019s time for a pain pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let your dad dispense that.\u201d She ran her hand up Sierra\u2019s good arm. \u201cNeed anything else right now? Food? Something else to drink? Another blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Gavin said from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cRee\u2019s volunteered to help me with some girl hygiene stuff.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stopped beside the bed and looked at Rielle with disbelief. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Did he really think she\u2019d just stand back and do nothing while Sierra struggled? While he struggled? Staying out of Gavin\u2019s parenting decisions with Sierra didn\u2019t mean she wanted to stay out of Sierra\u2019s life. Didn\u2019t he see the difference? Didn\u2019t he know how much she\u2019d come to care for his daughter?</p><p>Cut him some slack. He\u2019s figuring out a way to deal with all this.</p><p>Rielle smiled. At Sierra. \u201cLet me know when you need me. Have a good night.\u201d She brushed past Gavin without a word and returned downstairs.</p><p>In the two days since Rielle had returned from Denver, Gavin hadn\u2019t kissed her. Hadn\u2019t touched her. Hadn\u2019t explained why he wasn\u2019t doing any of those things. So Rielle let it ride.</p><p>But by the fourth day she wondered if Gavin\u2019s supposed distraction was actually dismissal. Of her. Of their relationship.</p><p>Ask him.</p><p>That would make her seem needy.</p><p>Then seduce him.</p><p>That would make her seem needier yet.</p><p>Still...that got her to thinking. Why should Gavin have to make the first move? Maybe he thought she wasn\u2019t interested in doing the mattress mambo since she hadn\u2019t made a move either.</p><p>So she\u2019d seduce him tonight. Take his mind off his worry and make him mindless\u2014if only for a little while.</p><p>Plan in place, Rielle helped Sierra until Vi shooed her away. She tackled her to-do list, but didn\u2019t accomplish much since various McKays traipsed in and out of the house all day.</p><p>By the time the clock struck ten, she ventured upstairs. Sierra\u2019s light was off. Gavin had stretched out on the couch to watch yet another sports game on TV.</p><p>Rielle straddled his lap and he smiled at her. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d She slid her hands under his T-shirt and leaned forward to kiss him.</p><p>Gavin emitted a deep, sexy rumble and kissed her back.</p><p>She touched him, teased him and felt his cock harden beneath her ass. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>In his bedroom, she stripped off his sweatpants, boxers and T-shirt. He sat on the edge of the bed, staring at her...expectantly? She peeled off her thermal T-shirt and stepped between his thighs, rubbing the upper swell of her breasts against his jawline and chin. He groaned and buried his face in her cleavage. She loved the feel of his rough whiskers on her tender skin. Still teasing him, she stepped back and her bra fell to the floor. She shimmied out of her jeans, hooked her fingers in her panties and eased them off slowly, then kicked off her socks.</p><p>Gavin wore a sexy, half-lidded, keep going look.</p><p>So she did. Rielle dropped to her knees and enclosed her mouth around his cock. Sucking and licking the hard shaft. Fondling his sac, then using her lips and teeth on just the wide head. She glanced up at him.</p><p>He\u2019d closed his eyes, but he made soft growling noises.</p><p>Blowing him always got her hot, so she was wet and ready for the next stage of seduction. She chuckled at Gavin\u2019s sound of disapproval when she released his cock from her mouth. Pushing him flat on the mattress, she crawled over him. Her hands followed the contours of his muscled biceps and forearms. Then she pressed his arms above his head and warned, \u201cKeep them there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Rielle rubbed her face over Gavin\u2019s upper body, inhaling his clean and musky scent. Nuzzling his neck and sliding her nipples against the hair on his chest. Rolling her hips and rocking her clit into the hard muscle of his lower abdomen.</p><p>She put her lips on his ear. \u201cYou can touch me now. I know how much you like to have your hands on my ass as I\u2019m riding you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t answer. Didn\u2019t move at all. Then he made a noise. But not the noise she expected. She heard it again.</p><p>Wait. Was that a...snore?</p><p>\u201cGavin?\u201d</p> <p>No response.</p><p>Rielle placed her hands by his head, lifting up to look into his face. It was damn dark in here, but she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.</p><p>Gavin. Asleep. And snoring softly.</p><p>Apparently his dick wasn\u2019t tired because it was still fully erect.</p><p>What the fuck?</p> <p>Was her seduction technique so bad, he\u2019d just conked out?</p><p>Tempting to slap him awake. But then...no. This was far too humiliating.</p><p>She got dressed and slunk out.</p><p>Gavin showed up in the kitchen early the next morning, whistling for Christsake. \u201cGood morning, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the cupboard door. When she turned around he wore the oddest expression.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something to piss you off?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe, possibly, I\u2019m just a teensy bit upset because you fucking fell asleep when I seduced you.</p><p>The oven timer went off. Slipping on her hot mitts, she pulled out the dinner rolls, setting the pan on the cooling racks. She lifted the towel on the next pan and slid it into the oven. When she turned around, she saw Mr. Narcoleptic had helped himself to a cup of coffee.</p><p>Too bad you didn\u2019t drink some coffee last night, buddy.</p><p>\u201cSo...I had the weirdest dream about you. I was watching TV upstairs and you showed up. We started going at it hot and heavy. Then you dragged me into my bedroom, where you stripped me and pushed me onto the bed. The way you sucked my cock...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost like it was real?\u201d she supplied sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYes! I watched you perform a strip tease, then you were crawling all over me, rubbing on me, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I woke up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. Too bad it ended there.\u201d She headed out the swinging door, but Gavin caught her wrist and pushed her against the wall. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He got right in her face. \u201cNo other comment on my dream? Like maybe...it wasn\u2019t a dream but a hazy memory from last night? A very hazy memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Got cold feet?\u201d</p><p>Why would he say that? \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But do you want to explain these?\u201d He eased back, pulling a sock out of his right front pocket, then his left pocket. \u201cI thought your feet might be cold since you forgot your socks in my room last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme those.\u201d Rielle snatched them and quickly ducked under his arm.</p><p>But he caught her, shoving her back in place. \u201cAh ah ah, not so fast. Tell me that I just had an incomplete dream and that I didn\u2019t conk out while you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked? Rubbing myself all over you like you were my personal stripper pole and then you started snoring? Yes, that did happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Rielle. I...I don\u2019t remember anything from last night after I checked on Sierra. I sat down to watch ESPN and I woke up this morning, naked in my bed.\u201d</p><p>She studied his eyes. Were they dark with guilt? Remorse? Disbelief?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making an excuse, but this type of...thing has been happening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Two days ago I woke up in the middle of the afternoon on the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep on the toilet?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cEvidently, for about thirty minutes.\u201d His cheeks colored and he looked embarrassed. \u201cAnd that is the most mortifying thing I\u2019ve ever had to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. I haven\u2019t been sleeping. I figured as long as I was up, listening for Sierra, I might as well be working. I\u2019ve been catching up on projects every night since Sierra came home from the hospital.\u201d He framed her face in his hands. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d check out when you were having your wicked way with me if I wasn\u2019t suffering from sleep deprivation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t touched me, or kissed me, or talked to me much since I came home from Denver.\u201d</p><p>Gavin frowned. \u201cYes I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You. Haven\u2019t.\u201d She poked his chest with each word.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He sealed his mouth to hers, kissing her in the deviously languid way that nearly melted her fillings. \u201cHow many days of missed kisses do I have to make up for, my love?\u201d He brushed his lips across hers. \u201cSix? Seven? Because I can\u2019t have you feeling neglected.\u201d Another soft smooch. \u201cUnwanted.\u201d He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI love you. And I\u2019m starting to think the reason I haven\u2019t been sleeping is because you haven\u2019t been in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat comment earns you total forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now if you\u2019ll listen for Sierra, I might slip back into bed for a few hours to try and get my sleep schedule back on track. Because tonight?\u201d He sucked on her lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. As many times as I want you, any way that I want you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Early February...</p><p>Boone appeared a week after Sierra\u2019s accident. Waltzing into her family room like it was no big deal, as she tried not to think about the fact she looked like hell, felt like hell and was embarrassed as hell.</p><p>Then he directed that breath-stealing smile at her the instant her dad was out of range. \u201cMcKay, you\u2019re looking a whole lot better than the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>She played it cool rather than breaking down in grateful tears the second she saw his face. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I hear blue lips are the fashion color for spring.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI take it you\u2019re on the mend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain isn\u2019t as bad. Sit down. Or aren\u2019t you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stay.\u201d He settled next to her, draping his arm along the back of the couch and propping his feet on the coffee table. \u201cTwo weeks out of school, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least two. Probably three.\u201d She groaned. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep up, but I\u2019m so slow and I can\u2019t write anything with my left hand anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m left handed, so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for me.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cSo what\u2019s new with you? Saved anyone else from rape, drunk driving and a deadly car accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease let me say this, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you for all you did for me that night. I vaguely remember you letting me squeeze your hand when the pain was too much as we waited for the ambulance. You made me talk to you and wouldn\u2019t let me fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But I figure we\u2019re even now in the life saving department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard my dad accused you of some stuff in the hospital and he got a little violent. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with it after...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI know he\u2019s apologized to you and tried to make amends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I don\u2019t want anything from either of you, understand?\u201d His fingers traced the bruise on her cheek and the bigger one on her neck. \u201cYou have no idea what I...\u201d He refocused on her eyes and stopped touching her. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d Her cheeks grew hot. \u201cAlso...thanks for not telling my dad everything that happened before the accident. At the party. Especially that thing with Tyler...I can\u2019t believe I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all do stupid shit.\u201d A strange expression crossed his face and vanished. \u201cDid you get in trouble for drinking?\u201d</p><p>Sierra pleated the folds of the blanket. \u201cYes. I\u2019m not supposed to drive for a while but it doesn\u2019t matter since my car is totaled. I\u2019m back to where I was just before Christmas. Carless.\u201d Friendless. \u201cSo entertain me. Any good gossip at school?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHasn\u2019t Marin told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarin hasn\u2019t come out to see me.\u201d And Sierra wasn\u2019t about to call her first. She hadn\u2019t heard from anyone, not even Angie and Kara. So much for all the great friends she\u2019d made in the last month.</p><p>\u201cActually, you and I are in the hot seat of gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because of the accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. There are interesting rumors going around. Like...we\u2019ve been secretly dating since school started. We had a fight while you were gone over Christmas break and you broke up with me. But we made up at Tyler\u2019s party with loud, raunchy sex. Everyone at the party heard us.\u201d</p><p>Sierra blushed.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the rumor I purposely crashed your car so I could save you. But that backfired because your father forbid you from ever seeing me again. He took a swing at me and it became a West versus McKay brawl in the hospital waiting room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are denying it all, right?\u201d</p><p>Boone grinned. \u201cNope. I\u2019m thinking of adding fuel to the fire by spending a few hours at India\u2019s Ink. Then the rumors will fly I got your name tattooed on my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Boone West! You can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me. Anyway, there\u2019s another reason I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fixing you lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you haven\u2019t lost that bizarre sense of humor, McKay. I\u2019m volunteering to be your study buddy.\u201d He poked her shoulder. \u201cYour right hand man.\u201d</p><p>She groaned at his pun but immediately grew suspicious. \u201cHey, wait a minute. Did my dad hire you to do this?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cLike I need payment to hang out with you? That hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. So tell me why you\u2019re volunteering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my girlfriend and you need me.\u201d He made loud kissing noises. \u201cI live to serve you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sierra glared at him. \u201cThe truth, Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s a selfish reason. I know you\u2019re working on a big project about McKay history. I thought if I helped you, I\u2019d find out some West history. After all the bullshit and rumors going around, I got to thinking about the feud. Has anyone ever told you how it started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck. When my Aunt Carolyn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Aunt Carolyn,\u201d he corrected with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhen our Aunt Carolyn told me I could access the McKay archives, I asked if she\u2019d let me scan all the old family documents. She claims there are letters and stuff from the late eighteen hundreds. Even she\u2019s not sure what\u2019s in there. As far as she knows, no one has looked at the old stuff in sixty or seventy years. She just keeps adding boxes of updated McKay history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say about you copying them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem as long as I pass along an electronic copy of all the files in case something happened to the originals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a scanner?\u201d</p><p>Her look said, doesn\u2019t everyone? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know I don\u2019t even have a computer? I have to use the ones at the library.\u201d</p><p>She had a computer and a laptop, which had never made her feel spoiled until now. \u201cIf you\u2019re over here helping me with homework, you can use mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you busy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work the graveyard shift tonight. Besides that, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because my dad retrieved the archives.\u201d</p><p>Those beautiful brown eyes lit up. \u201cReally? Where are they?\u201d</p><p>Sierra pointed to the far wall.</p><p>He turned to look. \u201cHoly shit. There\u2019s got to be thirty boxes there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThat\u2019ll take weeks to scan.\u201d</p> <p>God, I hope so.</p><p>Boone faced her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019d better get cracking.\u201d</p><p>When Marin called the following week, asking if she could come over, Sierra almost said no. Being in pain was a legitimate excuse for denying visitors, but Marin probably knew most of the McKay family had been by, so she said yes.</p><p>Rielle escorted Marin upstairs. Sierra sensed Ree wanted to hang around. During their knitting sessions before Christmas, Sierra had mentioned her frustration with Marin constantly ditching her for Mitch.</p><p>Despite her closeness to her dad, he didn\u2019t understand girl drama. His advice was to ignore Marin, stop complaining about her and find new friends. God. That made her want to scream. So she should just walk up to a group of girls in her class and say, hey, you wanna be my friend? like she had in preschool? No one did that. She\u2019d rather eat lunch by herself every day and have no friends than come off that weird and desperate.</p><p>Sierra tried to talk to her mom over Christmas break about her lack of friends problem, but she\u2019d gone on a rant about how all women were bitches, they all started out mean little girls and never evolved. The trick, she\u2019d told her, was to become the bigger bitch. Don\u2019t care what people think of you. Tell them to kiss your size two butt if they don\u2019t like you. Then her mother also warned her that women would always be gunning for her because she was pretty and rich. Sierra hadn\u2019t said much\u2014she hadn\u2019t needed to; her mother had gone off on another tangent\u2014but she\u2019d secretly thought that\u2019d be a cynical way to go through life.</p><p>But her mom had been nearly hysterical when she\u2019d heard about Sierra\u2019s car accident. She swore she was leaving Paris and moving in with them until Sierra was healed up. As much as Sierra appreciated that her mom...well, was acting motherly, she knew having her here would put a huge strain on everyone. So they talked on the phone at least once a day. Her mom had sent her flowers and balloons, stuffed animals and candy. It seemed something came air mail every day. Fun things. Quirky things. Sweet things. Items that proved her mom had been listening to her.</p><p>How was it they\u2019d gotten closer after her mom had moved across the globe? Sierra hadn\u2019t mentioned the positive change in her relationship with her mother to her dad, because he\u2019d make some nasty comment about how it wouldn\u2019t last. She didn\u2019t believe it made her a sucker for hoping the change was permanent.</p><p>She glanced up and realized Rielle and Marin were staring at her, waiting for her to say something. \u201cSorry. The pain pills make me spacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll check on you in a bit and see if you need snacks or something.\u201d</p><p>After Rielle left Marin said, \u201cShe\u2019s nice. Is it weird that she\u2019s acting like your mom?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t point out that her mother and Rielle were nothing alike. \u201cRee is awesome. She\u2019s always there for me when I need her.\u201d Unlike you.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still with your dad?\u201d</p><p>Sierra nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that awkward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes when I see them making out or if they both disappear and I know they\u2019re off doing it. But it\u2019s kinda nice, actually.\u201d Almost like she had a normal family.</p><p>Marin perched on the edge of the recliner. \u201cSpeaking of doing it...are you and Boone West really doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is everyone at school saying we are?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell...you guys were at that party together before your accident. And Kara and Angie said you\u2019d locked yourself in the bedroom together for a long time. So is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the only reason you\u2019re here, Marin? To verify gossip about me and Boone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here? Because it\u2019s not like you gave a crap about me since before Christmas. You\u2019re so all over Mitch all the time you don\u2019t have time for anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Marin stared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to think? You never called me on the weekends or asked me to do anything. The only time I see you is at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd every time I saw you before Christmas, all you did was bitch, bitch, bitch about how freakin\u2019 bored you are out here in this fancy house. How much of a jerk your dad was for not letting you drive. Do you know that\u2019s all you talked about for months? How you couldn\u2019t wait to drive. Oh, and you bitched about how much it sucks here and how much you\u2019d rather be in Arizona. Yeah, Sierra, you were some fun friend to talk to. Can you blame me for not begging you to hang out?\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s jaw dropped. That wasn\u2019t true! That\u2019s what Marin thought about her? She hadn\u2019t been like that at all.</p><p>Had she?</p><p>\u201cThen you came back from Christmas break and started partying with Angie and Kara. Did you ever think of asking me to go out with you? No. How do you think that made me feel?\u201d</p><p>Like crap. A guilty feeling started to creep in and overtake her indignation. She closed her eyes and thought about their conversations at school. So maybe she did complain sometimes. But that wasn\u2019t a reason to completely ditch her like Marin had. \u201cFine, I can see where you might take it that way. But every time you started talking about Mitch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch and I broke up during Christmas break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Marin rolled her eyes. \u201cBecause you were so busy bragging about how hard you partied in Arizona and how much you rock at beer pong. I knew you wouldn\u2019t care so I didn\u2019t bother. Besides, it was all over the school. Everybody knew.\u201d Except you went unsaid.</p><p>Sierra\u2019s chin dropped to her chest. She\u2019d fucked up again on the friend front, and she\u2019d hurt Marin, who\u2019d never been anything but nice to her. She squeezed her eyes shut but that didn\u2019t stop her tears from falling.</p><p>Then Marin sat beside her. \u201cHey. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m such a jerk.\u201d Sierra sniffled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It\u2019s just...I\u2019ve been so mad at you and I\u2019m not good at saying stuff like that. I had no idea how to tell you that you pissed me off and hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did pretty good today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m kind of a jerk too for letting it slide.\u201d Marin leaned her head against Sierra\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were in a car accident. I bet it really hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sierra cleared her throat. \u201cMarin, I\u2019m sorry for being such a total bitch to you. I know I haven\u2019t been nice since I got back from Arizona, and I thought you deserved it for basically blowing me off before that. I mean, we hardly did anything together. Now I see I should\u2019ve invited you over...I shouldn\u2019t have expected you to make all the effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of the reason you didn\u2019t see me wasn\u2019t only because of Mitch. I had to get a job after Halloween and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone. Especially you, since you\u2019re, well...you know...\u201d</p><p>Rich. \u201cDoes that make it hard to be friends with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you flaunt it. But I know it\u2019s there. It was really hard for me not to be resentful when you complained about being bored out of your mind and I\u2019m cleaning bed pans at the nursing home in Hulett every weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it sucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>Sierra snickered.</p><p>\u201cBut my mom and dad had a bad year on the ranch and my mom had to get a job too. You\u2019re so lucky that you don\u2019t have to work.\u201d</p><p>Her guilt increased. Boone wasn\u2019t the only one struggling. \u201cAre you helping support your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to pay for my own gas and earn my own spending money and I wanted to make sure I could get my little brothers something decent for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a good person, Marin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally figuring that out, Arizona.\u201d She elbowed her. \u201cEnough about that. What\u2019s really going on with you and Boone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHuh-uh. Tell me what happened with you and Mitch first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so sweet. He\u2019s such a great kisser and we just kept taking it a step farther each time until I had sex with him.\u201d Marin sat up and sighed. \u201cI almost did a really dumb thing and got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Sierra said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe had sex a few times, like maybe five times, and we didn\u2019t use birth control, which was stupid. So I was a week late and freaking out and Mitch was all, I ain\u2019t marryin\u2019 you if you were dumb enough to get knocked up. That pissed me off. So after I got my period, I broke up with him. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. That is scary. I can\u2019t even imagine you pregnant right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. This really sweet and shy girl who you\u2019d never think was messing around? She dropped out last year because she got pregnant. Now she\u2019s workin\u2019 at the Pizza Barn in Moorcroft and living with her parents. Her baby daddy was another one of them scum-sucking cowboys like Mitch.\u201d</p><p>Sierra grinned. She\u2019d missed Marin so much.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Marin poked her in the shoulder. \u201cYou and the hottie known as Boone West. I\u2019ll warn you I\u2019m gonna be pissed as hell if the rumors are true and you\u2019ve been sneaking around with him since school started and you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with him, but nothing else, I swear. I did a dumb thing too.\u201d Sierra told her what had happened at the party and how Boone had rescued her. \u201cSo we decided we had to pretend to be together for a little while, but I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re still doing that. I\u2019ll have to ask him when he comes over tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad lets him in the house? I heard he punched Boone in the face and knocked him out cold at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. I love my dad, but Boone? He\u2019s like don\u2019t-fuck-with-me tough. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Marin sighed. \u201cYes. And that is so totally hot in a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and Boone didn\u2019t even...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKiss? Nope. But I have to ask...\u201d Sierra fought a blush. \u201cWhat was it really like? With you and Mitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurt the first time. Then the next time it didn\u2019t hurt, but it didn\u2019t feel that great either. I kept hoping it would get better, but honestly, I don\u2019t get what the big deal is.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut I bet it would be awesome with Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>Her dad walked into the room and she was happy for the interruption.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sierra looked at Marin. \u201cMuch better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Good to see you again, Marin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou too, Mr. Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Gavin. You girls need anything? Drinks? Snacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stay a little longer?\u201d Sierra asked Marin.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d rather be doing homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad, pizza rolls would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d He cut to the back staircase.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Arizona, your dad is kinda hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww!\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cKnow who else is hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoone West.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sighed. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna live this down, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Marin smiled. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll have me around every day to remind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Late February...</p><p>Gavin scanned the crowd at Ziggy\u2019s. With more than half the damn men wearing black cowboy hats, he wandered through the entire bar before he saw Dalton, sitting at a table in the corner, far from the action. He took the chair opposite him. \u201cHey, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was surprised by the invite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t had a chance to catch up...\u201d Dalton sent him a sheepish smile. \u201cI\u2019m fresh outta drinking buddies, now that Tell and Georgia got hitched, so since you ain\u2019t hitched either, you were selected.\u201d</p><p>Gavin grinned. No bullshit. He liked that. He ordered Crown and water from the cocktail waitress after she finished flirting shamelessly with Tell. \u201cVi told me Tell and Georgia flew to Vegas. Did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stood up for Tell. I never turn down a chance to go to Vegas. That said, I wouldn\u2019t get married in Sin City on Valentine\u2019s Day, but that\u2019s what they wanted. From there they flew to Acapulco. I hung around a couple days after, played some cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won big enough one night they upgraded my room at the Hard Rock to the high roller\u2019s suite. Immediately all sorts of lovely ladies volunteered to help me celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed. Dalton, like the rest of the McKays, had the rugged good looks women seemed to go for. He was a strapping guy, easily several inches taller than either of his brothers. Broader too. That baby-face was deceiving, according to Vi. Dalton McKay liked to fight. And he liked to win.</p><p>Once the drinks were on the table, Dalton lifted his glass for a toast. \u201cTo the last two single McKays standing.\u201d</p><p>After Gavin drank, he felt the need to point out, \u201cSince Rielle and I are in a relationship, technically I\u2019m not single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically you\u2019re not a McKay either.\u201d Dalton laughed. \u201cSorry. Couldn\u2019t resist. So it\u2019s serious with you and Rielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t something either of us expected, but it\u2019s...\u201d He wanted to say she\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, but that sounded sappy, so he said, \u201cGood. We\u2019re taking it day by day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra is cool with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be. Sierra\u2019s been a bit of a humble Tigger since the accident, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there, as you well know.\u201d</p><p>He looked Dalton in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t hold that intervention with Ben against you, Dalton. You did what you thought was right. You were looking out for someone you cared about.\u201d</p><p>Dalton turned his lowball glass on the cocktail napkin. \u201cIt sure opened my eyes about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too, to be honest. Anyway, Sierra and Rielle get along well. They like each other and spend time together, but I don\u2019t force the issue. Might sound obvious, but I\u2019m Sierra\u2019s parent, Ree is not. It\u2019d be easy to put expectations on her since we\u2019re living together and because she\u2019s a woman who\u2019s been a single parent. We\u2019re still figuring out boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Rory react to Rielle being in a relationship with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so well. Why?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cI ain\u2019t surprised. Bein\u2019 an only child, she\u2019s always been spoiled by havin\u2019 all her mom\u2019s attention. She ain\u2019t gonna be happy sharing it, even when she\u2019s old enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>That just reminded Gavin of how big a step it\u2019d been for Rielle to keep her daughter out of the intimate relationship in her life.</p><p>\u201cPlus, it\u2019s gotta piss Rory off that Rielle is involved with a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I suspect the McKays offering to buy the Wetzler\u2019s land over the years had some to do with it.\u201d Dalton sipped his drink. \u201cI suspect I had a lot more to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...complicated. I\u2019ve always considered Rory a friend. But after that night in Laramie, she\u2019d rather punch me\u2014and she usually does\u2014than look at me.\u201d He paused. \u201cMe\u2019n Rory got into it the night she was at the Golden Boot with Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cThat surprises me since your girl had to put Rory in a headlock to keep her from goin\u2019 after me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin decided he\u2019d be better off not knowing what else had gone down that night. \u201cSo you really called me up because you\u2019re looking for a drinking buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially. Feelin\u2019 sorry for myself. The other part is to ask if you\u2019ve got any plans for the land you own that abuts your brother\u2019s section?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Dalton, after what happened before, I suspect it\u2019s in my best interest to keep the family peace, to change the subject now, before you ask me something or tell me something I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I share what\u2019s on my mind but we\u2019ll keep this discussion between us for the time being. That way, both our asses are covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Gavin leaned back in his chair. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis fall we agreed to lease Charlene Fox\u2019s place for two years, and at the end of those two years, we have first purchase option. Do you know what piece of land I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make me a greenhorn if I say no?\u201d</p><p>Dalton offered a wide smile. \u201cNope. The land is adjacent to your creek access.\u201d</p><p>Gavin frowned. \u201cMy creek frontage is only about thirty yards. Rielle\u2019s section has most the creek frontage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But she\u2019s\u2014or rather Rory has\u2014made it plain she doesn\u2019t want cattle close by. But with your section adjoining Ben\u2019s, there\u2019s a chance Ben and Quinn will address leasing grazing rights from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeasing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ben and Quinn are your brothers, and they wouldn\u2019t expect to get the rights for free\u2014but bein\u2019s you are a greenhorn, their brother and rich in your own right, they\u2019d try to get a deal and tie up the lease rights for years. The chunk you own isn\u2019t the ideal piece of dirt, and it\u2019s undeveloped, which means it\u2019d be a lot of work on their part to get it cleared. So I\u2019m wondering if that work load is beyond your brothers\u2019 capabilities, since it\u2019s just the two of them running things and they don\u2019t have extra time or hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not beyond your capabilities?\u201d</p><p>Dalton leaned forward. \u201cNo. We\u2019ve got two extra set of working hands in Jessie and Georgia. Libby don\u2019t help Quinn out as much as she used to on the ranch after their kids were born, and Ainsley ain\u2019t the type to devote a month to clearing brush.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is to keep in mind we\u2019re interested in leasing that land. We\u2019re willing to do improvements on it\u2014on our dime. We\u2019re not at that point yet where we can consider signin\u2019 a lease with you. But we will be in the next year. So it\u2019d be a serious blow to us if you\u2019d already signed a long term lease with Ben and Quinn. Me, Tell and Brandt will pay the highest going rate. I know your brothers won\u2019t offer you that, so I\u2019m pointing out ahead of time that doin\u2019 business with us will be the better deal for you. And since it appears you\u2019re in Wyoming for the long haul, we wanted to state our...offer\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014up front.\u201d</p> <p>He allowed a moment to digest the information. But he had to admit Dalton impressed the hell out of him. Not playing on any type of family connection, laying out the facts. Appealing to Gavin\u2019s practical side. \u201cOut of the original 140 acres Rielle owned, she has forty. One hundred acres is a piss-ant amount in the scheme of McKay Ranches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but the right hundred acres, adjacent to our four thousand acres, with creek frontage ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 to sneeze at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people underestimate you?\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cA lot. Especially when I\u2019m playin\u2019 cards. They see my baby-face and assume...well, not many of them assume I\u2019m a rookie anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you funded your land purchases? Through gambling?\u201d</p> <p>Dalton hung his head. \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to pull off contrite, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSorry. So as long as we\u2019re swapping stories about how we made our millions\u2014ha ha\u2014I gotta know if all of yours was inherited.\u201d</p><p>Strange to think his brothers hadn\u2019t asked him this question. But since Dalton had been honest with him, he owed his cousin the same courtesy. \u201cMy dad started a real estate development company in the 1960s. He did very well in the 70s, 80s and lost more than half when the credit market collapsed. He recovered, but never like during the heyday. He died when I was twenty-eight and I was already VP of the company, so I took over.\u201d Gavin sipped his drink. \u201cMy father was a great guy, but I found out a few things he\u2019d done that were shady and I worried his mistakes would come back and bite me in the ass.</p><p>\u201cSo a few years after his death, I started buying cheap properties. Rentals in decent areas that didn\u2019t require more than basic updates. Two properties turned into four, four turned into eight...and so on. Around that time, I\u2019d had enough of my cheating wife and filed for divorce. Instead of letting that bitterness eat away at me more than it already had, I become more hands on, buying government foreclosures, houses auctioned by banks, any little gem I could turn fast. I\u2019d go in and gut the place. There\u2019s nothing more cathartic than beating the fuck out of stuff with a sledgehammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I worked out my aggression toward my ex-wife and started flipping houses at exactly the right time in the market. I made a killing. I reinvested it in rental properties. Daniels Development Group is still in business, I\u2019m still a figurehead CEO, but with the spectacular crash of the housing market, the bulk of my business focus is Daniels Property Management. Since I\u2019m not hands-on, ripping places apart, I can work from anywhere. Made it easy to move here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea. I gotta say. That\u2019s impressive.\u201d Dalton gave him a self-satisfied smile. \u201cEveryone else in the family sees you as a suit, making real estate deals. From this point on, I\u2019ll see you busting shit up with a chainsaw.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis stays between us,\u201d Dalton cautioned. \u201cIf anything changes on your end or my end, we\u2019ll agree to meet to discuss it before making a decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Dalton said, \u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way, you wanna play pool?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin studied the too-innocent face. Pool shark as well as card shark? Probably. But Gavin still had a few tricks he could teach this pup. \u201cSure. But we\u2019re not playing for money, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we play a few games and see how it goes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later Gavin went home three hundred dollars richer.</p><p>He doubted Dalton would underestimate him again.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>March...</p><p>Rielle stormed into Gavin\u2019s bedroom. \u201cDo you know who I just got off the phone with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPublishers Clearing House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even remotely funny, Gavin Daniels. A trucking company based out of Denver just called, asking me when I\u2019d be home to accept shipment for a greenhouse. Not a greenhouse kit, but a fully finished greenhouse.\u201d</p><p>He had a hard time containing his smile.</p><p>Her gaze pierced him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know anything about that, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you describe this greenhouse?\u201d</p><p>Rielle threw up her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a greenhouse! You know very well what a greenhouse looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Then that\u2019s probably the greenhouse I bought you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I just hear you say you bought me a greenhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there an echo in here? Yes, I bought you a greenhouse. And I\u2019m disappointed because they were supposed to deliver it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho buys someone a fucking greenhouse?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy someone a fucking greenhouse, I bought you a fucking greenhouse,\u201d he shot back. \u201cBig difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know I was pricing them?\u201d</p><p>Gavin cocked his head. \u201cRory told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When the hell did you talk to my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week she called to check on Sierra, when Sierra was sleeping, so I chatted with her. She apologized for being a jerk when she found out we were together. I confessed I\u2019d been difficult to live with in the weeks after Sierra\u2019s accident and I wanted to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your way of apologizing? You buy me a greenhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Gavin. Why didn\u2019t you just buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, I did. You can grow your own flowers in your new fucking greenhouse.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou are impossible. I can\u2019t accept this from you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin scooped her up, threw her on the bed, and loomed over her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice. I custom ordered it. It\u2019s on the way and it\u2019s nonrefundable.\u201d He studied her face. She had that determined set to her jaw, which meant arguing was pointless. So he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cNo fair,\u201d she panted after he slid his mouth between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSay, thank you, Gavin, for such a thoughtful gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will pay you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are starting to piss me off, Ree. I didn\u2019t buy it out of guilt. I bought it because you needed it and because I could. I wanted to do something nice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis goes way beyond nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. What I feel for you can hardly be described as nice. I love you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when she softened. When her pride took a serious smackdown from her heart. \u201cI love you too. It\u2019s just weird to have you buy me things. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it. And practice that saying thank you thing, because I had them toss in a new tractor with a trailer attachment.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cDid you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it\u2019s just a little tractor, so a little thank you will be fine.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou are so ridiculous. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019m ridiculously in love with you.\u201d She lifted up and kissed him. \u201cThank you, Gavin, for such a thoughtful gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis greenhouse is enormous,\u201d Ainsley said.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. It\u2019s twice the size of the one I\u2019d been saving for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Gavin just bought it for you three weeks ago? Out of the blue? Was it a lucky guess?\u201d</p><p>Rielle unhooked a hose coupling. \u201cNo. He talked to Rory and she told him. I suspect she exaggerated just a bit about what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley laughed. \u201cHow is Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy. We only get to catch up about once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo has she come around as far as you and Gavin being in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes. She apologized to me and to Gavin, although he didn\u2019t go into detail about what she said to him.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cThat\u2019s progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. I\u2019ll admit I suspected Rory was trying to pull one over on me. Claiming she had accepted the relationship in the hopes I would confide the intimate details to her. She\u2019s sneaky that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she been hinting around she\u2019d like to know more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. I recognize that contemplative look. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Rielle twisted on the spray nozzle until it loosened and fell off. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is even when everything is going so great between Gavin and me, why do I still feel like I\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee. That\u2019s natural. It\u2019s completely normal that you\u2019re afraid now you\u2019ve found this incredible happiness, you\u2019ll lose it or something will screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! If it\u2019s so natural and normal did you talk to Ben about this stuff at this stage in your relationship?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley squirmed and Rielle wished she could retract the question. Although Ainsley alluded to it, she never came out and said her intimate relationship with Ben was...more intense.</p><p>\u201cNot until Ben and I decided we wanted the same thing. We didn\u2019t have the added pressure of kids meddling or trying to manipulate our emotions. So is Sierra completely accepting of your relationship with Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost days. She\u2019s sixteen, though. One day she\u2019s on top of the world, the next day she\u2019s in the pit of despair. Everything is a crisis in her life. A bad hair day. A B minus on a test. If a friend ignored her in the hallway. Or she\u2019s elated because her favorite song came on the radio. Or if she\u2019s having a good hair day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas Rory that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse. I think most girls are like that. I\u2019d forgotten how small things are such huge angst inducing incidents in teen girls\u2019 lives. Things we dismiss as irrelevant are life changing events in their world. It boggles my mind, what event constitutes a major breakdown and then is easily shrugged off the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, I remember being exactly like that,\u201d Ainsley said with a groan.</p><p>\u201cGavin handles it really well. He\u2019s a great father. And I know this will sound weird, but his nurturing, unconditional love and fluid discipline style he shows as Sierra\u2019s father is one of the reasons I was so attracted to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Gavin are so perfect for each other. The hippie chick and the businessman? Who\u2019da thunk, right? But it works.\u201d Ainsley squealed and hugged her. \u201cI am so thrilled for you\u2014for both of you. Just think, when you and Gavin get married? We\u2019ll be sister-in-laws!\u201d</p> <p>Rielle\u2019s belly tumbled. \u201cMarried? That\u2019s jumping the gun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of you went into this relationship thinking it would be casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you.\u201d</p><p>A division of space and time still continued in the house and their relationship. It frustrated her at times; sometimes she welcomed the separation of selves. Despite their declaration of love, neither had spoken of changing their agreed-upon living arrangement.</p><p>Ainsley wandered to the far end of the greenhouse, poking her finger in random peat pots. \u201cI do have another reason for showing up besides to gossip about your love life.\u201d</p> <p>Rielle grinned like a loon. She did have a love life. She had a fantastic love life. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a nosy question, so go ahead and get your back up.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cA nosy question from you? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ainsley set her hands on her hips, in confrontation mode. \u201cSo straight up, Ree. Are you planning to cultivate twice as many plants this year since you have twice the growing space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this concerns you...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you already work hard enough for two people. If you double the size of your operation, you\u2019ll be doing the work of four people and as your friend, that really concerns me.\u201d</p><p>Had anyone else stuck their nose in her business like that Rielle would\u2019ve bristled. But Ainsley based her observation on logic, not emotion. \u201cTruth? I feel guilty that half of this top of the line, state of the art, brand spanking new greenhouse isn\u2019t being utilized. I went so far as to scour my seed supplier\u2019s online catalogue. But I realized I can\u2019t do that and have any kind of life outside the gardens. I\u2019ve decided to curtail what I plant, as far as the yield to work ration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heavens. I know how much of this\u201d\u2014Ainsley gestured to the space around her\u2014\u201cdefines who you are. But you need to tend your relationship with Gavin with as much care as you tend your plants.\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cThat sounded a lot less hokey in my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get what you mean. And I really appreciate your concern. But I have to ask what prompted this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely. Her patient load is too much for one doctor. So my nagging must\u2019ve worked because she is bringing another doctor into her practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. I\u2019ve hardly seen her in the last four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. A celebration is in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the ball rolling.\u201d Ainsley frowned and pulled her cell phone out of her pocket. \u201cMy darlin\u2019 husband is mighty impatient today, so I gotta get. Take care, Ree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>After bending and lifting and being covered in dirt, Rielle indulged in a long, hot shower\u2014in Gavin\u2019s bathroom. The scent of his body wash sent her thoughts back to how thoroughly Gavin had rocked her world in this shower. He\u2019d defined relentless, making her come three times before allowing his own shuddering release. As much as she loved his commanding side, it didn\u2019t leave her many opportunities to lead the charge in the bedroom.</p><p>That\u2019s an excuse. You want him, show him.</p><p>For the next hour, their previous sexcapades ran on a continual loop. So by the time she heard the front door open, her anticipation for him had reached fever pitch.</p><p>When he strolled into the kitchen, so hip and hot in a sexy-ass black suit, Rielle had to grip the edge of the counter to keep from pouncing on him.</p><p>His eyes registered surprise. \u201cHey. I thought you\u2019d be in the greenhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done for the day. How was the meeting with Jack and the guys from Lodestone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent better than I expected. I\u2019ve always considered myself a tough negotiator, but I\u2019m an amateur compared to Jack Donohue. Jesus. He hammered them on several points, which forced them to shave off a considerable amount of their asking price.\u201d His teeth gleamed in a shark-like smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a done deal. Be interesting to see what Jack does with a historic hotel in Whitewood, South Dakota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you his plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just the money man.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were glued to Gavin\u2019s nimble fingers as he unknotted his tie. When the ends hung beside the lapels, he flicked open the top two buttons on his pristine white dress shirt.</p><p>She said, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop undressing. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Rielle ambled toward him. Wrapping the ends of his tie around her fingers, she drew his mouth to hers for a teasing kiss. Licking at his parted lips. Keeping her mouth a whisper away, she began to leisurely unbutton his shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you all afternoon. How hot and sexy you are. How every time you touch me I lose myself in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, when I\u2019m content letting you have your wicked way with me and I forget turnabout is fair play.\u201d Rielle\u2019s hands were greedy on his bared chest. \u201cI want you. Just like this. Looking professional and a little tight-assed in this snappy suit. But I want you my way. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>She placed a kiss on his sternum. \u201cPut your hands on the counter behind you and don\u2019t move.\u201d She tugged the tie from around his neck, watching it slither free. Holding the body-warmed silk up to her nose, she inhaled. \u201cI love your scent. Cologne and man.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes were a stormy blue as she snapped the tie between her hands.</p><p>She reached up and draped the silky fabric across his eyes and fashioned a knot at the back of his head. Wouldn\u2019t be light tight, but it\u2019d work for her purposes.</p><p>\u201cRee. What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my show, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I see the show with my damn eyes covered?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she kissed his pouting lips. \u201cPoor baby. You\u2019ll just have to focus on your other four senses, won\u2019t you? Stay put. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened. Then he closed it without a word.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the smug smile as she heated the squeeze jar in the microwave and tested the temp. Using a feather-light touch, she traced the bottom edge of the tie stretched across his eyes. Then her finger moved to outline his lips. \u201cI love this mouth. The things it can do to me...\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t lodge a protest as she unbuckled his belt, unzipped his suit pants and dragged them and his boxers to his ankles.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to mention I\u2019ll pay for dry cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDry cleaning?\u201d he repeated hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYep. This is gonna get a little messy.\u201d Rielle squeezed the bottle, releasing two thick rivulets of warm honey on his chest.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>She dug her nails into his hard pectorals as her tongue lapped from the bottom of his ribcage up. She used her teeth to scrape up every bit of sticky goodness on the second stream of honey. Once she\u2019d licked him clean, she reached for the bottle and squirted a dollop above his left nipple, watching as it slowly slid down and coated the dark disk. She attacked, sucking, rubbing the tip of her tongue over the hardened nub. Over and over.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>Rielle directed the next river of honey down the center of his body. She didn\u2019t begin lapping until the stream teased the top of his belly button.</p><p>Gavin arched into her with a deep groan.</p><p>Drizzling honey all over him had become more than a sexy game. She gloried in eating every amber-colored drop, sometimes ferociously, sometimes delicately, his masculine textures a feast for her senses. While her tongue happily zigzagged here and there, looking for spots of forgotten honey, her hands became stickier. But she couldn\u2019t stop from touching his sides, his ribs, his hips, his abdomen.</p><p>And Gavin made these fucking hot little noises, deep, almost growling whimpers.</p><p>Then Rielle dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck yes,\u201d she said before her mouth engulfed every inch of his rigid cock. She withdrew slowly and blew a stream of air across the wetness.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s whole body jerked.</p><p>She chuckled and dropped a glob of honey on the sweet spot where his shaft flared into the wide head of his cock. Sucking the sweetness until the only flavor that remained was his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands were too sticky to use on his cock, so after drawing a line of honey on the underside of his shaft from tip to root, she fluttered her tongue down to his balls. And back up. She brought that long, hard honey stick into her mouth and opened her throat. Gripping his thighs, she shuttled his cock in and out of her mouth exactly how he liked it.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s legs started to shake and he pumped his pelvis into her face.</p><p>Rielle closed her eyes. Blowing him always made her body throb with want and her pussy slick with readiness. Even her skin seemed stretched too tight.</p> <p>\u201cRee.\u201d</p><p>She kept on plunging his dick in and out.</p><p>\u201cStop. Please.\u201d</p><p>No way. This was her show. Her prize.</p><p>\u201cRielle, stop. It feels so goddamned good but I don\u2019t want to come in your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ll see about that. She wanted a full taste of him mixed with the honey sliding down her throat.</p><p>Then his hands were on her face, stopping the movement of her head and pulling his dick free from her mouth. She looked up and saw he\u2019d ditched the blindfold too. \u201cNot happy that you\u2019re trying to steal my moment, tycoon.\u201d</p><p>Gavin answering smile was decidedly...animalistic. \u201cYour moment is over. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>If he put his hands on her anywhere she\u2019d come undone. She couldn\u2019t make this easy on him.</p><p>\u201cYou want your turn?\u201d Rielle rolled to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take it.\u201d She ran out the swinging door.</p><p>She was feeling pretty smug, because she\u2019d basically hobbled him with his pants and underwear, when two steel bands clamped around her upper body, immobilizing her. She screamed. Her heart slammed into her throat.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t dare me,\u201d he breathed in her ear, \u201cbecause I always take it. And I always win.\u201d His mouth latched onto the curve of her throat in that knee-weakening spot and her traitorous legs buckled.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Then he spun her around and ripped her blouse open, jerking it down her arms and to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll pay the sewing bill.\u201d He peeled off her camisole and he pressed his sticky chest to hers, ravishing her with a kiss packed with raw passion, completely erasing her will to do anything but surrender.</p><p>Using his mind-controlling kiss, he herded her backward until her butt connected with the couch.</p><p>Gavin tore his mouth away and bit that same spot on her neck and she fell into him with a startled gasp. \u201cI\u2019m going to bend you over the couch and fuck you, Ree.\u201d He nipped the skin again. \u201cFuck you hard.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cStay right here. But those jeans better be down around your ankles when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Talk about bossy. His sexy, terse commands did it for her in a bad way, yet she had the urge to push his buttons a little. See if she could get that control panel to short out completely. She pulled her jeans down, but left her panties on.</p> <p>Gavin strolled into view. That\u2019s when she realized he still wore his suit coat, and his shirt, but he was naked from the waist down\u2014except for his socks. He should\u2019ve looked ridiculous, but damn he looked like sex on legs.</p><p>His eyes blazed, seeing her underwear still on. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lower my jeans? Yes. But you didn\u2019t say anything about my panties.\u201d</p><p>That devilish gleam appeared and she understood she was seriously fucked.</p><p>\u201cLeave them. Just like the first time I fucked you, remember? You said you came so hard you forgot to breathe, so let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t up the ante some.\u201d</p><p>So so so fucked.</p><p>Gavin held up his hand and a skein of yarn dangled from his fingers. \u201cBend over the couch and put your hands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing with my yarn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing it to bind you since I\u2019m fresh out of rope.\u201d When she continued to stare at him, he snapped, \u201cMove it.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and leaned over the couch.</p><p>\u201cHands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient much?\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed. A little meanly. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Her anticipation skyrocketed as he wound the soft fiber around her wrists.</p><p>\u201cLift your chest up.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she obeyed, Gavin slid the buffalo robe underneath her. When he pushed her chest down, the incredibly soft hair rubbed her nipples.</p><p>Then his mouth was on her ear again. \u201cThere\u2019s one other thing before we get started.\u201d Two sharp smacks landed on her ass cheeks and she yelped. \u201cThat\u2019s for leaving your panties on.\u201d</p><p>Gavin kicked her legs out and adjusted her underwear so the elastic stretched directly over her clit. His big hands angled and spread her lower half to his liking.</p><p>Then he plunged into her.</p><p>Rielle arched up. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>Then he curled his hands over her shoulders, using her body for leverage as he hammered into her. Bottoming out with every thrust, pulling out completely and surging into her pussy again and again.</p><p>The buffalo hair constantly caressed her nipples like soft tongues. Add in the continual friction against her clit and she knew it wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Her ass stung, she couldn\u2019t move her arms, she was utterly at Gavin\u2019s mercy. And she loved every second of it.</p><p>He pressed a kiss at the top of her spine. \u201cYou blow my fucking mind, Ree, every time.\u201d</p><p>Gavin owned her. Heart. Soul. Mind. Body. His every primitive groan and animalistic thrust drove that point home.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will it take to get you there?\u201d</p><p>Mouth dry, brain scrambled, she could barely speak. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it take...this?\u201d He sucked on the side of her throat and it was over.</p><p>The warning flutter in her lower belly lasted a nanosecond before she climaxed. A gasping, shuddering, shattering orgasm. The sensations coalesced. Then her body and mind splintered\u2014her mind cried uncle, the sensations overwhelmed her as her body pulsed and throbbed, screaming more more more.</p><p>Gavin roared, his hips furiously pounding into her pussy with such force the couch slid forward.</p><p>His body shook.</p><p>And shook.</p><p>He layered his chest over her back and panted in her ear. \u201cYou destroy me.\u201d</p><p>Something about that sweet masculine bewilderment settled the emotions raging inside her.</p><p>Turning her head, she breathed him in and tenderly kissed his strong jaw.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Jesus, Rielle. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a sticky mess. Let\u2019s get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But no water games. I have a feeling I\u2019ll be a little sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. It\u2019s a good sore, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I will point out it still makes you a sore loser.\u201d</p><p>She heard the smirk in his tone. Such a crazy competitive man. But she loved that about him too.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>Late March...</p><p>Gavin listened to Rielle\u2019s slow breathing as she started to drift off. They were both exhausted but they\u2019d managed to sneak in some alone time for the first time in over a week. She was gearing up for spring planting and he\u2019d been drafted to help with calving.</p><p>Quinn and Ben had a great time teasing him about his missing rancher gene, but Gavin hadn\u2019t minded. He looked forward to spending time with his brothers\u2014even in the dead of night in the miserable cold and snow. Nothing built a brotherly bond faster than having your arms up a cow\u2019s birth canal together. Chase had shown up for a week, claiming to need a break from his pregnancy-hormone-crazed wife, but the truth was he hadn\u2019t wanted to be left out. It was weird having brothers...and yet, not.</p><p>Sierra had made a full recovery after her accident and was at the physical therapy stage. He drove her to Moorcroft for sessions with Keely. He hadn\u2019t replaced her car and so far, Sierra hadn\u2019t asked for a new one, which weighed heavily on his decision to buy her one. If his daughter wasn\u2019t with her best friend, she was hanging out with Boone West. Sierra swore they were just friends and Gavin believed her\u2014he\u2019d never caught them even holding hands. Sierra also spent time with Charlie and Vi, who absolutely doted on her. The entire McKay family had rallied around her after the accident and she fit in with them like she\u2019d always been part of the rowdy clan.</p><p>Which led him to the issue he and Rielle needed to address.</p><p>He idly stroked the side of her breast. \u201cRee? You awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. You wore me out, tycoon. Man. You can do that thing with your tongue anytime.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed.</p><p>She yawned. \u201cSo now that I\u2019m awake...why am I awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Her body stiffened slightly. \u201cOkay. About?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis living arrangement.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to build your own place. I want you to stay here, living with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to end the division of your space and my space, and make it all our space. Our home. I want to end the division of our time, too. I want you doing family things with us.\u201d Gavin ran his hand down her arm and threaded his fingers through hers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fling for me. It hasn\u2019t been from the start. I love you, Ree. I want to spend my life with you. Every part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that in the wake of smoking-hot sex?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cCan you be serious\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smothered his protest with a laughing kiss. \u201cYou accuse me of being too serious.\u201d She propped her chin on his chest. \u201cThe honest truth? I don\u2019t want to build that house. I want to live here with you. I adore Sierra and I know she\u2019s part of the package. That said, I\u2019ve always been so independent and in a short amount of time I find myself depending on you more and more. What if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I leave, and you\u2019ve come to depend on me and I\u2019m no longer there? Honey. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you love me.

But things can change so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this.\u201d He kissed her knuckles. \u201cYears down the road, I want to look at you and remind you of this moment and do a little I-told-you-so dance.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cNow, that is something I can\u2019t wait to see. Do we tell Sierra about the change?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like that you said we.\u201d He liked it a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it requires a sit-down discussion. The melding of our lives has been a gradual shift over the last few months, and she\u2019s accepted those changes. If she asks, then we\u2019ll address it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing I want to do to prove that I\u2019m serious about permanently tying our lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting your name on the title to this house. Before you automatically say, no, no way, I\u2019m not taking that gift from you, I\u2019ll point out it\u2019s not a gift. You\u2019ll have to pay half the property taxes. And I\u2019ll want you to start kicking in more money for utilities because those ovens of yours are a serious electrical suck.\u201d</p> <p>Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit. Ree, honey, I was kidding about the utilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, dumbass.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cIt\u2019s just more than I ever expected. You...this...everything.\u201d</p><p>God, he loved this woman.</p><p>\u201cFor me too.\u201d</p><p>April...</p> <p>\u201cBoone. Check this out.\u201d</p><p>Sierra aligned photocopies from the Crook County Monitor newspaper on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis newspaper went out of business in the early decade of the nineteen hundreds but here\u2019s mention of a land transfer from Ezekiel West to Silas McKay in 1898.\u201d She squinted at the blurred text. \u201cI can\u2019t tell how much land, but I bet that\u2019s the land the McKays supposedly \u2018stole\u2019 from the Wests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Did it say anything in Dinah McKay\u2019s journal about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve come across, but she detailed just about everything else, so I\u2019ll look closer. Although, she didn\u2019t start chronicling her life as a ranch wife until she married Jonas McKay in 1901.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Who is Silas McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonas\u2019s twin brother. And you\u2019re not the only one who hasn\u2019t heard of him.\u201d Sierra slumped back into the couch, her eyes aching from trying to read old, faded text.</p> <p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Boone asked, concern on his face. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a twinge. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Boone constantly fussed over her, but she liked it so sometimes she let him soothe her pains\u2014phantom or not. After her car accident and all the hours he\u2019d helped her with homework and her research project, they\u2019d become even better friends. She liked him, liked spending time with him. They both had an offbeat way of looking at things and they shared the same strange sense of humor. If friends were all they ever were, she was good with that. But she\u2019d be lying if she didn\u2019t admit part of her would always hope for more.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. What was I saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about Jonas and Silas McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. How can the McKays be so proud of their family name and lineage and not know their basic history? I talked to my Aunt Kimi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Aunt Kimi,\u201d he corrected with a quick smile.</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him as she always did when he reminded her of their shared family connection. \u201cOur Aunt Kimi told me in the years she knew Jed McKay, he refused to speak of his father\u2019s twin brother. He said they\u2019d paid good money to ensure the past was left buried in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCryptic. Did Kimi ever ask her father about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he expressed his displeasure that two of his daughters married into a family of thieves and murderers.\u201d Sierra absentmindedly tapped her pen. \u201cKimi said not even the gossip about her and Carolyn marrying into the McKay family revived the old scandal, whatever it might\u2019ve been. How can it be such a big secret?\u201d</p><p>He wore a reflective look. \u201cThe Wests and the McKays have been settled in Crook and Weston counties longer than any other existing families. With coal mining, railroads, oil production and agriculture, people constantly moving in and out of the area, not only in the last fifty years, but the last hundred years...things that happened, even scandalous things, would get lost in the shuffle, Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. Our families have forgotten the actual event that caused the feud in the first place, but they\u2019ve kept the hatred for generations? I don\u2019t buy that. There\u2019s a cover up on one side or both sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Boone pushed his hair out of his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that neither Aunt Kimi nor Aunt Caro knows the West family history besides that all the Wests have always hated all the McKays and always will. Caro and Kimi are the most gossipy, in-the-know women in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I said! So I\u2019ll admit I was a little...pushy with Kimi, especially since Jed McKay lived with her and Uncle Cal and I think she was dodging my questions. But I\u2019m interested in the real story, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta be a reporter. Or a private eye.\u201d Boone nudged her. \u201cSo how did Aunt Kimi react to a pushy non-McKay acting like a pushy McKay?\u201d</p><p>She nudged him back. \u201cShe asked me when I was officially changing my last name to McKay so it accurately reflected my overbearing genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a possibility? Your dad changing your last name to McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never mentioned it. But that\u2019s how everyone introduces him\u2014Gavin Daniels, Charlie and Vi McKay\u2019s oldest boy.\u201d Sierra shuffled the papers in front of her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have an issue if he did want the change. Some people\u2014\u201d she knocked her knee into his, \u201c\u2014already call me McKay, so it wouldn\u2019t be such a big shift for me. But it would be a big deal for my dad. Anyway, I\u2019m just frustrated with the lack of information.\u201d</p><p>Boone covered her restless hand with his. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your report. Why are you still combing through these old papers?\u201d</p><p>His touch\u2014even casual\u2014caused a hot jolt of awareness. She stared at his rough-skinned knuckles and the smattering of dark hair across the back of his hand. She wanted to run her fingertips across the rugged texture and memorize every inch.</p><p>\u201cSierra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does this matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to show my dad that I am invested in my family. I know it probably sounds weird, but I\u2019ve never had this type of connection. I don\u2019t know anything about my mom\u2019s side of my family, except that she cut off all contact with her dad after he left her mother for another woman. Then her mom died when she was in college. I\u2019ve never had cousins, or aunts and uncles and now I\u2019ve got so many I can\u2019t keep them all straight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also interested because Dinah went to all the trouble to keep records for future generations of McKays. These archives haven\u2019t been touched in years and someone needs to care, to bring it to life, so it might as well be me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy Grandpa Charlie said after his mom died his father boxed up all her things, shoved them in the attic and warned his sons if he ever caught them messing up there, he\u2019d tan their hides.\u201d</p><p>He whistled and sank back into the sofa, breaking their handhold. \u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t take the chance and go poking around either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to know what the damn scandal was. It had to be big. It had to be documented some place in these papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you half the papers jammed in the boxes were worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s got to be more information somewhere that we don\u2019t have.\u201d She had a thought. \u201cSmall town newspapers\u2014especially back then\u2014detailed the lives of people in the community by calling local gossip news. So and so went for supper at so and so\u2019s house. So and so won the pie-eating contest at the church social. Ellie Mae was seen dancing with Tom, Dick and Harry at the street dance.\u201d</p><p>Boone laughed. \u201cEllie Mae? Is that name from what I think it\u2019s from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I watched every episode of The Beverly Hillbillies on classic TV at least three times.\u201d Sierra poked his arm. \u201cWhat old TV show was your guilty pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYou know I hate guessing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but if you guess, I\u2019ll help you scour these pages and we\u2019ll dissect the library archives piece by piece until we break the news of the hundred-year-old scandal.\u201d</p><p>That perked her up. Boone\u2019s appearance today had shocked her since she\u2019d finished the history project last week. And if he promised his help, she\u2019d still get to hang out with him. \u201cEven if I guess wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Love Boat.\u201d</p><p>Boone laughed. Hard. \u201cGod, McKay, you are so freakin\u2019 hilarious sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She buffed her nails on her chest. \u201cBut I guessed right, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Guess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Adventures of Daniel Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>She blinked innocently. \u201cWhat? Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ya think?\u201d he half-snarled. \u201cI was saddled with this ridiculous name because of that man. And my ditzy mother named her other son Crockett, after Davy Crocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie. She named her daughter Oakley. After Annie Oakley. Who does that to a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off topic.\u201d She jabbed his chest with her index finger. \u201cTell. Me. Your. Favorite. Old. Show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. And for me it was all about Daisy Duke and those short shorts. Man. She was something.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the dreamy look on Boone\u2019s face...now she knew exactly what pieces to add to her summer wardrobe. Speaking of summer...she\u2019d wondered how to bring this up. \u201cSo can you believe there\u2019s only a month left of school?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I\u2019ll be unhappy to see the ass-end of high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the West family throwing a graduation party for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them no way and if they did I wouldn\u2019t show up. I don\u2019t even want to walk with my class. I can\u2019t fucking wait to walk away from my class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre your parents coming to the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>Boone closed his eyes and leaned his head back into the couch. \u201cGives me a headache thinking about it. In fact, I\u2019ve had a low-grade headache all day.\u201d</p><p>Almost without thought Sierra reached out, and her fingers brushed away the thick hank of hair that perpetually fell in his eyes. She flattened her palm on his forehead. He didn\u2019t flinch, or ask why she was touching him; he made a low groan.</p><p>\u201cYour hand is cold, but it feels good.\u201d</p><p>She seized the chance to study his beautiful face up close. Starting with the wide span of his jaw and the dark razor stubble that reached the hollow of his cheeks. He\u2019d said his nose had been broken twice, but it looked straight to her. Her focus drifted to his mouth. She\u2019d spent hours imagining the fullness and softness of his lips on hers.</p> <p>Boone\u2019s long lashes slowly lifted.</p><p>Her belly jumped. But she didn\u2019t back away. This close she could discern the various shades of brown that swirled together to create his striking eye color. His eyes were so expressive. But she had no idea what he was thinking right now.</p><p>He\u2019s thinking you\u2019re a pervert and you need to get your hand off him.</p><p>She casually brushed his silky hair back and retreated.</p><p>\u201cThanks. It actually feels better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d Seriously. I can put my hands on your face any time you need it.</p> <p>\u201cYou know something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been here and you haven\u2019t offered to feed me.\u201d</p><p>So much for a personal moment. She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s scrounge up food so you\u2019re not sorting through piles and piles of papers on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>He leveled that bad boy grin at her. \u201cYou are a taskmaster, McKay. But a promise is a promise, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I hold everyone to their promises.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p>Gavin and Rielle hammered out details on the housing situation. She agreed to her name being put on the title to the house, but they\u2019d opted to keep their original land split. Rielle retained her forty acres; Gavin kept his one hundred acres.</p> <p>He\u2019d been prepared to deal with backlash from her when he mentioned leaving the land unimproved seemed like a waste of resources. But she\u2019d confessed part of the reason it\u2019d remained fallow under her ownership was she hadn\u2019t the time, money or drive to make improvements. Since he now owned it, she didn\u2019t much care what he did with it as long as his plans didn\u2019t encroach on her growing space.</p><p>During the spring he\u2019d been so busy he hadn\u2019t revisited his conversation with Dalton about future land usage possibilities. Thinking back, Gavin hadn\u2019t gotten the impression Dalton was scheming to undercut potential lease and land expansion for his closest McKay relatives. Now that he\u2019d received the green light from Rielle, he needed to broach the subject with his brothers.</p><p>Ben had offered to tour the area with him, but Gavin found himself calling Quinn instead. Quinn showed up with the two horses. They saddled up and began to explore, picking their way through overgrown scrub cedar, weaving around scraggly pine trees and dodging the multitude of rock outcroppings. The piece of land was small, but it took them over two hours to forge a path to the creek.</p><p>Quinn dismounted and held the reins as he led his horse through the mud to the water. \u201cI gotta say, you\u2019re doin\u2019 much better on horseback, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding at least,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cSaddling shouldn\u2019t be the hardest part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one would be hard if you rode every day.\u201d</p><p>Gavin followed Quinn, and Duchess didn\u2019t fight him as much as she used to. He just hoped she didn\u2019t try to bolt when he released the reins to let her drink. He squinted at the stream flowing in front of them. It ran higher in the spring, so it\u2019d be harder to cross now, but not impossible. He couldn\u2019t tell where the land Dalton, Tell and Brandt had leased started on the opposite bank.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d have a horse of your own by now,\u201d Quinn commented.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that when all\u2019s I have to do is call you and you bring the horses and the tack right to me?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed. \u201cTrue. I\u2019m makin\u2019 it too easy on ya. Sometimes because of your greenhorn status I have to remind myself you\u2019re my older brother, not younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that people are calling me Charlie and Vi\u2019s oldest son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would it? You are their oldest son.\u201d</p><p>Matter of fact\u2014that was Quinn.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve never put much belief in them rules about birth order determining anything. Bunch of mumbo-jumbo if you ask me. We\u2019ve already broken them rules by not bein\u2019 raised together. Would we be different people if we had? Yep. But we weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had any qualms about me just showing up? What I might want? What I might do? The problems my existence caused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried you\u2019d insist on havin\u2019 a piece of the ranch as your birthright. I\u2019m a good judge of character and yours has always been sound. I\u2019ll admit some...concern when we first found out about you, what level of involvement you\u2019d have with us\u2014but that was more concern for our folks. I didn\u2019t want Mom or Dad feelin\u2019 less than, if that makes sense.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re here now. You\u2019re part of the family. We\u2019re all glad for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am too.\u201d Gavin watched Quinn urge his horse back from the creek. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen this piece of dirt, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Quinn pushed up his hat. Then he smirked. \u201cHonestly? I think you probably overpaid for it. By a lot.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed, but he withheld additional comment, wondering if Quinn had as good a poker face as Dalton.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know the initial purchase of this place caused a rift between you and Ben, and I\u2019m glad you two got it sorted out. I didn\u2019t take sides, mostly because I never understood the big push for havin\u2019 access to this section anyway. Probably just a McKay pride thing, since it wasn\u2019t in McKay hands, or a competition thing between Dad and Uncle Casper. If I brought Dad out here now, he\u2019d shake his head and consider us better off for not payin\u2019 taxes on land we can\u2019t use for nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>A harsh assessment. \u201cSo this section doesn\u2019t have any redeeming value?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Quinn said evenly. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t have value for us.\u201d He gestured to the overgrown trees along the creek bed. \u201cIt\u2019d take one helluva lot of work to get it remotely useable. Since it\u2019s just me\u2019n Ben runnin\u2019 our ranch since Dad retired, I don\u2019t see takin\u2019 that workload on as any kind of long term benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Ben would feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably now he would. The time of the failed land deal he was in a whole other mindset. He\u2019s got a different life these days and his extra time is spent with Ainsley or on his furniture business. Ben won\u2019t wanna spend months clearing brush when we\u2019ve already got enough goin\u2019 on to keep both of us busy fulltime. And I\u2019d rather be with my darlin\u2019 wife and kids than wasting time tryin\u2019 to improve something that ain\u2019t gonna give us much in return.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed on him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with all the questions?\u201d</p><p>Gavin shrugged. \u201cLike you said, this piece of land has been a point of contention. I thought I\u2019d gauge your interest in it now that you\u2019ve seen it up close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I\u2019d put it at zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your honesty. Between us, Dalton and Tell have some interest so I might hear them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe interestin\u2019 to hear what they come up with.\u201d</p><p>And that was that. He could discuss partnership possibilities with Dalton, Tell and Brandt without guilt.</p><p>Hanging out with Quinn was very low-key. Almost peaceful. He didn\u2019t fill the silence with meaningless chatter. Quinn was so different from Ben\u2014yet, in some ways they were exactly alike, and strangely enough, Gavin had many of the same characteristics of his brothers. Gavin was starting to believe he had a place in this family besides being an object of curiosity and regret.</p><p>They mounted up and skirted the inner section in favor of following the fence line that ran on flatter land.</p><p>Once they returned to Gavin\u2019s place and dealt with the horses, he handed Quinn a beer and sat next to him on the tailgate of Quinn\u2019s truck.</p><p>\u201cSo I have to ask you something a little random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a scary start to a conversation, but go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I showed up here and we had the meeting? Vi got upset telling her story and Charlie told her to calm down because of her high blood pressure.\u201d</p><p>After lowering his beer bottle, Quinn looked at him curiously. \u201cThat is a random thing to remember. What\u2019re you askin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is Vi\u2019s blood pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than it was. Mom ain\u2019t the type to talk about it. She don\u2019t wanna be seen as anything less than Teflon-coated.\u201d</p><p>That did fit with Gavin\u2019s impression of Vi.</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Ben did get Dad to tell us that the doc had put her on high blood pressure meds and ordered a change in diet. But after a year, she lost weight, they switched meds and her health is a lot better.\u201d He raised his bottle again and drank. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Gavin swung his feet. \u201cI was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few months after that meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised me too. I was a little overweight, but not bad. So I wondered if high blood pressure is hereditary, and on which side. The McKays or the Bennetts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt comes from the Bennett side.

It\u2019s under control. I just wondered if that health issue might be a double whammy from both sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad is healthy as an ox.\u201d Quinn snorted. \u201cCourse, when Ma went on a diet, Dad did too, whether he wanted to or not. He ended up losing weight and that improved his overall health. I ain\u2019t gonna claim all the McKays are a hale and hearty bunch\u2014Grandpop had a heart attack, but it wasn\u2019t early on. And the uncles seem to be fine. Aging well, if you ask me.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut there is one other thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one in the family talks much about it.\u201d Quinn sent him a look. \u201cSierra didn\u2019t find any mention of it in the family archives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA...physical thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of physical thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA physical anomaly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Like a heart murmur or something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you have this anomaly?\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s gaze dropped. \u201cNot yet. This condition shows up at a specific age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat age?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForty-four.\u201d</p><p>Now Gavin was getting spooked. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my place to say. Maybe you oughta ask Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis third nipple.\u201d</p><p>Gavin turned toward Quinn and repeated, \u201cHe has a third nipple.\u201d</p> <p>Quinn didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>A pause, then, \u201cNope. Just pullin\u2019 your leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally fucking funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Quinn grinned. \u201cI\u2019da given anything to see the look on Dad\u2019s face when you demanded to see his extra nipple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Quinn.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI almost said we McKays grew a third testicle. And since Dad is the McKay castration king, he\u2019d just whack off your extra ball during branding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said. Fuck. Off.\u201d Gavin groaned. \u201cJesus. I\u2019m not that green. Am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But we\u2019re workin\u2019 on ya.\u201d</p><p>Marin\u2019s Blazer ripped up the driveway, music blasting out the windows.</p><p>Quinn muttered, \u201cAmelia\u2019s teen years are gonna kill me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Adam\u2019s don\u2019t do you in first. I hear boys are worse than girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the sympathy, bro,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Sierra hopped out of the car, holding her backpack on her left side.</p><p>Marin backed up and yelled, \u201cBye, McKay, don\u2019t forget to call me later!\u201d out the car window before she sped off.</p><p>McKay? That was new. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Sierra stopped a few feet from the tailgate. \u201cHey, Q.\u201d</p><p>Quinn smiled widely at her. \u201cSo, McKay, huh?\u201d</p><p>Sierra shot Gavin a quick glance before looking at Quinn. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what the kids at school call me.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Sierra mentioned this?</p><p>Because it\u2019d gone over so well when you found out she called Vi Grams.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s a better nickname than Trouble,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThough to hear most folks around here talk, McKay and trouble mean the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Sierra grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of the stories about the wild McKay boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll lies,\u201d Quinn said with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Grandpa Charlie says too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind any proof of those wild ways as you\u2019re doin\u2019 your family research project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. I found out a lot of stuff about the McKays and Wests and I can\u2019t wait to talk about it at the branding.\u201d She made a face. \u201cGrandpa Charlie and Grams are making me give an oral report to the entire McKay family.\u201d</p><p>Gavin could see Sierra\u2019s excitement and pride, even when she tried to pass it off as a chore.</p><p>\u201cBut most of the recent McKay dirt I\u2019ve heard has come from Kyler or Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Keely...\u201d Gavin said. \u201cGrab a snack and we\u2019ll hit the road in about ten minutes for your physical therapy session.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDo I have to? My collarbone feels completely healed.\u201d She rotated her arm forward and back. \u201cSee? It\u2019s fine. The sessions are a waste of my time and Keely\u2019s time and your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Doc Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Sierra shifted her stance, acting as if she needed to talk but wasn\u2019t comfortable doing so in front of Quinn.</p><p>Quinn caught the vibe and slid off the tailgate. \u201cI best be goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing the horses over today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. Just holler anytime you wanna ride.\u201d Quinn tugged on Sierra\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can ride any time you want after you get the doctor\u2019s official all clear on your physical therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be so surprised when I just show up, demanding riding lessons, Q.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d Quinn drove off.</p><p>Sierra dropped her backpack on the ground and moved in to hug him. \u201cHey Dad.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head, enjoying this sweet spontaneous hug. She held onto him for the longest time. Finally, his curiosity got the better of him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had a bad day. Nothing specific happened, I\u2019m just feeling kind of sad. I miss my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t seen you in forever. I\u2019m low on Dad hugs and need some Dad time.\u201d</p><p>Gavin held her a little tighter. \u201cSo we should do something after your physical therapy appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest and sighed.</p><p>Moments like these were worth suffering through every slamming door and petty fight. \u201cI\u2019ll run in, grab my wallet and leave a note for Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it won\u2019t hurt her feelings that we\u2019re doing something without her.\u201d</p><p>That Sierra even mentioned it was a sign she\u2019d accepted Rielle as a permanent part of their life\u2014he refused to look at it any other way.</p><p>May...</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s sucky that Boone isn\u2019t taking you to prom this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Me too. \u201cProm is so not his type of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would he know if he\u2019s never been to one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have a point.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell Marin that Boone couldn\u2019t afford to take anyone to prom. What girl would ride on the back of his bike in a fancy dress?</p><p>You would. In a freakin\u2019 heartbeat.</p><p>Marin sighed heavily. \u201cI just don\u2019t get you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned down Paxton Green\u2019s invite to prom, which is just stupid because hello, he\u2019s hot, sweet and...did I mention hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should\u2019ve said yes. We should be in Rapid right now trying on slutty prom dresses.\u201d</p><p>Sierra laughed. \u201cYou really think my dad would let me wear a slutty prom dress out of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d Marin grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t say we were gonna buy them, just try them on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d be wearing fuck me heels too, with this imaginary slutty prom gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. And carrying a sparkly rhinestone purse big enough to fit a flask, condoms and a small handgun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so crazy-wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is crazy-wrong is that you\u2019re not goin\u2019 to prom with pretty Paxton the bulldoggin\u2019 stud, because you\u2019re mooning over boring Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMooning. As if. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s it. Besides, prom wouldn\u2019t be any fun if you weren\u2019t there, Marin, so that\u2019s really why I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. But next year we\u2019re double dating no matter what.\u201d A few minutes passed and Marin complained, \u201cWhy are we sitting out here? I can feel my white skin frying like bacon and more freckles popping up on my face.\u201d</p><p>Sierra knocked her foot into Marin\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous day. Warm air, blue skies. No snow. One thing I miss about Arizona is soaking up the sun. So suck it up, cupcake, and sit here with me until Rielle picks me up. I do all sorts of stuff with you that I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Marin challenged.</p><p>\u201cLike listening to country music.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that there are worse things we could be doin\u2019 than watching the guys on the track team running around in shorts and tank tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about going out for track?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until right this minute...omigod.\u201d Marin peered over the tops of her sunglasses. \u201cWho is that guy in the black shorts and white wife beater running sprints by the fence?\u201d</p><p>Sierra didn\u2019t even hesitate to say, \u201cBoone,\u201d with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t recognize him without his thug hat and coat on. Is that why you made me come here? So we could drool over him from afar?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo. I\u2019m waiting for a ride, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I want to talk to him, okay? I\u2019ve texted him a couple times and I haven\u2019t heard back. And I don\u2019t wanna come across as\u201d\u2014desperate\u2014\u201ca pest, so I hoped I\u2019d see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk to him about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether he\u2019s coming to the branding. I\u2019m supposed to share my McKay family history report\u2014the stuff that didn\u2019t make it in the actual school report\u2014and since he helped me so much, I hope he wants to be there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s he supposed to see you if you\u2019re crouched down in the grass?\u201d</p><p>Sierra\u2019s gaze slowly tracked over Boone\u2019s body\u2014obviously amazing even at this distance. His skin gleaming, his muscles straining as he performed a pivot and run body conditioning exercise. The last time she\u2019d spoken to him, he\u2019d talked about a new strength and stamina training regimen. She\u2019d asked tons of questions until he\u2019d offered to demonstrate his new moves, which made her feel a little pervy, but a victorious pervy.</p><p>\u201cSierra?\u201d</p> <p>She said, \u201cWhat?\u201d offhandedly, keeping her eyes on Boone as he bent forward. Nice buns. But she preferred them in jeans.</p><p>\u201cI said how is Boone supposed to notice you if you\u2019re halfway across the damn football field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does? How?\u201d Marin demanded.</p><p>It\u2019d sound like a lie, or at least wishful thinking, if she told Marin she knew Boone had watched her walk the entire way from the gym exit. \u201cHe, ah, waved to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Marin stood and brushed the grass from her rear. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need a ride? I could drop you off on my way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle is in town so she offered to pick me up. I\u2019ll be fine hanging out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>Within three minutes of Marin leaving, Boone strolled over.</p><p>Her belly did that flip, swoop, roll thing even when she acted bored.</p><p>Boone flopped beside her, stretching out on his back and groaning, \u201cMan, I\u2019m so fucking whupped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Hi, Sierra, how are you today? No, I\u2019ve been ditching your calls because I pulled a muscle in my phone dialing finger? Just, I\u2019m so fucking whupped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouchy today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He showered her with a handful of grass.</p><p>\u201cHey! That\u2019s it. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Sierra started to stand but Boone grabbed her around the waist and rolled her beside him in the grass, ignoring her yelps.</p><p>He kept his hand on her stomach, holding her in place. \u201cHey. If it isn\u2019t sexy Sierra McKay. You\u2019re looking damn fine today. Is that a new shirt? It does amazing things for your...eyes.\u201d He aimed a quick grin her direction. \u201cDid you do something different with your hair? The chocolate-colored tresses are so silky and shiny in the sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dickhead. And I\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how come you\u2019re still here?\u201d</p> <p>Sierra pointedly looked at his palm that seemed to be burning a hole through her shirt, right to her skin.</p><p>Boone removed his hand. Those striking brown eyes met hers and he lifted his eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. She stayed right there, gazing into his handsome face, understanding what Marin had meant by mooning over him\u2014wanting what she couldn\u2019t have. Somehow she forced herself to sit up. \u201cYou suck at returning text messages, West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying for finals and covering Alan\u2019s shift since he\u2019s on vacation. Or I\u2019ve been working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell. You\u2019ve got some beefy biceps going on.\u201d</p><p>Boone flexed. \u201cCheck \u2019em out.\u201d</p><p>Yes please. She bumped him with her shoulder. \u201cNo. It might compromise your virtue if people saw me feeling you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be worth it.\u201d His intense focus traveled from her eyes to her hair. \u201cSorry for throwing grass at you.\u201d He leaned close enough she could see his pulse pounding in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>She stayed frozen as his fingers started at her scalp and drifted down the strands of her hair with such deliberation she\u2019d swear he was dragging it out.</p><p>You know better.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you need to talk to me about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sierra\u2019s gaze roved over his face. From his dark eyes, so intent on his task, to his full mouth, his lips parted to release shallow breaths, to his angular jaw. Such a beautiful man. She could just look at him all day.</p><p>\u201cSierra?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. I wanted to see if you were coming to the branding next Saturday. You don\u2019t have to help with the actual work part, just come to the after party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the invite? The McKays need a West whipping boy? Or are your dad, psycho uncles and cousins gonna castrate me?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and sank her teeth into his wrist. Hard.</p><p>\u201cJesus, McKay! Let go.\u201d</p><p>She slid her mouth free and licked her lips. \u201cYep. As salty as I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re being a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to really piss you off,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cToo late. I\u2019m already mad at you. Anyway, I\u2019m filling in the blanks on the McKay/West feud for the entire McKay family. I wondered if you wanted to be there since you helped with the research.\u201d</p><p>He tucked her hair behind her ear. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m working a twelve that day.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment flooded her.</p><p>\u201cBut I heard there\u2019s a pre-graduation party at Phil Nickels\u2019 parents\u2019 cabin at the lake that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have told you to come if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Close enough to an invite for her. \u201cI\u2019ll show up. Think Angie, Kara and Tyler will be there?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned cold. \u201cI\u2019ll flatten that fucker Tyler if he comes anywhere near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll have to pretend we\u2019re together again?\u201d Stop acting like that\u2019s what you want. \u201cYou have to be tired of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Boone gave her a light head butt that shouldn\u2019t have been sweet, but was. \u201cI gotta get back on track.\u201d</p><p>Sierra groaned.</p><p>\u201cSee you around, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Six</p><p>Rielle stayed in the greenhouse long past dark. She\u2019d finished her work hours ago, but she couldn\u2019t force herself to be in the house with happy Gavin and his equally happy sidekick Sierra.</p><p>She was in a mood. This type of surly, sulking mood was rare, but once she became infected with it, look out. Which was why she\u2019d hidden herself away from the people she cared about.</p><p>Gavin wouldn\u2019t track her down. He understood the demands of her business. So with any luck, and with the help of isolation and booze, she\u2019d shake this mood and return to normal tomorrow.</p><p>For the next hour she accomplished exactly nothing except pacing and fretting. Running calculations in her head caused a headache and she threw in the towel. She slipped on her jacket and shut the lights off, her trusty pal Sadie trotting alongside her on the road to the house. On the porch she crouched and hugged her dog. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Sadie. Sorry I\u2019ve been lousy company.\u201d</p><p>The house was quiet but she saw the glow from the TV upstairs which meant Gavin was glued to some sporting event. Addicted to sports was better than being addicted to porn, she supposed, but she\u2019d never understand the man\u2019s undying love of the games. Rielle found it ironic the sport Gavin\u2019s brother competed in on a professional level held zero interest for him. He\u2019d watch Chase ride, but he turned the channel the instant Chase was done.</p><p>A long shower removed the dirt but not the black cloud hanging above her. She stared out the window for a while, until she realized if she\u2019d be up all damn night without a sleep aid. She wandered to the kitchen and grabbed a six-pack of Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade. During her unproductive navel-gazing in her room, she\u2019d already downed half the second bottle when a knock sounded on her door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you in the kitchen. I thought you were still working.\u201d Gavin\u2019s arms encircled her waist and he pressed a kiss on her neck. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come upstairs?\u201d</p><p>Rielle pointed to the six pack. \u201cI\u2019m lousy company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s true.\u201d She drained the bottle and set it on the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin, I appreciate your concern, but I\u2019m bitchy right now and I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t see this side of me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cAm I to take that as you\u2019ve never been bitchy with me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you think I can\u2019t handle you being less than my Ree of sunshine?\u201d He paused. \u201cRay of sunshine. Get it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, in spite of herself. \u201cYes, I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you really going to sleep down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sucks. Not only because I looked forward to having my wicked way with you\u2014which I was\u2014but because that means you\u2019ve shut me out. And you know what? I don\u2019t like being shut out.\u201d</p><p>Rielle didn\u2019t detect hurt in his tone, just concern. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This...sharing your bad day stuff is still new to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me too. But we both know every day won\u2019t be perfect and I want you to be able to tell me what\u2019s eating at you.\u201d</p><p>She always handled stuff on her own. \u201cIt\u2019s not a personal thing between us, but a business thing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s different. Fuck this talking about your business shit; if it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me and you, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cSee how crazy that sounds? Ree. I\u2019m in your life. All aspects of it. I\u2019m a pushy dick who won\u2019t leave this\u2014or you\u2014alone until you talk to me.\u201d</p><p>How had she ever gotten so lucky to have this man in her life? She leaned back into him. \u201cI lost the Twin Pines bread account today. Which means I also lost the Creekside B&amp;B account since they\u2019re owned by the same people.\u201d There. She\u2019d said it without choking on it or letting loose a string of profanities. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid they indicate why they were terminating the contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bringing the baked goods in-house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re upset,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>Now that she\u2019d opened her mouth, everything just spilled out. \u201cThe Twin Pines is the first place that contracted me for baked goods before the bakery closed. So it feels like I\u2019m losing a cornerstone of my business, even when their orders had dropped off in the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. But the upside of this situation is that it isn\u2019t the quality of your product that caused their decision. So there\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done to prevent it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin wasn\u2019t just being the sweet supportive boyfriend, but he looked at this from the business side and she appreciated that.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried other restaurants and businesses will follow suit and take the baking in-house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it. But I know a big plus to the restaurants I supply is my products are unique to each place. The only restaurant you can get the savory and honey seven-grain rolls is at Fields. Same with the other five restaurants I supply.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is smart. You don\u2019t need me to tell you that.\u201d Gavin gently turned her around to face him. \u201cWhat else has put that wrinkle in your brow and the clouds in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I left the Twin Pines today, I didn\u2019t immediately start researching other restaurants I could sell to, to fill the gap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always done that in the past?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always needed to replace the income right away. Over the last few hours as I\u2019ve dissected this reaction every possible way, I realized I don\u2019t want to seek out replacement restaurants.\u201d She hated talking about money with Gavin, but her mindset in this case went beyond money and it involved him. \u201cSo I have to ask myself: Have I gotten lazy?\u201d</p><p>Gavin burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cGavin. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRee. Honey, rest assured you\u2019re not a slacker. I\u2019m pretty sure losing the Twin Pines and Creekside B&amp;B business will only be a blip in your daily routine. If the income loss isn\u2019t substantial enough to worry you at all, then you\u2019re exactly right in questioning the immediate need to find replacement income.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his smirking mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re so...I hesitate to say right because you\u2019ll get a swelled head, but you are. Even if you are pushy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly so I won\u2019t have to push you again and you\u2019ll come to me on your own next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also had to question whether the reason I didn\u2019t want to add more business was because of you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t choked on admitting that either.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cPersonally or professionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause filling that gap is no longer a financial necessity? Since you now have me as a fall back guy?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cDoes that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhacked out Ree sense, yes, but that\u2019s why I love you.\u201d His eyes grew serious. \u201cYou\u2019re permanently involved with me, a guy who has no financial worries. If you lost all your businesses now it wouldn\u2019t affect your standard of living because I\u2019m there to pick up the financial slack\u2014even when I know you\u2019d never ask me for a dime. You\u2019ve never had that long-term stability before and it scares you.\u201d His voice dropped to a husky whisper. \u201cYou know I\u2019d like to make your life easier.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that be an issue between us. I love your independence and that you are a self-made woman. I still think you work too hard, but that\u2019s a huge part of who you are and what formed you. I love the whole of you, Ree. But I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out that counting on me\u2014physically, emotionally, financially\u2014doesn\u2019t make you soft or lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin. I...\u201d She forced the words past the lump in her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to make my life easier. But you already make it better. That\u2019s all I want from you.\u201d</p><p>He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI know. Just don\u2019t shut me out anymore, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>An odd sort of acceptance shifted between them in the silence.</p><p>\u201cCan I make love to you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he murmured and kissed her eyelids to ensure she did.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s hands cradled her face and he kissed her so softly, so sweetly, she felt tears welling again. Then his hands moved down her neck and beneath the collar of her robe. He said, \u201cUntie the sash.\u201d As soon as the tie fell free, he slid her satin robe off her shoulders until it pooled on the floor, leaving her naked.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful, every inch of you,\u201d he breathed against her skin.</p><p>His mouth cruised to all the hot spots he\u2019d discovered. The arch of her neck. The side of her right breast. He feasted on her nipples until she became dizzy and wet with want. The entire time his sucking mouth and flickering tongue drove her out of her mind, his hands were on her. Caressing. Squeezing. Soft at times, rough at others, but every sweep and brush of his fingers and mouth told her of his possession.</p><p>Rielle gave herself over to him completely, understanding that\u2019s what he wanted\u2014her total surrender.</p><p>Gavin worshiped her. With his hands. With his words. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong here,\u201d he said, his voice soft against her throat as his fingertips mapped the muscles in her arms. Then the slope of her shoulders.</p><p>Normally she\u2019d urge him to hurry, push her on the bed and mount her like a rutting beast. But she\u2019d given him control and it appeared he intended to take his own sweet time in exercising it fully.</p><p>Not that she was complaining.</p><p>He stood behind her. Scattering openmouthed kisses down her nape and spine until she shook from the eroticism of it. His breath, his lips, the play of his hands all swirled together into an overwhelming maelstrom of sensation. Yet she felt every press of his fingertips, every kiss, every stuttered puff of air across her skin. And he left no section untouched. Unloved.</p><p>Then Gavin turned her around again. He lowered to his knees.</p><p>The muscles in her abdomen rippled as he pressed kisses from her belly button to the rise of her mound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. My own personal honey pot. I love this hot, sticky honey your body makes just for me.\u201d The tip of his tongue followed the slit down to her opening. After wiggling his tongue inside and softly sucking, he flattened his tongue and dragged it back up.</p><p>Rielle couldn\u2019t keep her legs from wobbling.</p><p>Using his thumbs, he opened the folds of skin hiding her clit. He murmured something and settled his mouth on her sex.</p><p>He\u2019d wound her so tight that thirty seconds after his wicked mouth began to suck, she unraveled. The short, intense orgasm had just primed her for more. She eagerly waited for him to command her to get on the bed.</p><p>But Gavin didn\u2019t budge. His tongue traced the lines of muscles in her quads. His teeth nipped the inside of her thighs. When he fucked two fingers in and out of her swollen pussy, her legs became Jell-O again. That tingling tease of release hovered close to the surface.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She groaned when he slid his thumb over the seam of her sex.</p><p>Between the pressures of his thumb pushing her clit up so his tongue could torture her with wet swirls and the constant rubbing of his fingers on her inner vaginal wall, she hit that detonation point. The throbbing heat licked through her body. She felt the waves in her nipples. In her throat. In her lips. Gavin held on and held her up through every pulse. Then he nuzzled and petted her as she floated down from that foggy bank of pleasure.</p><p>As soon as he was on his feet, she tried to remove his clothes, but he stayed her hands. He kissed her fingertips. The center of her palms. The insides of her wrists. Planting his mouth on hers, he kissed her deeply, with sweetness, with finesse. Sharing her taste and giving her a taste of his need.</p><p>He kept touching her as he ditched his sweatpants and T-shirt. His hands were in her hair as they landed on the mattress, warm skin meeting warm skin.</p><p>His seduction was all consuming. Powerful in a quiet fever of desire. It seemed he\u2019d shown her in a hundred different small ways that he loved her. But this was different. This was action speaking louder than words. This cemented their connection completely. Physically. Emotionally. Permanently.</p><p>Watching her eyes, he entered her, stopping when they were fully joined. Letting her see in his eyes everything she brought to him, everything she gave to him when their bodies became one.</p><p>Rielle wrapped her legs around his hips. She lifted her arms to circle his neck but he made a growling noise and pinned her right arm above her head. That brought their bodies even closer.</p><p>Then he started to move. Showing her that passion didn\u2019t have a set speed. Gavin\u2019s need for her was there in every measured undulation of his hips. In every drawn out glide of his chest against hers.</p><p>Sinking into the slow sizzle and burn of his kisses. Breathless in anticipation for the long thrusts of his body linking to hers. This was acceptance. This was love. This was perfection.</p><p>And this man was all hers.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d taken them to that pinnacle of pleasure, sweat coated their skin. Their hearts thundered. Need clawed with tiny teeth.</p><p>He ground his pelvis into hers and her orgasm unfurled. Unending, glorious. And with her inner walls rhythmically clamping around his shaft, Gavin let himself go.</p><p>There was no need for words. Rielle wasn\u2019t sure if there were words for what\u2019d just happened between them.</p><p>They curled into each other and drifted into peaceful sleep.</p><p>Branding day dawned misty and warm. Gavin had no idea what to expect, so he asked his brothers. Ben and Quinn had looked at the sky, looked at the ground and said, \u201cMud.\u201d</p><p>Dalton, Tell and Brandt arrived early to help round up cattle. Ben, Quinn and Brandt were on horseback, the rest of them were on ATVs. An hour and a half later the herd milled around the corrals. The calves inside; the mamas outside. Mamas did not like to be separated from their babies. Babies didn\u2019t like being away from mamas. The noise was deafening. They all had to shout over the din. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Other McKay cousins arrived and Charlie told him it took four days of branding to get all the McKay cattle branded. One day at their place. Kade and Kane\u2019s, and Brandt, Tell and Dalton\u2019s calves were branded on the same day. And two solid days to mark the calves that Cord, Colby and Colt raised.</p><p>Gavin watched as the guys worked in teams of two. They grabbed a calf from the pen, pinned it on its side. One held the head; one held the rear. Quinn and Ben did the branding with the irons. Libby and Ainsley handled vaccinating the calves. Gavin never imagined the suit and high-heel-wearing bank president down in the muck, but she got right in there.</p><p>Cal used the small round iron for de-horning if needed, and Charlie was tasked with castration. One of Colby\u2019s boys was in charge of the \u201cnut bucket\u201d and followed Charlie as he cut off the testicles, turning potential bulls into steers. Gavin peered into the big dump bucket. There looked to be a whole lot of Rocky Mountain oysters.</p> <p>As the day wore on they were all grateful for the cloud cover. Charlie had warned him to be prepared for anything because the month of May could be as hot as eighty or cold enough for heavy snow.</p><p>At first Gavin had been self-conscious about jumping into the fray, but his curiosity won out over pride. It was a challenge, holding the head of an animal as its flesh got seared, its balls got whacked off and its horns were burned away. Down in the trenches the air was thick with the stench of burning hide. By the time he took a breather, his coveralls were covered in mud, manure and hair.</p><p>His cousins teased him. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a rancher out of you yet.\u201d</p><p>After they finished branding, everyone showed up at Quinn and Libby\u2019s. Kids and dogs ran wild. Beneath two canopies tables were piled with enough food to feed an army.</p><p>Gavin looked around for Sierra. She waved to him and continued her conversation with Colt\u2019s wife India. Hopefully she wasn\u2019t discussing future tattoo options.</p> <p>When he saw Rielle, laughing with Ainsley and Libby, he had a feeling of rightness. Of contentment.</p><p>Rielle strolled over. \u201cHey, cowboy. So after a day of branding are you ditching your loafers for spurs to wrassle cattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gavin snuck in a kiss or three. \u201cI\u2019d rather wrassle you. You don\u2019t put up nearly the fight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, then shot a look at Sierra before she leaned closer. \u201cWhat do you know about Sierra\u2019s presentation? Because she\u2019s nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. But she\u2019s a little high-strung, like someone else I know.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Me.\u201d She pecked him on the mouth. \u201cGotta run. Save me a seat at the table.\u201d</p><p>Even with so many people the chow line moved fast. Gavin sat across from Keely and Jack. Sierra scooted over when Rielle showed up and didn\u2019t say much.</p><p>\u201cKeely, how are you feeling?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cGood, for the most part. I\u2019m tired. I could sleep all damn day. This kid kicks all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>Keely shook her head. \u201cThere are so few surprises in life, we want this to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny weird cravings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTomatoes and Hershey bars,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cAnd yes, she eats them at the same time.\u201d</p><p>That sounded nasty.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not hungry at all today,\u201d Keely said. She turned sideways on the bench seat and leaned into Jack.</p><p>Jack stretched his hands across Keely\u2019s rounded belly and murmured to her.</p><p>Then Gavin was drawn into conversation with Carson and when he turned back to talk to Sierra, she\u2019d vanished.</p><p>After everyone had eaten, and they were milling about under the big tent, Vi clapped her hands for attention. \u201cSierra has something she\u2019d like to share. A piece of McKay history.\u201d Vi gently patted Sierra on the shoulder as she shoved her front and center.</p><p>Gavin grinned. Vi had her own way of doing things.</p><p>Sierra looked nervous being in front of the entire McKay clan. Her gaze scanned the crowd until she found him. He smiled, elated his daughter still looked to him for support. He gave her two thumbs up, which would earn the, Dad, you\u2019re such a dork remark later.</p><p>Sierra clutched a sheaf of papers and began. \u201cMost of you know I did a paper on the McKay family for history class. I started out with an old family tree, branched out, and wow, there are a lot of McKays running around these days. It took me forever to do that part.\u201d That earned her laughter. \u201cAnyway, when I finished, I was still confused about a few things. For one, the lack of information about Jonas McKay\u2019s twin brother Silas, who was unofficially marked as deceased. He isn\u2019t buried in the McKay cemetery and there is no official record of his death.\u201d</p><p>A wave of conversation broke out and then Dalton whistled for quiet.</p><p>\u201cAunt Carolyn lent me the McKay archives and I scanned all the information in twenty-seven boxes, including Dinah Thompson McKay\u2019s journals. The other reason I kept going on my search, is because I\u2019ve heard about the West-McKay feud, but no one\u2014in the McKay family or the West family\u2014knew what\u2019d happened. And I mean no one. Not even my Grandpa Charlie and he\u2019s old.\u201d More laughter and Sierra blew Charlie a kiss when he tipped his hat to her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to be accused of skewing any information I might uncover as favorable to the McKays, I enlisted Boone West to help me search for facts. Boone had no idea what the original source of friction between the Wests and McKays might be either.\u201d She paused and thrust her arm in the air and waved the paper. \u201cAnd guess what? We found it!\u201d</p><p>Excited chatter erupted.</p><p>Gavin watched as Sierra waited for the crowd to quiet down, a smug smile on her face.</p><p>Keely whistled to cut the chatter. \u201cPipe down. I wanna hear what she has to say. Go ahead, tell us everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Keely.\u201d Sierra took a deep breath. \u201cSilas and Jonas McKay were identical twins who wound up in Wyoming in 1896. Jonas worked as a deputy. Silas worked as a ranch hand. In 1897 Silas bought a tract of land, which is still part of the McKay ranch today. Then in 1898, during a poker game at a bar in Moorcroft, which was likely a whor\u2014\u201d she shot a look at the little kids sitting in front and amended, \u201c\u2014a house of ill repute, Silas McKay won a chunk of land from Ezekiel West.</p><p>\u201cEzekiel\u2019s brother Zachariah disputed the validity of the game, but the sheriff vouched for Silas. Since Jonas worked for the sheriff, the Wests accused the sheriff of corruption. In the meantime, whenever Ezekiel and Silas crossed paths the following year, they\u2019d end up in fight. According to Dinah\u2019s journal, Ezekiel broke Silas\u2019s arm one night when Zachariah joined in and they beat Silas to a pulp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, this is already playing in favor of the McKays,\u201d Cam shouted from the back.</p><p>\u201cHush, you,\u201d Carolyn scolded. \u201cYou got just as much West in you as McKay.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cOohs,\u201d broke out.</p><p>\u201cThis is where Dinah Thompson enters the picture. She was the school teacher and she boarded with the town\u2019s doctor and his wife. Dinah was also expected to help the doctor out on weekends. Silas wasn\u2019t much of a fighter; he ended up at the doctor\u2019s office frequently after his tussles with Ezekiel. Silas became smitten with Dinah and wooed her.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at the term. \u201cTaking her to church socials and community events. They fell in love. Since school teachers couldn\u2019t continue teaching after marriage, she asked Silas for a long engagement, so she could keep earning money to put toward building a new house on the ranch.</p><p>\u201cBut Ezekiel also had his eye on Dinah. He wasn\u2019t the gentlemanly type that Silas was\u2014Dinah\u2019s words, not mine\u2014and Ezekiel became a stalker of sorts. Dinah wasn\u2019t wearing Silas\u2019 ring, so that made her fair game.\u201d Sierra scowled. \u201cThis next part is a little hazy, but near as I could tell, Ezekiel got Dinah alone and hurt her. When she told Silas, he went after Ezekiel. They got into another fight, Ezekiel pulled a gun on Silas, but Silas ended up shooting him.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stayed quiet.</p><p>\u201cWith Ezekiel dead, Jonas had no choice but to arrest his brother, even though it was clearly self-defense. But Zachariah West swore the murder was premeditated and he\u2019d see Silas hang for killing his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened to him?\u201d Kyler demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s why no one talks about Silas, because he was hanged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But Silas believed he was headed for the gallows. One night he attacked Jonas inside his cell and escaped from jail. Silas disappeared, never to be seen around here again. Several people swore they saw Silas get killed during a train robbery in Montana, but it was never confirmed. Others said Silas lived with the Crow Indians on the Montana border, but again, nothing was ever confirmed.</p><p>\u201cDinah wrote that Jonas knew his brother would be unjustly hanged so he made it possible for Silas to escape. Then Jonas resigned as a deputy and took over Silas\u2019s ranch. We discovered Zachariah West ended up with a small section of land in Campbell County that\u2019s still in the West family today. Dinah\u2019s last entry alluded to that land being paid for with blood money. What that means is up for debate and probably always will be. Some secrets really do go to the grave. Anyway, Jonas and Dinah fell in love and got married.\u201d Sierra looked up. \u201cAnd they are the reason we are all here today.\u201d</p><p>Applause and wolf whistles rang out.</p><p>Charlie sidled up and put his arm around Sierra. \u201cHow about my smart and determined granddaughter? Getting to the bottom of all this family stuff and putting rumors to rest with facts?\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m so damn proud of you for taking an interest in our heritage.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head and Charlie hugged her.</p><p>Then she was surrounded by curious McKays.</p><p>\u201cQuite the girl you have there, proud daddy,\u201d Rielle said.</p><p>\u201cShe is something. She really fits in with the McKays, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but so do you. Did you have any idea that Sierra had done so much research?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew she was working her butt off on it. She mentioned she\u2019d found something to Quinn and Charlie and Vi, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was.\u201d He put his mouth on her ear. \u201cTo be honest, I thought she and Boone were using just doing research as an excuse to hang out together these last few months.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed.</p><p>Sierra fairly bounced over after being waylaid by questions. \u201cDad, can I go now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the only place I ever go?\u201d she said with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cTo meet Marin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you and Marin going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo a graduation party at the lake. And no, we won\u2019t be drinking, smoking weed or having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo swimming at night either,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI know. And Boone will be there.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t exactly alleviate his worry. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had any issues with your new car?\u201d Maybe he had gone a little overboard, buying her a Mercedes M Class SUV, but he couldn\u2019t put a price on her safety. A little peace of mind was worth a lot.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDad. We studied the manual together. You read the manual to me when I was driving. I read the manual to you when you were driving. I\u2019ve studied the manual more than I have for my English final. So can I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But drive careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cI love you. I know my curfew\u2019s at midnight. There. I saved you from saying it.\u201d She gave Rielle a half-hug. \u201cSee you later.\u201d She practically skipped across the gravel driveway.</p><p>\u201cSo...she\u2019s gone for a few hours,\u201d Rielle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we head home? School will be out in two weeks, ending our mid-morning quickies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our afternoon delight.\u201d Rielle threaded her fingers through his. \u201cSince we have two vehicles, and I know how competitive you are, let\u2019s have a race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the prize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinner\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn.\u201d He whispered, \u201cYour ass is mine tonight, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</p> <p>But Gavin beat her home by a full two minutes.</p><p>He was feeling pretty cocky after a spectacular bout of raunchy sex, until Rielle whispered, \u201cSo, for the record, I let you win.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><p>The bright moon glow sent silvery light across the clearing. Sierra bumped over the cattle guard and saw him shielding his eyes from the glare of her headlights. Seemed a little strange, Boone calling her out of the blue and asking her to meet him. She hoped it meant something more than he was bored.</p><p>Sierra ignored Marin\u2019s snarky voice in her head, asking why she went running every time Boone crooked his little finger at her. But she hadn\u2019t seen him since his graduation and he\u2019d slipped back into the not-returning-texts zone. School had ended two days ago, and her summer plans were still up in the air.</p><p>She put her car in park and killed the ignition. Butterflies danced in her belly. Where had her nervousness come from? She was out here with Boone. Mr. Trustworthy. Mr. Oblivious.</p><p>His butt rested against his motorcycle seat. His booted feet crossed at the ankle. His arms folded over his chest. He wore a super tight T-shirt which displayed the ripped muscles in his arms and the ridges in his lower abdomen. She\u2019d seen that shirt on him a dozen times, and every time she whispered a little thank you to the T-shirt gods.</p><p>Stop gawking at him.</p><p>Nothing wrong with being attracted to her best guy buddy.</p><p>Was there?</p><p>No. Especially when he still didn\u2019t have a clue how she felt. She walked up to him, her hands jammed into the back pockets of her jeans. \u201cYou summoned me?\u201d</p><p>Boone frowned at her attire. \u201cWasn\u2019t tonight the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Was it fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I skipped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you said that night at the lake you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMarin is at her grandma\u2019s for a week so she wasn\u2019t going. Besides, they probably only played country music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>But I knew you wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me here to chew my ass about a dance I didn\u2019t go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here, anyway? Did your bike break down again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. It was a great night for a ride. I lost track of time. When I pulled over, I realized I wasn\u2019t far from your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you called me.\u201d Instead of just showing up at her house. That made no sense. Especially if Boone thought she was at the dance. What was going on with him? He acted...jumpy.</p><p>\u201cYou got any decent tunes in that piece of crap car you\u2019re driving these days?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The Mercedes was hardly a piece of crap and he knew it. Boone also knew that the only reason her dad had bought it was for the safety features, including an excess of air bags. \u201cI\u2019ll play music as long as you don\u2019t bitch about what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>She rolled down the windows and plugged her iPod into the stereo system. She mimicked his pose against the car, standing opposite him.</p><p>Boone grinned when the music started. \u201cFoo Fighters. Cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it. The next song might be by Flogging Molly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the hell that is, McKay. You\u2019re more ur-bane than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Seriously, West, what\u2019s up? It\u2019s not like you to text me, demanding I meet you out in the middle of nowhere. Especially this late.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cSince when is ten late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince my dad grills me about where I\u2019m going at ten at night and who I\u2019m going with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him you were meeting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She smirked. \u201cHe said not to let you drive my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d Boone paused and tipped his head toward the sky. \u201cAs much as I love how bright the moon is, I miss seeing the stars on nights like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Neither said anything for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cBut this moon-gazing shit is killing my neck.\u201d He moved to lean next to her. \u201cMuch better. So, what are your plans for this summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about becoming a carny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s the appeal? Getting hooked on meth? Hooked on pot? Hooked on fried food? Or is it getting to rip off little kids every day? Maybe you\u2019ll grow a mustache and get a bad tattoo.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons way more than I have. I was just in it for the unlimited cotton candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s option two for your summer?\u201d</p><p>He was more persistent than usual, so she hedged, in case he had a specific reason for asking her plans\u2014like he wanted to spend the summer with her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much my mom and dad argue over me and where I should be. My mom\u2019s boyfriend bought a place in Paris with an extra bedroom, so she wants me to stay at least half the summer with her.\u201d She shot him a sideways glance. \u201cI haven\u2019t mentioned this to my dad yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just found out yesterday. He\u2019ll ask me what I want to do, and like I said, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gives you a vote in your options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What about you? Now that you\u2019ve graduated, what are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the reason I asked you to meet me.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach performed a hopeful summersault.</p><p>But as usual, he didn\u2019t elaborate. He just kept looking skyward.</p><p>\u201cBoone? I\u2019m lousy at guessing games, remember? So just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here this summer because I joined the army.\u201d</p><p>Sierra gave him a ten-second pause and hip-checked him. \u201cYou have a bizarre sense of humor sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He faced her. \u201cI\u2019m not joking. I joined the army.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling took root as she realized he was serious. Then she exploded. \u201cWhy would you just up and do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an impulsive decision. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost three years. Since my youth forestry counselor suggested it when I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>And this was the first time he\u2019d mentioned it? After all the time they\u2019d spent together? \u201cBut we\u2019re at war! The military sends the newest recruits over there.\u201d Another horrible thought occurred to her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got medical training, which means they\u2019ll put you on the first cargo plane and drop you right in the middle of a combat zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get yourself killed?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, to help keep others from dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do that every day as an EMT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. I can\u2019t make a living as an EMT in rural Wyoming. I\u2019m tired of being broke and there are a lot of things I\u2019d like to do with my life that I can\u2019t do if I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go to college like normal people do.\u201d</p><p>Boone scowled at her. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have money for a car do you really think I\u2019ve got money to go to college? Or that anyone will lend me the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll ask my dad. He\u2019ll float you a loan. Heck, he\u2019d probably just give you the money since you saved my life.\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the car. \u201cI don\u2019t want your money or your charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m only trying to help. You took that the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? What part of making it on my own is confusing to you? I have to do this. I want to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no talking you out of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Boone shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a done deal.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scream at him, throw herself at his feet and beg him not to go, but that was the epitome of childish. Instead, she tossed off a breezy, \u201cFine. Whatever. Go be a hero. Get yourself killed. Later.\u201d She sidestepped him and ducked around the front of the car, hoping to make it inside before her tears were obvious.</p><p>But he latched onto her upper arms and forced her to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>His gaze roamed over her face. \u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d he demanded softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I hate that you\u2019re doing this stupid thing. And I hate you.\u201d The last word came out as a sob.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSierra. Come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that either.\u201d Boone crushed her to his chest.</p><p>Sierra fought him for a few seconds, swinging punches that didn\u2019t land, yelling and thrashing, but he just held on. She gave up fighting the pull of him and clung to him as she cried.</p><p>How many times had she imagined Boone holding her, stroking her hair and murmuring sweet things to her? Hundreds. But never like this.</p><p>Her voice was muffled against his chest when she finally spoke. \u201cWhen do you go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>She froze. Then she squirmed away. \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me now? When did you sign up?\u201d</p><p>Boone looked away.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days after your accident.\u201d</p><p>Sierra felt all the air leave her lungs. The blood drained from her face and she was drowning. Her lips formed the word why.</p><p>\u201cBecause that night at Tyler\u2019s party when I told him we were together? I wanted it to be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I would\u2019ve shot you down, Boone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d His eyes were locked on hers. \u201cI know you would\u2019ve said yes.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned with mortification; he\u2019d known how she felt all along.</p><p>\u201cYou understand my history. Since I was twelve years old I\u2019ve been counting off the damn days until I can get the hell out of Wyoming. Last fall, the start of my senior year, I was taking the prep classes I needed and I was getting a year of practical experience as an EMT and moving on was finally within my grasp. And then you showed up.</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment we met on the bus, you sucked me in. You were so gorgeous, feisty, funny and sweet\u2014and so easy to talk to. I tried to stay away from you, but something about you, Sierra, just kept pulling me back.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, absolutely speechless.</p><p>\u201cThat night at the party I wanted to kill Tyler for thinking he had the right to put his hands on you. After the accident, I about lost my fucking mind because you were hurt... That\u2019s when I knew you could keep me here. If I got involved with you, like I wanted to, I wouldn\u2019t leave. And I have to leave. I had to have a solid plan to go so I enlisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sierra found her voice and said it louder. \u201cNo.\u201d Then she was screaming at him. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no! You don\u2019t get to do this to me, Boone. You don\u2019t get to treat me like a friend, and then tell me you\u2019ve always felt more for me...the night before you fucking leave! You don\u2019t get to make me feel guilty for you joining the army because I have some kind of magical hold over you. That\u2019s total bullshit and it\u2019s not fair!\u201d God. This could not be happening.</p><p>\u201cNot fair? You think this has been easy for me? Especially the last four months? When we\u2019ve been together all the damn time because I couldn\u2019t stay the hell away from you? And I had to act like it\u2019s not fucking killing me when you look at me like your world would be perfect if I just kissed you.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her hands on his chest and shoved him. \u201cThe only thing you can kiss, Boone West, is my ass.\u201d She spun around and considered kicking over his stupid bike as she skirted the back end of her car. Jerk. Asshole. Jerkoff. Asshat. He wanted to leave her? Fine. He could leave her. She\u2019d be better off.</p><p>Such a fucking liar you are, Sierra.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Boone shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna say goodbye to me?\u201d</p><p>Sierra whipped a U-turn and marched back up to him. \u201cHow did you expect I\u2019d say goodbye? Strip my clothes off and let you take my virginity in a field of wildflowers under a full moon? Screw that. I\u2019m saving my virginity for someone who deserves it. And. That. Is. Not. You.\u201d She punctuated each word with a poke on his hard chest.</p><p>Boone said, \u201cYou do that,\u201d in a throaty rasp she\u2019d never heard from him. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019m taking this.\u201d He wrapped one hand around the back of her neck and clamped the other on her butt, pulling her in for a kiss.</p><p>She should\u2019ve shoved him away. But his kiss was like a drug. Intense, determined, amazingly seductive\u2014as if he was trying to convince her that his passion for her was real. That he\u2019d been imagining this kiss for as long as she had. That he\u2019d wanted it as much. Mouths and tongues clashed and she slipped her arms around his waist, her hands clutching his shirt.</p><p>The kiss was beyond anything she\u2019d ever experienced. Rough and sexy, bringing alive things inside her she\u2019d heard about but had never felt.</p><p>Then Boone slowed it down. The kiss became soft. An unhurried tease, as if they had all the time in the world to explore. To learn each other.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t. By this time tomorrow, he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>Sierra kept kissing him even as her tears fell.</p><p>Then Boone\u2019s hands were on her face, trying to wipe away the moisture but her tears ran over his fingers.</p><p>He moved his mouth back; she felt his lips against hers and his breath in her mouth as he whispered, \u201cSierra. Baby, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d He planted tender smooches on her lips. His mouth wandered down her neck and her entire body erupted in goose flesh. He nuzzled the sweep of her shoulder and stopped, breathing against her skin.</p><p>She had to bite her lip to keep from sobbing when he strung soft kisses along her collarbone, right where the injury had hurt the most. But that pain was nothing compared to the pain she felt now.</p><p>Boone\u2019s fingers entwined in her hair and he tipped her head back. His beautiful eyes were dark with remorse and something else, something that made her pulse quicken. \u201cI knew it\u2019d be like this between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He just consumed her mouth again.</p><p>While kissing him was better than she\u2019d dreamed, she still felt like someone was stabbing her in the gut with a rusty knife as Boone took the kiss deeper until she feared she\u2019d never get out.</p><p>She broke away, resting her forehead to his.</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a long time. Not looking at each other, clinging to each other, so close but so far apart.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way. This was your choice.\u201d</p><p>He placed one last soft kiss on her lips.</p><p>Sierra pulled away from him. \u201cGoodbye, Boone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you around, McKay.\u201d His hands fell away.</p><p>Sierra didn\u2019t look at him. Not even in her rearview mirror as she bumped over the cattle guard and drove away.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><p>Ben and Quinn had enlisted Gavin\u2019s help moving cow/calf pairs from one pasture to another. Helping wasn\u2019t entirely accurate\u2014he\u2019d been designated the gate opener. But it\u2019d been a great morning. Cruising around on four wheelers and watching his brothers work cattle. Listening to Charlie tell stories.</p><p>He climbed out of his Lexus, in desperate need to ditch his dirty clothes and hit the shower, when Rielle yelled at him from the closest garden. He met her halfway down the road and stole a kiss. \u201cHey, sexy lady. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Sierra today? She swore she wanted to help me and I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s summer vacation. She mentioned it was her right to sleep in until noon, at least the first week.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe how early the school year ended in Wyoming. In Arizona, Sierra would be in school at least another month. \u201cI\u2019ll check on her.\u201d</p><p>After brushing off the ever-present dust, he scaled the stairs and knocked on Sierra\u2019s door. \u201cSweetheart? Are you up?\u201d He heard a thump. But no answer. Then another thump. He turned the handle and opened the door.</p><p>Boxes were stacked beside her bed. Everything had been stripped off the walls. She stood by the closet, dumping winter clothes into a box.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to come in without knocking first,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI knocked. You didn\u2019t answer.\u201d His gaze moved over the organized destruction. \u201cAre you planning to redecorate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just getting ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>Sierra whirled around. \u201cYes, leave. I\u2019m done with the living-in-Wyoming experiment.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stepped in the room, avoiding a pile of papers. \u201cWhoa. You want to rewind and tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. Her face distorted into the sneer that indicated he\u2019d just entered the battle zone. \u201cWhoa? Enough with the fake-cowboy shtick, Dad. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the verbal jab. \u201cWhat are you talking about, going home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you I\u2019d stick it out an entire school year. School ended. You promised me if I hated it we could go home. I freakin\u2019 hate it here and I cannot wait to get back where I belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a damn minute. Nothing was set in stone. We were going to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to discuss. I held up my end of the deal, it\u2019s time for you to hold up yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened? You didn\u2019t hate Wyoming two damn days ago. I don\u2019t get where this is coming from, so will you please explain it to me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. My mind is made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou change your mind about everything, Sierra.

I\u2019m just supposed to drop everything and move back to Arizona because you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me drop everything to move to Wyoming. How is this any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a helluva lot different.\u201d Do not remind her you\u2019re the adult and you make the decisions. Take a different tack. \u201cYou want to tell me what happened to you in the last day? Because this change of heart or mind, or whatever, came completely out of left field.\u201d</p><p>She vehemently shook her head. \u201cIf you think this is sudden then you haven\u2019t been paying attention. But that\u2019s not a surprise since most your time is spent with Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going there, Sierra? Making Rielle the root cause of your problem?\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks colored with guilt. But that didn\u2019t keep her from snapping back, \u201cRielle is the cause of this problem\u2014your problem\u2014you don\u2019t want to leave Wyoming because of her, which is not my problem.\u201d</p><p>His daughter had him there.</p><p>\u201cAnyway I thought she was building a new house so she didn\u2019t have to live with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans change. She\u2019s living with us permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t even think to tell me about that? Great. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter because I won\u2019t stay here and you can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Drive to Scottsdale by yourself? You certainly can\u2019t live there by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting Scottsdale isn\u2019t my only option.\u201d</p><p>His stomach pitched.</p><p>\u201cMom has been asking what my plan is for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this the first I\u2019ve heard of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you only hear what you wanna hear,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Rielle accused him of the same thing? \u201cI would\u2019ve remembered that. What did your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to move us back to Arizona or not?\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI have to decide right now? Then fine. No. This is ridiculous, Sierra. Let\u2019s just take a step back and discuss this rationally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen my mom in almost six months. I miss her. I want to be with my mom. You don\u2019t care about that at all. You hate her and you\u2019re trying to keep me away from her.\u201d She started to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore. I hate it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it! If you don\u2019t move us back to Arizona, I\u2019m moving to France. And not just for the summer.\u201d</p><p>His heart nearly stopped. \u201cWhat? How did this go from you spending the summer in France to you living there for the entire school year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s boyfriend is staying there two more years and he bought a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom will be living in Paris two more years?\u201d</p><p>Sierra nodded. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s fair that I\u2019ll hardly get to see my mom at all in the next two years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving was her choice,\u201d Gavin pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFor a year. I know the custody agreement gets reviewed after my birthday. So if I tell Mom I want to live with her, you know she\u2019ll fight to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>And Ellen would win for all the reasons Sierra had just given him.</p><p>A profound sense of grief choked him. He managed to eke out, \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? To hurt me?\u201d He swallowed. \u201cGuess what, it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Let\u2019s just go back to Arizona. Please.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stared at his child; she was nearly unrecognizable in this state. Beyond stubborn. Almost wild with the need to get her own way. And she always did. He could see everything that he\u2019d ever done for her wasn\u2019t enough. It\u2019d never be enough. In that instant he saw her resemblance to Ellen and it made him nauseous. But how much was his responsibility for letting her become this way?</p><p>\u201cThis discussion is far from over. And don\u2019t think for a second you get to make this decision. I do. Don\u2019t call your mother. I mean it. And I suggest you steer clear of me until I\u2019ve had time to think this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Sierra. You need to back off and leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes in the shower did nothing to clear his head.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t yet noon and he needed a stiff drink.</p><p>So he poured himself one.</p><p>How had he ever thought he\u2019d escape this issue? If someone held a gun to his head and made him answer if Sierra was miserable here, his answer would be no. Living around his family had changed his life. All he\u2019d had in Arizona was his business and his daughter. Looking ahead, in two years Sierra would be in college and he\u2019d be alone. The daily parenting part of his life would be over. That thought had always scared him.</p><p>Now when he looked ahead to the future, he didn\u2019t see emptiness. He saw Rielle.</p><p>He knew Rielle loved him. But how would that change if he walked away? If only for Sierra\u2019s sake, if only for two years?</p><p>Rielle would feel like his second choice. That no matter what, he\u2019d always put his daughter before her. She deserved better than that.</p><p>But how could he, in good conscience, send Sierra off to France? Two weeks with her mother in Arizona had put her right back on the edge of that destructive path. Sierra had taken full advantage of her mother\u2019s need to prove that she was young, hip and cool.</p><p>If he returned to Arizona, he could monitor his daughter for the next two years. Make sure she was being responsible in all aspects of her life. Sierra could choose the college that best suited her, rather than having limited choices because she pissed away two years in another country.</p><p>Did he let his daughter go and let her make her own mistakes?</p><p>Vi popped into his head. Although she avoided calling his birth a mistake, it was. A mistake that changed the course of her young life.</p><p>Would he really have to choose between the stability of his daughter\u2019s life and his life with Rielle?</p><p>Rielle\u2019s arms came around him and he jumped.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I thought you heard me come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sipped his drink.</p><p>\u201cYou never came back outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRan into a little problem with Sierra.\u201d He grunted. \u201cScratch that. A huge fucking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we moved here last year, in a moment of guilt, much like promising her a car, I told Sierra if she hated it, we\u2019d return to Arizona.\u201d</p><p>Rielle stiffened behind him. \u201cYou told her that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromised her that, actually.\u201d</p><p>Her hold tightened on him. \u201cOh, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>The words weren\u2019t meant to chastise him, but somehow they did. \u201cSchool is out. Sierra has decided she\u2019s had enough of Wyoming and is holding me to my promise...by way of a threat. If I refuse to move back to Arizona, she\u2019ll go to France and live with her mother. We revisit the custody agreement this month after Sierra turns seventeen. I know the judge will favor reverting custody to Ellen, given the lack of contact between her and Sierra in the last year. Sierra has a voice in the decision and she will side with her mother.\u201d</p><p>Rielle was quiet. Too quiet. Then she said, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He drained his whiskey and set aside the empty glass. \u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>She stepped in front of him. \u201cGavin. Think about this. You\u2019re giving Sierra all the power here. She\u2019s a sixteen-year-old girl. Can you imagine how difficult she\u2019ll be from here on out if you give in to her threat? You\u2019re her parent. Not her puppet. She\u2019s a child and she\u2019s got way too much control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had control of me since the minute she was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s had your love and support since the minute she was born. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will lose any influence I have over her if I let her move to France. I\u2019ll lose her.\u201d That caused an acute ache. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her not being in my life every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have made your decision,\u201d she stated softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled her to him. \u201cI love you. We have a life here. A life I\u2019m happy with. I don\u2019t want to lose you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will.\u201d</p><p>That startled him. \u201cI will what? Lose you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I love you. I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re in my life. But if you decide to go back to Arizona...then this won\u2019t work. You can assure me it\u2019s only for two years until she graduates from high school, but you\u2019re hoping Sierra goes to ASU. Can you really see yourself leaving Phoenix if she\u2019s still living there? What if she picks a college in California? Will you stay in Phoenix the next four years because it\u2019s so much closer than Wyoming? If Sierra needs you, you can hop on a plane and be at her side in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019d drop everything to be at her beck and call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. You know you\u2019re the same way with Rory.\u201d</p><p>Rielle shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drop everything when she called you last fall, so stressed out about school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different. Rory is an adult. She needs me when she has the occasional breakdown, not every day like Sierra still needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Move to Arizona with me. If you love me and you don\u2019t need to be in Wyoming because Rory is here. We\u2019ll find a place with gardens and you can grow exotic chili peppers. After Sierra graduates, we can return here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove to Arizona? Really, Gavin? How am I supposed to make a living there? You expect me to just walk away from the business I\u2019ve built the last fifteen years? It\u2019s taken me a long time to get to the point that I\u2019m not starving.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to work, Ree. You could take a couple of years off. Do things because they interest you, not because you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the way I live my life and how I make my living. You accepted that about me. I wouldn\u2019t work this hard if I didn\u2019t love it and I know I\u2019d miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you miss me if I wasn\u2019t here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin touched her cheek. \u201cCan\u2019t we start there and find a way to make us work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how. This is a lose-lose situation for both of us. I won\u2019t go to Arizona. And if you don\u2019t go, you\u2019ll resent me for making you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is if I\u2019m willing to compromise for us to be together, that\u2019s fine. But when I ask you to compromise, well, no way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an oversimplified statement,\u201d she argued. \u201cBecause the move to Arizona wouldn\u2019t be based on mutual compromise. The move would be because your daughter threatened you into a decision you didn\u2019t want to make.\u201d</p> <p>Was that really how she saw the situation? Sierra throwing a fit and him just giving in?</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what was happening?</p><p>Rielle retreated. \u201cI love you. I never thought a man like you would ever love me. We\u2019ve had similar parenting styles with our only children. But I\u2019m telling you...please don\u2019t make my mistake. I didn\u2019t see myself as anything but a parent to Rory until I met you. You gave me love and worth as a woman\u2014as your woman. It was hard to tell my daughter, who, yes, had me at her beck and call even as an adult, that I deserved a life outside of being her mother. I\u2019ve embraced it and she didn\u2019t like the change but she\u2019s accepted it. I didn\u2019t have the guts to do that until you came into my life and changed it completely for the better. So don\u2019t wait until Sierra is twenty-four to come to the same realization.\u201d</p><p>Gavin was too stunned to say anything as she walked out and quietly closed the door.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Nine</p><p>Rory knew the instant she\u2019d talked to her mom yesterday that something was wrong. Like horribly wrong.</p> <p>She assumed that fucking McKay bastard had done exactly what she feared\u2014ripped her mom\u2019s heart out and run over it with his goddamned Lexus. So she\u2019d been shocked to hear the McKay male wasn\u2019t causing the problem, but his precious spawn.</p><p>At first her stubborn mother stayed true to her decision to exclude Rory from issues in her relationship with Gavin. But she wasn\u2019t deterred. She adopted her mother\u2019s soothing style of extracting information and her mom finally broke down.</p><p>And Rory had broken down too, silently, on the other end of the phone because she grasped her mom\u2019s dilemma. If the situations had been reversed and Rory had made those demands? Her mom would\u2019ve sided with her\u2014seen to her child\u2019s needs above her own without question. Even right now when her mom was miserable, she wouldn\u2019t fault Gavin if he chose his daughter over her. But hearing her mother cry...Rory wanted to hop in her truck and kick some serious McKay ass\u2014starting with Sierra\u2019s.</p><p>But she\u2019d promised to cover her co-worker\u2019s bar shift last night and she hadn\u2019t left for Sundance until early this morning.</p><p>Upon arriving home, Rory parked her truck at her cabin and skulked through the trees, avoiding her mom as she made a beeline for the house.</p><p>Gavin wasn\u2019t around. Good. That might\u2019ve been awkward, him asking what she was doing there and her answering...I\u2019m here to bust Sierra\u2019s balls.</p><p>Rory knocked on Sierra\u2019s door, but didn\u2019t allow the girl a chance to deny her entrance so she barged right in.</p><p>Sierra sat on her bed, earbuds jammed in her ears and the music cranked so loud Rory heard it by the door. Sierra\u2019s head was back, her eyes closed. A notebook sat on her lap with words scrawled across the page.</p> <p>Rory recognized heartbreak when she saw it. Grabbing the footboard, she jostled the bed.</p><p>Sierra\u2019s eyes flew open. She scrambled out of her slouch, wiped her eyes and pulled out her earbuds. \u201cRory? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame to see my mom. She\u2019s busy making hay while the sun shines, so I thought I\u2019d grab you and we\u2019d go get ice cream or French fries or something equally junky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Let\u2019s go. You can keep me company while I eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory. I\u2019m not dressed, I\u2019m in a shitty mood and I just wanna be left alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit and toughen up, little sister.\u201d She jostled the bed frame again. \u201cMove it.\u201d</p><p>Sierra tossed her iPod aside. \u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, Little Miss Mopey Face. You\u2019re hunched up in your bed, acting like your pet hamster died and I\u2019m PMS-ing for chocolate and grease. I\u2019ve never ridden in your fancy-ass new ride, and since I know how much you love to drive, I\u2019m telling you to get up and chauffer me around, be-yotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Give me a fucking minute.\u201d</p><p>Rory chattered about bullshit on the way to town. College and bartending and guys that\u2019d been sniffing around. Sierra was occupied with driving so she was only half-listening anyway and didn\u2019t suspect a thing.</p><p>At Dairy Queen, Rory went inside to order since Sierra refused to go through the drive-thru. An extra-large fry and two gigantic mocha Moo-lattes later, Rory directed Sierra to drive to Flat Top. If she thought it weird two girls were headed to the local make-out spot, she didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>They sat on the bench overlooking the deep, red-rock rimmed canyon, with prairie on one side and Devil\u2019s Tower on the other. Once they demolished the order of fries\u2014so much for Sierra not being hungry\u2014Rory broached the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo. I guess you won\u2019t be round much longer, huh?\u201d</p><p>Sierra glanced at her sharply and then suspiciously. \u201cDid your mom put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me up to what? Gorging ourselves on junk food? My mom is the prophet of healthy eating, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, did she ask you to take me aside and talk me out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk you out of what? Holding a knife to your dad\u2019s throat and insisting he do what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad said something to you,\u201d Sierra accused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to shock when I called my mom yesterday and she was sobbing so hard I couldn\u2019t understand her.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from Sierra\u2019s face. \u201cWhat? Rielle was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sobbing. Like her heart was breaking and she couldn\u2019t get enough air. There\u2019s a difference between sobbing and merely crying. I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d</p><p>Sierra squirmed. \u201cDid she tell you why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. That your dad was probably leaving her and here for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Sierra protested. \u201cHe can stay here with Rielle if he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he does, you\u2019ll punish him by moving to France with your mother,\u201d Rory pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe promised me if I didn\u2019t like it here we could go home.\u201d</p><p>What a little shit. So self-righteous and involved in her stupid teenage dramas that she couldn\u2019t see the aftershocks of stamping her foot and demanding her way. Rory had been that girl too. But she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d stand by and watch it happen. Her mother had put aside her own life for years to make sure Rory\u2019s life was happy. It was time to pay it back.</p><p>Rory got right in her face. \u201cYou are such a fucking brat, Sierra, I can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d</p><p>Sierra reared back, completely floored.</p><p>\u201cYour dad has done everything for you, sacrificed any kind of personal life, selflessly put up with his ex-wife because he wouldn\u2019t deny you a relationship with your mother. And now, when he\u2019s finally found happiness, when he\u2019s found a woman he loves and who loves him back, when he\u2019s building relationships with the family he didn\u2019t know he had...you\u2019re gonna pull the fucking rug out from under him? You\u2019re essentially saying, Daddy, your life is solely devoted to seeing that my needs are being fully met, one hundred percent of the time and I don\u2019t give a shit about anything else but getting my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so fucking true it makes me sick. You wouldn\u2019t think twice about ruining his relationship with my mom. You\u2019d do it, devastating two people, and then it\u2019d be out of sight, out of mind as you flit off and get your damn nails done.\u201d</p><p>Sierra leapt to her feet. \u201cWhere the fuck do you get off saying that shit to me? You were a total brat to your mom when you found out about her and my dad. You threw a little baby tantrum and stormed off, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was upset, but not because our parents were together. It was something entirely personal on my part and I had to do a shit ton of soul searching to figure out why I felt that way. And I did. Then I mended the rift in my relationship with my mom. I apologized to her. I asked for her forgiveness. I told her I wanted her to be happy because she deserved it. And I meant it. Oh, and I also apologized to your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just supposed to suck it up and be miserable for the next two fucking years until I can escape this godforsaken place and go to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop blaming the way you feel because you\u2019re hating on Wyoming. I know you were just as miserable in Arizona, no matter how you try to paint the desert with rainbows and butterflies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra. You told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me late one night in January. Crying about not fitting in anywhere. You said it didn\u2019t matter where you lived, it was always the same.\u201d</p><p>Sierra looked away. \u201cI\u2019d been drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But it doesn\u2019t make the things you told me any less true,\u201d she said gently. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think moving to France will change anything. Except you\u2019ll be stuck in a foreign country where you don\u2019t speak the language, with no escape. You will have to live with your impulsive, spiteful decision. And I ain\u2019t gonna lie. Part of me hopes you make that choice. A dose of reality would do you good because you don\u2019t understand how good you have it right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sierra paced, acting as if she was contemplating Rory\u2019s words. \u201cYou really think my dad will decide to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. For my mom\u2019s sake and for his.\u201d Rory watched Sierra, so torn; she knew something else was at play. \u201cWhat happened in the last couple of days that made you so eager to leave Sundance immediately?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and studied the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWere you bullied by girls at school? Verbally harassed or physically assaulted or threatened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>An awful thought occurred to her and it wouldn\u2019t go away. \u201cDid a guy touch you in a way you didn\u2019t want to be touched? Or force you? Because if that happened, we can get you help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t raped or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Rory exhaled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to push you, but I know you\u2019re holding something back and I was really scared that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, like you reminded me a few months back, there is some stuff we can\u2019t talk about with our parents, no matter how much we should. I suspect you don\u2019t have many people you can talk to if you\u2019re calling me.\u201d</p><p>Rory waited for Sierra to speak. When several minutes passed and she stayed mum, she pushed her. \u201cSierra. What\u2019s really going on? What couldn\u2019t you tell your dad?\u201d</p><p>Sierra had closed herself off, wrapping her arms around her upper body. \u201cI have\u2014had\u2014two people I can talk to. Marin. But she\u2019s staying at her grandma\u2019s. The other person I could talk to? He left yesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>Sierra had only ever mentioned one guy. \u201cBoone?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>Well that explained a lot. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe joined the army. We\u2019ve hung out so many times and he never...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThen after he told me he was leaving, he said all these things to me...how he felt about me\u2014which I didn\u2019t know\u2014and he kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he left and it hurts! It pisses me off and I can\u2019t stop crying. I want to leave. I want to put him behind me, put this whole year behind me and start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t be starting over if you went back to Arizona,\u201d Rory pointed out. \u201cDo you think you could start over in France?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p><p>Rory let her settle before she spoke. \u201cCan I give you some advice, little sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChange yourself, not your location.\u201d</p><p>Sierra looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let things happen to you instead of making them happen for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the same way. Or I was. You didn\u2019t confront your dad about the stuff that was bugging you last fall. You made me do it. I went through this too, learning to be assertive without changing who you are inside, so listen to me.\u201d Rory tucked a strand of hair behind Sierra\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019re a fun, smart, funny and sweet girl\u2014when you\u2019re not being a total brat.\u201d</p><p>Sierra gave her a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cFor some reason, you hide that. Don\u2019t. Be proud of who you are.\u201d Then Rory laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just realized I\u2019m telling you to act like a McKay.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in Sierra\u2019s eyes again.</p><p>What was up with that?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a pack of friends, okay? If you have one good friend, one you can talk to, one who can talk to you, one you have fun with...then count yourself blessed. There are a lot of lonely people in the world who don\u2019t even have that, to say nothing of all the people you have in your life who love you. The McKays may annoy me to no freakin\u2019 end, but if you called any of them and told them you were having troubles, they\u2019d all be there for you in a heartbeat. I think you know that.\u201d</p><p>A full minute passed before Sierra spoke. \u201cSo if you were me, Rory, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Boone West or the memory of Boone West fuck up my life any more than he already has. Move on. Use his leaving as a chance to make yourself stronger, not let it weaken you further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is the best compliment you could ever give me.\u201d</p><p>Sierra paced in her room after her conversation with Rory. She hadn\u2019t seen her dad since the blowup yesterday morning and she missed him.</p><p>You\u2019ll miss him a lot more if you move to France.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d walked out, telling her that he didn\u2019t want to deal with her, Sierra knew she\u2019d screwed up bad. Like usual, she\u2019d said the first shitty thing that popped into her head. Lashing out because she hurt. Knowing exactly to what to say to her dad to make him hurt. Twisting the circumstances\u2014not telling her dad the real reason she wanted to leave because he wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>After what\u2019d happened with Boone, she\u2019d spent the whole night cursing him, cursing herself, cursing this stupid town. She\u2019d called her mom and cried for over an hour, telling her about Boone\u2014things she\u2019d never told anyone. And her mom had been so sweet, not offering some snarky advice but really listening to her. Then her mom urged her to visit her in France, not in her usual manipulative way, but because she missed her daughter and then Sierra couldn\u2019t see anything beyond just getting the hell out of Wyoming.</p><p>Her mom had no idea she\u2019d given her dad an ultimatum. Now she\u2019d dug herself into a hole. She couldn\u2019t march into her dad\u2019s office and say, \u201cJust kidding! I don\u2019t want to go back to Arizona... By the way, what\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p><p>This time she\u2019d gone beyond crying to get her way. This time her rash response was having life changing repercussions because hers wasn\u2019t the only life that would be affected.</p><p>She flopped on the bed and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>Every sickening thing Rory had thrown at her was true. But Rory was mistaken if she believed Sierra hadn\u2019t already recognized those nasty truths about her childish behavior. But she was stuck. She couldn\u2019t talk to her dad. And she was so embarrassed by what she\u2019d said and done that she just wanted to hide in her room and hope all this shit blew over.</p><p>It\u2019d serve her right if her dad called her bluff and shipped her off to France.</p><p>Her mom would be happy. She\u2019d sent Sierra three emails in the last day, begging her to come and stay in Paris. One thing she hadn\u2019t lied about during the big blow up was that she missed her mom. Yes, sometimes her mom acted ridiculously self-centered\u2014now Sierra understood where that trait came from in her own knee-jerk responses\u2014but other times, her mom was thoughtful, honest and helpful and she understood her in ways that her dad never would.</p><p>Divorce sucked. It\u2019d turned her dad completely against her mom. He always pointed out her mother\u2019s worst qualities and didn\u2019t see her good side. He claimed she didn\u2019t have a good side but it was there. Maybe Sierra wished it were there more often, but it was there.</p><p>Her stomach growled. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything except French fries and a bag of chips she\u2019d found during her packing frenzy. But she was too much of a chickenshit to go into the kitchen in case she ran into Rielle. What could she possibly say to her after what she\u2019d done? Thinking about it made her sick to her stomach all over again.</p><p>Her cell phone buzzed on her desk and she rolled to her feet. Why was Marin was calling her? \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Sierra? I get a text from you that says you\u2019re moving? What\u2019s that bullshit about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t send you a text!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah you did. Two hours ago. It says, and I quote, please try and talk me out of moving away forever.\u201d</p><p>Rory. That sneaky bitch. She\u2019d asked to see Sierra\u2019s iPhone under the pretext of buying one and used it to send Marin a text.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big mess, Marin. It\u2019s my fault and I don\u2019t know where to start. I don\u2019t know if I can fix it.\u201d She started to cry again. \u201cI just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop crying. Get in your car and meet me at the football field.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sniffled. \u201cWhat? I thought you were at your grandma\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I could stay there after my best friend texted me that she\u2019s moving away? I oughta bitch slap you for even thinking I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>That brought tears to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still may bitch slap you. And you cannot move away. We have plans for junior year, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Uh. No. I think you made plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich always includes you, duh. Anyway, get to the football field.\u201d The line cut out but Marin\u2019s next words were loud and clear. \u201cFriends help each other out. They listen to each other. They\u2019re there for each other. Whatever happened...we\u2019ll find a way to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Sierra didn\u2019t get her hopes up about that, but she snuck out of the house and drove into town anyway.</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Gavin needed someone to talk to.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t quite sure why Vi was the first person who\u2019d come to mind. Maybe because her kids were grown and she\u2019d lived through the turbulent teen years. Maybe because she\u2019d listen and offer her unvarnished advice.</p><p>Or maybe because she\u2019s your mother.</p><p>She met him on the porch. She wore a straw hat, her World\u2019s Greatest Grandma sweatshirt from Sierra and jeans\u2014which shocked him. He\u2019d never seen Vi in jeans.</p><p>She inspected him head to toe. \u201cAt least you\u2019re wearing decent shoes. I thought we could walk a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my favorite thinking spot.\u201d She laughed when Gavin wrinkled his nose. \u201cCow shit will wash right off those loafers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>She sobered quickly. \u201cGavin. Sweetheart. You look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel like it too.\u201d</p> <p>She handed him a bottle of water. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>They cut through the first pasture and followed the fence line up a steep incline. Gavin found himself studying the ground, seeing the variances in grass and the occasional wildflower. Gray rocks popped up and sagebrush abounded. But the only scent carried on the wind was manure and a hint of Vi\u2019s perfume.</p><p>They stopped at the apex of the rise. The land spread out in a carpet of green, which he knew would only last a few more weeks if it didn\u2019t rain soon. The view wasn\u2019t a breathtaking vista. No steep canyons. Just a view of rangeland. Simple. Timeless.</p><p>Two chunks of rock, embedded in the earth about six feet apart rose up like stone pillars. The heights were nearly identical and someone had placed a foot wide piece of wood across the top.</p><p>\u201cSo, you come here often?\u201d</p> <p>Vi snorted. \u201cOften enough. Something about this place helps me sort stuff out.\u201d She uncapped her water bottle and drank. \u201cI figured it might work for you too. So, son, you wanna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Gavin intended to give her the basics. But for some reason, everything just poured out. Everything he was thinking, feeling and he didn\u2019t bother to filter any of it.</p><p>She mulled over his words for a good long while before she said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a shocker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say it\u2019s knocked me on my ass is putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re talking to me about this because you want my...insight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Sierra has overstepped her bounds. But she won\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s used to getting her way. Is she forcing this on you maliciously? No. She is a sweet girl. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d done anything wrong. Teens are notoriously self-absorbed. Her rationalization is that this behavior has always gotten her what she wants in the past and she doesn\u2019t know any other way to be at sixteen. However, she is using manipulation and you cannot give in to it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin faced her to argue.</p><p>\u201cHear me out completely before you jump in. You\u2019re a good father. But that is not all you are. You are a good man who deserves what you\u2019ve found with Rielle.\u201d She smiled a little devilishly. \u201cBetween us? For a few years I thought Ben and Rielle would get together. Until I realized she\u2019d never let him boss her around the way he likes to.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his water.</p><p>Vi patted him on the back. \u201cYou and Rielle complement each other. You\u2019re both stubborn enough and set enough in your ways that you won\u2019t settle for the first warm body that walks through your door. I\u2019ve known Rielle a lot of years. She was content. But when I see her with you? She\u2019s happy in a way I haven\u2019t seen. You, my dear boy, are the same way with her. Why on earth would you give that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s simple. Don\u2019t. Tell Sierra you\u2019re sorry she\u2019s so miserable here and you only want her happiness. So if that means her skipping off to France, then bon voyage.\u201d</p><p>Somehow he kept his jaw from dropping. \u201cYou think it\u2019s that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens no. But she\u2019s the one who put you in this position. Remember she\u2019s not making it easy on you. She\u2019ll make mistakes whether she\u2019s here, Arizona, France or Timbuktu. Some you\u2019ll even know about. You can\u2019t protect her from everything. And she\u2019ll never learn to protect herself if you\u2019re always there to do it for her.\u201d Vi took a long pull from her water bottle. \u201cDoes that sound harsh? Who would ship a sixteen-year-old off to handle things by herself?\u201d</p><p>Light bulb moment. \u201cYour father did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a parallel I was trying to make, believe it or not. Your biggest worry is that Sierra will go off the rails in France if you\u2019re not there to stop the train. Don\u2019t look at it that way. Look at it as you\u2019re telling her that yes, if she really wants to go to France, then you\u2019re trusting her to make the right choices once she gets there.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, a huge weight fell off his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss her. That\u2019s part of the guilt. The other part is that you\u2019re consciously choosing to do something that\u2019ll be good for you at the expense of what might be best for your child. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a brand new feeling for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can live with either decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know how that feels, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin took a breath to ask the question Vi had been expecting for a long time. \u201cDo you regret your decision to give me up for adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery single day of my life. Would I do things differently?\u201d Vi looked right into his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That answer didn\u2019t sting as much as he thought it would. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I would\u2019ve been a terrible mother at that time in my life. As much as I ached that you were gone, I would\u2019ve resented you if you\u2019d been there.\u201d Vi reached for his hand. \u201cCan you imagine Sierra with a baby right now?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d tried to look at it from that angle and the image never jelled. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAs irresponsible as you think Sierra acts sometimes? Multiply that by ten and you\u2019ll get me\u2014Violet Louise Bennett\u2014at that age. A na\u00efve rebel. Sneaking out at night, gloating I was oh-so-mature having sex with an older guy like Charlie McKay. Then the next morning after my secret rendezvous? My mother had my breakfast on the table. My lunch packed for school. She\u2019d probably ironed my clothes. I was a child. I had no idea how to be a mother because I didn\u2019t see my mother. She was there to do things for me. So I\u2019ll admit, it was selfish of me to give you up. But at that time in my life? I didn\u2019t know any other way to be.\u201d</p><p>An almost thoughtful silence lingered between them.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t blame your father?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is that...side of the issue. Yes, my father made the decision to send me to the unwed mother\u2019s home. He knew once I was living with other girls in my condition, I\u2019d follow the herd mentality. And I did. But that just strengthens my point. I didn\u2019t have a backbone to stand up for myself, let alone stand up for a child I\u2019d be responsible for, for the next eighteen or so years.\u201d</p><p>Gavin blew out a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I thought of you the day Sierra was born. Not in a good way. I wondered what type of woman could look at a baby and say, take it away, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to that. I don\u2019t know if I can ever explain my mindset at that time to your satisfaction, Gavin. Adopted kids, no matter how happy their childhoods with their adoptive parents, are resentful on some level. I talked to a counselor about that when I needed an unbiased opinion on how to handle you either being in our lives or not being in our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw a counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This hasn\u2019t been easy on me, or on your father. Let me ask you a hypothetical question. If you would\u2019ve tracked me down and discovered I\u2019d married another man, and had children with him, would you feel differently? Instead of knowing I went back to your father and had three other sons with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Because I\u2019m odd man out in any family situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it feels like that to you, but it doesn\u2019t to the rest of us. Especially not to me. I finally feel like my family is complete.\u201d</p><p>Gavin processed that. His family had accepted him with open arms and hearts. He liked them and his life was better for all of them being part of it. He didn\u2019t want to give that up either.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re wondering how this situation with Sierra popped up from out of nowhere. I think I can shed some light on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Did she call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I talked to Carolyn today and she mentioned that Boone West just up and joined the army. He left for basic training yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Gavin briefly closed his eyes. \u201cNow it makes sense. She met Boone the night before last. The next morning she was packed and ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoone must\u2019ve told her that night he was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would she throw her life into upheaval over some boy?\u201d Why wouldn\u2019t she tell me?</p><p>Vi patted his leg. \u201cGavin. Sweetie. You aren\u2019t that clueless. Think about what you just said.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBut she and Boone weren\u2019t even dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean Sierra didn\u2019t feel something for him. Something big. Something that crushed her entire world when he took it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...love? For Christsake. She\u2019s sixteen years old! How can she possibly know what real and lasting love is at that age?\u201d</p><p>Vi remained quiet and a little stoic.</p><p>Gavin knew he\u2019d stepped in it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t get it. I never had that feeling until Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel that way about Ellen when you first met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. What happened after we got married tainted any good memories I had of her or us.\u201d Gavin let out a slow breath. \u201cCan you please explain this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie, I can\u2019t. Because no matter how well I explain it, you\u2019ve never experienced it so you won\u2019t understand. I knew Charlie was the one for me at that same age. Charlie knew I was the one for him. Same with Quinn and Libby. To some extent, it\u2019s the same with Tell and Georgia. The gut feeling that you\u2019ve met the person who is the one for you is powerful and it\u2019s very real.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s more than Sierra throwing her life and everyone else\u2019s into upheaval over some boy. She\u2019s devastated in a way you can\u2019t understand. Not only has she lost him, she\u2019s lost the potential of anything ever happening between them. It\u2019s not trivial to her. So please, whatever you decide to do, don\u2019t discount how serious this is to her. If you do, it will change your relationship with her\u2014not in a good way. Especially since she hasn\u2019t felt comfortable telling you the real reason for wanting to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove her. But be ready to let her go. She\u2019ll come back to you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin impulsively gave her a hug. \u201cThanks. You have no idea how much it means...how much I...\u201d Just tell her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been there for me every time I\u2019ve needed you in the last year and you didn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p> <p>Vi smiled. \u201cI am a little persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been an ass to you. And I appreciate that you don\u2019t let my shitty behavior slide. Christ, I\u2019m a grown man who\u2019s supposed to know better. Then I hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head telling me to knock it off. I think the reason I\u2019m so reserved with you is I\u2019m constantly reminding myself that I can\u2019t like you because it feels disloyal to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were close to her, Gavin, and I\u2019m not looking to replace her. That\u2019s never been my intent. She raised you to be a good man. That was all her doing. I\u2019m grateful to her, because she loved you enough to send you back to us.\u201d</p><p>That choked him up a little.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSo where does this leave us now that we\u2019ve had this overdue discussion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can move on. The truth is I like you, Vi. A lot. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in my life. Charlie too. So I\u2019m, ah...working on the loving you part, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. In the meantime I\u2019ll love you enough for both of us.\u201d She patted his cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s stop with this mushy stuff. Let\u2019s go back to the house. I baked a pie in my new oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomemade crust?\u201d</p><p>She peered over the tops of her glasses. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>Gavin tracked Rielle to the garden. But she wasn\u2019t on her hands and knees in the dirt. She rested her forearms across the top of the fence and stared at the recently planted alfalfa field across the road.</p><p>He took a moment just to watch her, the beautiful, amazing woman he\u2019d fallen in love with. He\u2019d made his decision after talking to Vi, but being here, seeing her, just cemented it.</p> <p>Rielle finally noticed him. She smiled uncertainly. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He walked to the fence. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you immersed yourself in dirt therapy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to...but even that isn\u2019t working. I\u2019ve been wandering. Aimlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you seem lost in thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just feeling a little lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRee. Honey. I\u2019ve always been a little lost...and then I found you.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze bored into his. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a decision.\u201d</p><p>Gavin didn\u2019t see a reason to drag it out. \u201cYes. I\u2019m staying in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Sierra?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wanted you to know first. So you understand you\u2019re my first choice. Not out of guilt or manipulation, but out of love. We have something I never thought I\u2019d find and I\u2019m not walking away from it. I\u2019m not walking away from you.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her dusty gloves on his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re serious? I...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cYou should know I was out there wrestling with whether I could leave the only place I\u2019ve ever known and move to Arizona. And the answer was yes.\u201d She pressed her mouth to his so decisively he had to grin. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to be with you. This chunk of dirt has mattered to me for so long, but it\u2019s nothing compared to how much you matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, woman, you undo me.\u201d He touched her dirt-smudged cheek. \u201cHowever, since we\u2019re agreed this is forever, you will marry me. You don\u2019t have to take my name, you don\u2019t have to be on my bank accounts, but I want you to be my wife. Mine. As soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cThat was the shittiest proposal I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019m not exactly Mr. Romance.\u201d He looked at her shrewdly. \u201cIs that what you want? Me on bended knee? Because I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. I\u2019m good with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. And I have a demand as well.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cI want my damn bedroom back. We can keep your big bed, but the rest of that ugly bachelor shit has got to go, since your bachelor days will be behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d He leaned closer to nuzzle her neck. \u201cHow about if we go inside and seal this marriage deal on that big bed.\u201d He kissed behind her ear. \u201cI missed you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. As I laid alone in my room I kept thinking this would be my life if you weren\u2019t in it. I never want that feeling again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please put me out of my misery and leap over that fence so I can touch you?\u201d</p><p>Rielle climbed up the rails and threw her leg over.</p><p>Gavin braced himself to catch her, but when she scaled over the top, she knocked him off balance and they both crashed to the ground with Rielle on top.</p><p>She grinned at him and waggled her eyebrows. \u201cWell, well, this is an interesting possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d Gavin rolled, putting her beneath him. Just as he\u2019d settled into a loving kiss, pounding footsteps came down the walkway.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Seriously? You guys are doing it out here in the dirt practically on the front yard where anyone can drive by and see?\u201d</p><p>And...there was a verbal equivalent of a cold shower.</p><p>He pushed up and helped Rielle to her feet.</p><p>They faced Sierra together.</p><p>Sierra\u2019s eyes darted to Rielle and then back to him. \u201cDad, I know you said you didn\u2019t want to talk to me and I should stay away from you until you made your decision, but can we ah...talk about some stuff? Alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Whatever you want to talk about will affect Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sierra shoved her hands in the front pockets of her shorts. \u201cSorry I\u2019ve been a jerk.\u201d</p><p>He waited because that pseudo-apology wouldn\u2019t fly and she knew it.</p><p>\u201cI was a total dick, okay? I said a bunch of horrible shit I didn\u2019t mean. God, I\u2019m so sorry and I don\u2019t know why I keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re sixteen.</p><p>\u201cI was hurt and mad and I took it out on you.\u201d</p><p>I keep hoping one of these days you\u2019ll figure out that lashing out and hurting those you love doesn\u2019t make you feel better. He\u2019d done this over her teen years, not answering her questions out loud but in his head; it allowed him to speak his mind without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cI...some stuff happened that I didn\u2019t know how to handle and I couldn\u2019t think of anything besides I wanted to go home.\u201d She kicked a rock. \u201cI wanted my mom.\u201d</p><p>Gavin wondered why Sierra had such a hard time admitting it.</p><p>Because sometimes you don\u2019t curb your dislike of her mother and she picks up on that.</p><p>She looked at Rielle. \u201cI like you a lot, Ree. In fact, I love you more than a little. You\u2019ve never tried to be my mom, but you\u2019ve always been there for me. Even before you and my dad started being...whatever. So when I was hiding in my room, I wished I could talk to you, because you listen until I figure stuff out on my own. Then I realized how much I\u2019d hurt you and that I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you never wanted to talk to me again.\u201d She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Really, really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Sierra was back to staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cSierra? Can you look at me please?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d came out softly.</p><p>He wanted to go to her, and Rielle even relaxed her hold on him so he could, but he forced himself to let his daughter struggle a little. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was awful to you. Making demands. Being mouthy, hurting your feelings, not caring about anyone but myself. I\u2019m sorry. So, so, sorry and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever...\u201d</p><p>When Sierra broke down completely, that\u2019s when Gavin went to her. That\u2019s when he pulled her into his arms and let her cry it out, holding her tightly. Listening to her babbling about acting stupid again.</p><p>She calmed down but her arms were squeezed around him. \u201cI love you, Dad. I\u2019m sorry I was such a selfish, bratty kid.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI love you too. Yes, you\u2019re bratty and selfish sometimes, but not all the time, so I\u2019ll keep you.\u201d He felt Rielle\u2019s hand on his arm, silently offering her support. He glanced at her, standing beside him, where she belonged.</p><p>Sierra stepped back and wiped her face. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve had time to think, and I still want to go to France.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s heart broke, just a little. \u201cAll right. If that\u2019s your choice, you should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just for part of the summer,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cMaybe six weeks. I do want to spend time with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. She\u2019ll be thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when I get back? Before school starts? I\u2019d like to talk to you about some changes. See, Marin and I were talking about this stuff today after Rory chewed my butt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you talk to Rory?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cThis morning. We went to DQ and then up to Flat Top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s in the kitchen. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>Rielle shook her head. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically she told me I was a whiny-ass spoiled baby and to knock it off and think of someone besides myself for a change.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Gavin kept his jaw from hitting the dirt.</p><p>\u201cWhen I talked to Marin she said the same thing; quit acting so childish and selfish.\u201d Sierra snorted. \u201cWhich is kinda funny because she begged me not to move and that was selfish of her, but whatever.\u201d</p><p>Gavin had agonized over the decision for a solid day. He hadn\u2019t slept or eaten...and all it\u2019d taken to change Sierra\u2019s mind were Rory and Marin telling her...to grow up and not act spoiled? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unbelievable.</p><p>That was parenting\u2014he could talk until he was blue in the face and then one of her friends would made the same suggestion he had and suddenly...wow, that was the best idea in the history of the world.</p><p>But he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t complain that his daughter had come to the right decision, regardless of how it\u2019d come about.</p> <p>\u201cDad? Are you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Can you give me an idea on what you want to talk about when you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...I want to try out for the cheerleading team. That\u2019ll mean practices after school and cheering at games on the weekends and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds doable, as long as Doc Monroe gives you the okay and you keep your grades up.\u201d He could tell she wanted to roll her eyes\u2014bonus points for her for resisting.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I want to get a job. Either one that pays me or doing volunteer work. Marin pointed out that I sounded so entitled whenever I complained I was bored. So we\u2019re gonna try and get jobs at Dairy Queen because that\u2019s where everyone goes.\u201d</p> <p>Sounded like Marin had put the screws to his headstrong daughter and he reminded himself peer pressure was sometimes a good thing. \u201cI\u2019d agree to that, but the same rule about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grades applies, yeah, I get it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s plenty to keep you from being bored first semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something else I\u2019d like to do and it\u2019s a pretty big thing.\u201d Sierra jammed her hands further into her pockets. \u201cI want to legally change my last name to McKay. When I was doing research on the McKays...it just clicked that it was my heritage. No offense, but I didn\u2019t know your dad, so his last name means nothing to me, especially since you were adopted. But I do know what Grandpa Charlie means to me. The McKay name means something around here. That\u2019s who I\u2019m part of. And I want everyone to know it. Besides, most the people in my school already call me McKay anyway.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, but oddly pleased, he hugged her. \u201cSweetheart. If that\u2019s really what you want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I want to make it Grandpa\u2019s birthday present. So I\u2019ll tell him first, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d He brushed her hair from her cheek. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I want a pony.\u201d</p><p>Gavin snorted. \u201cNice try, but no.\u201d</p><p>Sierra grinned. \u201cI thought I\u2019d give it a shot.\u201d Then she paused. \u201cSo, are we okay?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked at Rielle. \u201cAre we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, yes. But your dad and I have something else to discuss with you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Oh, the other reason I came outside, besides Rory nagging me to freakin\u2019 death about marching down here and facing the music, was to tell you that your martini is done. She said to hurry up because she didn\u2019t like drinking alone. But I told her it might be a while because I had groveling to do. A lot of groveling to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind did she make?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI volunteered to taste test it, but she turned me down. Then she snapped me in the butt with a towel and told me to get my ass moving. She\u2019s so bossy. I\u2019ll tell her you\u2019re both on your way.\u201d Sierra jogged up the driveway. Sadie and Jingle came from out of nowhere and ran alongside her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re already fighting like sisters,\u201d Rielle said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cDoes that make you happy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVery. But there\u2019s gonna be some fireworks when they start advising me about my wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just sneak off to Vegas and get married?\u201d</p><p>Rielle shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019d never forgive us if they didn\u2019t get to be part of the wedding. Heck, they\u2019ll plan the whole damn thing, most likely.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of wedding we have, just as long as our daughters aren\u2019t part of the honeymoon planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So the tycoon won\u2019t mind if it\u2019s an old-fashioned country wedding\u2014held in the barn, with hay bales for pews, followed by a hoe-down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ll even wear a bolo tie, a Stetson, Wranglers and shitkickers if you want.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI like you a little country, but that sexy citified vibe does it for me in a bad way, so I definitely want you in a black tuxedo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Gavin kissed her again. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the honeymoon. I want to take you someplace exotic. For at least two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019ll insist on paying for it entirely?\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cThat is not even up for discussion. And trust me, it\u2019s going to be spectacular. I won\u2019t spare any expense when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of...\u201d Rielle poked him in the chest. \u201cYou\u2019d better not buy me some big tacky diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTacky? Never. I have great taste. Big? Absolutely. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019ll be at least seven carats.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of carrots,\u201d they said in unison, and laughed in unison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re such punny dorks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Gavin pulled her into his arms and rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI love everything about you, Ree. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I love everything about you too.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Gavin plucked her up and swung her in a circle until she shrieked at him to let her down. He whispered, \u201cNever,\u201d and carried her home. </p> </body></html>"]
