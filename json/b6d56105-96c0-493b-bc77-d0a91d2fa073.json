He laughed at the very idea, but was intrigued. He\u2019d been waiting patiently for an assignment to a church of his own and thought it couldn\u2019t hurt to take a look at the place himself. If nothing else, it would be a good excuse to get out of town for a day and see something different. He\u2019d heard Northern California was very beautiful.</p><p>The first thing that struck him was the overwhelming beauty of the mountains, redwoods and rivers. The town was a little washed out and the church was a wreck, but there was a peacefulness and simplicity there he couldn\u2019t dismiss. Or forget. It seemed uncomplicated, fresh.</p><p>No one really noticed him in the little town; the local men he\u2019d seen either had hair shorn in military fashion or ponytails and beards, just like the fishermen Noah had worked with over the years. He fit right in\u2014he wore scuffed boots, his jeans were almost white with wear, ripped here and there, his denim shirt was thin on the elbows and frayed around the collar and cuffs. His black hair was too long and curled over his collar; he planned to get it cut the second he was assigned a church of his own. But for now, he fit right in, looking like any other laborer after a hard day\u2019s work. He was fit and toned like the local Virgin River men; years of working on a fishing boat and dockside, dragging nets, hauling in tons of fresh catch will do that.</p> <p>The church had been easy to locate and he hadn\u2019t needed a key to get inside\u2014it was boarded up and appeared to have been abandoned for years, but the side door wasn\u2019t locked. The place had been stripped bare and filled with years of trash, probably litter from transients who\u2019d taken shelter there at one time or another. Almost all the windows had been broken before being covered over with plywood. But when he got to the sanctuary, he discovered a stunning stained-glass window, boarded from the outside to keep it safe. It had been left untouched.</p><p>Afterward, he had driven the neighborhoods in town, which hadn\u2019t taken long, had a cup of coffee at the only eating establishment, snapped a few digital pictures and left. When he got back to Seattle he contacted the woman who was auctioning the church on eBay, Hope McCrea. \u201cThat church has been boarded up for years,\u201d she said in her gravelly voice. \u201cThis town has been without religion a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure the town is in need of religion?\u201d Noah asked her.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely sure,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut it could damn sure use some faith. That church needs to be opened up or razed to the ground. An empty church is bad mojo.\u201d</p><p>Noah couldn\u2019t agree more.</p> <p>Despite being busy at the college where he taught, Noah couldn\u2019t get Virgin River, or that church, out of his mind.</p><p>He took the idea of buying the church to the presbytery and found they were already well aware of its existence. He showed them his digital pictures and they agreed, there was great potential. Placing a minister there appealed to them; the population was just the right size to build a congregation and it was the only church in town. But the renovation, not to mention the accoutrements, would put the costs too high. There was no way they had the budget. They thanked Noah sincerely and promised him he would get his own church real soon.</p><p>What the presbytery didn\u2019t know was that Noah had recently come into some money. To him, a small fortune. He was thirty-five and since the age of eighteen had been slaving and studying. While attending the university, he\u2019d worked on boats, docks and in fish markets out of the Port of Seattle. A year ago his mother had passed and, to his surprise, had left him a hefty portion of her inheritance.</p><p>So, he offered to lighten the presbytery\u2019s financial burden by taking on the renovation costs of the church as a donation if they would see fit to assign him as the pastor. The proposal was an appealing one for the Presbyterian church.</p><p>Before closing the deal, Noah called his closest friend, and the man responsible for talking him into the seminary in the first place. George Davenport thought he\u2019d lost his mind. George was a retired Presbyterian minister who had been teaching for the last fifteen years at Seattle Pacific University. \u201cI can think of a thousand ways for you to throw away that money,\u201d George had said. \u201cGo to Las Vegas, put it all on red. Or finance your own mission to Mexico. If those people needed a pastor, they\u2019d go looking for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny that church is still standing there, useless, like it\u2019s waiting for a rebirth. There must be a reason I happened to see it on eBay,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at eBay before in my life.\u201d</p> <p>After much debate, George conceded, \u201cIf it\u2019s structurally sound and the price is right, it might work out. You\u2019d get a big tax write-off with the donated renovation cost, and a chance to serve a small, poor congregation in a hick mountain town that doesn\u2019t get cell-phone reception. Sounds perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no congregation, George,\u201d Noah reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to gather one, son. If anyone can do it, you can. You were born to do it, and before you get all insulted, I\u2019m not talking about your DNA. I\u2019m talking about pure talent. I\u2019ve seen the way you sell fish, I always thought there was a message there. Go\u2014it\u2019s what you want. Open your doors and your heart and give it all you\u2019ve got. Besides, you\u2019re the only ordained minister I know who has two nickels to rub together.\u201d</p><p>So Noah inked the deal with the presbytery and hoped his mother wasn\u2019t spinning in her grave. Truth be told, she\u2019d always quietly supported him when, years back, he had been determined as hell to run away from the ministry. She had good reason. Noah\u2019s father was a powerful, semifamous televangelist\u2014and a cold, controlling man. Noah had run away while his mother could not.</p><p>If someone had told Noah seventeen years ago, when he fled his father\u2019s house at the age of eighteen, that he would one day be a preacher himself, he\u2019d have laughed in their face. Yet here he was. And he wanted that church. That wreck of a church in that peaceful, uncomplicated mountain town.</p><p>Several weeks later Noah was in his fifteen-year-old RV, which would be his home for a good long time, towing his twenty-year-old faded-blue Ford truck. En route to Northern California, he called George\u2019s office, placing the call from his cell phone before the signal was lost in the mountains and tall trees. \u201cI\u2019m on my way into Virgin River, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, boy\u2014how does it feel?\u201d George asked with a deep chuckle in his voice. \u201cLike you pulled off the sweetheart deal of the century, or like you\u2019ll be dead broke and out in the street before you know what hit you?\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cNot sure. I\u2019ll be tapped out by the time the church is presentable. If I can\u2019t drum up a congregation, I could be back in Seattle throwing fish before you know it,\u201d he said, referring to an old job of his working the fish market on Seattle\u2019s downtown wharf. He\u2019d literally thrown large fish across the market. It had been like theater and it was where George had discovered him. \u201cI\u2019ll get started on the improvements right away and trust the presbytery won\u2019t leave me out in the cold if no one shows up to services. I mean, if you can\u2019t trust the church...\u201d</p> <p>That comment was answered with George\u2019s hearty laughter. \u201cThey\u2019re the last ones I\u2019d trust. Those Presbyterians think too much! I know I wasn\u2019t keen on this idea at first, Noah, but I wish you well,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you for taking a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, George. I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d George said soberly. \u201cGood luck, son. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>It was the first of July when Noah rattled into Virgin River and pulled right up to the church. Parked there was a big old Suburban with the wheels jacked up and covered with mud. Standing beside it was a tiny old woman with wiry white hair and big glasses, a cigarette hanging from her lips. She wore great big tennis shoes that didn\u2019t look as if they\u2019d ever been white and, although it was summer, she had on a jacket with torn pockets. When he parked and got out of his RV, she tossed the cigarette to the ground and stomped it out. One of Virgin River\u2019s stunning beauties, he thought wryly.</p><p>\u201cReverend Kincaid, I presume?\u201d she said.</p><p>From the look on her face, Noah assumed she was expecting someone a bit more refined. Maybe someone who dressed in khakis and a crisp white button-down? Shiny loafers? Neatly trimmed hair? Clean shaven at least? His hair was shaggy, his whiskers itchy, and he had a healthy bit of motor oil on his jeans, a result of a stop a hundred miles back when he\u2019d had to work on the RV. \u201cMrs. McCrea,\u201d he answered, putting out his hand.</p><p>She shook it briefly, then put the keys in his palm. \u201cWelcome. Would you like a tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need keys?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe building wasn\u2019t locked the last time I was here. I looked it over pretty thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d she asked, clearly startled.</p><p>\u201cSure did. I took a run down here before placing a bid on behalf of the Presbyterian church. The door wasn\u2019t locked so I helped myself. All the presbytery really needed from you was the engineer\u2019s report on the building\u2019s structural competence. I gave them lots of pictures.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her oversize glasses up on her nose. \u201cWhat are you, a minister or some kind of secret agent?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cDid you think the presbytery bought it on faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t see any other possibility. Well, if you\u2019re all set, let\u2019s go in to Jack\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s time for my drink. Doctor\u2019s orders. I\u2019ll front you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the doctor order the smokes, too?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn straight, sonny. Don\u2019t start on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta meet this doctor,\u201d Noah muttered, following her.</p><p>Hope stopped abruptly, looked at him over her shoulder as she adjusted her jacket and said, \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d And with that she turned and stomped into Jack\u2019s bar.</p><p>Noah had only been in town a couple of days before the need for cleaning supplies sent him in the direction of Fortuna. The narrow, winding mountain roads led him toward the freeway, and he marveled that he had managed to get his RV to Virgin River at all, especially while towing his truck. He wasn\u2019t quite halfway to Fortuna before he had his first lesson in how dramatically different mountain life was from life in the city, the campus and the Seattle wharf.</p><p>He spied a motionless animal by the side of the road and by pure coincidence there was a wide space on the shoulder just ahead. He pulled over and got out of his truck. When he was within a few feet, he realized it was a dog; perhaps some family pet. He went closer. Flies were buzzing around the animal and some of its fur looked shiny with blood, but Noah detected a slight movement. He crouched near the dog, whose eyes were open and tongue hanging out of its parted mouth. The animal was breathing, but clearly near death. The condition of the poor beast tore at his heart.</p><p>Just then, an old truck pulled up and parked behind Noah\u2019s vehicle and a man got out. Noah took him for a farmer or rancher; he wore jeans, boots, a cowboy hat, and walked with a hitch that suggested a sore back. \u201cGot a problem there, bud?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Noah looked at him over his shoulder. \u201cDog,\u201d he said. \u201cHit by a car, I guess. And a while ago. But it\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>The rancher crouched and took a closer look. \u201cHmmph,\u201d he grunted. He stood. \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Noah waved away the flies and gave the dog\u2019s head and neck a stroke. \u201cEasy now\u2014help\u2019s on the way.\u201d He was still stroking the dog\u2019s neck when the man\u2019s boots came into view beside him, as well as the business end of a rifle, aimed at the dog\u2019s chest. \u201cMight want to move back, son,\u201d the man said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Noah shouted, pushing the rifle away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put that poor creature out of its misery,\u201d the man said in a tone that indicated he found the question ludicrous. \u201cWhat else you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it to a vet,\u201d Noah said, standing. \u201cMaybe it can be helped!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuddy, look at that dog. It\u2019s emaciated, pretty much starved. That animal was half-dead before a car hit it. Wouldn\u2019t be right to leave it to lie here, dying.\u201d He aimed again.</p><p>Again Noah pushed the rifle away. \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest vet?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. If the vet can\u2019t help it, he can euthanize the dog without blowing it apart.\u201d</p><p>The rancher scratched his chin and shook his head. \u201cNathaniel Jensen is off 36, just this side of Fortuna, but he\u2019s a large-animal vet. He\u2019s got dogs, though. If he can\u2019t help, he can give you the name of someone who can. Or put it down for you. But, buddy, that dog isn\u2019t going to make it to the vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I get there?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cTurn left off 36 on Waycliff Road. You\u2019ll see a sign for Jensen Stables and Vet Clinic, and Dr. Jensen. It\u2019s only a few minutes down the hill.\u201d He shook his head again. \u201cThis could all be over in thirty seconds.\u201d</p> <p>Noah ignored him and went back to his truck, opening the passenger door. He returned to the animal and lifted it into his arms, which is when he discovered it was a female. The blood was dried and didn\u2019t soil him, but flies buzzed around the injury and he was pretty sure he\u2019d end up with maggots on his clothes. He was about halfway to his truck when the rancher said, \u201cGood luck there, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noah grumbled. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Nathaniel Jensen proved to be a friendly guy just a little younger than Noah and he was far more helpful than the old rancher had been. He looked the dog over for about sixty seconds before he said, \u201cThis looks like it could be Lucy. Her owner was a local rancher, killed in an accident up north, near Redding, months ago now. He was hauling a gelding; killed him and the horse. They never found his dog, a border collie. She might\u2019ve been thrown and injured. Or maybe she got scared and bolted. Oh, man, if this is Lucy, I bet she was trying to find her way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have family who will take care of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing\u2014old Silas was a widower. He had one daughter and she married a serviceman, moved away more than twenty years ago. Silas\u2019s ranch and stable sold immediately. The remaining animals\u2014horses and dogs\u2014were sold or placed. I don\u2019t think the daughter was even back here for the sale. I could call around, see if anyone knows where she is. But that could take time old Lucy doesn\u2019t have. She didn\u2019t take on any of her father\u2019s other animals. And we don\u2019t even know if this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Lucy?\u201d Noah asked.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. She\u2019s not that old. Three or four, maybe. Silas had a pack of ranch dogs. Herders. But Lucy was a favorite and went everywhere with him. She\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I can start an IV, treat her for a possible head injury, find the source of bleeding, clean her up, sedate her if she needs it, run some antibiotics, transfuse her if necessary\u2014but you\u2019re looking at a big expense that Silas\u2019s only daughter might not be willing to pick up. People around here\u2014farmers and ranchers\u2014most of \u2019em aren\u2019t real sentimental about their dogs. They wouldn\u2019t spend more than the animal\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to understand that,\u201d Noah said, pulling out his wallet. He extracted a credit card and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a phone yet\u2014I just got here and there\u2019s no reception for the cell. I\u2019ll call in or stop by. Just do what you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with just letting her go, Noah,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAs banged up as she is, that\u2019s what most people would do. Even if she pulls through, there\u2019s no guarantee she\u2019ll be much of a dog.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the dog\u2019s head and thought, No guarantee any of us will be much of anything, but we still try. \u201cBe sure to give her something good for pain, all right? I don\u2019t want her to be in pain while you see what can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Nathaniel asked.</p><p>Noah smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call tomorrow afternoon. And thanks.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Noah learned that Lucy had a few cracked ribs, a couple of lacerations and scrapes, was malnourished and infested with tics and maggots, and had a systemic infection. She might recover, Dr. Jensen said, but her condition was poor. If she did get stronger, Dr. Jensen insisted she should be spayed. So on top of everything else, poor Lucy was going to have a hysterectomy. He gave Nathaniel Jensen the phone number for the bar next door to the church, in case something came up. It turned out Doc Jensen knew the owner, Jack.</p><p>Noah soon discovered that Virgin River\u2019s Communication Central was located right next door to the church\u2014at Jack\u2019s Bar. Jack was a very nice guy who seemed to know everyone and everything. He quizzed Noah briefly about his denomination, education, what plans he had for the church, and that was all it took for the entire town to be informed. Noah had expected some rude jokes and at the very least some good-natured ribbing about being the pastor who bought an old church on eBay, and he hadn\u2019t been disappointed. But it also seemed the people in town were relieved to learn he was an ordained minister, since he looked pretty much like an out-of-work lumberjack; all the thin white scars on his hands and forearms from work on the boats and docks undoubtedly set him up as a man who did hard, physical labor.</p><p>Noah explained that the building officially belonged to the church but that it would be governed by a group of church elders once they were functional and had a congregation. Ownership would hopefully, in time, pass to the congregants, as they amassed and grew and gathered the funds to support it. His plans? \u201cHow about a low-key, friendly place for people to gather, support each other, worship together?\u201d Noah had answered. \u201cNo revivals or animal sacrifices till we\u2019re all better acquainted.\u201d And then he had grinned.</p><p>Not only did Jack give him good press, which Noah appreciated, but in short order Jack began to feel like a friend. Noah checked in daily at Jack\u2019s, usually having at least a cup of coffee, and through Jack he met many of the locals. And Jack\u2019s phone was the hotline to the veterinarian. \u201cNate called in, Noah,\u201d Jack reported. \u201cThat dog of yours is still hanging in there. Doing better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe worth more than my truck yet?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cI saw that old truck, Noah. I suspect she was worth more than that when you scraped her off the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat truck gets me where I\u2019m going. Most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s partner and cook, known as Preacher, invited Noah to jump on their satellite wireless-Internet connection so Noah could use his laptop for e-mails and research on the Net, but cautioned him against buying anything else Hope McCrea might be selling.</p><p>When he wasn\u2019t cleaning out the church or getting himself settled in town, every other day Noah visited Lucy at Jensen\u2019s Stables and Vet Clinic. Since the weather was warm, Nate was keeping her in an empty stall and Noah would spend an hour or so just sitting on the ground beside her, talking to her, petting her. By the time she\u2019d been there a week it was apparent she was going to pull through. After ten days she was walking around, if slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t show me the bill,\u201d Noah said to Nate Jensen during one of his visits. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cry in front of you.\u201d</p><p>There was no parsonage for Noah to call home, but he was comfortable in the RV and he had the truck for getting around the mountains. He did a little door-knocking, letting the folks know he was new to town and planned to get that church going. He had hoped some volunteers would materialize to help with the cleanup, but he refrained from asking and so far no one had offered. People seemed extremely friendly, but Noah thought they might be holding off a little to see what kind of minister he stacked up to be. There was a good chance he wasn\u2019t what they were looking for at all, but only time would tell.</p><p>He\u2019d collected enough cakes and cookies for a bake sale. The women in town had been dropping by, bearing sweets and welcoming him to the neighborhood. Even though Noah had a scary-powerful sweet tooth, he was getting a little tired of feasting on desserts. He even gave a passing thought to holding a bake sale.</p><p>Another thing Noah did was visit the nearest hospital\u2014Valley Hospital. He called on the sick and bereaved. Preaching might be his job, but bringing comfort was his calling.</p><p>Since there was no hospital chaplain, they relied on the local clergy to visit, so Noah just asked a hospital volunteer to point him toward anyone who might need a friendly visit. She looked him up and down doubtfully; he was dressed as usual in his jeans, boots and flannel shirt...He wore the T-shirt without holes. If he hadn\u2019t had a Bible in his hand, he had the impression the volunteer would have seriously questioned him. Clearly, the pastors hereabouts must spruce up a bit before visiting the patients.</p><p>His first client was an elderly man, a real sourpuss, who eyed the Bible and said, \u201cI ain\u2019t in the mood.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cSince I can\u2019t fit the Bible in my pocket, why don\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019d like to do. Talk, tell jokes, watch some TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you from, boy?\u201d the old man asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Ohio originally, most recently from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, what religion you from!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Presbyterian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t been in a church in fifty years or more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Noah replied.</p><p>\u201cBut when I was, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t Presbyterian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born Catholic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d Noah said. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see.\u201d He dug around in the pocket of his jeans. He pulled out a rosary. He dangled it. \u201cYou have any use for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the Sam Hill is a Presbyterian fella doing with one of those? You using those now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re still sticking to the basics, but I\u2019m a pretty all-purpose preacher. You want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t use it,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cYou can leave it, but I won\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo, what\u2019s that you got on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndy Griffith,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAll right! I love that show. You ever see that one when Barney had the motorcycle with the sidecar?\u201d Noah moved into the room and took the chair beside the old man\u2019s bed, draping the rosary across his arthritic hands.</p><p>\u201cI seen it. You see the one where he locks himself in the cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he do that every few weeks?\u201d Noah asked with a smirk. \u201cHow about when Aunt Bea accidentally got drunk? You see that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtis, the town drunk, now there\u2019s a character,\u201d the old fella said.</p><p>It took a while, but he learned this man was Salvatore Salentino, Sal for short. They went over their favorite episodes for a while, then Sal needed assistance to the bathroom, then he wanted to talk about his old truck, which he missed like crazy since being put in a nursing home. Next, he spoke about his grown daughter who\u2019d moved out of the mountains and rarely came back. Then he got onto how much he hated computers. Finally, he asked Noah if he\u2019d be back this way anytime soon because he was returning to the nursing home in a couple of days. \u201cI could stop by there if you\u2019d like me to, Sal,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cCan if you want,\u201d the old fella said. \u201cBut don\u2019t get the idea you\u2019re going to turn me into some goddamn Presbyterian!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah smiled and said, \u201cGood grief, no. I just haven\u2019t had anyone to watch Andy with in a long time.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to salvage in the old church. The pews had been removed, the appliances in the church kitchen ripped out, the pulpit, altar and baptistery gone, not an accessory in sight\u2014all sold off when the church had closed its doors. There was, however, that incredible stained-glass window at the front of the church. It was an amazing, valuable work of art.</p><p>The first thing Noah had done when beginning the cleanup was borrow a ladder from Jack and tear the plywood off the outside of the church. The daylight revealed a far larger and more beautiful stained-glass window than he imagined a poor church could afford, and he was surprised it hadn\u2019t been removed and sold or transported to another church. When he stared up at it, it gave him a feeling of purpose, of belonging. It was an image of Jesus, white robed, arms spread, palms out and accessible. On his shoulder was a dove. At his feet a lamb, a rabbit, a fawn. In the setting sun the light caught the eyes of Christ and created a beam of light that shone down into the church; a path of light in which he could see the dust motes dancing. He had no prie-dieu kneeler, but he would stand in front of that beautiful creation, hands deep in his pockets, staring up at the image and repeat the most beautiful prayer he knew. The prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi. Lord, make me an instrument of your peace....</p> <p>By his third week in Virgin River, Lucy had been released into Noah\u2019s care. Dr. Nathaniel Jensen gave him Lucy\u2019s bill, and Noah folded it in half, stuffed it in the pocket of his Levi\u2019s and refused to look at it until he had Lucy home. When he looked at the statement, he grabbed his heart. \u201cReally, I should be able to drive you,\u201d he said to the dog. Lucy licked his hand. \u201cRemind me to keep my eyes on the road when I\u2019m driving through the mountains,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lucy was still a long way from being a frisky pup\u2014she was on a special recovery diet, along with vitamins and antibiotics. She was a black-and-white border collie, maybe a bit of something else in the mix, and she had the most beautiful, large brown eyes that could look very pathetic and sad. Noah purchased a soft dog bed that he carried from the RV to the church office to accommodate her lingering aches and pains. Preacher agreed to fix a special chicken-and-rice meal for her twice a day, since Noah\u2019s cooking facilities were a bit restricted in the RV. Lucy could manage the three steps up to the bar porch, where she took many of her meals, but she had a terrible struggle getting up the stairs to the church office. Noah usually ended up carrying her.</p><p>What with the community outreach, caring for Lucy and the slow progress on the church cleanup, Noah realized he was going to need some help. So, once the phone line was installed, he advertised for a pastor\u2019s assistant. He fielded many more calls than he expected, but once he\u2019d answered a few questions about hours, pay and benefits, most of the callers said \u201cthey\u2019d get back to him.\u201d The duties weren\u2019t typical\u2014there would be cleaning and painting, as well as setting up an office\u2014and he guessed the callers found the work too hard. He made appointments for three women who hadn\u2019t bothered to ask questions. With Lucy settled on her pallet beside the old desk that had been left behind, he prepared to interview the first round of candidates.</p><p>The first was Selma Hatchet, a portly woman of sixty who walked with a three-pronged cane. \u201cYou the pastor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cPleasure to meet you, ma\u2019am. Please, have a seat,\u201d he said, indicating the chair that faced his desk. When they were both seated, they proceeded to visit a bit. The lady had raised a family and a couple of grandkids for her working daughter, done a great deal of volunteer work, and had been quite involved in the Grace Valley Presbyterian Church for the past twenty years.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Hatchet, this position will evolve into secretarial work, but right now it\u2019s going to be a very physical job. I not only need help organizing an office and library, but scrubbing, painting, spackling and probably a lot of heavy lifting. It might not be what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and lifted her chin. \u201cI want to do the Lord\u2019s work,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll willingly carry any load the Lord entrusts me with.\u201d</p><p>Noah briefly wondered if Mrs. Hatchet thought he had workmen\u2019s comp for when she threw out her back or took a tumble off a ladder. \u201cWell, that\u2019s admirable, but in this case the Lord\u2019s work is going to be dirty, messy and the only praying will probably be for Bengay.\u201d</p><p>He saw her to the door with a promise to be in touch.</p><p>The next applicant looked physically better suited to the hard work ahead and she was more than willing to pitch in, no matter how difficult or dirty the work. Rachael Nagel was in her midforties, a rancher\u2019s wife who\u2019d done her share of lifting and hauling, but she was a little scary. She had that pinched look of disapproval and began questioning him before he could get a word in edgewise. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be one of those liberal preachers, are you?\u201d</p><p>Liberal was just about his middle name. Noah\u2019s father was all about fire and brimstone, hell and damnation, and was probably the main reason Noah was not. \u201cUm, I\u2019ve been considered liberal by some, conservative by others. Tell me, Mrs. Nagel, do you by chance play the piano or organ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever had time for anything frivolous with a ranch to run, but I raised seven children with a firm hand. I can make sure the doctrine of the church is followed to the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a wonderful gift,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou oughtn\u2019t keep a dog like that in the church,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna end up with problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you suggest I keep her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t have land, you could get an outdoor kennel. Or tie it to a tree.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew right then Mrs. Nagel wouldn\u2019t work out.</p><p>His third applicant was Ellie Baldwin. Noah was sitting behind his desk when she walked into his ramshackle office. He paused before managing to get to his feet to greet her. She looked young, early twenties at best. And tall\u2014almost six feet\u2014without her shoes and hair. Most of that six feet was legs, which were sticking a long way out of a short flouncy skirt, her feet slipped into high-heeled sandals. She had very big hair, a ton of coppery curls that were streaked with gold and that fell to her shoulders and down her back. Not only was her yellow sweater tight and revealing, but a little bit of her purple bra was showing at the low d\u00e9colletage...on purpose. This was a look he\u2019d been seeing for a while\u2014this showing of the bra, a push-up bra no less. He couldn\u2019t deny it was a lovely sight, but he didn\u2019t usually see this immodest style in a church.</p><p>She had a crinkled-up piece of newspaper in her hand. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Reverend Kincaid,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Noah Kincaid. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pastor. And you must be Miss Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes were thick with black liner and mascara, her cheeks rouged, her lips red and glossy, her nails long and painted blue with sparkles, and a glance down those long legs revealed the polish on her toes matched her fingertips. She smiled at him when she came into the room. Then she turned away abruptly to take the gum out of her mouth, though he couldn\u2019t tell where it went. But the image of her smile was immediately tattooed on his mind\u2014it was beautiful. Also hopeful. But what was she thinking, coming to a job interview in a small-town church dressed all honky-tonk? And he thought, Aw, Jesus. Why me?</p><p>He stuck out his hand, hoping a wad of gum wouldn\u2019t be left in it. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you filled the job yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of promising applicants. But let\u2019s talk about the job,\u201d he said. He had a twinge of guilt\u2014no way could he, a single minister of thirty-five, hire someone like this. People would never understand. Or worse, they\u2019d assume they did understand. This interview was going to be a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cAwww, is that your dog?\u201d she asked, smiling down at Lucy.</p><p>\u201cMeet Lucy,\u201d he said. At the sound of her name, she lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cIs she really old? She looks very tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s recovering from a bad accident. I found her by the side of the road and, presto, I became her new owner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job,\u201d he went on, \u201cisn\u2019t limited to office work. As you can see, there\u2019s a lot of renovation and repair going on here. This church won\u2019t be ready for a congregation until some very heavy and very dirty work gets done. A couple of months\u2019 worth, at least.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you look kind of fragile for that kind of work.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and her whole face brightened. \u201cIs that so? Well, this fragile girl has cleaned up a lot of dumps and lifted more than her share of heavy stuff, Your Reverence.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s Noah. Please. I\u2019m not the pope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cI was being funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And so you were,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSo, not only do I need an office set up and some appointment, phone, and calendar management, but also help with moving furniture, painting, cleaning, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cMs. Baldwin, why do you want this job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a good job?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to the ad, but it sounded like a decent job in a decent line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And you\u2019re drawn to this line of work because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a change. Something a little more secure. Less stressful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your last or current job is...was...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancer. The hours don\u2019t work for me. I have kids. They\u2019re with my ex right now, but I\u2019d like a job I can do while they\u2019re in school. Y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you have secretarial experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor when we\u2019re done plastering and painting and moving furniture? Sure. A lot. I have a list of previous jobs,\u201d she said, pulling a pretty tattered, folded piece of paper out of her purse.</p><p>He glanced at it. He didn\u2019t see dancer on there but, without asking, he suspected he knew what kind of dancer. Just the way she was dressed, decidedly not churchy, suggested way too much. But, she had also worked for a real estate broker, a property manager and a \u201cLawyer?\u201d he asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Nice guy. I did a real good job for him. You can call him\u2014he\u2019ll tell you. He said he\u2019d write me a letter of recommendation anytime I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you left that job because...?\u201d</p><p>She looked away a bit uncomfortably. \u201cHe liked my work, I promise. But his wife wasn\u2019t real crazy about me. But call him!\u201d she said, looking back at him. \u201cI did a good job there.\u201d</p><p>The girl had worked everywhere. Everything from a loading dock to a convenience store. \u201cHow could you do all this stuff?\u201d Noah asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cTwo jobs,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cOffice work during the day, for the experience and benefits. Then a second job, part-time, at night and on weekends. I worked at a convenience store at night till it got held up, then I cleaned business offices with a cleaning crew. I have a lot of experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoading dock?\u201d he asked, glancing up from her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cFor a big retailer. It was kind of temporary, till I could get a job that didn\u2019t break all my nails.\u201d And she smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you could throw at me that I haven\u2019t done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I keep this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked a little panicked. \u201cCould you just copy down stuff? Names and numbers or whatever you want? I had to go to some trouble to make that up and I only have the one copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI should probably get copies,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a computer, myself. A friend helped me do that up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. And he made a point of copying some things off the page, though he had no intention of following up. When he looked up at her again, it was difficult not to notice that chest. He couldn\u2019t escape the feeling those boobs were going to poke his eyes out. \u201cTell me something\u2014any chance you play the piano or organ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgan? No. But my gramma taught me the piano, and hymns were her favorite. I could manage, probably. If I had time for a little practice. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch hymns?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s what I grew up on, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Noah said, intrigued. Then he found himself just staring at her for a long, mesmerizing moment. \u201cUm,\u201d he started, collecting himself, \u201cwhere do you live, Ms. Baldwin?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned forward, and her boobs nearly fell out of that tight sweater. He could feel his eyes bulge and his hands itch with temptation. \u201cEllie is fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, if I don\u2019t have to call you Your Reverence, you can call me Ellie. I have a place in Eureka right now, but I\u2019d like to get my kids out of there. I\u2019d like to move them someplace small and friendly where they can grow up safe, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind me asking, how old are your kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanielle is eight and Trevor is four.\u201d She smiled proudly. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing. Beautiful and smart and...Well,\u201d she said, straightening. \u201cOf course I\u2019d think that. They\u2019re also very healthy. I shouldn\u2019t be missing work because they\u2019re sick or anything.\u201d</p><p>He was speechless. \u201cYou don\u2019t look old enough to\u2014\u201d He stopped himself. It was none of his business.</p><p>\u201cI started the family too young, I know that. But I\u2019m sure glad I have them.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of silence he said, \u201cYes. Absolutely. Well, listen, you have some very good qualifications here. Can I get back to you?\u201d</p> <p>Her face fell. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cSure.\u201d And then she stood. \u201cI wish you\u2019d take it kind of serious. I need the job. I\u2019ve looked everywhere for a job I can do while my kids are in school and it\u2019s hell, you know? Sorry\u2014you probably don\u2019t say hell...\u201d</p><p>He felt a smile tug at his lips. He almost said, Hell if I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cReally, I could do just about anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a very hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very qualified,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d He stuck out his hand.</p><p>Eyes downcast, Ellie took it limply. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, looking totally disheartened.</p><p>Two</p><p>While Ellie made her own way out of his office and the church, Noah stayed behind his desk. He hadn\u2019t really expected to immediately find someone he could hire, anyway. In fact, he thought the search would probably be long and difficult. But the last thing he\u2019d expected was to interview someone who could do the job, and do it in a push-up bra and short skirt. Whoa, he thought. He was actually having a reaction. He shifted in his chair to get comfortable, trying to ignore his body\u2019s response. Nature was a practical joker.</p><p>Reflecting on the past several weeks and remembering Ellie\u2019s dejected posture as she left the interview got Noah thinking. When his wife, Merry, died a few years ago, the grief bit hard and the adjustment was terrible; marriage really worked for him and the loss was devastating. Merry\u2019s death left him a thirty-year-old widower, just about the last thing he ever envisioned for himself. For a year he felt like a pebble banging around inside an empty tin can and then, with George\u2019s encouragement, he headed for the seminary.</p> <p>Noah had nurtured a lifelong aversion to the ministry because of his father whom he considered a mean-spirited hypocrite. Jasper Kincaid was a semifamous preacher who had his own cable television mission in Columbus, Ohio. Big-time church, big-time money, big-time fame and power. But Jasper had treated his wife and son with indifference, and that was on a good day. They were too often the objects of his anger and recriminations. No way was Noah ever going to follow in those footsteps.</p><p>\u201cStop judging how everyone else treats their faith and study your own,\u201d George had counseled. \u201cIt took a bloody ton of it to get where you are today.\u201d</p><p>Indeed. While still a teenager, Noah had fled his Ohio roots and headed for the Pacific Northwest. He worked as a laborer anywhere he could get work, but fell in love with the fishing industry, with the ocean and the livelihood it offered. While he worked, he also studied\u2014sometimes as a part-time student, sometimes full-time.</p><p>His mother, too loyal and kindhearted to ever defy his father, stayed in touch and even visited. She wanted to give him money to assist with his education, but Noah refused. His mom met Merry only once and, for the first time in his life, Noah saw his mother weep with happiness that Noah should find a young woman so full of love and joy. Only two years later, his mother came, alone, to Merry\u2019s funeral.</p><p>Noah and his father had spoken only once in the past seventeen years and that was at his mother\u2019s funeral a year ago. He had no desire to reconcile with Jasper. He considered it a matter of survival.</p><p>Noah had been at his desk about an hour, trying to write up a schedule for himself but doing nothing but thinking and remembering, when he looked at his watch. Three o\u2019clock. There wouldn\u2019t be a crowd at Jack\u2019s at this time of day and he thought maybe a cup of coffee was in order. He gave Lucy a pat on the head and promised to be back soon.</p><p>When he walked into the bar, he was surprised to see Ellie Baldwin seated at a table not far from the empty hearth. A cup of coffee sat in front of her, her hands were folded in her lap and she gazed out the window. Instead of looking brassy and sexy, she looked a little lost. Noah lifted a hand in her direction, but she was deep in thought and didn\u2019t even notice him. So he went up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Noah,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cDisappointed, I think. But what are you gonna do?\u201d Jack put a mug in front of Noah and poured coffee without being asked.</p><p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t get the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d get back to her about that,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not what she heard, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He took a sip of coffee. \u201cHow about two slices of pie, right over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Noah migrated to Ellie\u2019s table. He stood there until she looked up at him. Oh, man, he was in trouble. Her eyes were red rimmed and wet, her mascara a little smeared. Grant that I may not so much seek to be understood as to understand. \u201cYou mind if I join you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She straightened and her eyes immediately cleared and narrowed. She was one tough customer. \u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>He pulled out a chair and set his coffee cup in front of him. \u201cYou seem upset, Ellie. Was it something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was something you didn\u2019t say,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOh? What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hired,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should give all the applicants a fair shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I sat in my car outside waiting for my turn. I saw the other applicants\u2014all two of them. One could barely get up the stairs; not a good bet for moving furniture. The other one had such a mean schnobble, she could break glass with her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchnobble?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat my gramma used to call a sourpuss. Now, that\u2019s a church lady, all right\u2014if you\u2019re looking for one as mean as a junkyard dog.\u201d</p><p>He laughed before he could reel it in. \u201cWho knew you were checking out the competition.\u201d Jack brought the pie, put it in front of them and got the heck out of there. Noah lifted a fork. \u201cPretty accurate, too. But I told you I\u2019d get in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, it\u2019ll be to say I didn\u2019t get the job.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a moment, then he said, \u201cHave some pie. Nobody makes pie like Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher? You made the pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the cook\u2014he goes by the nickname Preacher. That could lead to problems.\u201d He nodded toward the plate. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a chance, you\u2019ll be amazed. And between bites, tell me why I don\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, reluctantly, she took a bite of blackberry pie. She chewed and swallowed, but clearly the ambrosia of Preacher\u2019s pie was lost on her. After one bite, she put down the fork and her hands went back into her lap. Noah had to concentrate to focus on her eyes. That cleavage was killing him. \u201cNo hard feelings,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much luck in the job market lately. I think it\u2019s made me a little cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you looking for?\u201d he asked, digging into his pie.</p><p>\u201cAnything proper,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s for my kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ll benefit from their mom having a proper job?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip for a moment. \u201cLook, it\u2019s kind of personal\u2014my kids are going through a hard time. I don\u2019t think I should talk about it. No way I want people to know all that stuff...\u201d</p><p>Noah considered this for a second and against his better judgment he said, \u201cIf you feel like talking about it, Ellie, you can trust me with a confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I be sure of that?\u201d she asked with a lift of one eyebrow.</p><p>He sat back and smirked. \u201cI\u2019m a minister. I took Secret Keeping 101.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not my minister,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cIt\u2019s all pretty messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course I never hear anything messy in this job,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry. I was just offering you a chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my kids,\u201d she blurted. \u201cMy ex-husband filed for custody and got it. It shouldn\u2019t have happened, but it did. I was dancing in a club where some of the girls take off their clothes sometimes.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNot sometimes\u2014all the time. They think the more they\u2019re willing to take off, the better the tips, and that was usually true.\u201d She swallowed and looked away, her eyes threatening to fill again. \u201cMy tips were about average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an exotic dancer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked back at him. \u201cThere was nothing exotic about it.\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, she looked like someone who\u2019d be more than comfortable taking it off. Noah was hardly shocked; while he was working his way through seminary, he had a casual little ministry down on the docks. His best customers were bums, strippers, homeless people, addicts and others.</p><p>\u201cAre they okay with their dad?\u201d Noah asked with as much sensitivity as possible.</p><p>The question got an instant reaction out of her. Her face became angry and hard, erasing some of the youthful beauty buried under too much makeup. \u201cHe\u2019s not their dad. He was their stepdad for less than three months, and this isn\u2019t about giving them a good life, it\u2019s about holding them hostage. He wants me, that\u2019s what he wants. I dated him for quite a while and I thought he was a nice, normal guy, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s weird, abusive, mean and controlling, so we got out.</p><p>\u201cAfter we left him, I found myself a real nice setup\u2014I rented half a duplex next to a great lady who could keep the kids at night while I worked. I needed the sitter, she needed the extra money and we had a good arrangement. She was super to the kids, they hardly knew I was gone. I fixed dinner and left at six, she got their baths, read with them and put them to bed, then she\u2019d nod off on the couch till I got home. It was one of the first times I could afford both the rent and the babysitting on just one job. But Arnie wanted us back. He doesn\u2019t like it when things don\u2019t go his way. Taking my kids away from me was the only thing he could think of. He\u2019s one of those people who has to be in charge all the time. In control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah\u2019s fork was frozen in midair. After all that, all he could say was, \u201cAbusive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hit, but he\u2019s real rigid, demanding as hell and says hurtful things. You don\u2019t like what\u2019s on your plate, you go to bed hungry after you\u2019re called a whole bunch of names. You don\u2019t snap to attention, and you\u2019re called stupid and idiot. Don\u2019t rinse the dishes and wipe the table just perfect, you go to bed without stories or playtime. There\u2019s no TV in the house, no talking at the table, no playing outside unless an adult is standing over you. No sleeping together\u2014that\u2019s dirty.\u201d Her eyes watered. \u201cTrevor is only four! And even when I did manage to get a place where they had their own room, they were always crawling in with me! It\u2019s what kids do!\u201d</p><p>Noah couldn\u2019t move. She was pushing some buttons he didn\u2019t feel like having pushed. He started hearing his father\u2019s voice. What do I ask of you besides respect and decency? You have to learn discipline and restraint for your own good before you\u2019re completely lost! No dessert/football/summer camp/TV/friends/et cetera et cetera et cetera!</p> <p>Her voice lowered and calmed. \u201cDanielle is only eight, and she\u2019s expected to make sure everything is perfectly tidy and clean. And if it isn\u2019t exactly how he wants it, which she\u2019s just too young to do, he calls her names and takes away privileges.\u201d Her laugh had a hollowing. \u201cThey\u2019re not things I call privileges\u2014like dinner? Like reading before bed? A privilege? I call it a necessity. How\u2019s Danielle going to grow up smarter than me if she doesn\u2019t get to read?\u201d</p><p>Noah cleared his throat. \u201cAnd this is better for them than a mother who dances for a living?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and looked down for a second. \u201cIt was the kind of dancing I did, I guess.\u201d But she met his eyes when she said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the problem. It\u2019s not like I took the kids to the club. It\u2019s not an illegal place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the judge awarded custody to their stepfather?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in a cynical smile. \u201cThe judge isn\u2019t such a good tipper, either,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Noah felt sick. He put down his fork. \u201cHow did the judge figure in this, Ellie? Did you know him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into the club sometimes. He asked to buy me dinner a few times and I said no\u2014he\u2019s an old man! And besides, we don\u2019t date customers. I explained that, but he wasn\u2019t happy with the answer. But he fixed me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the judge tell you that if you found a \u2018proper\u2019 job, you could have custody again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t, in good conscience, leave the children in the hands of a stripper when there was a better alternative. All he knows about Arnie is that he\u2019s a principal for a private school. He doesn\u2019t know the real Arnie. The real Arnie can have a mean mouth on him. The judge said this was just temporary\u2014he\u2019d look at the custody again in ninety days.\u201d She glanced away. \u201cEighty-two and counting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing your kids?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and that\u2019s when things fell apart for her; she couldn\u2019t keep the tears back. One big one rolled down each cheek. \u201cEvery Saturday, just during the day. They can\u2019t even spend the night with me. They\u2019ve never been away from me before. I\u2019ve never spent a single night away from them since they were born, except to work! Do you know the only reason why I haven\u2019t done something like snatch them and run? Because Arnie is obsessed with winning, with having his way. I believe he\u2019d hunt me down and have me locked up. And that would be even worse for the kids than this.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s pie sat untouched, as well. He didn\u2019t feel so hot. \u201cHave you tried to get help, Ellie? Like legal aid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were very nice to me. But there\u2019s not a lot they can do with the decision at this point. Their advice was to try to find an acceptable job. They said they\u2019d go back to court with me, maybe even sooner than ninety days, and they\u2019d make sure I got my kids back. And make sure Arnie didn\u2019t get any visitation\u2014we were only married three months and they\u2019re not his kids. Once I have my kids back legally, I\u2019m running for my life. I\u2019ll go as far as I have to go. I\u2019ll change our names. I\u2019m never letting something like this happen to them again. I made a lot of mistakes...I know I\u2019m not the best mother\u2014the best mother wouldn\u2019t dance for strange men. But I love my kids. I take as good care of them as I can and I love them. And they are, for God\u2019s sake, going to be able to read before bed!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI think that\u2019s something a good mother would insist on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try. I do everything I can. What else you going to do? It\u2019s really hard when you have to work two jobs. At least at the club, I didn\u2019t have to have a second job to make ends meet. And it was a job I could do while they were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, do you mind if I ask\u2014how old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Well, she said she had them too young, he thought. \u201cWhere\u2019s their biological dad?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and heaved a defeated sigh. \u201cOh, what the hell, you\u2019re not giving me that church job anyway. A church job would really kick ass, but\u2014\u201d She took a breath. \u201cThis is all part of that Secret Keeping 101, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got pregnant in high school and then my boyfriend got killed in a motorcycle accident before we could even get married. It took me a long time to pick up the pieces and then I made my second big mistake\u2014Trevor\u2019s daddy went to prison when I was just barely pregnant. Robbery.</p><p>He had a cigar lighter that looked exactly like a gun\u2014how about that? He decided to play a joke on a store owner and ask for the bank deposit. We don\u2019t have any contact at all and never will. And then, as if I couldn\u2019t be smart even once in my life, I married Arnie Gunterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhy\u2019d you marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, he didn\u2019t act crazy when I was getting to know him. He was real nice. And he offered me something I\u2019d never had before\u2014a chance to live in a real house and stay home to take care of my kids. He treated me careful, with respect. He never even tried anything, he was saving himself for marriage\u2014remind me never to fall for that one again! I didn\u2019t know there was anything wrong with him. I mean, I knew he wasn\u2019t fun. But the last fun one, Chip, was a laugh a minute, all the way to jail.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cHonest to God, I don\u2019t even know why Arnie wants me. I wasn\u2019t married to him for three days before he started acting all jealous, asking every day if I talked to any men, acting as if he didn\u2019t even really like me. But he wanted me there, in his house, taking orders. And I don\u2019t take orders very well. I must have been like a bad dream to him and he still wouldn\u2019t let me go.</p><p>\u201cBut you know what? I\u2019m going to figure this out. I\u2019m going to get on my feet, get my kids back, and we\u2019re going to be fine. There have been three men in my life, one of \u2019em dead and two of \u2019em too lousy to talk about, and that\u2019s the total number of men there ever will be until I drop dead. How\u2019s that? I don\u2019t care what it takes, I\u2019m getting ahead of this. My gramma always used to say the stuff that doesn\u2019t kill us makes us stronger. Pastor Kincaid, meet Hercules Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>Right away Noah\u2019s thought was, You might\u2019ve sworn off men, but I bet they haven\u2019t sworn off you\u2014not with that face and body. Shew. He was starting to feel a little warm. Let me seek to understand rather than to be understood. Where there is despair, let me offer hope. And dear God, could you please get her to cover up that cleavage for a while?</p><p>\u201cLook, Your Reverence, I just need a job like this for ninety days. That\u2019s all. Maybe even less. I just have to convince the judge I\u2019m a good mother, that I have a proper job, and then I\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the judge shouldn\u2019t have been able to take them from you without a pretty exhaustive investigation, right? You know he overstepped his authority, right? Did the legal-aid people explain all that?\u201d Noah asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat the judge went his own way on this because he could?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, yeah, I know he was just screwing with me. And it was also explained that challenging him right now could drag things out even longer\u2014it would make his decision more of an issue than the custody. And believe me, I don\u2019t cut him any slack here, but he doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing to the kids by giving Arnie control any more than I did when I married Arnie. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t think it would be horrible for them. That\u2019s no excuse for ignoring some real important rules, like giving the kids a lawyer of their own...That isn\u2019t going to happen twice, I promise!\u201d</p><p>He thought for a second, studying his pie. He looked up. \u201cEllie, I\u2019d like to ask you a question and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to do it that won\u2019t be offensive. I apologize for that. Could there be any other possible reason the judge chose your ex-husband as the guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she asked, as if confused.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cProblems with the law? Parenting problems? You know...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t drink or smoke. I don\u2019t do drugs. The only law I ever broke was not getting my license tags renewed on time because I didn\u2019t have the money. I have a potty mouth, but not in front of the kids...I hardly ever slip. I don\u2019t leave my children alone, and I\u2019ve lost jobs when the sitter stood me up. I can\u2019t give my kids everything I want to, but I take care of them the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand, I can\u2019t even consider you for the job unless I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do your stupid job,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cAnd you can bet I\u2019ll do a damn good job. No one has ever complained about my work. I work hard. I always do two days\u2019 work in one, just in case one of the kids gets a fever or something and I have to call in sick to stay with them. I swear to God, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not, it\u2019s lazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Ellie, the pay I\u2019m able to afford is low. Very modest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some benefits, but they\u2019re not the greatest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you make that work? You obviously need money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGive up the duplex. Find one room somewhere. I don\u2019t need a house when I can\u2019t have my kids overnight. We\u2019ve lived in one room before and we could do it again.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cCozy. We just curl up and tickle and laugh and play and\u2014\u201d Again her eyes misted over. \u201cI\u2019ll manage whatever life throws at me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m used to doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church job\u2014it\u2019s not a piece of cake,\u201d he said. \u201cI need help with heavy jobs. You saw the place. I have to fix it up before I even get to the preaching part.\u201d</p><p>She flashed him a smile. \u201cSounds like fun. More fun than listening to a lot of bible beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not going to have to work at getting you to come out of your shy little shell,\u201d Noah said, and she laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re in a tight spot. You need just under three months to get back to the judge and for me to find someone permanent. We could try it. But it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d On either one of us, he thought.</p><p>\u201cDo I seem like someone who knows what to do with easy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. He knew better; this was a bad idea. But the kid deserved a break, didn\u2019t she? He dared a glance down from her eyes. A tremor ran though him. She sure didn\u2019t look like a church secretary. But then, he didn\u2019t look like a preacher. \u201cYou\u2019re out of work right now?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI quit the day the judge gave Arnie the kids. I have to find something right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Thursday. If you want to start then, you can. But like I said, it\u2019s dirty work. Do you have...ah...Jeans? Sweatshirts? Some shoes that aren\u2019t high heels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cCool. I haven\u2019t been in a church in years!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo kidding? I\u2019d never have guessed. Well, people will have certain expectations...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, no swearing. I\u2019ll be totally polite. And I\u2019ll leave my pasties and G-string at home.\u201d Noah went completely red and she burst out laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t have pasties and G-strings. That club? It wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, what was your part?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes upward. \u201cThat\u2019s the interesting thing\u2014sometimes a certain costume or look does more for the guys than being totally naked. The two most popular outfits were the cheerleading costume and the candy striper\u2019s costume. The men\u2014they really go for pom-poms.\u201d Ellie looked at Noah. \u201cHey\u2014are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m fine,\u201d Noah said weakly. He\u2019d been in his share of strip clubs, but not for a while. And he hadn\u2019t had much female companionship lately, either. Until today, he hadn\u2019t realized how much he missed that. \u201cNow, try that pie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you just doing this to be nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Are you conning me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of a job that\u2019s really hard and pays practically nothing?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy? So I can steal and hock a crucifix? Please. If I could figure out how to con someone, I\u2019d go after that judge. What a jackass he turned out to be. Oops. Sorry. I\u2019m going to have to work on my language, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Noah grumbled.</p><p>After finishing their pie, Noah and Ellie stood, shook hands, and she left. Noah took the empty plates and cups over to Jack at the bar.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed a lot happier when she left than when she came in, if you know what I mean,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cShe assumed she wouldn\u2019t get the job at the church,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot exactly church-secretary material, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNice-enough girl, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a job,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThat a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she needs is a break. And it turns out she has all the qualifications.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice.\u201d</p><p>Noah sat on a stool. \u201cBetter give me a beer....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. What\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m flexible.\u201d</p><p>Jack drew him a cold draft. \u201cYou gave her the job, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Noah admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, this is going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor who, exactly?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Jack laughed at him. \u201cI only talked to her a minute, but she seems okay, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be a little rough around the edges for a church job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d Jack asked with a laugh. \u201cSo could you, Noah. But you\u2019re an old softie. You sure she\u2019s not just using you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt eight dollars an hour? Come on. I\u2019m going to have to pray for forgiveness all night for taking advantage of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to do something about those...Maybe a shawl? A nice big, concealing shawl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Noah. How about a tarp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help me.\u201d Noah took a drink of the beer. \u201cJack, it\u2019s been a real trip, getting to know you and the town. But when the locals get a load of the pastor\u2019s assistant, I\u2019m going to be run out on a rail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Noah. This is Virgin River. We like things a little on the interesting side. You\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Noah took another drink of his beer. \u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>For her first day of work at the church, Ellie chose to wear something conservative. She dressed in overalls with a white, sleeveless tank top underneath that laced up the front. She slipped into sneakers, pulled her plentiful, curly, copper-colored hair up in a clip, lined her lips and eyes and off she went to Virgin River.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she yelled as she walked into the church.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the basement,\u201d Noah yelled back.</p><p>She clomped down the steps, jumping off the bottom step. Noah was patching cracks in the unfinished cinderblock wall, a plasterer\u2019s hawk with a mound of wet cement in one hand, a putty knife in the other. Lucy lay not far away on her bed, lifting her head and wagging her tail as Ellie came down the stairs. Noah smiled at her, then his smile froze. He looked her slowly up and down. And again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded hotly, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cNo. What? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>He turned back slowly, put his tools down on top of the ladder and approached her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this. I think it would be in the best interests of both of us if you\u2019d dress a little more...conservatively.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at herself. \u201cMore conservatively than overalls?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He felt a laugh escape in spite of himself. He shook his head. \u201cEllie, I\u2019ve never seen anybody look that good in overalls before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is a bad thing?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s provocative,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cSexy. People who work around churches usually dress a little more...What\u2019s the best way to put this...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrumpy? Dumpy? Ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout some of their bra showing, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, Reverend, just where have you been? Because this happens to be in style. And I\u2019ll do any work you give me, but you really shouldn\u2019t be telling me what to wear. The last guy I was with tried to do me over. He liked me well enough when he was trying to get my attention, but the second I married him, he wanted to cover me up so no one would notice I had a body!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very same. It didn\u2019t work for him and it\u2019s not going to work for you. You didn\u2019t say anything about a dress code. Maybe I\u2019ll turn you in to the Better Business Bureau or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you mean the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Or maybe you should go straight to the American Civil Liberties Union.\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cEllie,\u201d he said, using his tender but firm minister voice. \u201cI\u2019m a single man. You\u2019re a very beautiful young woman. I would like it if the good people of Virgin River assumed you were given this job solely because of your qualifications and not because you\u2019re eye candy. Tomorrow, could you please wear something less distracting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d she said in a huff. \u201cBut this is what I have, and there\u2019s not much I can do about that. Especially on what you\u2019re paying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think \u2018baggy,\u2019\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a problem there,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy my clothes baggy. Or ugly. Or dumpy. And you can bet your sweet a...butt I left behind the clothes Arnie thought I should wear.\u201d She just shook her head in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re complaining about. You know how many guys would rather have something nice to look at than a girl in a flour sack? Guess you didn\u2019t get to Count Your Blessings 101.\u201d She cocked her head and lifted her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting,\u201d he said. But his eyes bore down on hers seriously. He was not giving an inch. \u201cJust an ounce of discretion. Do what you can.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to work. Tomorrow I\u2019ll look as awful as possible. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Why don\u2019t you get started by sweeping up in the kitchen. It\u2019s large enough for a dozen people to work in there together\u2014it\u2019s a big room. The appliances are all gone, but it\u2019s going to have to be cleaned up before I can put down new flooring and paint. It\u2019s accumulated a good ten years of dirt. Some of my household things are being delivered in a few weeks. After I get the walls patched, textured and painted, and put down flooring over the concrete, I can store my shipment and other things down here while we work on the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, fine. Are there supplies somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it, Rev,\u201d she said with a salute, turning on her heel to march off toward the kitchen, treating him to a little skip and fanny wiggle on her way.</p><p>Noah grimaced. He looked down at Lucy, who lifted her head and wagged her tail\u2014maybe in sympathy, so he gave her a pat on the head. That went well, he thought. He\u2019d offended Ellie and judged her all at the same time. He already knew she was forced to pinch pennies and couldn\u2019t buy new clothes for a job of cleaning and painting. Besides, the absolute truth was, she was a pleasure to look at. And frankly, you could see more skin and curves on prime-time TV. So what was he afraid of? That stodgy church ladies were going to get uptight, seeing her around town, knowing she was helping him work on the church?</p><p>The girl\u2019s having a hard enough time, going up against a judge who is, himself, a patron of the very strip joint he condemns her for working in. She was taking a low-paying church job just to gain enough credibility to get her kids back\u2014credibility she shouldn\u2019t need. Any woman her age willing to work more than one job to afford the most rudimentary stuff of life, having never been separated from her children before except to work, should be plenty convincing.</p><p>For a second he wondered if he\u2019d been sucked in by her lost soul. \u201cPah,\u201d he scoffed aloud. Ellie didn\u2019t seem at all lost. She was a fighter, and that impressed him. He barely knew her and he already admired her. Plus, it was good that she was sassy; she shouldn\u2019t let anyone tell her what to wear.</p><p>He was right about one thing, however. She was distracting, even when she wasn\u2019t in the same room. It wasn\u2019t just the visible edges of her bra. Her thick, curly hair, pulled up and cascading down, her creamy skin, sultry, deep brown eyes, full lips, teasing smile, long legs, narrow waist, perfect hips and nice round booty\u2014all that added up to an appearance that couldn\u2019t help but bring sex to mind. And it reminded Noah that he\u2019d been on a serious sex diet for the past few years. Not exactly a starvation diet, but still...</p><p>He climbed back up on his ladder and continued to patch the walls while Ellie worked in the kitchen. And while he worked he thought a lot about what had brought him here to this run-down church in Virgin River.</p><p>He thought back to something his mom used to ask him from time to time. \u201cWhat are your goals, Noah?\u201d she had asked.</p><p>\u201cI will never be a minister, Mom. Never.\u201d</p><p>After a long period of silence, she said, \u201cI\u2019m relieved. I think your father and I have thoroughly ruined you for that.\u201d</p><p>As he continued to repair and patch the walls, Noah smiled at the irony\u2014he was embarking on a career he never thought he would have. It was a shame that his mom and Merry weren\u2019t here to see this. They had always supported him and he knew the irony of his current situation would not have been lost on them, either.</p><p>Even though it had been a few years since her death, Noah still missed Merry sometimes. Their couple of years together had been magic. She had been such a free spirit; she made him laugh, brought him wisdom and optimism. She was edgy and fun\u2014she took chances and encouraged him to do the same. Merry was a committed soul who cared deeply and loyally about her \u201ccauses,\u201d as he called them, and all the people in her life. After she was gone he made a point of remaining in touch with her family. Her parents and siblings were a great support to him even as they contended with their own grief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The whole idea of considering going back to the seminary came from George, who described it as a combination of dredging the soul for the innermost spirituality, personal faith, teaching, counseling, community and theater. Only George could come up with a combination like that. \u201cYou\u2019ve had those leanings anyway,\u201d George had said. \u201cJust check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will never preach,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cNot that many ordained ministers do,\u201d George said with a shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re therapists, minister to sick and needy folk, teach\u2014there are more options than I can list. But along the way you might find out a thing or two about yourself. No harm there.\u201d</p> <p>In short, Noah was convinced. During his studies, he found out he was meant to try to hold a group of believers together in faith, to lend a hand, to communicate, to educate, to bring hope. To be a friend. There was only one thing that was required of him that he could not do\u2014and that was to forgive his father.</p><p>Just last year his mother passed. She had slipped away in the night, having had a stroke at the age of seventy. Noah attended the funeral, even though he hated the idea of seeing his father. But it was the only time in Noah\u2019s life he could remember having the last word with his dad.</p><p>Jasper said to him, within the hearing of many others, \u201cDo you see what leaving the family and the faith did? It killed your mother.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Noah replied, \u201cYou should be aware that Mother and I have been in touch ever since I left home. She visited twice even though I wouldn\u2019t come back. She was always there for me and we loved one another profoundly. The truth is, I think staying with you was what killed her.\u201d</p><p>The shock on his father\u2019s face was priceless; and the insult bit Jasper deep. It had obviously never occurred to Jasper that his wife would keep secrets from him. Maybe it was just that he paid so little attention to her, he was unaware that she kept a close relationship with her son. The reading of the will hammered Jasper with a few more home truths\u2014Inez Kincaid had brought a trust fund to her marriage to a poor preacher who was ten years her junior. Her personal wealth had helped Jasper build a big following, televise his services, evangelize and collect members. She willed half of the fund to Noah. Jasper had expected to receive all of it.</p> <p>And now Noah was going to run through a great deal of his inheritance fixing up this old church.</p><p>He looked in the direction of the kitchen. Another free spirit, he admitted to himself. In a completely different form.</p><p>There was a crash, a splash, and Ellie said, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Lucy came to her feet and Noah looked up. \u201cVery funny,\u201d he said to God. \u201cThat kind of thing isn\u2019t going to go over well.\u201d Then he walked to the kitchen, Lucy beside him.</p><p>He stood in the doorway and watched as Ellie used the rag mop to try to capture the flood that resulted from a tipped bucket. But that wasn\u2019t where his focus was\u2014he frowned and looked at his watch. The morning had passed without him even realizing it. He\u2019d been completely lost in thought. And while he\u2019d been thinking of his past and patching wall cracks, Ellie had been working like a demon.</p><p>The huge, restaurant-size kitchen almost glowed. The floor had been swept, mopped, and was being mopped again. She\u2019d done some things that had made an enormous difference\u2014the high windows were cleaned and spotless, the frames scrubbed of dust, spiderwebs and dirt. The countertops were scoured and disinfected. The cupboards were washed out with their doors standing open. The few remaining kitchenware items that had been abandoned were washed and drying in a dish drain she\u2019d found; all four deep sinks were scrubbed clean, the faucets shining. The room didn\u2019t look like new, but it was clean and fresh and ready for painting and flooring.</p> <p>She squeezed her mop, straightened and wiped a hand across her forehead, pushing up a curl that just bounced back to hang over one eye. She blew out of her lower lip to cool her face, making that curl flutter in her breath. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said. \u201cYou heard me say fuck. Sorry. I\u2019ll try not to say it. But I bet if you\u2019d dumped a big pail of nasty mop water on your clean floor, you would have said fuck, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and just shook his head. \u201cMaybe. It looks good in here, Ellie. Who knew you could do something like this with long, blue, sparkly fingernails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you meant for me to clean it, so I cleaned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I bet you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s after one.\u201d</p><p>She got a very strange look on her face, as though a thought just came to mind or she\u2019d forgotten something. Then she just continued mopping. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think I could eat. I really pigged out on pizza last night and I\u2019m still stuffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going next door for a sandwich. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, go on. I\u2019ll just finish up here. If I do a good job, maybe you\u2019ll let me out of here early or something. I have to get looking for a new place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave whenever you\u2019ve had enough\u2014you\u2019ve done an incredible job. I\u2019ve been chipping away at the dirt in this place for weeks and it looks like you conquered it in no time at all.\u201d</p> <p>She straightened again. She pushed that curl back. Her neck and chest were damp with perspiration, which made her look even sexier. She smiled almost shyly. \u201cI cleaned office buildings and sometimes houses for cash\u2014under the table. One of my many second jobs. I don\u2019t think it was listed on that sheet of jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d he corrected, then damned himself for being so uppity. Why couldn\u2019t he just accept her the way she was?</p><p>\u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI got some great tips from the girls who had more experience than me. Clean is good. Fast and clean makes more money.\u201d</p><p>He laughed with genuine pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the trenches,\u201d he said with appreciation. Admiration. \u201cCome on\u2014let me buy you a sandwich. If you\u2019re not real hungry, Preacher will make you half, but it\u2019s your first day working for me. My treat\u2014come on.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>For someone who had stuffed herself on pizza the night before, Ellie seemed to have no trouble packing away a very large chicken-salad sandwich and some of Preacher\u2019s potato salad. Noah doubted the pizza story. He picked up their plates and carried them to the bar, and when he returned he said, \u201cJack\u2019s bringing chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were on her flat belly. \u201cOh, man, I couldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bite or two,\u201d he said. \u201cSo\u2014you said you were raised on hymns. Tell me about that. I mean, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll tell you. I grew up with my gramma. What a peach\u2014you\u2019d have liked her. My mother wasn\u2019t...isn\u2019t...very stable. When I was born, she was clueless, so my gramma took over and my mother left and I stayed. When I was seven, Gram started teaching me to play the piano. It was a real old piano and about the only thing worth a dime in the house, but we had a neighbor guy who kept it tuned. Gramma hummed gospel tunes all day long and she loved it if I could figure out one of those old-time hymns. \u2018The Old Rugged Cross,\u2019 \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 \u2018Great Is Thy Faithfulness...\u2019 \u2019Course, I would have rather played Elton John, John Lennon or Billy Joel, but for her I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your mother?\u201d he asked just as the cake arrived.</p><p>\u201cJumping from man to man,\u201d she said, lifting her fork.</p><p>\u201cWere there more children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cShe figured out that much. When I got pregnant in high school, my gramma must have been scared to death that I was just following in her footsteps. I wasn\u2019t really, but it must have looked like I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said patiently, \u201cwhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She shook her head. \u201cTrying,\u201d she finally said. \u201cTrying my hardest. I got pregnant at sixteen. I was three months pregnant with Danielle and trying to throw together a fast, cheap wedding to my nineteen-year-old boyfriend when he was killed. It wasn\u2019t his fault, either. His family sued the driver of the car that killed him, and they won. They were supposed to set something aside for Danielle, but I guess it slipped their minds.\u201d That last was delivered with a dubious look on her face. \u201cBy the time she was three, I\u2019d gotten my GED and had finally stopped feeling sorry for myself long enough to meet someone I liked\u2014a guy who made nighttime bread deliveries to the convenience store when I worked there. Like some kind of curse, I was three months pregnant when he pulled that stupid robbery stunt.\u201d</p><p>Noah chewed on the cake and this history for a second. He had a million questions, but the one that popped out was, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any intuition about him, that he was capable of a felony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, he wasn\u2019t. He was an idiot. He was out with his friends, drinking. Twenty-two, drunk, and he thought he was funny\u2014putting his lighter that looked exactly like a revolver\u2014into the hardware-store owner\u2019s chest and saying, \u2018Hand over the money.\u2019 The store owner was going to drop off his deposit for the night when my dipshit boyfriend decided to be cute. Didn\u2019t quite work out for him, though. I guess the judge had no sense of humor. He was convicted. Did time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s either out by now or due to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t he help you with his son? With the kids?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. No, he can\u2019t. And besides, I\u2019m not going back that way. In fact, I\u2019m not going back. Period.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cHave you always been this stubborn? This strong willed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. For all the good it\u2019s done me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014where did the husband come in? If that\u2019s not too personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing personal about it, Rev. I was a working mom with two little kids and two jobs. He was new in the area and came into the real estate office, looking for something to rent or buy. I was the office manager. Our agents didn\u2019t find him anything, but he kept coming back, was real nice, real friendly. I thought he was a stand-up guy. Trevor was only two, my gramma had died a year before, and I was having a real hard time holding everything together. I didn\u2019t rush into anything\u2014I made him act nice for six months. I didn\u2019t have much time to date, but I never had a single date alone with him\u2014if he asked me out for dinner, I told him the kids went where I went, and that wasn\u2019t a problem for him. He did a lot of talking about wanting to be a family man and just hadn\u2019t found the right woman yet. I took that as a good sign.\u201d For a moment she looked away and couldn\u2019t connect eyes with Noah. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t love him, but I was so tired,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSo scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of my kids with my gramma gone. My kids saw more of the babysitter than they saw of me.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at Noah and said, \u201cI married him and quit my job because he wanted to take care of us. It didn\u2019t take two days before I knew I\u2019d made a big mistake. He insisted I dress real dowdy and awful. He had rules. He needed to be right about everything. Ridiculous demands. He started trying to get me to give up my independence on the first day! He wanted me to sell my car, and he took his computer to work, out of my reach. He doled out money for food...It was terrible. And I wouldn\u2019t play along, which made him so frustrated and angry. I mean, I knew in two days it was a bad deal, but I gave it almost three months. Then I packed up our stuff while he was at work, picked up Danielle from his private school, and we were history. I went back to an old boss, the lawyer, to draft a divorce petition. That gave poor old Arnie the impression I had a rich, classy lawyer. I didn\u2019t ask for anything, so he couldn\u2019t contest it. I just wanted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t fight it, then,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cNot legally. But he threatened me. He said if I went through with it, he\u2019d be my worst nightmare. We had been divorced for about nine months when he made a case for custody. There\u2019s where I wasn\u2019t too smart\u2014I couldn\u2019t see how he had a leg to stand on. He wasn\u2019t their father, we\u2019d lived with him less than three months, and I didn\u2019t think I needed any help keeping my own kids. And, like I said before, I\u2019d never done better for myself workwise. I had a good job, made good money, was taking good care of my kids. That club is totally legal. Maybe it\u2019s not tasteful, but it\u2019s legal. Most of the women dancing in there are single moms. That judge\u2014he had it out for me. Maybe I should\u2019ve let him buy me dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glowered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I said no,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou were blindsided,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know. I should have called my old boss again. I did call him afterward. What a nice guy. He said there wasn\u2019t much he could do for me, but gave me the name of a friend of his who worked for a legal-defense office that did charity work. He called them for me, and that brings us to today. Hey,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is still part of the silence pact, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, Ellie. I don\u2019t gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not ashamed of anything, but I\u2019m not stupid. All the stuff I\u2019ve screwed up? I\u2019m bound to be judged pretty hard by people who don\u2019t know me. But it\u2019s not even that\u2014it\u2019s the kids. I don\u2019t want them judged because I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cOur conversations are private.\u201d He concentrated for a minute on the chocolate cake, which didn\u2019t get as much appreciation as it deserved.</p><p>Noah had a lot of experience counseling people who were down on their luck, many of them actually in need of food and shelter. He\u2019d seen worse than what Ellie was going through, but just the same he was mighty impressed by her toughness, her fearlessness. She wasn\u2019t dependent on him for anything. All she needed was a job chit to take back to that crooked judge in eighty-one days, collect her kids and get on with her life. Meantime, he\u2019d help her any way he could. He was glad he\u2019d taken a chance on her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed I had that job, you know,\u201d she said, lifting a bite of cake to her mouth. He lifted his eyes to hers. \u201cThe owner of the club\u2014he\u2019s a great guy who liked to take good care of his girls. And the funny thing was, the ones who didn\u2019t mind getting right down to cracks and nipples weren\u2019t always the most popular ones....\u201d</p><p>One end of Noah\u2019s mouth lifted in a half smile. Ellie laughed.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m a little too straightforward for you, huh?\u201d she asked. \u201cThing is, all I had to do was wiggle around with those pom-poms or the white nurse\u2019s hose held up with a garter belt and I did just fine. I think Madonna wore less on stage half the time than I did in that club. The people were usually nice, the customers didn\u2019t give us any trouble. \u2019Course, we had a plus-size bouncer, just in case. It was just work. It paid the bills. It\u2019s not something I wanted to do forever. I was always on the lookout for something better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have lost your kids over that job,\u201d he said. \u201cWorst case, they should have been left with you with visits from Child Welfare. They would have seen in no time that the job wasn\u2019t damaging to the children. That was crap, what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>She just looked at him for a long moment. Then very quietly she said, \u201cThanks. I guess coming from you, that\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing from me?\u201d he said, lifting one dark brow.</p> <p>\u201cYou being a minister, and everything. I know you don\u2019t approve of that kind of place\u2014or of the women in it.\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cEllie, I don\u2019t have an opinion about your last job. There\u2019s plenty about it to admire,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a mother who would do just about anything to take care of her kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, be real clear about that, Rev. If I hadn\u2019t lucked into that job, I would have done just about anything. When it comes to the kids, I\u2019m all out of false pride.\u201d</p><p>Soon, he thought, I\u2019m going to see her kids. And I bet I see something remarkable.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever want kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said quietly. A bunch of them, if possible. And so did Merry\u2014she wanted them right away. \u201cI think this little town church is going to be my kid for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I think the deal I got with Arnie was just what I deserved. I married him because I thought he was safe for me and the kids. He seemed all right, he made a decent living, he was okay that I had children while a lot of guys run for their lives when they find out you come with kids. I wasn\u2019t attracted to him, I wasn\u2019t in love with him. So maybe that\u2019s what I deserved, huh?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t have to consider it. \u201cNever think that,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one deserves cruelty of any kind. Not on their worst day.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the door opened and Mel came into the bar. She went first to Jack, lifting herself up to lean over the bar and give him a kiss. Then she turned and looked at Noah and Ellie. \u201cMel,\u201d Noah called. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>She walked over to their table. \u201cMel Sheridan, this is Ellie Baldwin. She\u2019s helping out in the church for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Mel said, putting out her hand. \u201cJack said there was someone new in town. How\u2019s it going over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first day, so it\u2019s looking pretty ugly,\u201d Ellie said honestly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not my first day, but Ellie got more done this morning than I\u2019ve managed in the last week. She\u2019s a whirlwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Very cute top, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked down, then lifted an eyebrow toward Noah before she said, \u201cThanks. Target. Under twenty bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I need to get over there one of these days. They usually have good buys. So, Ellie\u2014where do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Eureka now, but I have to find something closer\u2014I can\u2019t afford the gas. Would you happen to know of anything? Nearby?\u201d</p><p>Mel pulled up a chair. \u201cI can sure ask around. What are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kids are with my ex-husband right now, so all I need is a bed and a roof. Really, one room would do it for me. Something cheap, but not scary. His Holiness here doesn\u2019t exactly pay a lot.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cI know one thing that qualifies as cheap and real nice, but I think it might flunk the scary test. Right at the end of the block, nicest house down there, Jo Ellen and Nick Fitch have a great one-room efficiency over the garage. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve rented it out in a long time. Jo Ellen\u2019s a doll, a very nice lady. But she\u2019s married to a groper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? How serious a groper?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I met him, he treated me to a major butt grope while I had my back turned.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this exchange, Jack put a cup of coffee in front of his wife and used the pot to refill Ellie\u2019s and Noah\u2019s cups. \u201cMel drop-kicked him,\u201d Jack inserted. \u201cIt was a beautiful sight. I think that\u2019s when I really fell in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Ellie grinned widely. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lucky, that\u2019s all. I took a little self-defense course in college, I didn\u2019t think I even remembered any of it. But he snuck up on me and I just reacted. I threw him an elbow in the gut and then under the chin. One little swipe behind his heels and he was flat on his ass. Sorry, Noah\u2014I meant to say butt. Butt\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><p>Noah looked up at Jack. \u201cThe women in this place are rougher on the language than the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe now have a swear jar at home. David\u2019s college education will be paid for and we\u2019ll have a trip to Bermuda by the end of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have to put a swear jar in the church,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI could teach you that move,\u201d Mel said to Ellie, taking a sip from her cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I have some moves of my own, too. So, this guy\u2014is he dangerous? Or just frisky?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s dangerous, but I couldn\u2019t guarantee it,\u201d Mel answered. \u201cI\u2019d hate myself forever if you came to any harm from him. But, as the gossip goes, he\u2019s been slapped down by several women in this town. Too bad Jo Ellen hasn\u2019t hit him over the head with a big club. I can\u2019t believe she puts up with that behavior. Really, she\u2019s such a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick might have ideas all the time, but I think he\u2019s only frisky when he drinks,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHis problems usually come up during a party. Most of the time, when the town gets together, they do it here, they have food and drinks, and Nick loses his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question, Ellie,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could work,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cMel, would you be willing to introduce me to them, be there when I ask about the room? I\u2019d have to have a look at him, too. See if I think I could take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening,\u201d Noah muttered.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019m positive he\u2019s still scared of me. I know he\u2019s been slapped, but I hold the sole distinction of taking him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she put a boot on his chest to hold him down while she threatened his life,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I almost exploded with lust. I had to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Ellie sipped her coffee. \u201cWell, I\u2019m bigger than you are,\u201d she said to Mel. \u201cAnd I have Mace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could try starting with a firm warning,\u201d Mel suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou\u2019d rent from a guy who\u2019s a known molester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s be totally straight here\u2014is this just an idiot who gets stupid and cops a feel? Or has he left a trail of wounded victims in his path?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cSo far as I know, he\u2019s a laughingstock,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee that wouldn\u2019t escalate. Luke Riordan has some cabins on the river\u2014vacation rentals. Also one-room efficiencies with kitchenettes, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re more expensive. And from what I hear, he\u2019s done a brisk summer business\u2014full or almost full all the time with early reservations for hunting season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a tight budget,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cNo reason to be afraid of Nick,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI could take you down there and introduce you, threaten to sic my wife on him if he steps out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet one knee in the nuts straightens him right out,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>There was a strange sound from Noah, something of a growl. \u201cI don\u2019t like this idea at all. If this guy got fresh with you, I\u2019d have to deal with him. That wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorsefeathers,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be the best time to bring up the fact that she was having a tough time doing exactly that\u2014taking care of herself. And in almost exactly twenty-four hours Noah was already feeling the urge to deck the imbecile who would dare put a hand on her. It had been years since he\u2019d been in a fight; it wasn\u2019t nice for ministers to fight. He was supposed to counsel and pray his way out of tight spots.</p><p>One corner of his mouth lifted. Actually, he was competent in a fight. Didn\u2019t bother him in the least to engage, as long as it was fair.</p><p>Noah looked over at Allie. She hadn\u2019t completed her first day of work and already she was complicating his nice uncomplicated ministry.</p><p>Right at the end of the main street in Virgin River was a beautiful two-story home, freshly painted a pale yellow with white trim, just like three other houses on the block. But this one was large and pampered\u2014it looked almost new. The porch was wide, the lawn was lush and green, summer flowers grew thick and healthy along the walk and tall trees shaded the house from the summer sun. It had white shutters and rocking chairs on the porch. The driveway went around the side of the house to a detached two-car garage. There was a staircase on the outside leading to the room upstairs.</p><p>Mel had called Jo Ellen, learned the room was available to the right person and had set up an appointment. Noah would not be left behind, and so it was that the three of them stood on the porch of the lovely house and rang the bell. Jo Ellen Fitch came to the door with a smile on her face, but the second she saw Ellie, she gasped and covered her mouth with her hand. Then she shot a pleading look at Mel, which Mel completely ignored. Even dressed in overalls, no makeup, and her hair pulled up, Ellie was a striking young woman. She had a beautiful face and a drop-dead-gorgeous body that she made no attempt to downplay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Jo,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThis is Ellie Baldwin, who\u2019s looking for a room. And this is Reverend Noah Kincaid. You might have heard about him\u2014he\u2019s the new minister, fixing up the old church. Ellie works for him and needs a place to live. So, what do you think? Want to show her the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh, Mel,\u201d she said miserably.</p><p>\u201cYou can make up your mind about me later, Mrs. Fitch,\u201d Ellie said, taking charge. \u201cFirst things first\u2014let\u2019s see if I like the room. How about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said a bit nervously. She opened her front door, keys to the room in hand, and began to lead them toward the garage. Then she stopped suddenly and turned. \u201cOh, I apologize. How do you do, Reverend Kincaid? Miss Baldwin. This way.\u201d When they entered the room, Ellie went into a kind of daze. It was perfectly lovely\u2014a double bed with two bedside tables against one wall, a small bathroom with a tub and shower, and on one wall a minirefrigerator, two-burner stove, microwave, sink and a few cupboards. At the foot of the bed was a chest. A comfortable chair and ottoman sat in the corner. There was no closet, but rather a large armoire for clothes. It was finer than anything Ellie had ever lived in. In her life.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a TV in here or anything,\u201d Jo Ellen said.</p><p>The bed had a yellow floral comforter and lots of fat, decorative pillows. There was a picture of a meadow and barn over the bed, a full-length mirror on the bathroom door, a reading lamp behind the overstuffed chair. Ellie sighed. She fell in love with the room at once. \u201cDoes that phone work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Jo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a private line.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of a car in the driveway, followed by the slamming of the car door.</p> <p>\u201cAre there some plates and glasses?\u201d Ellie asked. \u201cA couple of pans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, some. Not much. And towels. This is kind of a one-person room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d Ellie laughed. \u201cI\u2019m exactly one person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing extra comes with the room,\u201d Jo said. \u201cNo housekeeping. You\u2019re on your own. There\u2019s no washer or dryer. I mean, it\u2019s not a bed-and-breakfast\u2014you\u2019d have to take care of all your own needs. Meals, laundry, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>There were feet on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI understand. There\u2019s probably a coin laundry somewhere nearby.\u201d</p> <p>The door opened and Nick walked into the room. \u201cWell, I thought there was company here.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Ellie smiled back. He was probably her height, wasn\u2019t all that bad looking and he was fit. His salt-and-pepper hair was still thick, his brows heavy and graying. He wore a short-sleeved shirt\u2014light blue\u2014with a bad tie that he\u2019d loosened, nice dress jeans and boots. His eyes glittered approvingly and he smiled at Ellie.</p><p>Jo Ellen cleared her throat and made introductions; everyone shook hands. \u201cHow much is the room, Mrs. Fitch?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>Jo Ellen opened her mouth to speak, when Nick interrupted her. \u201cHoney, is a hundred a month too much?\u201d Nick asked his wife.</p><p>\u201cWe usually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that sound, Ellie?\u201d Nick asked her.</p><p>\u201cVery reasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you find me acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a problem, if you work for the preacher, here,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cHow soon can I move in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ready when you are,\u201d he said. And he slipped an arm around his wife\u2019s waist and gave her a squeeze. \u201cRight, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any money or checks with me today. Can I settle up with you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine,\u201d Jo said, clearly not happy.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you. I think this will be perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. But when she looked between Mel and Noah, she saw doubtful expressions. Their expressions could have to do with that lascivious gleam in Nick\u2019s eye. \u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime tomorrow, Mrs. Fitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jo said, standing aside so everyone could go single file down the stairs. Noah followed Mel. Nick held the door open for his wife, then for Ellie.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Fitch\u2014can I talk to you a second?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart,\u201d he said.</p><p>She spoke to him at the top of the staircase while the others descended. They all stopped at the bottom while Nick listened to Ellie and actually seemed to back away from her. But she was smiling the entire time, smiling with a glow. Then she grabbed his hand in both of hers to shake it vigorously, and hurried down the stairs to join the others.</p><p>Everyone said their goodbyes. Nick and Jo Ellen went into their house while Noah, Ellie and Mel began walking back toward the bar and the church. \u201cYou sure about this, Ellie?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s going to be great. I love the room. The price is terrific, I\u2019m going to save a ton in gas, I can walk to work. And I\u2019ll be close enough to sneak away from the reverend here and catch a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a glimpse of Nick,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cI did. He agreed I\u2019ll be totally safe in that room.\u201d</p><p>Mel lifted a brow. \u201cI didn\u2019t see his lips move, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Ellie said. And then she walked on. \u201cIt\u2019s going to work out perfectly.\u201d When they got to the bar, Mel said goodbye. \u201cThank you so much, Mel,\u201d Ellie said, waving.</p><p>Noah walked Ellie to her little PT Cruiser that sat in front of the church. \u201cWhat went on while you two were out of earshot?\u201d he asked Ellie.</p><p>\u201cOh, Your Righteousness, you probably don\u2019t want to know. What if it makes you an accessory to the crime or something?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. Impatiently. \u201cJust lay it on me, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Come on. You smiled the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that part wasn\u2019t so easy. I wanted to smack him just from the look in his eye. I said, I know about you, so don\u2019t try anything. My boyfriend is a six-foot-five-inch bouncer in a mean bar and my father is a judge, and if you even exhale within twenty feet of my boobs, I\u2019m going to have your nuts on a platter. And then I\u2019m going to call my boyfriend and my father.\u201d</p><p>Noah was speechless for just a second, but then he burst out laughing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I think that\u2019s called a preemptive strike. Isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d he said, laughing in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cI got that room for a hundred bucks a month. And it\u2019s a great room.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou think that threat will hold?\u201d</p><p>She peered at him, lifting a corner of her mouth and an eyebrow at the same time. \u201cThat bouncer? He\u2019s a friend. I babysat for him and his wife a couple of times. He\u2019d come out here and scare the bejesus out of that imbecile if I asked him to. But before we even get to that, Mr. Nick has a date with my knee. And I know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>Noah just chuckled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI just want that room. It\u2019s the best room I\u2019ve ever seen. My gramma and I slept on a pullout sofa together my whole life. The only thing that could make that room prettier would be if my kids came with it.\u201d</p><p>Noah sobered. Two sentences hit him in the gut\u2014she slept on a pullout sofa bed her entire life? With her grandmother? They must have lived in one room. And her kids? It must have been so traumatic to leave her children with a guy she knew didn\u2019t love them. When they got better acquainted, he meant to ask more about that. \u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen will you move in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right away. I\u2019ll bring money and my stuff tomorrow. It\u2019ll just take one trip. Can I have a little time in the morning to unload the car? I\u2019d like to do it when Mr. Hands is at work. I plan to avoid him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the duplex?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat nice lady next door owns it. She\u2019ll let me go without a problem. She understands my situation. She\u2019s on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can move in one trip?\u201d he asked, looking at her car.</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cNoah, the kids have their clothes and toys with them. I have very little to move. Believe me, I live a one-trip existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car is full of stuff,\u201d Ellie said to Noah when she arrived at the church the next morning. Then she crouched in front of Lucy, grabbed her head in her hands and kissed her snout, receiving a lick in return. \u201cMorning, girlfriend. You\u2019re looking better every day.\u201d Then to Noah, \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like to take an hour to tote it up the stairs to my new residence. I just want to wait until Mr. Fitch has gone to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he asked, \u201cdid you leave anything behind? Or in storage somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s it. I travel light. So, what\u2019s on the schedule for today?\u201d</p><p>He tried not to let it show that he felt something cinch in his chest at the very idea she could fit all her worldly goods in the little PT Cruiser she drove. Up until he married, while working and going to school, he\u2019d had next to nothing, but that was different. He liked having a light load; it was all part of the changes he wanted to make in his life. But Ellie had a family! What about her grandmother\u2019s house, her grandmother\u2019s furniture\u2014the pullout sofa and piano? But asking about that would have to wait. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like you to get started painting the bathrooms today, if you think you can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can do it. I should probably change clothes. Around nine, I\u2019ll go move my stuff, but I\u2019ll wait till later to put it away. I\u2019ll grab something old and ratty to put on and get started. You have the paint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome yellow, some white, some blue. Can you work with that?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cHow were you planning to use them? One blue bathroom, one yellow, white trim? Because that\u2019s very boring.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her long fingernails. Today was hot pink with sparkles. He looked down\u2014she was wearing tennis shoes, but somehow he knew her toes matched her nails. Against his better judgment he said, \u201cUse it any way you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deal. Do you have any masking tape? Any caulking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight lines and edges. Just out of curiosity, how\u2019d you settle on those colors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were on sale,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shifted her weight to one foot. \u201cHave you ever actually had a church before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ll make something work with those colors. Even though they\u2019re pretty dorky colors....\u201d</p><p>He had a fleeting thought that this was not the woman to be lecturing him about good taste in anything. \u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit afraid I might take that personally? Maybe I\u2019m sensitive about the colors I picked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, tilting her head and peering at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not gay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>And she smiled, her hands on her hips. \u201cObviously. Or you\u2019d have chosen more interesting colors.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. He watched her walk toward the upstairs bathroom in her shrink-wrap jeans. He squinted. He followed, Lucy ever at his side. She had a tattoo peeking out of the back of her low-rise jeans, right in the small of her back. \u201cI...ah...have an old painting shirt you can throw over your clothes, if you\u2019d like. Would that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks. After I get my stuff out of the car, I\u2019ll put on my old sweats. You have all the supplies for me to get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStacked outside the bathroom in the hall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuper. I\u2019ll start up here and, when I\u2019m done, I can move it downstairs. Let me check it out, make sure you have everything I\u2019ll need.\u201d She knelt on one knee, checking out the supplies, showing more of that tattoo, but he still wasn\u2019t able to make out what it was. She looked over her shoulder. \u201cNoah, can you round up the masking tape and caulk? And get me a screwdriver and hammer, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrewdriver? Hammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take the door and mirror off. Open paint cans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cWant me to help with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just get me what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. But he stood there, his eyes riveted on that tattoo.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder again. \u201cIt\u2019s called a tramp stamp,\u201d she said. \u201cI got it when I was fifteen, to be cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s called. I just can\u2019t make out what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vines in the shape of my name, and I\u2019m not showing you any more of it. Let\u2019s get this show on the road, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, going off to his toolbox. And he thought, I\u2019m taking orders from her. Why am I not the least bit surprised?</p><p>After he delivered what she asked for, she completely ignored him, so he took Lucy to his office. He heard Ellie humming, moving around the drop cloth, pounding at the hinges to remove the door. She didn\u2019t ask questions, nor did she need any help with the heavy door or with the mirror over the sink. He could hear her peeling off strips of masking tape for the borders. Completely self-sufficient and low maintenance. That\u2019s what a good pastor\u2019s assistant was, whether painting or managing the office. Now, that did surprise him.</p><p>Before sitting down to make a renovation list, Noah decided to tour the old building once more. The church was large but simple. Upstairs was a sanctuary that could hold about three hundred people. There were large double doors at the east end of the church that opened onto a foyer. From here, four wide stairs led up to the sanctuary level and a wider foyer\u2014wide enough for a staging area, as for the gathering of a bridal party. Large interior double doors opened to the aisle, which led toward the stained-glass window, then two more steps led up to a deep stage that had room for the altar, the pulpit, a couple of choir pews. Up here Noah would find room for the piano that had been Merry\u2019s.</p><p>There were doors to the right and left at the front of the church. To the left was the pastor\u2019s office\u2014a room large enough for his desk, shelves and filing cabinets plus a big round table for meetings. Outside that office, the stairs led down to the basement and a side exit door. On the other side of the sanctuary was another room of equal size that could serve as a secretary\u2019s office and library. Right next to that room was the upstairs bathroom. Just a sink and toilet, of course, but it had taken the strain off his RV bath facilities. They seemed to be in perfect working order, even though they hadn\u2019t been used in years. And that was it\u2014no classrooms. But the basement could be divided with movable panels.</p><p>Noah went to his office and set about making a list of things to talk about with the local builder. Paul Haggerty was a friend of Jack\u2019s and was going to work on the remodel. That big basement room with a kitchen would make a great community hall, once finished. Right now the walls were plain cinder block and needed texturing. The ceiling was stained from mystery leaks that should be checked out before new ceiling panels were hung. The floor was hard, cold concrete and could use a subfloor covered in tile.</p> <p>The sanctuary was in pretty good shape, if a little beat up. If he rented a sander, he could finish the hardwood floors himself, but the ceiling was much too high and would require scaffolding.</p><p>He had ordered pews, an altar, a pulpit, a baptistery and a new desk for his office. The pews were an extravagance\u2014they could make do with folding chairs. But the pews would be beautiful; he wanted them and there was enough money. Once done, the sanctuary would be breathtaking. And while Noah would enjoy doing all the work himself, it was his mission to get the church open for business as soon as possible. Paul could undoubtedly help with that.</p><p>Maybe while Paul was handling the walls and ceiling of the sanctuary, he could be painting the offices. He and Ellie, he thought. He heard her faint humming. She seemed completely capable. If the bathroom didn\u2019t end up painted in stripes or polka dots, he might ask for her input on colors for the offices.</p><p>She popped her head into his office. \u201cI\u2019m going to run home, unload the car, change into painting clothes and come back. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to take you up on that offer of your old shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ll have it here when you get back.\u201d</p><p>Less than an hour later, she was back wearing sweats and a tank top. It seemed everything Ellie owned fit snugly, without a pleat, gather or wrinkle to spare or rattle around in. Fitted to that extraordinary body with those incredibly long legs Ellie managed to make old sweats look sexy. She\u2019d had two children\u2014how\u2019d she manage her flat stomach and high, full breasts? Surgery? Somehow he couldn\u2019t imagine her spending money on plastic surgery if she didn\u2019t even own a couch.</p><p>He handed her one of his blue work shirts, already decorated with a little old paint. He was very happy to see her put it over her sweats and tank. Then he observed with some consternation that she looked every bit as pretty and sexy in that oversize shirt. Thank goodness she got right back to work. Humming. Sometimes actually singing, too softly for him to make out words, but it was very pleasant. Every once in a while Lucy meandered from his office to the bathroom and Noah would hear Ellie say, \u201cHey there, girlfriend. How\u2019s it going? Bored?\u201d</p><p>Around eleven in the morning, he checked on Ellie. In just a couple of hours, she had taped off all the edges and was almost done trimming the baseboards in white. When she heard him in the doorway, she looked up from her place on the floor and a coppery curl fell over her forehead. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at her\u2014she looked cute as the dickens with her hair piled on top of her head and drowning in his shirt. Besides, there wasn\u2019t a bubble or streak on those baseboards. It was perfect.</p> <p>\u201cAre you extra happy today?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI might be,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI talked to my kids last night and gave them my new phone number. I\u2019ll talk to them tonight and then tomorrow I\u2019ll pick them up at eight in the morning for the day. I\u2019m thinking of showing them my new apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, tomorrow\u2019s Saturday. Your day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventy-nine days to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a very nice job there, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I know how to paint. I have a knack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me. I\u2019m going to put that talent to good use. Listen, I have some errands to do. I might not be back before you\u2019re through today. I\u2019m going to leave Lucy in the RV. I want you to help yourself to the lunch fixings in the refrigerator in the RV. There\u2019s sandwich stuff and fruit, bottled water and soda.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled around to her knees. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Rev. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to, but it seems only fair. I could either raise your pay to eight twenty-five an hour or offer you lunch. I went with the lunch idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually a very nice guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I\u2019m a man of God. Don\u2019t you expect nice?\u201d Then he grinned.</p><p>\u201cDoes God know you\u2019re throwing his name around to impress people?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThe RV is unlocked. Take a nice long break. Would you mind letting Lucy out to do her business? And try not to get paint on my dog or my La-Z-Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a La-Z-Boy? Oh, brother. You\u2019re certainly not gay....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they sound when you talked to them?\u201d he asked. He hadn\u2019t planned to ask, but it popped out. \u201cThe kids\u2014how did they sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fair. Not happy. They were a little emotional. They want me to come and get them right now and they\u2019re having a real hard time understanding why I can\u2019t. But they didn\u2019t sound scared or hurt or anything. And I was as nice to Arnie as I could manage\u2014I told him I was working things out so the judge would be happy with my job, and that I had a new place that was small but perfect. He was a jerk, but he promised to take good care of the kids. \u2018They\u2019re in better hands than they were, Ellie,\u2019\u201d she mimicked. \u201cSchool starts soon and he goes to his office every day, getting ready for classes to start, and takes them with him. The school secretary keeps an eye on them. They miss me, but they\u2019re safe. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must be very tough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, but I\u2019ll have them tomorrow. I\u2019ll be able to see how they\u2019re really doing.\u201d And then she smiled at him.</p><p>Four</p><p>The only plan Noah had for Saturday morning was to take life slow and easy. While Ellie was with her kids, the church would be quiet. He began the day with a leisurely cup of coffee, checked his e-mail, listened to his stomach growl. \u201cIs that you or me?\u201d he asked Lucy. He heard it again. \u201cOkay, me. We should think about breakfast.\u201d He looked at Lucy. \u201cI\u2019m talking to a dog.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at him with questioning eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Jack\u2019s,\u201d he said. And Lucy followed obligingly.</p><p>While Lucy had her breakfast on the porch, Noah had his at the bar. He sat beside a local rancher and commiserated on the price of fuel, visited with Preacher for a while and discussed next week\u2019s menu ideas, listened to Jack brag about the great progress his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Rick, was making as he adjusted to a prosthetic leg. Then he took his coffee out to the porch to soak in a little of that sunshine.</p><p>One of the best things about having a dog, Noah had realized, was that she usually drew a crowd, and that meant he got to know a lot of people. Noah had noticed the majority of dogs around these parts were herders, working dogs. One of his favorite visitors was young Christopher, Preacher\u2019s son. Chris had a pup named Comet, a border collie by the looks of him and, at a few months of age, was already almost as large as Lucy. Since dogs weren\u2019t allowed in the bar, Chris and Comet visited with Noah and Lucy on the porch.</p><p>Around noon, Noah finally ambled back over to the church, intending to take his good old time with the newspaper. He got set up in the church office, glanced at the lists on his desk before spreading out the weekend edition. He could, of course, help out with the painting of the bathrooms, but he didn\u2019t want Ellie to think her work was less than adequate, so he gave up on that idea and got back to the sports pages.</p><p>He heard a sound and cocked his head to listen. There was movement in the church, so he went off to investigate, but Lucy beat him to it\u2014she was already looking in the doorway of the upstairs bathroom, tail wagging.</p><p>There was Ellie, wearing his long, oversize blue work shirt, painting the top half of the bathroom walls yellow. She must have heard Noah approach, but she didn\u2019t say a word. She didn\u2019t even turn to look at him. And she wasn\u2019t humming. She was working that paint roller with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPainting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the kids?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and looked at him and her expression was at once furious and completely broken. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let me have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>She lowered the roller to the pan on the floor. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let them speak to me on the phone last night and wouldn\u2019t let them come with me this morning. He said they had misbehaved and were grounded. They were disrespectful to him by complaining to me that they wanted to leave. My God, they\u2019re babies! They want their mother! When I told him we had a court order, he told me to take it to the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, did you call the judge?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled her eyes before leveling them at him. \u201cA\u2014the judge is not on my side, and B\u2014he\u2019s not around on Saturdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police? Now come on, Rev. Do the police get into stuff like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been in situations in the past where they have, though not in this state. He has to turn over the kids on your scheduled days. He\u2019s been ordered by the court. He\u2019s in contempt. He could go to jail. Or at least be fined or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your lips to God\u2019s ears. Listen,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m pissed as hell about this, plus my kids are all torn up. I left them crying and begging and clawing for me with Arnie holding them back and threatening them. But I\u2019m afraid of him, you know? Afraid he\u2019ll take it out on them or something.\u201d</p><p>Noah thought for a second. Then he said, \u201cWait a minute\u2014did he suggest you resolve this problem by moving back in with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but he did say we could\u2019ve been a family if I hadn\u2019t been so impossible. That\u2019s not true, by the way. I tried\u2014for two months and twenty-six days. He\u2019s the stubbornest, most unreasonable man I\u2019ve ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, pulling her out of the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell...? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He stopped right at his office door and slowly unbuttoned the paint-splattered work shirt that she wore. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go get your kids. It\u2019s your day.\u201d</p><p>He hung the shirt on his office doorknob. He looked at her low-cut, sleeveless T-shirt, her tight jeans. He sighed. Well, this was Ellie. No doubt this had always been Ellie. And he was in a position he\u2019d never been in before in his life\u2014he liked her just fine the way she was. The fact that he worried about the judgment of others made him furious with himself.</p><p>\u201cI have to rinse my roller, my pan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time. Let\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cIf the paint dries on the roller...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a new roller tomorrow,\u201d he said. He crouched and looked deeply into Lucy\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou stay here. Take a nap. No painting.\u201d Then he pulled Ellie out of the side door of the church. \u201cIf you\u2019re right, and it sounds like you are, he wants you back. Ellie, do you think he cares about your kids? Do you think he wants them, on any level?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids annoy him. He doesn\u2019t do things with them, like play or read or anything. He wants them quiet, neat, invisible. All kids annoy him. Really, he\u2019s the last person who should be the principal of an elementary school....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate school, you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, private. More money there, he said.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brain was working. Maybe a small private school wasn\u2019t so picky about things like credentials, and past work problems. Noah wondered what Arnie\u2019s employment history would reveal. \u201cHe\u2019s punishing you, Ellie. Don\u2019t buckle. Let\u2019s go get your kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do to him what you did to Nick Fitch\u2014but I\u2019m going to do it in a pure ministerial, manipulative and threatening kind of way.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take your car so we have room for the kids. I\u2019ll drive. Now, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled into a neighborhood in Redway, just north of Garberville. The houses were a lot alike in shape and size, but were painted a variety of colors. Most had two stories with dormer windows, porches, detached garages and front walks. Some boasted pampered lawns and summer flowers, some weren\u2019t quite so well loved. They were all what Noah would consider small\u2014maybe three bedrooms, as well as attics and basements. They were all nestled into tall trees.</p> <p>Noah drove very slowly because kids were playing in the street. There were a few riding their bikes around in circles while a group in the center appeared to be playing kickball. A couple of parents were busy with the usual Saturday chores\u2014cutting the lawn, digging in the garden, washing the car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that house,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cThere\u2019s a black SUV in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your kids out here?\u201d he asked. As he drove slowly down the street, the legion of kids separated to let his car pass.</p><p>\u201cNo. Arnie doesn\u2019t let them play outside unsupervised. And he doesn\u2019t have time to supervise, so they never had a chance to make friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what I should expect?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cHe\u2019s a chameleon, Noah. He fooled me for quite a while. The school secretary worships him, she thinks he\u2019s a kind, devout man, who\u2019s strict and doesn\u2019t put up with bad behavior, but he\u2019s beyond strict. He can be nice when it suits him. His favorite saying is, \u2018Speak softly and carry a big stick.\u2019 His other favorite is, \u2018Children should be seen and not heard.\u2019 By now the neighbors hate him because he\u2019s antisocial and wouldn\u2019t allow the kids to interact with their kids. He\u2019ll probably be very nice to you, but don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d</p><p>Like that\u2019s new to me, Noah thought. A lot of people treated him with deference and extreme politeness when they\u2019d prefer not to talk to him at all. They were talking to the minister, not the man. Not only that, but his father had been that kind of man\u2014a charmer at church and a demon at home. That experience gave him an edge\u2014he knew exactly what he would be dealing with.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no TV in the house, what\u2019s he doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his laptop all the time. All the time. He carries it around with him. When I got too close and might see what he was doing, he\u2019d close it. My babysitter, from the duplex? She said he might be playing games. You know\u2014real complicated games that have other people online from all over the place? Or maybe he\u2019s looking at dirty pictures. Lord, I have no idea. But that\u2019s what keeps him busy all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019m on my laptop a lot, too. But you can read over my shoulder anytime and just get bored to death.\u201d He pulled alongside the curb at the front walk. \u201cDo me a favor and stay in the car, for right now at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, already out of her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to give him a chance to preserve his manhood, which will be hard for him to do in front of you. Let me try reasoning with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you better watch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a naive goody-goody, Ellie. Ministers deal with more dysfunctional people than strippers do, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re right,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cStay in the car and don\u2019t ruin my show.\u201d And with that, he got out and strode purposefully up the walk.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have surprised him that his knock was not answered. He rang the bell, he knocked again, he rang and knocked and hoped it was becoming increasingly obvious that he wasn\u2019t going to stop. Finally the door opened and the man standing there looked completely composed and not in the least ruffled. Ellie hadn\u2019t mentioned he was a big, ugly guy. Oh, man, how Arnie must have lusted after Ellie! This was not a guy who had a long line of women waiting to hook up with him.</p><p>Arnie smiled without showing any teeth and there was a slight tic in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cArnie Gunterson?\u201d Noah asked, putting out his hand.</p><p>\u201cArnold Gunterson,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally when people don\u2019t answer the door, they\u2019re either not at home or not interested in company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Reverend Noah Kincaid, and I knew you were home because your car\u2019s in the driveway,\u201d he said, his hand still out.</p><p>Arnie burst out laughing, but there was not an ounce of humor in his eyes. \u201cReverend?\u201d he asked, looking Noah up and down. So what if he was wearing worn jeans and a plaid flannel shirt over a waffled, gray, long-sleeved T-shirt? \u201cReverend of what? The church of hope and BS?\u201d</p><p>Noah tried to ignore him, though it did briefly cross his mind to get that haircut and some of what he always called \u201ctown clothes.\u201d \u201cForgive me for being so determined, but it is imperative I speak with you before calling the police department,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you go to the police? Is it against the law not to answer the door?\u201d</p><p>Noah finally pulled back his hand. Arnie was six feet or so and broad shouldered, but he was thick around the middle. He looked about forty years old and had an awful big head. His light brown hair was going thin, but it was neatly combed back from a long, wide forehead. His face was slightly flushed, suggesting he had high blood pressure or had been holding in some anger. Noah glanced at the hands that hung at Arnie\u2019s sides; they were loose and relaxed. \u201cNot at all, Mr. Gunterson. It\u2019s against the law to defy a court-ordered visitation agreement. Miss Baldwin is in my car. She\u2019s my employee, she works for the Virgin River Presbyterian Church now. And while she was willing to let the matter go, I thought it was important for her to see her children, and I insisted on stepping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have. The situation is under control.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed indulgently. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cShe needs to see the kids and, from what she told me about her attempt to pick them up this morning, they need to see her. I am sure we can work it out. If we talked about it.\u201d</p><p>Arnie\u2019s eyebrows came together in a frown. \u201cIs that what you thought? Well, the kids are having time-out. We had talked about how they would behave if they wanted a special day with their mother. No crying, yelling, complaining or throwing fits. No begging. They haven\u2019t been with me very long, so acting appropriately is new to them. Their mother never bothered to discipline them. Or take care of them at all, for that matter. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be on their good behavior by next weekend, but I thank you for your concern.\u201d He backed into the house and attempted to close the door in Noah\u2019s face.</p><p>But Noah\u2019s hand came out fast, hitting the door and preventing it from closing. \u201cBut see, that\u2019s not in the court orders\u2014concessions, loopholes and time-outs. I have a copy if you\u2019ve lost yours,\u201d he lied. \u201cYou have custody for ninety days until the judge revisits the issue, and your ex-wife has a visit every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. It\u2019s a legal document, Mr. Gunterson. At the very least, I\u2019ll get us an escort from the police or sheriff\u2019s department. But if we have to haggle over this more than five more minutes, I\u2019ll get help from the police. And I\u2019ll be in court Monday morning with Miss Baldwin and an attorney. Because you can\u2019t do this to her or the children. It\u2019s cruel. We have to work it out. Or fight it out.\u201d</p><p>Arnie smiled meanly. \u201cWell now. I guess she\u2019s got you under her spell.\u201d</p><p>Noah returned the smile and met his eyes. Noah was determined to set a good example by his behavior, but nothing would have felt better than dragging this son of a bitch out of the house and beating the crap out of him. I could wipe the floor with him; he\u2019s totally out of shape, Noah thought. He\u2019s just a big fat bully. Yet all Noah said was, \u201cEntirely.\u201d</p><p>Arnie chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that. See, Ellie has a very strong tendency to stretch the truth. She\u2019s not usually honest with the facts. Believing what she says usually carries a big price. You just have no idea.\u201d</p><p>If there was one thing Noah had figured out in only a couple of days, Ellie was painfully honest. She could have come up with much more flattering tales about her predicament than she had. \u201cI\u2019ll probably pay a visit to the judge anyway, just to assure him that Miss Baldwin has herself a good job with the local church, has a nice little apartment right on the same street for very affordable rent and has already collected some well-respected friends around town. I might let that go another week or two, depending. You could sweeten the pot by letting the kids pack an overnight bag.\u201d Noah glowered at Arnie meaningfully. \u201cSince they missed most of the day with their mom, and all. Mr. Gunterson, knowing how decent and fair-minded you are, wouldn\u2019t that be a generous gesture on your part? The judge would have a hard time believing you\u2019re just a cruel, vindictive bastard if you did something nice like that.\u201d And then Noah smiled. Meanly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arnie was speechless for a moment. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing with, do you?\u201d</p><p>Noah let out his breath slowly. Unfortunately he did. He grew up with one of them. \u201cI just thought we\u2019d both be happiest if we negotiated. Met each other halfway. Because if we go head-to-head, physically or legally, I\u2019m going to win. Trust me. Now\u2014give the kids a break here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do that, it\u2019ll take me all week to get \u2019em back into shape.\u201d</p> <p>Noah pushed the door open a little more, pushing it against Arnie. \u201cWatch that, Arnold,\u201d he threatened. \u201cYou\u2019re already on thin ice here. You\u2019re not going to get away with anything. You treat those kids harshly and it\u2019s going to come back on you so hard, you\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s my fault they haven\u2019t been raised right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, go real easy on them. And I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d he asked coolly, totally unafraid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn straight. Now, get the kids. I\u2019m getting tired of trying so hard with you.\u201d</p> <p>Arnie seemed to think about this. Then he said, \u201cYou sure you\u2019re a preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplete with two master\u2019s degrees, a ton of money and a load of local influence.\u201d He faced him down squarely. Noah was just a hair taller than Arnie, but his arms and shoulders were strong, his neck thick, his chest hard, and while Arnie had that generous spare tire, Noah had a six-pack. He looked Arnie in the eyes easily. And there was only one, maybe two lies in what he had said, and he considered them small ones. His money did not amount to a lot after spending on the church, and he thought maybe his influence went as far as the local bartender. Period. But what the heck. These were innocent children. And no matter what Ellie had done for a living, this bastard was bad. Yet there was nothing about Ellie that was bad. Just nothing.</p><p>Noah\u2019s little secret was\u2014he had a bit of a temper. It didn\u2019t take all that much to push his buttons\u2014especially over matters of injustice. He\u2019d been trying real hard to be one of those turn-the-other-cheek kind of guys, but it wasn\u2019t going that well. Injustice like this ranked right up there as something that made him fighting mad. And he was damn sure going to research Arnold a little further.</p><p>\u201cStay out here,\u201d Arnie said. \u201cI\u2019ll get the kids ready. And don\u2019t ever pull this again or you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Noah wanted to slap back many retorts and threats. But he said nothing. He stood. And stood. And stood. He cast a glance over his shoulder at Ellie, waiting impatiently in the car, confusion and anxiety all over her face. It was a good ten minutes before the door opened again.</p><p>Arnie appeared alone in the doorway. He looked behind him and said, \u201cStay! I said stay!\u201d as if the kids were dogs in training. Then to Noah he said, \u201cShe can keep them overnight if she\u2019ll get them back by four tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can do that. I\u2019ll make sure of it. And I\u2019ll come along to bring them home, just so we\u2019re sure we\u2019re all on the same page here.\u201d From the look on Arnie\u2019s face it was pretty clear that he understood the subtext of Noah\u2019s comments.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re sleeping with her?\u201d Arnie asked.</p><p>Noah was momentarily stunned. \u201cDid you seriously ask me that?\u201d he said, shocked. He shook his head and laughed unhappily. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s my employee. People can respect and help each other without there being a sexual agenda. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with Ellie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a tramp.\u201d</p><p>Noah ground his teeth, his eyes narrowed and his fists clenched. He was seconds away from the happiest moment of his life, when he broke this guy\u2019s nose. But there was a miracle. He didn\u2019t move at all, and simply said, \u201cLet the kids go to their mother now.\u201d</p><p>Arnie stepped back, gave his head a nod and let the kids past. \u201cMind your manners,\u201d he called after them, and his voice was controlled, civil, as though he meant well. It made Noah\u2019s head spin. It was just as Ellie had said, this guy had two sides\u2014both of them creepy.</p><p>The children each carried small backpacks for overnight, and they tried to walk slowly, until they were halfway to the car, until Ellie\u2019s door came open, and then they lost control and broke into a run. Ellie fell to her knees and they flung themselves into her arms.</p><p>There was so much kissing and hugging and crying, it made Noah nervous. He saw that Arnie watched for a moment, then closed the door. He heard the dead bolt slide. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Noah said, trying to shepherd them into the car. \u201cKids in the back, seat belts, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the car, kids,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThis is Reverend Kincaid, my new boss. This is Danielle and Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d he said. \u201cJust call me Noah. Come on, let\u2019s get outta here, huh?\u201d</p><p>When he was behind the wheel, his brain went into overdrive. Would Arnie call the police and insist the kids had been kidnapped by a small-town preacher? Would they suffer even more when they were returned because Arnie felt he had lost ground? What could happen to these kids a few weeks down the road? Was there any way to assure their safety? How would Ellie survive if something happened to them and she felt it was her fault?</p><p>Noah listened as Ellie and the kids discussed the situation. \u201cHe said we were good enough today so we could spend the night. But we have to be back by four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Ellie asked Noah. \u201cDid he say they could stay over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said we have to mind our manners and behave if we ever want another visit. Mommy, I have been doing my manners,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my please and thank-yous, I\u2019ve been keeping Trevor from crying at night.\u201d</p><p>Noah thought furiously, that son of a bitch let them think they had earned their visit by being \u201cgood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d Ellie said, tears in her voice. \u201cTrevor, have you been scared?\u201d</p><p>He nodded piteously and reached for his mother, the seat belt holding him in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Trev\u2014you\u2019re very brave,\u201d she told him, holding his hand. \u201cDid you bring your books?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Danielle said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to bring them. We only have two now. Arnie said they keep us from paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. How upside down is that? A school principal who doesn\u2019t want kids to read? Okay, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. When we get back to my new place and drop Noah off at his church, we\u2019ll go to the bookstore at the mall in Eureka. We\u2019ll buy books for you to keep at my house. And there\u2019s a library in town\u2014they have books for children. Every week I\u2019ll get new ones for you to look at when you have Saturdays with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you and the kids to lunch, or early dinner, or whatever it is, then to the bookstore for books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>But no one could manage against that big, mean cretin. \u201cAnd then, we\u2019re going to get some legal help. Right away.\u201d</p><p>It took a long time for the tension from the escape to wear away, but it did. Noah asked the kids where they most wanted to go for lunch and they picked McDonald\u2019s. Ellie said, \u201cThat\u2019s a big treat. We couldn\u2019t do that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, today it\u2019s my treat,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThis is...Well, I wish you wouldn\u2019t do so much. I\u2019ll buy. Let me buy. I don\u2019t want to owe you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cI want to do this.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer to him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be a charity case, Rev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re a friend. Let it go at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I rank friend so quick?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? You cleaned the kitchen. Painted the bathroom. Nice job, too. Just looking at how you paint your nails, I was afraid. I was very afraid.\u201d</p><p>And she laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good. We\u2019ll get along fine if you stay a little on edge like that.\u201d</p><p>Children are almost too resilient sometimes, Noah thought. They were so excited to be having McDonald\u2019s, they perked right up and forgot all the stuff that had them anxious and scared in the car. He delivered their orders while Ellie found a booth. Of course, she sat on one side with the kids, an arm around each one, and they talked about a trip to the bookstore. She promised to read to them a little bit and buy them two books each.</p><p>Noah wanted to buy them ten books each. And clothes\u2014they were growing out of theirs. For a guy who couldn\u2019t seem to work up any excitement about his own wardrobe, he was surprised to be angry about the state of theirs. Couldn\u2019t Arnie, who claimed to be the better parent, do something about that? Apparently Arnie had no talent beyond disciplining and punishing. Noah wanted to make a big run through Target and make sure the kids had clothes and shoes that weren\u2019t too small, too worn and too scuffed. He knew Ellie\u2019s funds were limited, but what about the big shot who was going to do better by them? But he kept his mouth shut; it wasn\u2019t his place and he\u2019d been pushy enough.</p><p>At the bookstore he told her to take all the time she wanted\u2014hours if she felt like it. \u201cI want to graze, myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be happy in a bookstore forever. Just relax and enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Noah picked up book after book, reading the jackets, skimming first pages, but unlike his usual bookstore crawls, he couldn\u2019t keep his mind on all the choices. Every so often he\u2019d wander over to the children\u2019s section. He saw them cuddled close to their mother while she read. The next time he checked, he saw Danielle close to her mom while Trevor pillaged the stacks for the next book. Then he peeked and saw Trevor on her lap while Danielle sat nearby, reading her own book. The last time he looked, Trevor was asleep on Ellie\u2019s lap while she read to her daughter.</p><p>If the judge saw this, would it matter? he asked himself.</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t only watching Ellie and her children or browsing for books\u2014he was also people watching. He wandered through the mall a couple of times. He\u2019d been out of the mainstream of life for quite a while; he was either working in the fishing trade, attending the seminary or teaching at a conservative university. The students and staff were pretty buttoned down, more right wing than left. They certainly hadn\u2019t looked Amish\u2014there were plenty of tight and ragged jeans, short skirts, but they didn\u2019t push the limits much. He\u2019d been in a monastery, of sorts, where the culture was cautious. He had probably stood out the most, refusing to wear the standard V-neck sweater or herringbone jacket to teach in. As a professor he looked like he looked right now\u2014very casual. He had acquired a suit for his wedding, and he wore it again for Merry\u2019s funeral. He didn\u2019t like the idea of suiting up for future church services.</p><p>But here, in the bookstore and mall, there were hip young women, mothers and otherwise. He saw bare midriffs, pierced belly buttons, tattoos poking out of low-slung jeans and a rose on the top of the rise of a breast. He hadn\u2019t seen much body art at his teaching job, but it was popular around the docks and he had even acquired his own tattoos while working as a fisherman. Ellie\u2019s clothing might be a little racy for a church lady, but by contemporary standards, she fit right in. Well, except that it was hard to find anyone as beautiful, or as sexy.</p><p>And why wouldn\u2019t a woman with those assets\u2014height, figure, thick hair, ivory skin\u2014want to look pretty? Sexy? Her means might be slim, but in her own way she was making the most of what she had.</p><p>He smiled and admitted to himself that he found Ellie a lot of fun. Edgy and authentic and full of delightful mischief. Seeing her with her kids gladdened Noah\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they were finally back in the car, each child hanging on to two books, he said, \u201cWell, anyone hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuffed,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cKids? Hungry?\u201d They shook their heads. \u201cWe\u2019ll just head home, Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for asking. That\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>It was only 5:00 p.m. They\u2019d had their McDonald\u2019s at two\u2014they\u2019d get hungry. Ellie hadn\u2019t been planning on an overnight visit. \u201cI bet you could use a run by the grocery store before going home, to stock up for your sleepover,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mind? I\u2019m sure you have to get back to Lucy and I can just head out after I take you back to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Lucy is fine. She probably has that second bathroom painted by now. We\u2019ll stop at the store on our way home. You\u2019ll need something for tonight, after the hamburgers wear off. And breakfast. As for tomorrow\u2014don\u2019t take them back to Redway without me. I want him to know there\u2019s some scrutiny. That you have backup. Let me take you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Noah, it\u2019s Sunday. You probably have things to do. Don\u2019t you have religious things to do?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he thought. I have to stand in that empty church and remember what community really means. What shoring up your friends and neighbors is all about. What the real blessings are\u2014they\u2019re small of stature, they\u2019re young, they\u2019re innocent and they have to be protected. \u201cI\u2019m free all day, but I won\u2019t interfere with your family time. I\u2019ll be ready to take you in time for your deadline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Danielle asked from the backseat. She pronounced it \u201cMumma.\u201d \u201cCan we stay with you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust for tonight, angel. Arnie thinks he can do a better job, and so does the judge, and we have to give him some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mama, he doesn\u2019t do his manners,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like us very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, all we can do is go along for now. The judge said ninety days, and we\u2019re getting through it, then it will work out. Try not to let your feelings be hurt when he doesn\u2019t mind his manners. Just do your best. And please, baby, please know that I will never ever be disappointed in you. I\u2019m proud of you every second. We\u2019ll all do our very best and soon it will be over.\u201d She smiled at her daughter over her shoulder. \u201cMy gramma used to call it \u2018Go along to get along.\u2019 That\u2019s what we have to do\u2014go along for now. Pretty soon, we\u2019ll be together. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Danielle sniffed a little. \u201cOh, Mama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to let my feelings hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Danny. But when we don\u2019t have a choice, we have to be tough. I know how strong you are. You can get through this. And then, when it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll hold you and cuddle you every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mama,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Danielle. I\u2019m proud of you for trying so hard.\u201d But when Ellie said that last, her voice caught. She shook herself. \u201cWell, having to be strong is no big deal to us, huh? Because we\u2019re very strong! We love each other, and it makes us very strong. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d was all the little girl said.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s very hard,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI know, honey. It\u2019s very hard for me, too. I miss you so much it makes me want to cry. But I\u2019m trying to be as brave as you. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Noah thought he might have to pull over to the side of the road, put his head down and have a bone-deep cry himself. When he pulled into the grocery-store lot, he forced himself to let her be the parent, to be independent and do her own shopping. He offered to keep the kids while she went into the store, but of course she couldn\u2019t be separated from them for a second. They returned a few minutes later with only two shopping bags, but she must have indulged the kids, because they were happy again. They chattered about little pizzas, popcorn, cereal, juice and milk.</p><p>He dropped them off right at the back stairs to her rented room and watched them clamber up. Just as he was about to walk back down the street, Jo Ellen Fitch came out on her porch. She watched Ellie and her children go up the stairs. To Noah she said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t mention kids. I\u2019m not really set up for kids here.\u201d</p><p>When Noah looked at her, his expression was grim. \u201cGimme a break. It\u2019s overnight, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d Jo asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re with her ex-husband right now. She only sees them on weekends. Try to be nice about it. They mean everything to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be nice about it,\u201d she said, sounding affronted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for her, so let\u2019s all be generous,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jo Ellen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Fitch. It\u2019s been a rough day for them.\u201d For me, he thought. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be very kind to them. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He thought he should probably go someplace quiet and just pray until he fainted or lost bladder control, but instead he collected Lucy and went to Jack\u2019s. He leashed Lucy while she ate, and he went into the bar, his throat dry and aching. He asked for ice water.</p><p>\u201cAnything to eat or drink with that?\u201d Jack asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, thanks,\u201d Noah said. And then he sat, pondering the water in his glass, thinking. He\u2019d been close to more than one difficult domestic situation in his career, especially as a counselor. Some of them had been more dramatic than Ellie\u2019s, frankly. But this time it felt personal. Just listening to Danielle in the backseat of his car, her voice barely controlled, \u201cMama...\u201d It tore his heart out.</p><p>\u201cYou getting hungry?\u201d Jack asked him a while later.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHaving trouble with the cleanup next door?\u201d Jack asked, obviously trying to pin down the reason for Noah\u2019s unusually quiet mood.</p><p>Noah lifted his eyes to Jack\u2019s face. \u201cI have a situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Jack said. He nodded to Noah\u2019s glass. \u201cYou haven\u2019t downed that water yet. And you don\u2019t have much to say, either. Which is a first.\u201d</p><p>Noah took a breath. \u201cYou know just about everyone around here, right?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to know plenty of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an issue to resolve. It\u2019s not a confidence, but I really can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean to pry,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s...Well, it\u2019s a custody issue. I\u2019m trying to puzzle it out.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted his eyebrows. \u201cYou divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not my issue. It\u2019s a friend\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see. Hard to know how to help, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be it,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI feel helpless. That\u2019s my least favorite feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had enough time around here to make your connections, figure out who\u2019s going to be useful to your work,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat helping-people line of your work, I mean. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re good for some mighty powerful praying, but sometimes a man has to know who\u2019s gonna pass him the ammunition.\u201d</p><p>Noah had to chuckle. \u201cYou hit that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend of mine had some serious custody concerns a couple years back. There was a woman he was interested in and she was running from a dangerous ex. She had a kid with her and nowhere to turn. But my buddy had been fishing with this judge from Grace Valley and they were tight. That old judge\u2014named Judge, by the way, like his folks knew the day he was born where he was headed. Anyway, that tough old bird, he didn\u2019t like domestic violence. Irked him right down to his toes. He helped. So did my little sister, Brie\u2014she\u2019s a lawyer. She\u2019s dealt with more than her share of domestic situations, not to mention her own divorce. She lives right next door to me and Mel. The judge and my sister helped my buddy out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And is the woman safe now?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so.\u201d Jack smiled. \u201cMy buddy married her, had a baby with her. Everything got sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. Maybe I ought to go see this judge. Or talk to your sister. Maybe someone has some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, why don\u2019t you go back to the kitchen, have a chat with the other Preacher around here while he slices and dices. He might head you in the right direction so you can help Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, everyone seems to like you fine, but you don\u2019t have all that many close friends yet. If it isn\u2019t Ellie and it isn\u2019t me, the person\u2019s not from around here.\u201d He gave the counter a wipe. \u201cGo talk to Preacher. He\u2019s real good at confidences. He\u2019d have his tongue cut out before he\u2019d give up your secrets, but he\u2019s candid about his own. And he knows everything. He gets on that computer of his and gets himself an education about every issue under the sun. He\u2019s one smart critter. And awful helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019d mind? Even if I can\u2019t really discuss the particulars of this problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, most folks around here would jump in to help a neighbor, but Preacher is one of a kind. He might be built like a refrigerator and look scary as hell, but he\u2019s the sweetest man I know. He\u2019d do anything in the world to help. Go on back. Then I\u2019ll give you some dinner.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t see Ellie all day on Sunday and didn\u2019t expect to. The way they had left it, he was planning to drive with her to take her kids back to Redway to their stepfather\u2019s house. He was hoping that if she had support, it might modify the jerk\u2019s behavior.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the way it worked out. He walked down to her rented room at three that afternoon, but she wasn\u2019t there. Her deadline for getting her kids back was four and her car was already gone. He waited around awhile in case she came back looking for him, then at close to four he went back to his RV. At six he and Lucy grabbed a bite to eat at Jack\u2019s, hung around for a while, then walked down the block just to see if her car was back yet.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. He worried briefly that she hadn\u2019t taken them back to her ex-husband\u2019s house at all. Frankly, if he were Ellie, he might not have. The temptation to flee must be overwhelming. He went back to his RV, knowing he wouldn\u2019t sleep all night without knowing.</p><p>At nine, he walked down the street again, but this time he left Lucy behind. The summer sun had set and people turned in early in this little town, but her car was not yet parked in front of the Fitch house. There was a single light on inside the big house and an outside light at the top of the garage stairs, but her room was dark. Noah sat on the stairs that led to her rented room and waited.</p><p>About thirty minutes later, he heard the engine of her PT Cruiser as she came into town. She pulled up in front of the house and parked. He heard the car door slam; her feet were quiet and slow on the driveway that led to the garage.</p><p>Deep in thought, she didn\u2019t see him until she was about twenty feet away. She stopped. He stood. The light from the top of the stairs illuminated him. Still sheathed in semidarkness, she approached another ten feet and stopped again. Finally, in a very soft voice that didn\u2019t sound like Ellie, she asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She took a couple more steps toward him. She looked different. Oh, the clothes were Ellie\u2014tight jeans, snug top. But her makeup was gone, her big hair pulled back severely into a ponytail. She looked so young. Sweet. And so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you,\u201d he said. He came down the steps and stood in front of her. \u201cI wondered how it went. If everything was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said in a voice that sounded weak and beaten. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas it terrible? Were they very upset?\u201d</p><p>He saw her shake her head and there was only silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Noah said, \u201cdid you get them back on time?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. She bit her lower lip, looked down and didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><p>\u201cDid he give you any trouble?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Then she said, \u201cWell, there was the usual. He told them to go to their rooms, get ready for bed and stay there. Ready for bed, at four o\u2019clock. But I made sure they had eaten before I took them back, so if he doesn\u2019t give them dinner, they won\u2019t be hungry. Then again, if he does give them dinner and they can\u2019t eat it, there could be a different kind of problem. I couldn\u2019t tell him, though...that they\u2019d eaten.\u201d She sniffed and wiped at her nose with the back of her hand. \u201cHe seems to be always looking for ways to get to them and it would be just like him to give them a big dinner and insist they eat every bite, even though they can\u2019t. But there\u2019s not much I can do to control that. He\u2019ll do what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she admitted.</p> <p>\u201cSince four o\u2019clock?\u201d he asked, an ache creeping into his chest. When she didn\u2019t answer him, he said, \u201cI was worried about you. About you and your kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you\u2019d worry. I went to my friend\u2019s house. Phyllis\u2014the lady who owns the duplex. I just wanted to talk to someone who understood the whole mess.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a moment. Where there is despair, let me offer hope...\u201cThat probably helped.\u201d He saw her nod. \u201cWould you like to talk about it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty worn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help to pray about it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could\u2014\u201d</p><p>And she laughed a little, shaking her head. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it really does help,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d she said. Then she sniffed. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll be fine in the morning. I just need some rest. I\u2019m sorry if you were worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to put that on you\u2014I have no business waiting for you to get home. You\u2019re an adult. I can\u2019t explain\u2014it\u2019s just that I felt for them. The kids. And you\u2014I just wanted to know you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m okay, Noah. And the kids will get by. We talked about how we had to accept the way things are for a little while longer. We sang songs all the way to Redway in the car, just to keep their minds off things. I only had to put up with Arnie for three or four minutes, just long enough for him to tell me I\u2019d better remember who\u2019s calling the shots here.\u201d She groaned in the back of her throat. \u201cMaybe I should go back to him. Could I do that? Stay with him for the ninety days so I could watch over the kids? Then leave with them after the time\u2019s up? Legally? Could that work?\u201d</p><p>Noah felt a surge of anger rise up in him at the very thought of Arnie touching her, putting his hands on her, telling her what to do. In that instant he knew he\u2019d lose his mind if she did that. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, and then he asked himself who he thought he was to tell her what she could do. \u201cArnie might trip you up somehow, make it worse. You\u2019re doing what the court asked. Um, listen, I did some checking this afternoon\u2014there\u2019s a woman lawyer in town. Jack\u2014the guy who owns the bar\u2014his sister is a lawyer and she lives here.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might be willing to talk to you for free. If you explained. If you told her the cheapskate preacher doesn\u2019t pay worth a damn. I mean, maybe she can\u2019t build a case or go to court on your behalf without a fee, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, stop. I\u2019ve talked to lawyers...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could give you a loan. Long-term. Interest free.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she barely whispered. \u201cLeave me some pride. I got us into this, I\u2019ll get us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, there\u2019s no shame in a helping hand....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need some rest. I didn\u2019t sleep at all last night. Once I have some sleep, things will look better in the morning. I\u2019ll be able to think straight.\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled a rumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and held it toward her. \u201cWell, sleep on this. Her name is Brie Valenzuela. I just met her. Very nice woman.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAccording to Preacher, the cook, she\u2019s been known to help neighbors. She helped him once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they all know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take it. It\u2019s Mel\u2019s sister-in-law, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>She took the paper and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them all about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone anything. I just said I had a friend with a difficult custody situation that, as far as I could tell, was diabolical. I said I knew someone who could use some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all figure it out,\u201d she said, her voice tired.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the most important thing,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to bed now. So I can work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Helplessly, he said, \u201cIs there anything I can do to help? Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss. You can let me get up the stairs and shake this off. This isn\u2019t your problem.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but it was, he thought. It wasn\u2019t that he took on pain and suffering like an addict. He barely knew her and yet he was completely enmeshed in this crisis; his throat ached from remembering the sound of the children\u2019s voices when they were in his backseat. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to get in your business. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>He walked around her and down the driveway. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, though,\u201d she said to his back. \u201cNice to have someone care. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>Noah found himself wondering why Ellie hadn\u2019t slept last night. He would have imagined having her kids with her, so close, all in one big bed, would have given her comfort, peace of mind. Was she completely wigged out with stress? Fear? Confusion?</p><p>Where there is sadness, let me bring joy....</p><p>Noah realized with some embarrassment that he wanted to hold her and comfort her, whisper all the right words that would bring her peace of mind. He wanted to be the one to get her through this. To rescue her. To put his arms around her, protect her and bring contentment where there was fear and pain. Hope. He would show her hope where there was hopelessness. For it is in giving that we receive....</p><p>But this was not his job. He was not her minister. He was her boss.</p><p>He shook his head, trying to shake away the impulse that was all wrong for the circumstances. It was just that he\u2019d been too alone for too long. It wasn\u2019t just since Merry had passed, it was before and after that. There had been women, but nothing lasting, no one to whom he could really give himself except for that all-too-brief time he had his wife. He needed to get beyond that.</p><p>Ellie would probably be happier with a hundred-dollar bill than an offer to pray with him. Why didn\u2019t he know that? He\u2019d always known things like that! Anyone who could go to skid row with a Bible in one hand and a grocery sack full of peanut-butter sandwiches in the other knew when it was appropriate to offer spiritual assistance and when it was time to just be a friend.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten himself in deep. And fast. Well, that happened to counselors, he knew that\u2014it was a hazard of the profession. But he had fallen into her problems like a drunk into a shot glass. He took them on, worried them to death, worked at finding a solution. He liked happily ever after, even if he didn\u2019t exactly have an acquaintance with it right now.</p><p>He would have to separate himself from this situation, be objective, remember his job, his particular skills, his role.</p><p>He\u2019d better back off, before he did more harm than good.</p><p>Come Monday morning, Noah had a headache. He\u2019d tossed and turned, suffering through deep thoughts that ranged from his spiritual commitment and his job here, to Ellie and her problems, to missing Merry. He wished he had a woman in his life, he thought. Talk about hopelessness. Nothing can keep you up all night like worry and self-pity.</p><p>But when he finally made it to the church office at eight in the morning, he heard movement and soft humming. When he went to the upstairs bathroom, he found Ellie painting away, the little bathroom almost done. She wasn\u2019t wearing makeup this morning. Her hair was clipped in the back, but fell in a shiny curtain down her back\u2014she\u2019d straightened it somehow. Instead of her tight jeans, she wore some khaki things that tied right below the knees. And his painting shirt. She looked about fifteen.</p><p>She turned and smiled at him. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my usual time,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYeah, I know. Just giving you crap. I slept like a dead woman last night and thought I\u2019d get an early start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d he asked, rather stunned. When last he\u2019d seen her, she was a crying wreck. He hadn\u2019t slept. And she\u2019d been part of the reason.</p><p>\u201cI did. I was worn out. But then I woke up early and thought, why not just go for it. I didn\u2019t bother fixing up at all\u2014I figured no one would see me but you and the paint.\u201d Then she smiled again.</p><p>\u201cYou seem in a very good mood,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cSo much better. Really, you can\u2019t let yourself get tired out. It\u2019s bad all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kept you from sleeping the night before? Worry? Upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, laying her roller in the pan. \u201cOh, I\u2019m worried. I try not to let that take over, since worry isn\u2019t going to help anything. But I had my kids with me.\u201d Her eyes lit up. \u201cI snuggled them all night, listened to all their sleeping noises, smelled them fresh out of the shower, and just couldn\u2019t shut my eyes no matter how hard I tried. Knowing I wouldn\u2019t see them for a week and probably wouldn\u2019t get another overnight, I\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLike a stupid ninny, I was up all night just holding them and watching them sleep. No wonder I wasn\u2019t any good at taking them back on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>And he thought, wait a minute! You have all the same problems! Nothing has improved just by sleeping! What the hell...?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a slight headache,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDid you take something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019ll probably pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must want to have a headache. Right?\u201d she asked, lifting her pretty eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou actually look better without makeup. Without the big hair. And you\u2019re not six feet tall, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she admonished. \u201cNothing you say is going to make me look like some Amish woman. Besides, all that curly hair is mine\u2014I\u2019m stuck with it. Sometimes I straighten it, but it\u2019s way too much trouble. And I know it would make your life easier if I was really butt ugly and asexual, but I\u2019m here to work, not make your life easier.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cExcuse me, but isn\u2019t the job of a pastor\u2019s assistant designed to make the pastor\u2019s life easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Worship. It\u2019s to assist. And I am. And I will. And I will look good if I can, thankyouverymuch. So why the headache? Drink too much last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink too much, more likely. Listen, you don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s none of my business, but how are you so well adjusted after just a little sleep? You were kind of...kind of...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessed up over the kids last night?\u201d she finished for him. \u201cYeah, I know. I admit, it gets to me. And no matter how well I sleep, I hate it. This shouldn\u2019t be happening to them. I mean, it shouldn\u2019t be happening to me, either, but I can take about anything. It\u2019s them hurting that tears me up. I think people who hurt children are going to burn in hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh.

But instead of following his own advice and staying out of it, which kept him awake all night, he crossed the line again. \u201cYou going to talk to that woman lawyer? Brie?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cIf the time seems right. Really, my biggest worry is that if I get in Arnie\u2019s face anymore, try to upset his temporary win here, he\u2019ll get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that would be a good thing to talk to the lawyer about,\u201d he suggested. \u201cBecause while you\u2019re painting and leaving him alone with his temporary win, he could be plotting his next move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not ruling it out. And believe me,\u201d she said, stooping to pick up her paint roller, \u201cthe first thing I\u2019ll tell her is I can\u2019t afford her because my boss is a hopeless tightwad.\u201d She winked at him. Then her grin faded and she said, \u201cJesus, you look miserable. You have bags under your eyes. You might want to drop the macho-man deal and pop a couple of aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with worries, you know,\u201d he said defensively.</p><p>\u201cBaby, everyone has worries. The rich have as many as the poor. The healthy as many as the sick. It\u2019s a worrisome deal, this life business. You have to learn to mellow, not stay up all night feeding it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you sure shook off your funk pretty well. Maybe I\u2019m just not as good at it as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging on to it a little, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because I like being worried,\u201d he said. And it was damn tempting to point out to her that she and her problems started the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. She rolled more paint onto the wall. Then without looking at him, she said, \u201cMust be a payoff in there for you, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a trick to letting it go, in case you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p> <p>He took a deep breath, an impatient breath. \u201cLay it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t try. Trying is a struggle and doing is an act. You can\u2019t witness the act of trying, but you can see the results of doing. Trying brings on stress because not only do you have the problem, but now you have all this frustration with it not going away just because you want it to. It\u2019s kind of like being told not to think of pink elephants\u2014impossible. What you have to do is stop. You say to yourself, this is over for now. I\u2019m done for now. Take your mind to another place and concentrate on that peaceful place. Deep breaths. Go limp. Put your mind in another state. It takes practice, but it gets easier, over time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Scarlett,\u201d he said with a laugh, not believing a word. He tried to imagine counseling a completely stressed-out person by telling them that all they had to do was not try to let it go, and it would go. Although he did admit to himself that he had used that technique, or something similar, in the past with some o his clients.</p><p>\u201cMy gramma used to say, you can only feel one feeling at a time. For example, you can\u2019t feel trust and fear together. If you want to trust but you\u2019re afraid, fear is still in charge. If you trusted, there wouldn\u2019t be fear. She also used to say, you have to listen to what you feel\u2014feeling fear could be a warning, right?\u201d</p><p>He knew this theory. Fear and faith cannot coexist. He\u2019d used that a hundred times, too. But he had never counseled her. Her grandmother had. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m not as good at it as you are. If I have a problem, it tends to haunt me for a while.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, lifted one thin, light brown brow and said, \u201cOh. Sure. So, how\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p><p>Enough! he thought. No twenty-five-year-old stripper was going to counsel him! But he said, \u201cWhat else did your grandmother say?\u201d</p><p>She got a very happy look and turned to him, roller at her side. \u201cDon\u2019t make love to your problems\u2014they\u2019ll never give you back the satisfaction you give them. And, troubles aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re written on, but that doesn\u2019t mean writing them down won\u2019t help you get a fix on \u2019em. And, God respects you when you work, but he loves you when you dance. That last one might\u2019ve gotten me into some trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Good God, he thought. This was like listening to Grandma Pyle\u2019s wisdom on The Andy Griffith Show! \u201cI won\u2019t be around until later today,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cI have errands. I\u2019ll be gone most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also used to say, \u2018If Jesus walked the earth today, he wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with Billy Graham. He\u2019d be found with drug addicts and prostitutes and the like.\u2019\u201d</p><p>That one stunned Noah still for a moment. He\u2019d always thought that himself. \u201cNeed anything before I go?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said, rolling away. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get started on the downstairs john while you\u2019re gone. Take aspirin, Noah. Don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t see you when I get back, I\u2019ll assume you worked as long as you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkeydokey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please give Lucy a spin over the grass for her potty break and leave her in the RV when you quit for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Want me to get her dinner at the bar before I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll be back for that. That\u2019s almost the best part of my day.\u201d</p><p>With that, Noah left the church and got into his truck. It really pissed him off that she was doing so well this morning. Not that he wanted her to be in pain\u2014of course not. But he was the professional\u2014he was supposed to be telling her how to cope, not the other way around. Her grandmother had some very sage advice. And, he wasn\u2019t doing as well as she was...even with her problems! So one of them was not a particularly good role model, and he feared it was him.</p><p>And that really pissed him off.</p><p>As Noah pulled around to the front of the church, he saw Mel Sheridan loading a box into the back of the Humvee with another one sitting on the clinic porch. She lifted a hand and gave him a wave, so he pulled up alongside. \u201cNeed a hand there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s not heavy. Where are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d run over to Grace Valley and visit with Harry Shipton, the pastor there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Harry. We always called Harry when we needed a minister. Now I guess we won\u2019t have to do that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry? I mean, do you have an appointment with Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He shrugged. \u201cI called him and said I\u2019d drop by this week and he said that\u2019d be great. Why?\u201d</p><p>She walked over to his open window. \u201cHow would you like a private tour of some interesting and little-known parts of the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to keep some secrets. Are you any good at secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a break!\u201d he said, insulted. \u201cI\u2019m a minister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s not saying you don\u2019t have a big mouth,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I swear to God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s trying to get me to stop swearing, but go ahead, if it floats your boat. I just have something you might be interested in, but you can\u2019t tell. If you tell, my life is going to be too miserable to describe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d he asked hopefully. Right about now he\u2019d like to feel as good at counseling and giving comfort as Ellie\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. Tell you what, follow me out of town...if you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could stop him now. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Mel loaded the second box, jumped in the Hummer and pulled out of town. Noah was right on her bumper. They drove for about twenty minutes, out Highway 36, then turned off on a side road that wound up and down a big mountain, and then Mel pulled over at a wide space in the road. Noah pulled up behind her. She stepped out of the Hummer and beckoned him with a wave of her hand. \u201cLeave your truck here and come with me.\u201d</p><p>He did as she asked, getting in the front seat of the Humvee. \u201cWhere the devil are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first got to Virgin River, I was working with old Doc Mullins. He died last year and Cameron Michaels came down from Oregon to work as the town doctor for at least a year. Mullins was an ornery old coot, but I loved him. Anyway, I came from the city\u2014from L.A.\u2014and there were things he tried to tell me about life in the mountains. For that matter, Jack tried, too. Some things I just had to learn for myself. You a city boy, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. I grew up in a suburb of Columbus and went to college and seminary in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I came from, working in an urban trauma center, when we treated indigents or vagrants, we called social services and just handed them off. I never had to worry about what had become of them after that transfer. The doctors called it \u2018buff \u2019em and turf \u2019em.\u2019 Treat the patients as well as you can for your specialty, then hand them off to another service\u2014someone else\u2019s turf\u2014and then it\u2019s their problem. Things are very different around here\u2014except for the larger cities, there aren\u2019t facilities for dealing with poverty and homeless people. Virgin River doesn\u2019t have anything to offer, and neither do the surrounding small mountain towns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have homeless here?\u201d he asked. He knew that except for the successful ranches, farms and vineyards, most of the community lived a lower-middle-class existence, but he hadn\u2019t seen any stark poverty or homelessness.</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you should see for yourself. I doubt there\u2019s much you can do about it, Noah. They sure won\u2019t cotton up to you bible beating them. They might torture you for that. Or just plain go to sleep. But you should know about mountain life. There are lots of poor people out in these mountains who aren\u2019t homeless, people who homesteaded, and once they sold off their quotient of lumber, had nothing left but a mountain full of forty-foot trees and very little income. If they homesteaded, they\u2019re probably elderly and often sickly, but they\u2019re not real fond of doctors, either. I get a little slack, being a nurse-practitioner. We look in on them when we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you have to know the area pretty well,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMore than half of our population is rural,\u201d she said. She turned off onto what appeared to be a hidden road. Narrow, all dirt and washboard, obviously very seldom used.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all charity work in our practice,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re doing better all the time\u2014there are more insured and paying patients every year around here, but there are still people in need who don\u2019t have the means. It\u2019s all part of the territory, Noah. I get a lot of food at the clinic as patient fees. After Cameron and I go through it and see what we can use, most of the really good stuff goes over to Jack\u2019s. Preacher cooks it, bakes it, freezes it, cans it...and they always serve people who serve the town\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been real good to me that way,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI won\u2019t take advantage, but I\u2019ll take the occasional piece of pie off his hands....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it all shakes out even in the end. There\u2019s always stuff left at the clinic\u2014milk and juice real close to going bad, cheese with a few moldy spots I can cut off and, depending on the season, there might be some produce. And then there are the casseroles that are half eaten. Stuff that can\u2019t be used at Jack\u2019s but can fill a belly. The boxes in the back have food in them. There\u2019s just one problem....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack has absolutely forbidden me to do this. As Doc Mullins did before him. So, I\u2019m trusting you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, great. Secrets between husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are confidences kept by a medical practitioner in this town. You can rest assured that when you come to me with a medical problem that you might find personal and perhaps embarrassing, Jack will never know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a comfort,\u201d he said. Like when would that happen? When he finally had constipation? The drip?</p> <p>\u201cWell, Jesus, Noah\u2014would you tell about my spiritual struggles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have some?\u201d he asked almost hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. I\u2019d like you to please stay in the car. You\u2019re new around here. They don\u2019t know you. It might make them skittish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>But before Mel answered, she pulled into a clearing. And there was a camp. Surrounding a bald spot within the trees were tents, a couple of old vehicles\u2014one up on bricks without wheels and one that could be functional\u2014one old dilapidated trailer, some furniture that looked as if it had been pilfered from a dump, some tarps stretched over the furniture to keep the moisture off. And a few men standing around who looked for all the world like hillbillies. They had a pot over a fire and that was it.</p> <p>Mel jumped out, opened the back of the Humvee and hauled out a box. She put it onto the hood of the Hummer and waited. An old man with a gray beard that reached down to his chest ambled forward. He was skin and bones and real shaky. He nodded a little as Mel spoke to him. She reached inside the box and pulled out a large white plastic jar and held up one finger. She shook the jar and held up that one finger again, in emphasis, and the man nodded.</p><p>Noah watched in fascination. And then, although he had been told to wait in the car, he got out. Mel glared at him briefly, but didn\u2019t say anything. Noah stayed beside the passenger door, minding his own business. Then, braving her reproach, he went to the back of the Hummer and got the second box, bringing it slowly and cautiously around to the front of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cAnyone sick or hurt?\u201d Mel asked the man.</p><p>He shook his head and she handed him the box.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. You know where I am if you need anything medically.\u201d</p><p>He nodded without speaking and took the box off her hands. By the time he was on his way back to his tent, another man came forward from behind the old trailer. Since Noah was holding the box, he went straight to Noah.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you today, brother?\u201d Noah asked pleasantly. And the man merely nodded, not making eye contact. \u201cCan you think of anything you need, besides the food in the box?\u201d Noah asked. No response. \u201cCoats? Blankets?\u201d At that, the man lifted his beady gaze and connected with Noah\u2019s eyes. \u201cAh,\u201d Noah said. \u201cCoats and blankets. That makes sense. I\u2019ll look around, see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>The man broke his gaze and merely accepted the box, taking it back where he\u2019d come from. The entire transaction lasted under five minutes. They got back in the Hummer and Mel backed around carefully, heading down the bumpy road. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t follow instructions very well, do you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d he lied. He wasn\u2019t about to be kept back. He felt right at home. \u201cHow many of them are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few now. Six or seven, maybe. The faces change\u2014people wander in and out, stay awhile, move on. Sometimes I\u2019ll actually spot a woman. One of the men had an adult daughter with him for a while. There were more before, in a camp closer to town, but Jack and his boys ran them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was complicated. Some drug farmer set up in their camp and there was a caretaker watching the grow who was a dangerous felon. We had an altercation\u2014he put a knife to my throat and wanted narcotics from the clinic. Jack killed him. I mean, it was totally self-defense, you understand. It was down to me or him and Jack wasn\u2019t at all attracted to him.\u201d She turned to Noah and smiled. Then her smile vanished. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t joke. The man was going to kill me. After it was over, Jack rounded up his friends and they ran off all the old boys. He said if they couldn\u2019t keep the dangerous element out, they had to move farther away, so the town wouldn\u2019t be at risk. Turns out they didn\u2019t go that far. If they weren\u2019t on restricted land, Jack might\u2019ve run across them while hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you found them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a year back one of them came into the clinic. He had a nasty, infected laceration that needed debriding, antibiotics, and dressing. I told him if I knew where he\u2019d settled, I could bring him some leftovers to eat sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was in that jar you showed the man?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cExpired prenatal vitamins. Might keep him going one more week in his life, but what the heck. The thing is, Noah, I wanted to save them. Get them bottled water at least, if not placement in some facility with clean sheets. But the fact is, this is either what they want or serves what they think they need. There\u2019s undoubtedly some addiction or mental illness at root there\u2014alcoholism, bipolar, war disability, anything is possible, although I don\u2019t know that any of them have been evaluated. And since nothing will change it, no harm comes from a little decent food. Those old boys exist on fish and squirrel. And in the winter they almost freeze. But they won\u2019t go to town, won\u2019t go to a shelter. They know they can get help in Eureka. But they are not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Jack finds out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to make a big stink. He might run them off again. Or see if he can get some law enforcement to do it. He has a point\u2014if they\u2019re too close to town and open to dangerous types settling in with them, that could be a big problem. But I have a point, too\u2014it\u2019s not against the law to be homeless. They\u2019re not hurting anyone, as far as I know. If they break the law, they\u2019ll have to go, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the only group like that you know about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe only one around here I know about, but June Hudson, the doctor down in Grace Valley, she keeps an eye on an impoverished settlement near that town. She\u2019s given medical treatment to some of them. There are several families in her shantytown\u2014some of them actually keep animals\u2014mules, goats, chickens, like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some people real hard put, but for some reason I didn\u2019t expect it here. I guess I thought homelessness was only in the inner city, and near the docks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can relate, I was likewise naive. There are lots of folks living in isolated cabins out in the hills. If we know about them, Cameron and I try to keep track of them. We\u2019ll often go together, but he just became the father of twins and has been a little scarce around town lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cyou\u2019re a missionary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just doing the people\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a missionary is. It\u2019s not all about bible beating,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou have to fill their bellies before you can expect to peek into their hearts. Are you and Cameron the only ones who know about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe exact location, maybe, but probably not. Jack knew about them when they had that old camp nearer town and he just ignored them. Until there was trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a problem with you going out to isolated cabins to check on people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes someone will tell me there\u2019s no smoke coming from a neighbor\u2019s chimney, or that someone is bedridden and could use medicine, and often Jack will take me and wait in the car. Jack\u2019s been known to split logs for an old-timer who can\u2019t hoist his ax. Sometimes Cameron and I go together. I have to be real cautious. Some people really don\u2019t want to be disturbed. Some could be unstable. Even violent. Believe me, I don\u2019t venture foolishly. And don\u2019t you, either.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. She knew. There was a reason she had taken him, shown him and told him. Because his was also the people\u2019s work. What she didn\u2019t know was that his father was a wealthy, somewhat famous televangelist, who made a lot of noise about helping the needy and yet had never managed to get his hands dirty. He consorted mainly with rich people. In his stable of friends were politicians, government honchos, police officials, philanthropists. Anyone who could protect him in the clinches and make him richer.</p><p>In Noah\u2019s stable of friends, so far, there was a bartender, a stripper, a cook and a midwife.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, the flavor of his life tasted good in his mouth.</p><p>Noah\u2019s trip with Mel to the vagrants\u2019 camp in the forest presented many possibilities to a man whose soul was fed when he could feed people. His visit to Grace Valley to spend some time with Harry Shipton, a heck of a nice fellow, had been likewise illuminating. They spent two hours together and Noah learned Harry was not just a Presbyterian minister, but also divorced and a recovering compulsive gambler. Even though he\u2019d swindled some local friends, the whole town had welcomed him home after his treatment program. Here, in this little burg, Harry had found the truest sense of forgiveness and community.</p><p>Harry then gave Noah a tour of the town and lunch at the Grace Valley Caf\u00e9. Noah met Dr. June Hudson and her partner Dr. John Stone, and June\u2019s father, the former town doctor, Elmer. He had an invitation from Elmer to go fishing and get an education about a few things those Virgin River men didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t learn. \u201cNo matter what they say, I\u2019ve always outfished them. Bunch of liars, that\u2019s what they are,\u201d Elmer told him.</p><p>Grace Valley was a precious little town of quaint clapboard houses and delightful people, but when he\u2019d brought up the subject of rural poverty, June and Harry had been quick to fill him in, in detail, about their special cases. On the surface, some of these mountain towns looked to be thriving and healthy, but there was an underside, hidden in the trees, of both marijuana growers laying low under the law and impoverished families that June, John, Harry and a few others tried to look after.</p><p>A few days later when Mel Sheridan pulled into the vagrants\u2019 camp, Noah was seated around a weak fire with the boys, Bible in hand. Four of them sat on overturned buckets and there was a stack of army blankets beside one of them.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mel said, approaching. \u201cDidn\u2019t take you long to make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t the first in history to look for answers in solitude. So\u2014what\u2019s in your pantry today?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>Six</p><p>Noah had a couple of phone calls to make that he\u2019d been putting off for more than a week. Mrs. Hatchet and Mrs. Nagel. He had to tell them he\u2019d hired someone and thank them for their interest in the job. Mrs. Hatchet said, \u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s all around that you hired some pretty young thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, she is both pretty and young, but she was hired because she has office experience and is capable of helping with the heavy work that has to be done around here. I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out, Mrs. Hatchet, and I\u2019m very glad I got to meet you. And I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>She merely grunted and hung up.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Nagel,\u201d he said when he called the next woman. \u201cReverend Kincaid here. I just wanted to let you know that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHired that young slut,\u201d she snapped into the phone.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he said, shocked and affronted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not going to work for you if that\u2019s the kind of man you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>She gave a derisive snort before disconnecting without saying goodbye. \u201cWhew, dodged a bullet there,\u201d he muttered into a dead phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah spent the next week door-knocking in the more rural areas of Virgin River, introducing himself and inviting people to a church that would be refurbished and open for business in a couple of months. He\u2019d also been to Valley Hospital twice. He was now known among the volunteer women and before he even asked, he was directed to a patient who had had no visitors. While he carried a Bible and introduced himself as Reverend Noah Kincaid, he wasn\u2019t there to pray or preach unless asked. All he did was visit. He sympathized, comforted, consoled. He also laughed, shared favorite jokes, straightened linens, fluffed pillows and even gave assistance to the bathroom.</p><p>Merry had died at home, in his care. During her brief illness and chemotherapy he\u2019d spent countless hours at the hospital. While she was reading or dozing as the chemo IV or transfusion was running, he\u2019d make the rounds and visit with staff, patients and gathering families. He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d found a mission there. But people welcomed his friendliness and it filled a place in him. It fulfilled him.</p><p>On his way back to Virgin River, he visited the nursing home where Salvatore Salentino was living. When he stood in the doorway, the old man said, \u201cWell, here you are again. I guess you won\u2019t give up till you convert me.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ellie and Lucy were making progress on the cleaning and painting. Ellie had finished two bathrooms and was getting to work on the kitchen. And Lucy, for all her infirmity, was getting up and down the steps like a pup...and following Ellie everywhere.</p><p>On this particular day, Noah made it back to the church a little before three because he had an appointment with Paul Haggerty. He heard the water running downstairs and found Ellie bent over the sink, cleaning her painting gear. \u201cI\u2019m back, Ellie,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cBoy, you have a ton of messages. The phone was ringing all day. It\u2019s a shock I got anything done around here. Why\u2019s that phone ringing all of a sudden? You run an ad for some kind of soul-saving special or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessages?\u201d he asked with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wrote \u2019em down and left \u2019em on the desk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou answered the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do? Let them all think there wasn\u2019t any minister in this town? Besides,\u201d she said, turning around to face him, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to assist. Right?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cUm. I have a meeting with Paul Haggerty, the builder. Off the top of your head, do you remember any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a woman named Shelby MacIntyre wondered if you could perform a wedding in a couple of months. She\u2019s hoping there will be a church by then. Gloria Tuttle called from Valley Hospital. She\u2019s seen you around there visiting people and thought you should call her\u2014she\u2019s one of the nurses and can tell you about patients who might want you to visit them. You\u2019re gonna wanna watch Gloria, Rev\u2014she wants to jump your bones. She asked if you were married and when I said no, she giggled. Some old woman named Hope, who sounds like a man, called and asked how things were going and I told her we were doing our best.\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cAnd there were others. A lot of \u2019em just want to call back. And there were hang-ups\u2014maybe you got a number that was used too recently. Do you usually get so many calls? I can\u2019t remember the phone ringing once last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhom,\u201d he said, and then he almost kicked himself. \u201cTo Miss MacIntyre, for example.\u201d</p><p>She studied his face for a second and then, with a hand on her hip, she said, \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re damn skippy he\u2019ll do a wedding\u2014he needs the work!\u2019 What do you think I said? I took her number and told her I\u2019d have you call her back. The same to all of them. Except the nurse\u2014I told her she was scraping the bottom of the barrel, going after your hot pants.\u201d Then she smirked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the butt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so says the pot to the kettle. You thought I wasn\u2019t smart enough to know how to answer an office phone. I\u2019ve worked in offices!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cAh, you thought I got those jobs because I have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put up a hand to stop her. \u201cI never thought a thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBoobs,\u201d she finished insolently. Then she winked while she chewed vigorously on some gum. She cracked it for good measure. \u201cI\u2019m going to get this stuff cleaned and get out of here. I\u2019m totally shot,\u201d she said, turning back to the sink. \u201cCan you manage now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll muddle through. By the way, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor taking messages. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned over her shoulder. \u201cNo problem, Your Worship. You have a good day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do at the hospital?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVisit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t get company, people waiting around for someone to get out of surgery, people waiting for someone to die. It\u2019s the kind of place where a friendly face and a few kind words go a long way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople you know?\u201d she asked, turning back toward him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a congregation. They\u2019re complete strangers. But that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Noah. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you, I am nice.\u201d</p><p>She dried her hands on a towel. \u201cYeah. Watch out for Gloria, toots. I think she\u2019s looking for more than nice.\u201d</p><p>Ellie walked back down the street from the church to her rented room, feeling that good kind of tired that comes from having worked hard and done well. She was down to sixty-seven dollars until she could pry some church money out of the fierce grip of her cute boss. Oh, how she wished he was ugly, stupid or gay, she thought for the hundredth time. Why couldn\u2019t he just be gay? That would make life so much easier.</p><p>But he was not gay. Rather, he had waves of testosterone rolling off him. There was that build, for one thing\u2014powerful. And that thick hair that fell over his collar, itching for her to run her fingers through it, and the burning blue eyes, the hands...Oh, God, his hands! When she got up close, and if he had his sleeves rolled up, she noticed a map of tiny white scars that marred the backs of his hands and forearms. When she knew him better, she was going to ask about the scars, maybe twenty of them, but she suspected he got them when he was doing whatever he\u2019d been doing to make his palms callused and rough. He\u2019d only touched her a couple of times, just guiding her in a gentlemanly fashion, but she felt his rough hands. You don\u2019t get those in a pulpit.</p><p>Thinking about Noah made it difficult to remember that there would never again be a man in her life. Ever, ever, ever. She\u2019d been hurt by men too often. Okay, there hadn\u2019t been many, but the three major contenders had been totally horrible. Death, prison and weirdness. If there\u2019d been even one lucky break where love was concerned, she might consider another stab at it down the line a bit, but not likely. She had already proven she didn\u2019t know how to pick a man, and it was doubtful she could start now.</p><p>But he was very attractive, the preacher man. Six feet, ink-black hair with a lock that fell over his brow sometimes. Expressive dark brows over the most beautiful blue eyes she\u2019d ever seen. And lips that just screamed Come to Papa. Then there was that smile. Or, all those smiles\u2014the one that indulged, the one that mocked, the one that burst out of him before he could stop it. He couldn\u2019t hide the fact that for a devout sort of guy there was some bad boy in him that he was barely keeping under control. His smile came with dimples that almost brought her to her knees. Six feet of delicious man with strong shoulders, long legs and big, hard hands.</p><p>Yeah, he could get her in trouble.</p><p>But then, if she was realistic, he was a minister. No matter how he set her on fire, he was puritanical and pure, right? Life was just too short to forgo that playful, naughty edge. She didn\u2019t want to be in the missionary position for the rest of her life, anyway. He\u2019d probably make love with his black socks on. And his T-shirt. Lights out, covers up, in and out real quick, no screaming. Dull and boring.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right, she forgot, she thought with a laugh. She was giving up all positions. No men, no sex, no more heartaches or headaches. But it would be easier on her nerves if he were just a little homelier.</p><p>She wondered if she should be grateful he even inspired thoughts of sex; it had been so long since she\u2019d even been tempted. She had all but forgotten what tempted felt like. Long before Trevor was born, and it was a miracle Arnie hadn\u2019t killed it altogether.</p><p>Ellie stopped her daydreaming and realized she was almost home. When she got to her new address, she found Mrs. Fitch raking leaves and pine needles out of the flower bed in front of her porch. \u201cHey there, Mrs. Fitch. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Jo Ellen looked at her. \u201cFine, Ellie. Are you off early today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of. The reverend has an appointment and I\u2019ve been starting at the crack of dawn all week. I was painting by five this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got you painting?\u201d Jo Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fitch, there\u2019s not a dirty chore in that old trash heap of a church that I\u2019m not doing. While we get it pulled together, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel good,\u201d Ellie said with a smile, rolling the ache out of her stiff shoulders. \u201cNothing like some good old hard work. You should see the bathrooms\u2014they look great. I can tell Reverend Kincaid can\u2019t figure out how he got stuck with me, I am so not a churchy person, but I\u2019ll tell you what, it was his lucky day. The stuff that has to be done around there? Painting, cleaning, organizing? Heck, I\u2019ve had to make do so much of my life, that\u2019s what I know best\u2014making something decent out of a mess. Lots easier than computer programs.\u201d</p><p>Jo Ellen leaned on her rake and laughed. \u201cWould you like some iced tea?\u201d</p><p>Ellie ran the palms of her hands down her pant legs. \u201cOh, gee, I\u2019m a mess. I probably smell like paint and sweat, besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than me\u2014I smell like compost. Why don\u2019t I bring us some tea out here to the front porch. Just for a little break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful nice of you. Thanks.\u201d Gosh, Ellie secretly mused, I thought she didn\u2019t like me. I thought I had tricked her into renting me that room.</p><p>Jo Ellen was a plain woman in her fifties, but she had a softness that made her pretty. Her hair was light brown and strung with gray, which gave it a dull appearance, and she pulled it back in a simple catch at the base of her neck. She didn\u2019t wear makeup, which made perfect sense while gardening, but then, she hadn\u2019t worn it when she first met Ellie, either. Her eyebrows had a nice arch, which made her expression pleasant. But what Ellie noticed about her for the first time, was that her complexion was clear and her skin tight and smooth. There was a little bit of sun on her cheeks and nose from her afternoon of outdoor work. And her smile, which Ellie hadn\u2019t seen much of the first day they met, was lovely.</p><p>When Jo Ellen returned with two glasses of tea on a tray with a few cookies, Ellie said, \u201cMy gosh, Mrs. Fitch, this is just so nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, sweetheart. And call me Jo Ellen. Or Jo\u2014that\u2019s what my friends call me. It occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t visited with you at all since you moved into your little apartment. You\u2019ve been there a couple of weeks already! I didn\u2019t want to bother you while you had your children with you, but now that you\u2019re on your own again, I want to at least make an effort to get to know you a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s okay. About the kids,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get to have them overnight. It\u2019s a mess, this custody business.\u201d She sipped her tea. \u201cDo you and Mr. Fitch have children?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2014it\u2019s one of the greatest disappointments in my life. I don\u2019t have too much else to complain about, but I really wanted children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I wish you had. My kids are the center of my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard for you to be away from them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all a terrible misunderstanding, and I\u2019m going to get it straightened out as quick as I can. When they\u2019re back with me where they belong, I\u2019ll move\u2014I won\u2019t try to keep them here with me. I know you didn\u2019t intend that room for more than one person anyway. But don\u2019t worry, Mrs.... I mean, Jo\u2014I won\u2019t leave you owing rent. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried, Ellie. That room hasn\u2019t been let in a year or more. It\u2019s nice to have someone use it again. And I happen to like children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful room,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019d had a room like that growing up, I would\u2019ve felt like a princess. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decorated it myself,\u201d Jo Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cHave you lived around here all your life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince I got married,\u201d she said. \u201cI met Nick when he was in the air force, stationed in Florida, and fell madly in love, married him, and when he got out of the service we moved here. He\u2019s from these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gee\u2014is your family back in Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sister, her husband and my nieces. We don\u2019t see too much of each other. But I have friends here now. Women friends. This is a good little town.\u201d She laughed. \u201cReal little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThe only thing that would make it better for me is if I had my kids with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEureka. I grew up and went to high school there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd is your family nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one except the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grandmother raised me alone and she died a couple of years ago. That\u2019s it. No brothers or sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents dead?\u201d Jo asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. My mother is kind of a whack job.... Okay, not kind of\u2014she\u2019s pretty nuts. She had me when she was real young, never would say who my father was, and just left me with my gramma. She\u2019s all over the place, traveling, constantly moving. She visited now and then when I was growing up, sends postcards sometimes, but when my gramma died, I couldn\u2019t even find her. I haven\u2019t heard from her in a long time and, really, that\u2019s okay. The last time she visited, my daughter was totally confused about who she was. They knew my gramma as gramma and my mother was horrified to think she was a grandmother! She pretty much ran for her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what a shame. I\u2019d love to have a daughter with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said, she\u2019s pretty nuts. But I\u2019m not, I swear. Well, I have been known to marry stupidly, but I\u2019m working on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much we actually have in common,\u201d Jo said. Ellie went alert, wondering if Jo was about to tell her how she\u2019d married stupidly. But she said, \u201cTwo women, transplanted to this little town, with no real family.\u201d</p><p>Ellie almost said, But you have Mr. Fitch! But then, she\u2019d met Mr. Fitch, so she didn\u2019t say it. Instead she said, \u201cTell me about Virgin River, Jo. I hardly know anything about it, but I really like it.\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, after talking and laughing and asking each other questions, Ellie headed for a long soak in the tub and Jo finished raking up her flower beds. Ellie wanted to get to her room before crossing paths with Nick; she thought it best to give that man a wide berth. And if she wasn\u2019t totally mistaken, Jo felt the same way.</p><p>But before they parted, they made a date to have lunch together next week. Jo offered to make them sandwiches to eat on the back patio when Ellie took her break from the church. Ellie felt a rush of unexpected warmth coming from the woman, a feeling she welcomed.</p><p>Noah met with Paul Haggerty for a couple of hours, discussing what Haggerty Construction could do to help out with the renovation in the church. Noah had a lot of ideas about how he could save money by doing some of the work himself, like installing the basement flooring, refinishing the sanctuary floor, putting new glass in the windows, painting the offices, texturing and painting the basement walls.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing you have to do is paint the outside, Noah,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe I could put that off, concentrate on the interior first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNo one will see the inside if you don\u2019t spruce up the outside. You can\u2019t expect to draw a crowd if it looks like the same old broken-down church. In renovation, even do-it-yourself renovation, you want to start with what people see first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought of that. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do for you, Noah,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some measurements and get an itemized bid ready for you\u2014one that shows the cost of a complete remodel, from ceiling to floor, including the outside. The big issue is going to be time\u2014if you\u2019re in this project, we can\u2019t get started until you\u2019re done sanding in the sanctuary and replacing window glass. We can\u2019t have sawdust in the paint, or scratch it up during window replacement. If you look at the numbers and decide you still want your own hand in it, I\u2019ll be happy to loan you a sander and other equipment, no charge. But, if you want us to do the whole remodel, we\u2019ll get in and out of here pretty quickly. While we\u2019re at it, we\u2019ll check all the plumbing and wiring and roof, at no extra cost to you. And I\u2019ll give you my best church price. And my best church scheduling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll give me some good choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can deliver the bid by next week. Now, I have to measure.\u201d</p><p>So while Paul got about the business of measuring, Noah went to his office and began returning the phone calls he hadn\u2019t gotten around to earlier.</p><p>He spoke first to Shelby MacIntyre and set up a time to visit with her and her fianc\u00e9, Luke, to get the details regarding her upcoming marriage. He had a couple of other calls. One woman wondered when he\u2019d be set up for a baptism or should she take her new grandchild to Harry in Grace Valley, and another wondered if he\u2019d have a position for a choir director when the church was functional. And, last of all, he phoned Gloria Tuttle at the hospital. She had left all her numbers: work phone, home phone and cell phone.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Reverend Kincaid?\u201d she asked cheerily.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thanks. So, I understand you\u2019re a nurse at Valley Hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I saw you on one of your visits and a volunteer told me you stop by now and then. Your church is in Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but we\u2019re still in development. It\u2019s an old church and needs a lot of work. I\u2019m trying to get it back in shape while I get to know the town. Meanwhile, I try to make a few calls at the hospital and nursing home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s so thoughtful. Would it help if I could point you toward patients who don\u2019t have visitors? Or who seem particularly lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have many long-term-care patients at Valley, do you, Gloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re small, and critical-care patients are sent to larger facilities, but there\u2019s almost always someone who could use cheering up. Why don\u2019t we meet for coffee at the hospital the next time you\u2019re over this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be helpful, thank you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI won\u2019t be back over there until at least next week. I have commitments here in town and a lot of work to do on the church. When will you be working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI live close to the hospital and can dash over for coffee whenever it\u2019s convenient for you. Do you have my cell number and home number?\u201d</p><p>He repeated the numbers for her.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll look forward to hearing from you next week,\u201d she said.</p><p>They chatted for about fifteen minutes, but Noah had known within thirty seconds that Ellie was absolutely right. Gloria was interested in him. Well, at least in checking him out. He\u2019d seen a number of nurses at the hospital, of course, but he had no idea who she was.</p><p>He supposed it was too much to hope that Gloria would ring all his chimes.</p><p>Noah liked women, rather more than he probably should. He\u2019d never considered himself indiscriminate; however, it had never taken all that much to get him interested. And dating was a good idea, he knew that. But he had a real healthy libido. He happened to think sex was one of the best things in life. That hadn\u2019t gotten in his way when he was throwing fish and studying, but since entering the seminary, women who were attracted to him had their eye on an entirely different thing. They were setting themselves up to be Mrs. Minister, and he had entered a whole new territory. Every word or gesture, every affectionate move was translated into how it would contribute to their future together. He could hardly take a woman out on a first date without her imagining he wanted to get married. He had to use caution. And caution just didn\u2019t appeal to him. He\u2019d talked with his best friend and mentor, George, about this.</p><p>George was now seventy. He was divorced from a first wife, a second had passed on, and he wasn\u2019t exactly indulging in lengthy or lonely grief. George had lady friends. Quite a few, in fact. \u201cEven if you have no interest in another marriage, you should be seeing women, at least casually,\u201d George frequently told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it rounds you out as a human being,\u201d George always answered. \u201cYou\u2019re a single man, not a hermit. You should have friends of both genders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Noah asked again. \u201cI\u2019m not into long, platonic courtships. It\u2019s painful.\u201d</p><p>George had sighed enviously. \u201cGod, how I wish I was young again.\u201d</p><p>So he would have coffee with Gloria at the hospital. They would talk and he would be friendly and kind. And she would offer to cook him dinner, poor lonely bachelor that he was, and he would wiggle out of it to keep from leading her on.</p><p>And then, although there were other things he could be doing, he fired up the laptop and got online. He had a satellite dish on the RV, but the wireless connection he was using came from the bar. Jack invited him to make use anytime; since he installed the satellite for the TV and Preacher\u2019s computer, most of the town jumped off their connection.</p><p>Noah searched for Arnold Gunterson on Google. The only thing he came up with was his position as director of Brightway Private Elementary School. The school had a small Web site where the bios of the board of directors were posted, but the staff was only listed by name. A further search didn\u2019t turn up any Arnold Gunterson in Northern California. A statewide search turned up one other man by that name in La Jolla, and he was eighty-nine years old.</p><p>Arnie no doubt had degrees that qualified him, prior experience that proved him capable of his position, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he could give to parents of prospective students. But, he wasn\u2019t likely to give that information to Noah, not after what had passed between them.</p><p>Noah decided he\u2019d have to find a moment to quiz Ellie on what she knew about her former husband. And then he\u2019d figure out a way to learn about this guy\u2019s past. Because if he knew anything, just based on Arnie\u2019s behavior, he knew Arnie had a past.</p><p>When Ellie rented her small room over Jo\u2019s garage, the last thing she expected was to make a new friend. Her plan had been to be an invisible tenant\u2014she knew Jo was nervous about her being on the property and she thought she knew why. Nick Fitch could be a problem for his wife; he had a reputation. And Ellie did not want to be part of the problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>However, Jo invited her to lunch, then invited her again and again, and Nick was never around for these lunches that were dedicated to women-talk. In a little over a week of lunches, Ellie felt closer to Jo than she had to a woman friend since her grandmother\u2019s passing. But when Jo pressed her for details about how this ex-husband, this stepfather, could gain temporary custody, Ellie fibbed. \u201cI don\u2019t have much,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the means Arnie has. I rented a small place in a so-so neighborhood while Arnie has a house in a nice neighborhood. Plus, I worked nights in a bar while Arnie\u2019s trump card was being principal of an elementary school. I sure wish I knew how he managed that job\u2014he\u2019s not patient with kids at all.\u201d She so hoped Jo wouldn\u2019t hate her when she learned the truth, which she inevitably would. Ellie just wasn\u2019t ready to reveal it yet, though she already felt great affection and trust for Jo.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard,\u201d Jo said. \u201cWhere you work has nothing to do with the kind of mother you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it worked for Arnie,\u201d Ellie said with a nod. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re doing all right at the moment, the kids and me. He\u2019s letting them talk to me on the phone every night and I haven\u2019t had another problem on the Saturday visits. He always gets in my face a little bit, but I never let him see me sweat. I did tell him a small lie, though. I wanted him to think he was being watched, so I said that I\u2019d told the court where I was working and that I\u2019d have letters from real upstanding, proper people saying I\u2019m a good person and decent mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my darling,\u201d Jo said, running her fingers across Ellie\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you will! We\u2019ll all write letters for you, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed. \u201cJo, I don\u2019t know many people. I\u2019ve been scrubbing, painting, hauling trash and answering the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs working with Noah going well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Sometimes he\u2019s a pain in the butt, but he\u2019s fair and even funny. It\u2019s busy every minute, especially when he\u2019s away from the church, which is a lot of the time lately. I run from cleaning or painting to the office to grab the phone, back and forth. There have been a lot of hang-ups, by the way. I don\u2019t know what to make of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex, possibly?\u201d she asked. \u201cChecking to see if you really work at the church?\u201d</p> <p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cI suppose it could be. But wouldn\u2019t one call do it? Maybe it\u2019s that nurse from Valley Hospital who\u2019s chasing my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jo said. \u201cDo tell?\u201d</p><p>They talked for a while about the nurse, about the fact that Noah was a pretty good-looking guy, and then moved on to discuss about everything from the price of gas to the fact that soon the leaves would be changing color as August aged and September loomed on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cEllie, do you think I could meet the kids sometime?\u201d Jo asked.</p><p>\u201cReally? You want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019d share your time. I don\u2019t want to impose\u2014I know you don\u2019t get them often. But, let\u2019s see\u2014Saturday. The weather\u2019s cooling. We could bake! We could make cookies and decorate them. We could color and finger paint. We could\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJo! You don\u2019t have kids! You don\u2019t have all that kid stuff!\u201d</p><p>Jo smiled patiently. \u201cJust tell me which Saturday. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was silent for a while. \u201cCan I ask something personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you have children? You and Mr. Fitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNature\u2019s mystery,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cWe were both healthy and normal, but I didn\u2019t conceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you consider adoption?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when Jo dropped her chin, and her gaze. \u201cNick wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He said if he wasn\u2019t having a baby of his own he wouldn\u2019t have someone else\u2019s, not knowing where it came from.\u201d And then she lifted her gaze and met Ellie\u2019s. Just that little piece of information changed Jo\u2019s eyes and Ellie knew there was so much more to the story.</p> <p>Ellie frowned and shook her head. \u201cBut adoption isn\u2019t that mysterious or secretive. Oh, there might be one or two hidden things, but that\u2019s a risk even when you have your own\u2014that some little-known relative, or someone generations back contributed something you weren\u2019t even aware of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that was the end of it as far as he was concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ellie said softly. \u201cBoth of mine were total accidents. And it hasn\u2019t been easy\u2014but maybe I\u2019m the lucky one. Of course, I have no husband, no father for them, no partner...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick made that decision a long time ago,\u201d Jo said. \u201cThings haven\u2019t been the same between us since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jo,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cOh, the son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d she said. And then she was quiet.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not my business...You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove him crazy, trying for a baby. Then I was getting into my late thirties, it wasn\u2019t happening and I wanted to adopt a baby, but he wouldn\u2019t even talk about it. He was adamant. I\u2019ve never really understood. Oh\u2014he tried to get me to understand that the whole idea of raising someone else\u2019s child just didn\u2019t work for him, and he was getting older and ready to give up on the idea. He was happy without kids. At least happy enough. The truth is, I\u2019ve never forgiven him for that. For depriving me of that one chance to raise children.\u201d</p><p>Ellie reached for her hand and just held it for a minute. Finally, in a very soft voice, she said, \u201cJo, that was a long time ago. Can\u2019t you work through that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave working through it a serious try\u2014for a couple of years I was a foster parent. And it should come as no surprise, within five minutes I was attached to the children I kept. And the ones I got weren\u2019t easy kids, either, which almost proved Nick\u2019s point. Then I was depressed when they left.\u201d She laughed a little and averted her eyes. When she looked back at Ellie, she said, \u201cThese things get so complicated. I was angry, he was confused by my anger and maybe hurt by it, I was unforgiving and cold toward him, he didn\u2019t treat our marriage with the same respect...It didn\u2019t take long for us to fall into a routine where we get along, but there\u2019s nothing special between us anymore. There hasn\u2019t been for twenty years. We keep separate bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>And he flirts and gropes, Ellie thought. \u201cOh, man,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. Now,\u201d she said, brightening purposefully. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of time in my life to enjoy friends and their children! If you feel like spending a Saturday just hanging around here, playing, having fun\u2014I would absolutely love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, having you around has been so good for me. When I first saw you, all I could think was that you\u2019d tempt Nick and I\u2019d be embarrassed again, like I\u2019ve been so many times. But it didn\u2019t work that way. Instead, we got close, you and me. Two women with odd pasts and a lot to overcome. I find myself telling you things I haven\u2019t talked about in years. It would be a privilege to meet your kids, to have all of you for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Nick?\u201d Ellie asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cIf he isn\u2019t the most polite person on earth, I will shoot him in the head.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed at her. \u201cWow. A little fight looks good on you. Okay then,\u201d she said, giving her head a nod. \u201cNext Saturday it is.\u201d</p><p>Ellie realized that despite the struggles she\u2019d encountered along the way, wonderful people had always happened into her life. Her grandmother had been her angel. Her first love, Jason, had given her joy, and his loss was her heartache, but Danielle had her father\u2019s sweet disposition and bright eyes. And Chip might be a big dumb loser, but Trevor was a gift.</p><p>Her boss at that club had been a real stand-up guy who watched out for his employees. A couple of old bosses still helped her when they could, like the lawyer she\u2019d worked for. Her neighbor in the duplex had been there for her in ways she could never repay; a trusted babysitter was priceless. Noah, without a doubt, had given her a big break, at some risk to his own reputation.</p><p>And then, unexpectedly, there was Jo.</p><p>Saturday came and while Jo hadn\u2019t gone overboard, she had been ready to show Danielle and Trevor a good time. There was chilled cookie dough, ready to roll, cut, bake and decorate. The kids finger painted at Jo\u2019s big kitchen table. And there were books to read in the hammock strung between two huge trees.</p><p>Nick was at home, and while he wasn\u2019t underfoot, he did make his presence felt between cutting the grass and watching sports on TV in the den. He joined them all for a nice lunch on the patio and joked with the kids in an affable way. To Ellie\u2019s surprise, after what Jo had told her, it seemed they actually had a very good rapport. And what a loss that he hadn\u2019t tried parenting\u2014he was good with the kids, too.</p><p>Ellie got to thinking\u2014this couple got derailed in their marriage over an issue major to both of them, and they had lost the ability to compromise. Ellie\u2019s children had come while she was so young, and in such a shocking, scary way, she had never had to endure the frustration that some other women went through. In fact, before now, Ellie had never known any women friends who wanted children passionately and, for whatever reason, couldn\u2019t have them. The closest she came to really understanding the plight was a movie\u2014Steel Magnolias\u2014in which Julia Roberts\u2019s character risked her life to have a baby. That bespoke a desire so primal, so desperate, it was small wonder it could mess up an otherwise good relationship.</p><p>From the way Jo and Nick both interacted with the children, you\u2019d never know they hadn\u2019t been parents. And they seemed good together, as well; positive and even affectionate.</p><p>It began to fall into place for Ellie. She wasn\u2019t sure, but it was possible that Jo and Nick had once enjoyed a strong and loving marriage. Then they had a standoff over adoption and went to separate bedrooms. Whatever their arrangement was\u2014he worked and paid the bills and she managed the home\u2014there was at least some residual fondness there. But now Nick was flirting with other women and in a very wayward and foolish way, making passes. Could he be lonely? Hungry for both affection and some bolstering of his self-esteem?</p><p>\u201cThis has been such a fun day,\u201d Jo said to Ellie. \u201cYou know, I have friends in this town, plenty of them, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as close to some women I\u2019ve known for twenty years as I am to you. There\u2019s something different about having you here. If I\u2019d had a daughter when I wanted one, she would probably be about your age. She might have children like Danielle and Trevor. I hope that isn\u2019t too presumptuous of me, saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jo, that\u2019s so sweet! If I could choose the kind of mother to have, it would be someone like you. Someone kind and stable and a friend I could depend on.\u201d And she thought maybe Jo\u2019s eyes had misted a little when she said that.</p><p>So there it was\u2014Jo and Nick had parted while staying under the same roof, and the bitterness from their individual wounds had resulted in Nick\u2019s bad behavior and sullied reputation, and Jo was lonely and unable to hold her head up in her town.</p><p>If they wanted to, Ellie wondered, could they unravel their twenty-year-old quarrel and rebuild? Was it possible?</p><p>Seven</p><p>When Paul and Vanessa Haggerty decided they wanted to settle in Virgin River rather than Paul\u2019s home of Grants Pass, Oregon, he set up a part of his family\u2019s construction company in Virgin River. It had proven a positive choice for them, but it did require that Paul visit his father and brothers for a company business meeting about once a month. Vanni and little Matt, now eighteen months, were almost always with him, but this time she wasn\u2019t free to go\u2014she was helping her cousin Shelby plan her wedding. So Paul decided to drive up on Thursday and come back on Friday afternoon rather than spend the weekend away from the family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he arrived at the office, his brother North shook his hand and said, \u201cHey, perfect timing. I just hung up with some lawyer by the name of Hanson. Does the name Terri Bradford ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>The past came rushing back to Paul. \u201cIt does. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems she died recently. Car accident or something. The lawyer called because there\u2019s a will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDied?\u201d he asked, stunned. \u201cA will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Apparently she left you something. You know, in the will.\u201d</p><p>Paul was stunned and speechless. Dead? Terri was young, pretty, fun\u2014it was just wrong, her being dead. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why she\u2019d leave me anything,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he say what it was? Really, I didn\u2019t know her that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know her?\u201d North asked. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s personal. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not personal. I went out with her a few times before I married Vanni. You know\u2014back before Matt died in Iraq and all that. It was pretty casual between us.\u201d</p> <p>Except, it hadn\u2019t been quite that tidy. True, Paul had dated Terri a few times before Matt was killed in Iraq. Also true, it had been casual. She was a real pretty single girl and Paul had had no one in his life. He had been carrying a torch for Vanni, but she was married to his best friend, Matt, and pregnant with their child. But then Matt was suddenly gone, the baby was born with Paul\u2019s assistance, and Paul was all messed up in grief and guilt and regret...and hopeless love for Vanessa. In just that state, looking for someone to talk to, someone who might understand, he\u2019d spent the night with Terri.</p><p>Then began a real mess. Terri told him she was pregnant with his child and Paul had been prepared to take care of her, but ultimately Terri admitted the baby wasn\u2019t his after all. Medical tests proved that to be true and they parted company amicably. He even offered to help her anyway. He had liked Terri; she\u2019d been very sweet to him when he was in a bad place in his emotional life.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she leave me anything?\u201d he thought aloud.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the lawyer\u2019s number,\u201d North said, handing him a piece of paper. \u201cGive him a call and ask him. Then let\u2019s get everyone around the table and look at the company\u2019s last month\u2019s performance. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>The lawyer, Scott Hanson, wouldn\u2019t reveal anything over the phone. He said he\u2019d prefer to see him in person to explain Terri\u2019s will. That was the usual protocol, he explained. Hanson gave him an appointment for the next morning so there would be plenty of time for Paul to get back to Virgin River before dinnertime.</p> <p>When he talked to Vanni that evening, he told her about this unexpected development. \u201cOh, Paul, that\u2019s just awful that she would die so young,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cWhat about her child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I never spoke to her again after she told me the baby wasn\u2019t mine. I don\u2019t even know if she kept the baby. And I can\u2019t for the life of me guess what she would want me to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome memento of time you spent together?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cWhen you dated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel connected to Terri. Just enough to be sorry she lost her life so young. Whatever she left me, I\u2019ll just ask the lawyer to give it to her next of kin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you don\u2019t have to do that on my account. I wasn\u2019t jealous of her before and I\u2019m certainly not jealous of her now. Just be polite and thank the man. Then get home\u2014we have a baby to make.\u201d</p><p>Vanni had just decided, to Paul\u2019s great happiness, now that little Matt was eighteen months old, she was ready to get pregnant again. Paul thought of little Matt as his own, but the idea of a baby carrying his own DNA would thrill him.</p><p>Paul had once been to the law office where Terri worked, but he\u2019d never met her boss. It turned out to be Scott Hanson, also the executor of her will. After the introductions, Paul sat facing Scott\u2019s desk. \u201cLet me skip the suspense, Paul. Terri had absolutely no way of predicting she would suffer an accidental, premature death. It was a traffic accident. But, Terri was savvy when it came to the law, and given her family situation, she made sure her affairs were in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer family situation?\u201d Paul asked.</p> <p>\u201cHer mother has advanced MS and her parents have been divorced since Terri was a toddler, she had almost no contact with her father. Last time he came up in conversation, she had no idea where he was. And she was the single mother of an infant daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI knew she was expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to be the child\u2019s guardian. She\u2019d like you to adopt her.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s face was frozen in shock. His mouth stood open and his eyes were huge. \u201cBut...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBut, it\u2019s not my child.\u201d</p><p>Scott Hanson took a breath and folded his hands on his desk. \u201cI apologize for the shock. And for the irregularity. When preparing a will and living trust for a client, it\u2019s customary to request guardianship from the adult you have in mind for the job. When I asked Terri about your willingness to take this on, she said you were a good man, would be a good father, had offered to help her even though she wasn\u2019t carrying your child, and of all the people in her life, you were the only one who came to mind. The fact that she hadn\u2019t gotten your consent to be so named was irrelevant to her as she only set up her will as a far-fetched precaution. Of course, she expected to live to be an old woman. She was in excellent health and of sound mind. She also fully expected to meet the right man one day and give Hannah a stepfather who would always be there for her. And who, of course, would replace you as guardian in the will.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cObviously she thought you would never know how highly she regarded you.\u201d</p><p>Paul scooted forward on his chair. \u201cWhat do you know about our relationship?\u201d he asked Hanson.</p><p>\u201cReally? Hardly anything at all. That you were friends. That you were close.\u201d</p><p>Paul was shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a stretch. We dated a few times. I mean a few. She tried to convince me it was my baby, but she knew all along it wasn\u2019t and before that whole thing went too far, she admitted it. What about the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Terri, the father bolted. There\u2019s a name on the birth certificate, but Terri collected documentation from him indicating he wasn\u2019t interested in any relationship with his child so that Terri would be free to have that future \u2018right man\u2019 adopt her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should contact him,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBecause things have changed. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Scott Hanson leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s an option. You can certainly do that if you want to. But it\u2019s been my experience that people with that level of disinterest don\u2019t make good parents. I urge you to think about the baby. About Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hanson, I can\u2019t do this! My wife and I have been married just over a year. She was widowed when her husband was killed in Iraq and I\u2019ve been a father to her son. He\u2019s a year and a half and we\u2019ve just decided it\u2019s time for another child, one of my own. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t take on the child of a woman I hardly knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Mr. Haggerty. Believe me. I knew this outcome was a strong possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what will happen next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoster care for now. She\u2019ll be available for adoption and I can handle those details. She\u2019s a beautiful, healthy little girl and there\u2019s a trust for her care and education\u2014liquidation of Terri\u2019s personal effects and life insurance money. She\u2019ll find a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family with an eye on a trust?\u201d Paul asked, lifting a cynical brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot, as money goes,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cAlmost a hundred grand. That\u2019s either a good college education or averages less than five thousand a year to help defray some of the costs of raising her. As a father I can tell you, it\u2019s a pittance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be better off with no trust,\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cHow can you tell whether the couple who wants to adopt her has their eye on the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of ways, actually. She\u2019s a beautiful, healthy baby under a year old\u2014I imagine a couple who\u2019s been in the system looking for such a baby for a long time will apply. Someone who might otherwise find it difficult to adopt.\u201d</p><p>Might otherwise find it difficult rolled over in Paul\u2019s mind. Could a couple with health issues find this to be their lucky day? Could a couple with financial problems see it as a windfall? Aw, Terri, Terri, he thought in near despair. \u201cWell, as much as I\u2019d like to help out, this is an impossible situation for me,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI understand completely. Frankly, if my wife and I hadn\u2019t just put the last of four children into college, we\u2019d consider taking little Hannah into our home\u2014we were very fond of Terri and grew close to the baby. In fact, we\u2019ve kept her since Terri\u2019s untimely death and it will be hard to part with her. But we\u2019ve raised four kids, are grandparents now and have worked hard to get to this place in life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to another twenty years.\u201d</p><p>Paul judged Scott Hanson to be in his late fifties, maybe early sixties, healthy and strong. Paul was just trying to start a family, and he was sneaking up on forty. Boy, could he relate. \u201cI understand,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSince Terri\u2019s death, has anyone come forward asking if they could be considered as her guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Scott said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that odd? I mean, she was a young woman. The night I met her, there were girlfriends. I know she had relationships with young women her age and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, she did indeed. And one of the reasons she decided you were the person to be named was that you\u2019re in a stable marriage and earn a decent living. She talked about your values, she admired you, Mr. Haggerty. Terri\u2019s close girlfriends are single women, just getting started in life, mostly unmarried, trying to get on their feet. I didn\u2019t expect any of them to step forward. They\u2019re nice girls, but not ready for a family. In point of fact, Terri wasn\u2019t ready, either. A lot changed in her life when she found out she was expecting a child. She got real serious about her future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man...\u201d Paul was remembering. Back when he wasn\u2019t sure whether Terri\u2019s baby was his, he asked Vanessa if she could accept him with that baggage, and she said, Of course. We don\u2019t leave our babies out there without our love and protection. When he had forced Terri to agree to an ultrasound as a means of determining the time of conception, establishing the baby wasn\u2019t his, he had seen that little mass, the fluttering heart, and his first insane reaction had been disappointment! He knew that without his help, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do the best possible job of taking care of that little wonder. The results of the test let him off the hook, and he felt sorry for her. Sad. It wasn\u2019t his baby after all, but it could have been. He had been intimate with her. He\u2019d used protection, but still\u2014he\u2019d been with her.</p><p>\u201cThere must be family somewhere,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cShirttail relatives back in Missouri,\u201d Scott said. \u201cTerri hadn\u2019t seen them since she was a little girl. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s just one more thing I have to do before we close the book on this issue and I move on to the matter of placing Hannah,\u201d Scott said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cI just have to introduce you to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. Come on now, I don\u2019t have to see her. That\u2019ll just make matters harder. I mean, come on.\u201d</p><p>Scott Hanson touched a button on his phone console. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it come back on either one of us, Mr. Haggerty. We have to go through the steps. Right now the idea of taking custody of an anonymous child is complicated and inconvenient. You have to see Hannah so that the human factor is involved, so that your decision is based on all the facts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s required, Mr. Haggerty,\u201d he said as he stood. At precisely that moment the door to his office opened.</p><p>A smiling young woman, presumably an administrative assistant or social worker, entered carrying a simply beautiful baby of about ten months. She had Terri\u2019s dark hair, but in large curls that circled her head. Her eyes were so big they dominated her face. Her round cheeks were pink, she had a little, rosy, heart-shaped mouth, and she lifted her hand in the air and grinned hugely, showing two brand-new front teeth. And she said, \u201cMa!\u201d before her hand dropped. But her smile continued and she clutched her fat little hands together and giggled.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Haggerty, meet Hannah Bradford,\u201d the young woman said.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>And little Hannah said, \u201cHa!\u201d And then she giggled again.</p><p>Paul did the dumbest thing. He put out his big hands toward her and she fell right into them. She put her chubby arms around his neck and buried her face there, blubbering into his neck.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Paul. I can\u2019t complete an adoption for a couple the mother didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t name in her will very quickly. There will be red tape, it\u2019ll take weeks,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>\u201cWill you take her home with you?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Scott shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my wife and I have family commitments. We could squeeze Hannah in, but it would be complicated with the kids, grandkids. But I\u2019ll make sure Hannah gets quality foster care....\u201d</p><p>Paul nuzzled her. She smelled heavenly. Then he lifted his head and looked at Scott. \u201cCan I foster her until my wife and I have had a chance to make a final decision?\u201d</p><p>The lawyer shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. Terri had you in mind anyway.\u201d</p><p>Paul held little Hannah close. \u201cVanessa is going to string me up by the balls and take strips of flesh off me with a dull blade....\u201d</p><p>Scott laughed in spite of himself. \u201cThat would be Mrs. Haggerty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToday she is,\u201d Paul answered.</p><p>\u201cShould you call her first? Before taking Hannah home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would make sense,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one who owes Terri. I probably don\u2019t owe her this much, but I\u2014\u201d Terri tried to trick him into believing he was this child\u2019s father and it almost cost him the woman he loved. Why he thought he owed her was\u2014\u201cTerri was very kind to me when I was having a real hard time.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t so much that as this precious child in his arms. Hannah. It wasn\u2019t her fault her mother was suddenly gone and the only person Terri had been able to think of was Paul.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something\u2014does Mrs. Haggerty like children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants a houseful. I was really looking forward to starting on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever discuss a possible adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And we sure never talked about adopting an ex-girlfriend\u2019s offspring.\u201d Paul sighed heavily. \u201cShe\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d he muttered. Then he said to Scott, \u201cI\u2019m going to need a car seat. And all her stuff.\u201d</p><p>Paul was all checked out on the car-seat installation because of little Mattie. He rigged up the mirror so he could see her from the driver\u2019s seat. The truck bed was filled with her gear, from crib to high chair. He was a little rusty on changing and cleaning up a little girl baby\u2014but he had nieces and had been roped into babysitting a few times when they were small, so it all came back to him.</p> <p>He could have called Vanessa before heading out of Grants Pass to say, \u201cShe left me a child.\u201d But frankly, the whole thing scared him to death. He just made sure Hannah was dry and clean, gave her a bottle to drink as they started the trip and headed for home.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve called her,\u201d he told Hannah. \u201cThat was stupid, not calling. It would have given her a good four hours to think. But see, when I thought about taking you home, it was obviously a bad idea. Just didn\u2019t fit into our family plan. All that made sense, until I saw you. Until you blew raspberries on my neck.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took the bottle out of her mouth and belched loudly.</p><p>\u201cGood one!\u201d Paul said, praising her. \u201cDrink the rest of that bottle and close your eyes. It\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d she said loudly.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re stuck with me. But, hey, you might try that \u2018Ma!\u2019 thing on Vanessa when you meet her. You\u2019re going to need all the help you can get.\u201d</p><p>He drove in silence for a while, barely hearing the soft suckling sound of Hannah finishing her bottle. In a voice quiet enough that the little girl might not have heard, he said, \u201cYour mother was a good person. She was beautiful like you and very funny. That\u2019s why I called her the first time\u2014she was fun. I think you got her sense of humor. And obviously she wanted the best for you. Not that I\u2019m the best\u2014but the way she looked out for you, in case something happened, that\u2019s what a mother who cares does\u2014makes sure you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure. Me and Scott Hanson\u2014we\u2019ll make sure.\u201d</p><p>He thought he should probably rehearse what he was going to say to Vanessa, but nothing came to mind. It wasn\u2019t exactly that he took one look at the beautiful little girl and completely reversed his position. Not at all. It still didn\u2019t work into his plans for the future. But he did take one look and decided you don\u2019t just turn your back on a human being, a helpless child, and leave her to a system that may not serve her best interests. Someone had to be her advocate. And while Paul didn\u2019t think it should be him, he really couldn\u2019t think of anyone better for the job. Certainly not a biological father who had abandoned her when she was a mere seedling.</p><p>Paul pulled into a parking lot before heading into Virgin River to change and freshen Hannah, smear a little lotion on her and make sure she looked and smelled extra sweet. God, but she was beautiful. And while he carried her on his hip to walk to the trash can to pitch the dirty diaper, she put her arms around his neck and pressed her mouth against his cheek four straight times, a baby kiss that didn\u2019t quite pucker, and then she giggled.</p><p>And Paul cried.</p><p>He pulled her close and tears ran silently down his cheeks. He gulped a few times. His voice was a whisper. \u201cSee, I wasn\u2019t in love with her, but she was a very good person. She wanted you very much, even if she had to go it alone. I was almost sorry it turned out I wasn\u2019t your dad. That would\u2019ve given you one more person to protect you.\u201d</p><p>And she put her lips against his cheek again.</p><p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have happened to you,\u201d he said, smoothing her curls with his big, callused hand. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been left with no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d She put her head down on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCome on, lollipop. We gotta take you to meet the family.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>When he pulled up to his house, he gave the horn a toot. He pulled Hannah out of the car seat and held her on his hip. Vanessa came out onto the porch, Mattie toddling behind her.</p><p>\u201cGuess what Terri left me?\u201d he said.</p><p>Vanessa was stunned into total silence, staring at Paul with a baby on his hip. Mattie clung to her leg.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLet\u2019s just talk for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, her eyes as round as doughnuts. \u201cPaul, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cThe only thing I could think of at the time,\u201d he said lamely.</p><p>Vanessa turned and, taking Mattie by the hand, walked back into the house.</p><p>Paul followed, without even grabbing Hannah\u2019s diaper bag. They sat in the great room opposite each other, Mattie on Vanni\u2019s lap and Hannah on Paul\u2019s. Paul thought this was what a family-counseling session must look like when the family is at odds\u2014separated by space, watching each other warily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Vanessa asked with a desperate sound.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Paul returned.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she leave you her child?\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cThe lawyer said she thought I was a good person. In a stable marriage...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call this stable?\u201d Vanessa asked, trying to control her voice, trying not to cry. \u201cOh, Paul...Is this really your child and you lied to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Vanni, I\u2019ve never lied to you about anything. She\u2019s not mine. But I told you a long time ago, I offered to help Terri. I told her if she ever needed anything, she could get in touch with me through the Grants Pass company, through my family. I did that because I felt bad for her. And we did have a relationship. Not one I\u2019m real proud of, but we did. It turns out she died without anybody able or willing to take on this child. The grandmother\u2019s sick, the grandfather\u2019s absent, and there\u2019s no family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told her you\u2019d be there for her?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I really expected her to call if she was a little short of cash or something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring her home, Paul? Without talking to me first?\u201d</p><p>Paul stiffened a little and firmed his jaw. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know what else to do. The lawyer who Terri worked for, who did her will and trust, he and his wife are fond of her and have been taking care of her, but they\u2019re grandparents and they\u2019ve already raised four kids. Honest to God, if he\u2019d asked to keep her, I would have walked away, knowing she was in good hands. But he\u2019s not up to it, Vanni. And she\u2019s not a stray puppy. She\u2019s a living, breathing person.\u201d</p><p>Vanni scooted forward on the sofa. \u201cWhat about her biological father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want her,\u201d Paul said, instinctively pulling Hannah protectively closer. \u201cWe should talk about this, think about it, and if it\u2019s not possible for us, if it\u2019s not the best thing all around, Mr. Hanson will help us find a loving home for her. But I think we should at least try. We can talk about it and try it out a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did you maybe care about that woman a lot more than you told me?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t care if this makes sense or not, but Terri entrusted this child to me. To my care. And she was a friend. And she\u2019s dead. And this little girl has no one. No one, Vanessa.\u201d He stared at his wife. \u201cAs a favor to me, will you at least think about the possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a child of our own? What about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that out of the question? Because you said you wanted a houseful. You\u2019re wonderful at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, are you clueless? She\u2019s what\u2014about nine months? Ten? Mattie\u2019s eighteen months. I had my IUD removed! I could have another one in nine months! You don\u2019t just bring home a baby under a year old and say, \u2018Here\u2014add one more in diapers!\u2019 How wonderful do you think any woman can be at this?\u201d</p><p>Right on cue, Hannah lifted her little hand in the air toward Vanessa and said, \u201cMa! Ma, Ma, Ma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Vanessa said. And tears rolled down her cheeks because she didn\u2019t want to turn her back on this little girl any more than Paul did, but the enormity of the task was overwhelming. And the fact that the baby was Terri\u2019s didn\u2019t make it easier.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just walk away without even trying,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cHow can you love and hate the same thing about a man?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you\u2019re so sensitive, so giving,\u201d she said just above a whisper. \u201cBut do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done? I don\u2019t want your ex-girlfriend\u2019s child to raise and I still can\u2019t let you take her away now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help. I\u2019ll get you some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that well financially. Building in Virgin River is barely getting off the ground.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little money for her care,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to touch that while you\u2019re still thinking about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m still thinking about it?\u201d she asked, sitting forward a little. \u201cPaul, you\u2019ve made up your mind, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He hated that\u2014how she could read him before he even had a chance to open his stupid mouth and put his foot in it. He shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know her a little bit. And I don\u2019t want her to be all alone.\u201d He bounced her on his knee. \u201cI\u2019ll work out the money thing. It\u2019s not critical yet. We\u2019ll be all right. Business is fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Paul,\u201d she said, and tears fell from her eyes. She blinked her eyes closed and shook her head. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have at least talked to me first?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at Hannah. \u201cYou would have said the sensible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing I should\u2019ve been strong enough and smart enough to say. That this was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you have done then, Paul? What would you do if I said that while we talk about this and think about this, she can\u2019t stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs God is my witness, Vanessa, I don\u2019t have the first idea.\u201d</p><p>Paul unloaded the back of his truck while Hannah sat in the playpen with Mattie. At least there was no problem there\u2014Mattie was a real easygoing kid and he took to her instantly. Vanessa stood guard in case there were any bad manners. Paul set up the crib but left everything else to put away later. Then he put Hannah back in the car seat and drove into town, hoping to catch Mel and Cameron at the clinic before they left for the day.</p> <p>It was not yet four o\u2019clock, but when he walked into the clinic, he found Mel talking with Cameron while Cameron was loading what looked like files into his satchel.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cWell now, who do we have here?\u201d Mel asked, coming out from behind the reception counter.</p><p>\u201cRemember that situation I had up in Grants Pass? Before Vanni agreed to marry me? The woman who said she was pregnant?\u201d As it happened, he had gotten advice from both Mel and Cameron at the time.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...?\u201d Mel shook her head, confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I escaped that one,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMeet Hannah, Terri Bradford\u2019s baby. Terri was killed in a car accident a couple of weeks ago and it turns out she named me as Hannah\u2019s guardian, though I\u2019m not her biological father. I just found out this morning. And brought her home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Mel added.</p><p>\u201cI have her medical records and she seems perfectly healthy,\u201d Paul said. \u201cCam, would you mind taking a look to be sure? For our peace of mind? We don\u2019t want to suddenly find her sick or put Mattie at any kind of risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a freak,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI feel like a monster. Like I\u2019m taking a puppy to the vet to make sure the pedigree is all right.\u201d</p><p>Cam came around the counter and reached for the baby. She gave her hands a clap, grinned at him and went to him willingly. \u201cDon\u2019t feel that way. It\u2019s for her safety and yours. I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s up to date on shots, checkups, all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Paul just shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never been around a child so sweet natured. I\u2019m afraid the other shoe\u2019s going to drop and she\u2019s going to start screaming her head off. Since I first met her this morning, she\u2019s done nothing but smile and coo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that nice? How\u2019s Vanni doing with the news?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>\u201cI kind of dumped this on her. I was afraid to call her, so I just brought Hannah home. Vanni\u2019s in shock. We just barely started trying for one of our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d Cam said. \u201cSpeaking as one who hasn\u2019t slept through the night since Julia and Justin were born in June, I can imagine her hesitancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she pretty much wants me dead right now.\u201d He rubbed a hand across the back of his neck. \u201cBut what was I gonna do? Do you say no thank-you to a living, breathing, beautiful human being who needs a home? Do you say, shove her in a foster home while I think it over?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis might not be the most convenient thing, but I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God it was you and not me,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIf I brought another child home to Abby and newborn twins, I would be dead.\u201d He jiggled the baby. \u201cCome on, little girl. Let\u2019s look you over.\u201d He reached for the envelope that held her medical records. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d He took Hannah to an exam room.</p><p>When Cam was not in the room, Mel took a chance. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, but have you been in touch with the mother all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Paul said, shaking his head. \u201cLast time I saw her, she was four months pregnant and crying. She\u2019d tried to trip me up and Cameron set us up with a doctor in Grants Pass to do an ultrasound that showed she was about a month more pregnant than I was around for. She was miserable, so sorry she\u2019d done that to me. You know, I thought about checking on her to make sure she was okay. I thought that would be the kind thing to do, but I didn\u2019t want to set up any kind of expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t need to,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cI told her to get in touch if she ever needed anything. I didn\u2019t exactly mean something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to keep her, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? Give her away? Vanni\u2019s thinking about it. I guess if it just won\u2019t work for us, I\u2019ll get the lawyer\u2019s help to find a loving family for her. But Mel, when someone has enough faith in you to entrust you with their child, do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the larger question is, does anyone have the right to leave you a child to raise without talking to you about it first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t think it would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a car accident. She was just being cautious. Getting her legal ducks in a row. You gotta give her some credit for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still...Don\u2019t be too hard on Vanessa. I\u2019m assuming she never even met the woman.\u201d Paul shook his head. \u201cLord, what a huge undertaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then again, just one more. One that actually needs us right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give you some advice?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cShoot. I\u2019m wide-open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your marriage, your family. Be absolutely sure you\u2019re both of like mind. Kids put a strain on the happiest of marriages, and if it\u2019s one that came to you in a real unconventional way, you don\u2019t want any bitterness about the whole affair. I mean, you could be unhappy if Vanessa just can\u2019t take her on, she could be bitter if she takes her on because you want it so much. Think about some counseling before you make a final decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll bring that up with Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to show her a lot of appreciation for even considering taking in an old girlfriend\u2019s child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. And, Mel? This is awkward, but there being no drugstore in Virgin River...Would you happen to have condoms on hand?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and tilted her head. \u201cCondoms?\u201d</p><p>His face took on a red stain. \u201cYou pulled Vanni\u2019s IUD, right? She told me if I get her pregnant on top of all this, she can\u2019t be responsible for her actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll fix you up. But for future reference, Connie keeps some under the counter at the Corner Store.\u201d Mel went to the cabinet where she kept supplies like prenatal vitamins and brought out a box of a dozen. She handed them to Paul. \u201cMay the force be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe odds are pretty good, I\u2019m not going to be invited to use these for a while.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Paul delivered his bids and Noah was impressed with the detail. Noah thought about it for a while and then conceded that Paul was right about having his crews do the bulk of the heavy work in the church. Noah\u2019s job was to pick out the flooring and type of ceiling he wanted for the basement, plus paint for all the remaining walls. There was still plenty that needed his hand\u2014painting the two offices, buying appliances for the church kitchen, arranging for the delivery and installation of pews, not to mention receiving and moving in his personal shipment, which included books and an old piano.</p><p>Before Paul left the bids with him, he said, \u201cNoah, you\u2019re actually a counselor, aren\u2019t you? Like a real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real one?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019re not just a minister, but a\u2014Ah, hell, what I mean is, we\u2019re not religious people. You know? I pray all the time, but I\u2019m looking for something practical. Like marriage counseling. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cI can manage that, Paul. Need a little help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, and then he explained, from the beginning, the situation with himself, Terri Bradford, his wife\u2014and the will.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThings a little upside down at your house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Paul shook his head dismally. \u201cWe should have some help. There\u2019s some Ph.D. over in Grace Valley who does counseling, there\u2019s always Mel, who isn\u2019t a real counselor but she sure is smart and helpful. And maybe there\u2019s you. But, Noah, meaning no disrespect\u2014I don\u2019t want to pray my way through this. I want to get Vanni and me what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019m all-purpose. Let\u2019s set up a time.\u201d</p><p>In order to be prepared for when Paul had his work done, Noah had to go about the business of choosing additional items for the church. He admitted his obvious limitations and asked Ellie to help him with the selections. They spent days driving from Fortuna to Eureka and even to Redding, shopping and buying.</p><p>There was a lot of time for talk while driving and over lunch. He was relieved to learn that Arnie hadn\u2019t given her any more trouble over the Saturday visits, but was disappointed that she had so little concrete information about Arnie. \u201cHe said he grew up in Southern California, went to high school and college there, that his parents are dead and that he came here from a big private school in Arizona. I saw his framed diplomas, but I can\u2019t remember the names of the schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suspicious of him, Ellie. Of his past. I looked him up on the computer, but I can\u2019t find anything on him. I\u2019ll have to think about where to look next.\u201d</p><p>Ellie did have news that brought him great peace of mind. She had called Brie Valenzuela. \u201cShe\u2019s going to look into this custody thing and see if anything can be done. I love that woman! When I told her what had happened, she was really pissed off! I told her I\u2019d pay her somehow, but she said I could take my good old time about it\u2014she believed I was good for it. And she promised to discount her time for me because I\u2019m struggling right now. She said going against judges\u2019 decisions is dicey. I guess it makes them pissy.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cDoes it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to call Child Welfare Services and have them visit Arnie. She knows a couple of people there she\u2019s worked with before. They\u2019ll take a closer look at the way Arnie\u2019s taking care of the kids. But on paper it might not look like he\u2019s a bad parent. You know\u2014taking away privileges when they misbehave, giving them chores, that kind of thing. The thing they won\u2019t understand is that the kids don\u2019t really misbehave. I know I sound real biased, but they\u2019re awful good kids.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew all about this sort of thing. His father looked good on paper. How can a report show the contempt in a parent\u2019s features? The narrowness of the eyes when he calls you stupid? The sheer glee on his face when he can cancel something like summer camp because you didn\u2019t curl the garden hose up right? And his father was one of the greatest men of God known in the Midwest. Kindness, humility and devotion should have been starched into his bones, but he was arrogant and cruel. How does that happen? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And how did he know Ellie was such a great mother? He didn\u2019t know how he knew, but he was sure. It was something about the way she touched the children and talked to them. They craved safety and comfort in her arms and she enfolded them so bravely, so selflessly. Their need for her, their love, it was unmistakable in their voices, on their faces. Anyone who stayed awake all night to watch them sleep, to hold them because it would be so long before she could do so again...Oh, God help him, he didn\u2019t care if she did lap dances to keep them as well as she could. At least it mattered to her that they be safe and well fed.</p><p>And then something occurred to him. \u201cEllie, can I ask you a very personal question?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything private left. I\u2019ve told you pretty much everything.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it took him a moment. \u201cYour job. Your dancing job. Did you like it?\u201d</p><p>She looked across the front seat at him while he kept his eyes focused on the road. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an okay job.\u201d Then she took a breath and decided to cut him some slack. \u201cOkay, it wasn\u2019t the taking-off-your clothes part I was crazy about. That\u2019s something you do in private for a husband or lover. I was doing it for money, and getting leered at by strange men doesn\u2019t turn me on. In fact, if you don\u2019t fight it real hard, it can be humiliating.</p><p>\u201cBut there was stuff to like,\u201d she went on. \u201cFirst of all, there were some real nice girls there. They weren\u2019t all great\u2014some were a pain in the butt. But I got kind of close to a couple of girls, and I liked the bouncer and his wife, and the owner. The owner is a good guy, always watching out for everyone. He kept a clean club, he didn\u2019t want a big hassle from the cops, so it was drug-free. If he caught anyone using or turning tricks on the side, they were gone. And the customers were careful because Clint, the bouncer, was a bulldog. All I had to do was wiggle around a lot and get down to a thong. And for that, I had money, protection and friends. To a girl like me\u2014that\u2019s living large.\u201d</p><p>A girl like me? \u201cHow long did you work there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite three months. And before you ask, it\u2019s the only job like that I ever had. I did secretary work, waitressed, cleaned houses and offices, worked nights at the convenience store, worked on a shipping dock at a big retailer\u2019s for a while. But that club job paid the best and the hours were good for a mother. And get this\u2014it came with benefits. I hated letting go of the benefits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you ever have to do things you didn\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like taking my clothes off,\u201d she stressed. \u201cBut, that was the job and I needed that job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about things like, you know, lap dances?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, Your Reverence! You know about lap dances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t screw with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to ask...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t screw a swearword?\u201d she taunted.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the cusp. So?\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to be quiet for a second. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>He turned and met her eyes briefly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind telling me, I\u2019d like to know how it affected you. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Noah, it was like this,\u201d she said. He\u2019d already learned that when she called him by his name, she was about to be both serious and candid. \u201cThat was also part of the job. I didn\u2019t take off the thong and they weren\u2019t allowed to put hands on me, but it was awful. I hated it. That\u2019s another thing you do for a husband or lover, a man you\u2019ve given your heart and commitment to, not for a paying customer. So what I had to do was turn off my brain. Send my mind to another place. I learned to think about jets and ocean liners and hot-air balloons rather than what I was doing. And when it was over, I totally forgot about it. I scrubbed the details from my mind\u2014the face, the smile, the smell of him, everything. And I never remember again. I do not ever once think about a lap dance.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnything else about my life there that you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy jets and ocean liners and hot-air balloons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never been anywhere. I\u2019ve never been on a trip. I\u2019ve never been high up, except in a building or on a bridge. I\u2019ve never traveled or had adventures. Whenever I\u2019m in a bad place, I take a little trip in my head. My gramma used to say, \u2018You don\u2019t need a lot of money to live a full life\u2014all you need is a fertile mind, some books and a good attitude. Books are free at the library, but a fertile mind takes practice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cEllie, your grandmother must have been incredible. I wish I could\u2019ve met her.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cShe totally rocked. I miss her so much sometimes.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cSeems unfair sometimes. Jason...My gramma...Two people I loved so much are already gone.\u201d</p><p>Noah did an uncharacteristic thing. He reached across the front seat and grabbed her hand, giving it a squeeze. Because he understood that.</p><p>Noah had several appointments the following week. One was sheer fun\u2014meeting with Shelby MacIntyre and Luke Riordan to discuss their wedding. The second meeting was a bigger challenge for him. Paul and Vanessa needed some counseling while they tried to make a decision about Hannah. And the third meeting was a coffee date with a nurse named Gloria. He\u2019d been putting off that last one as long as he could.</p><p>When Noah met with Shelby and Luke, he felt as if the smile was permanently frozen on his face, they were so delightful. One look told him they weren\u2019t a perfect match; Luke was considerably older than Shelby and their personalities were very different. Two minutes with them proved his first impression wrong.</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing about this wedding is Luke\u2019s family,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cMy family is already here. They\u2019re not going anywhere. But Luke\u2019s mother is a widow who\u2019s been waiting forever for her boys to settle down, and two of Luke\u2019s four brothers have been serving in the Middle East. There\u2019s a weekend in early October when we can get everyone together. If the church is going to be ready, we\u2019d like to do it here, where we\u2019re going to make our home. And then we\u2019ll have a fancy catered dinner in a big tent in Uncle Walt\u2019s pasture beside the river, at the foot of the mountains. It sounds casual, but dinner will be served on china, there will be flowers everywhere and a wooden floor for dancing. I was for something small, but Vanni wants the wedding to be spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your cousin\u2019s husband, Paul, and I can provide the church,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThere will have to be a priest, as well. I\u2019m not going to become a Catholic, but Luke\u2019s whole family is Catholic, and it\u2019s important to his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very doable,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019ve done it before. An ecumenical marriage ceremony. The priest and I will share the honor of uniting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds wonderful,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWant to talk about your vows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about making up our own, but we\u2019re kind of stuck. Turns out we\u2019re not so good at that.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cBut I am. So, I take this to mean you don\u2019t want the customary vows, but something unique. And you\u2019re having trouble getting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it exactly!\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with any vows,\u201d Luke said. \u201cJust get it done. I\u2019m ready for Shelby to get off the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d she admonished.</p><p>Noah laughed again. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll want a cheap baptism next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking nine months from the wedding,\u201d Luke said. \u201cShelby\u2019s just starting nursing college. She has summers off. We should have our first in summer, if possible. Could be a push. We\u2019ll have to get rolling on that.\u201d</p><p>Shelby peered at Luke. \u201cOur first?\u201d she asked. \u201cA few months ago you were never getting married and now you\u2019re having more than one child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have input on the number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that you\u2019ve talked me into this, I\u2019m in no mood to wait. And it will make my mother happy if we get going on it.\u201d</p><p>Shelby looked at Noah. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better make it a quick ceremony, Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cMy services are being requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said with a happy laugh. \u201cQuick, unique and legal. Does that sum it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you come up with something, can we talk about it? I don\u2019t want to commit to anything that you think is totally hot and I think is really sappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll get right to work on it. I have two church offices to paint. I come up with great ideas while I paint.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s meeting with Vanessa and Paul at their home presented more of a challenge. He had requested that the children be included even though they wouldn\u2019t understand any of the dialogue. Even if they were napping, that was all right. He wanted to meet with the couple while the little ones were close at hand and on their minds, rather than removed from the home.</p><p>When he arrived, he shook Paul\u2019s hand and hugged Vanni. He met Hannah and Mattie, who were together in a playpen in the great room. He remarked on what beautiful children they were. It immediately struck Noah that they seemed to have such great rapport for babies who had only just met, rolling around and giggling, cooing and laughing at each other, Mattie pushing toys on Hannah, and Hannah knocking him down with hugs.</p><p>\u201cLook at them,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou\u2019d think they were brother and sister. They even look alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMattie has his father\u2019s dark hair and eyes,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>Paul glanced at Noah. \u201cAnd Hannah has her mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHow amazing is that? They\u2019re getting along so well. How are you two getting along?\u201d</p><p>They seemed to look at each other cautiously. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThis is very hard for Vanni. Two small children are a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it also very hard for you?\u201d Noah asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cVery. Hard.\u201d His elbows rested on his knees, hands clasped, and he looked down. The man was worried sick.</p><p>\u201cCan I hear about your struggle first? If that\u2019s okay with Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if Paul\u2019s honest, he\u2019ll tell you his struggle is with me.\u201d</p><p>Noah shifted gears. \u201cGo ahead, Vanni. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI butted in,\u201d she said a bit regretfully.</p><p>Noah chuckled. \u201cGimme a break here\u2014I\u2019m very good at this. Everyone is going to get a fair chance. Hit me\u2014tell me what your biggest burden is. Then we\u2019ll get to Paul\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI resent it. And because I resent it, I haven\u2019t bonded with Hannah. And there\u2019s no reason not to\u2014she\u2019s perfect. She\u2019s sweet and easy and delightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe the resentment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow and why does this woman I\u2019ve never met give me her child to raise? She might have named Paul in her will, but I\u2019ve never met her. And it\u2019s not Paul who\u2019s going to take care of Hannah. At least not most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s part of the problem, according to what I understand,\u201d Noah said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, Vanni,\u201d Paul said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she get a pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to tell Hannah, Paul?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cThat you slept with her mother but didn\u2019t love her? And she\u2019s not yours but her own father didn\u2019t want her?\u201d</p><p>There was silence while Paul and Vanni stared at each other. Noah cleared his throat. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think Hannah\u2019s going to care who Paul slept with. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to care who you slept with, either, Vanni. Since you never met Hannah\u2019s mother, she\u2019s going to want to know from Paul what he remembers about her. Paul will probably remember some nice things. Won\u2019t you, Paul?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. Yeah, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might be interested in how this came to happen,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHow she came to land in your family. Can one of you describe that to me?\u201d</p><p>They were both quiet for a moment. Then Paul said, \u201cTerri wanted me to be the father of her child from the first minute she realized she was pregnant. Well, maybe not the first minute, because we hadn\u2019t talked in months. She went to Hannah\u2019s biological father first and he told her she\u2019d have to sue him to get any kind of support. But then I happened to call her, spent the evening with her and she made up her mind\u2014she was going to try to convince me I was the father. She wanted to get married. In the end, when she admitted she\u2019d lied about the whole thing, she said she did it because she thought I\u2019d be a good father. She said she thought I was a good man.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she figured that\u2014I wasn\u2019t good to her. I told her I was in love with Vanni, that I couldn\u2019t marry her because I\u2019d always be in love with Vanni.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when the lawyer told you Terri had named you as Hannah\u2019s guardian? How did you respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I couldn\u2019t do it\u2014that Vanni and I were just starting our lives together. We wanted to have a baby together\u2014now that\u2019s on hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a decision then?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep her? Adopt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we get more comfortable with the idea. But even though Vanni doesn\u2019t really want another child now, she doesn\u2019t want to let Hannah go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right, Vanni?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said softly. Her voice took on some emotion. \u201cLook at them together,\u201d she said, glancing at the kids in the playpen. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect together. And Paul adores her. But I\u2019m scared to death\u2014when I hold her, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m holding someone else\u2019s baby, a stranger\u2019s baby. What if I never bond with her? What if I never think of her as my daughter? What if I\u2019m always a little angry that her mother, Paul\u2019s old girlfriend, just gave her to Paul without checking with me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you obviously changed your mind,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou told the lawyer no, but then you brought her home. What changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cHonest to God, I don\u2019t know. Before I saw her, I knew it was a bad idea, that it would complicate our marriage, our family, and my wife and little Matt are everything to me. Then here comes this little, chubby, rosy-cheeked kid who has no idea her mother\u2019s dead, has no idea she\u2019s being given to a family she doesn\u2019t know. A family that doesn\u2019t want her, that considers her a total inconvenience. And she looked at me and smiled so big I thought her face was gonna crack. It just shot me in the heart. I thought I was gonna die on the spot. I just couldn\u2019t...let...any more bad stuff happen to her.\u201d He inhaled for control. \u201cOn the way home, for hours in the truck, she was so good, so sweet and quiet. I stopped to give her a change and she grabbed me around the neck and gave me sloppy kisses. Before I knew it, I was crying like a girl. She didn\u2019t even know all she\u2019d been through. She had no idea how precarious her future was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how good he is?\u201d Vanni said. \u201cOh, Noah, that\u2019s why I fell in love with Paul\u2014because he\u2019s that kind of man. What\u2019s the matter with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself, Vanni. It\u2019s a shock, it\u2019s an intrusion. And not a baby abandoned on your doorstep, but the child of a woman your husband had a relationship with. Add to that, Paul took one look at her and was hooked. Your adjustment is more difficult. You have to cope with the bite of jealousy, which is a burden you shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about. I think it\u2019s pretty natural.\u201d</p><p>Paul scooted forward anxiously. \u201cBut I\u2019ve told Vanni over and over, there was no reason to be jealous of Terri. Even if Matt hadn\u2019t been killed in Iraq, even if Vanni and I never got together, even if Hannah had been my daughter, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve ended up with Terri. She was a good person, had lots of nice qualities, but I just wasn\u2019t in love with her. I\u2019d have taken care of them, but I knew the way I felt wasn\u2019t enough to make a good marriage. And Noah, it probably wasn\u2019t right for me to be seeing her, knowing that, but I never led her on, I swear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy, easy,\u201d Noah said. \u201cVanni\u2019s not jealous of Terri. She\u2019s jealous of Hannah.\u201d</p><p>You could have heard a pin drop. The silence stretched out.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be,\u201d Vanni finally said. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Jealous of a defenseless baby? I\u2019ll go to hell for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah said, smiling, shaking his head. \u201cNot in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s irrational! I\u2019m not mean enough to be jealous of an innocent child! A child who needs me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of emotions are irrational, but that\u2019s not really the case here, if you think about it. You wanted to have a child with your husband. You planned, waited until your son was a good age to space the children so you could manage, and you were looking forward to it. Paul told me\u2014you love children, want a bunch of them. And before you even had your chance, the little babe of an ex-girlfriend needs Paul, and Paul was immediately hooked. Your husband fell in love with another woman\u2019s child.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, this could have worked out differently. For example, if you\u2019d been present for the reading of the will, it might\u2019ve been you who was pulled in by her rosy cheeks and pretty smile. Her need for a loving family. But the way it went down...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him\u2014he should have called me from Oregon. Rather than just bringing her home like he did,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Noah was shaking his head again. \u201cThat might have been even harder, because Paul couldn\u2019t stop himself. He had to try. And if you\u2019d told him no, don\u2019t accept that baby, then he would have defied you. No, I think this worked out the way it was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now what am I to do?\u201d she said, tears leaking out of her eyes. \u201cHow can I ever bond with her if I resent her? If I\u2019m jealous of her?\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be this way forever, Vanni,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYour feelings aren\u2019t shameful or sinful, but predictable. They\u2019re human. You\u2019ll need a lot of reassurance from your husband, and we\u2019ll work on the issues\u2014anger, jealousy, remorse, guilt. Paul will learn to let himself off the hook for bringing this challenge to the family, and you will learn to forgive yourself for responding in a completely understandable way. It\u2019s going to be all right. We\u2019re going to walk through this, nice and easy, and reach a conclusion that works for your marriage, your family and for Hannah. You have a wonderful, deep, committed love for each other. In the end, this is going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>After an hour with Vanni and Paul, Noah called Gloria and pushed his coffee date at Valley Hospital off to the next day. He called her and said he\u2019d had a rough afternoon. Instead, he went to the nursing home in Eureka to watch Andy Griffith with Sal Salentino. An hour with Sal was like sandpaper on his emotions, smoothing down the bumps. He bought six large cans of soup at the grocery store and drove out to the transients\u2019 camp on his way home. Those old boys were starting to like him, he could tell by the way they drew near when he showed up.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d done a decent job of reassuring Vanessa and Paul that things would work out for them, but it left him tired and feeling sorry for himself. Vanessa and Paul grappled with adjustments to a new marriage and growing family, but at the core they had health, love and passion.</p><p>Noah missed passion.</p><p>The next day Noah met the nurse, Gloria, during her dinner break at the hospital. She was a nice lady, but then he had expected nothing less. She was short and cute, kind of round but pleasantly so, around thirty years old. She had a heart-shaped face, lots of yellow curls that she had pulled back into a tie to keep out of her face and her work, big luminous blue eyes, rosy cheeks and full lips. Of course she was wearing scrubs to work in, but he imagined she looked quite pretty in her regular clothes. And she was very excited to meet with Noah.</p><p>They had a pleasant conversation in which it was established that she was completely available and he admitted to being widowed. Within thirty minutes she was offering to cook him dinner. And he said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Gloria. I didn\u2019t mean to mislead you\u2014I\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>He had absolutely no idea why he\u2019d said that and was enormously grateful she didn\u2019t respond with, \u201cWho?\u201d It was just that he knew, almost instantly, that he didn\u2019t want to have dinner with her, didn\u2019t want to date her, didn\u2019t feel that lustful tug that accompanied attraction.</p><p>People probably assumed that a man of the cloth didn\u2019t experience all the usual emotions. Maybe just the tidy and manageable ones. Noah was eternally grateful such was not the case, especially when it came to things like desire for a woman. He was so glad it didn\u2019t feel like a warm bath to want a woman, but rather like a firestorm. For Noah, when it was the right woman, it was not quiet yearning, but a desperate and hot wanting that threatened his control. That was definitely the best part, that it was bigger than him, that it had a life of its own, that it was more like a fire-breathing dragon than an angel of comfort. When that feeling came over him, it was so good it was scary.</p><p>He did not have that feeling for a nurse named Gloria.</p><p>Nine</p><p>After meeting with Gloria, Noah was heading back into town when he drove by the Fitches\u2019 house. He pulled up in front, parked, got out and went up the garage stairs to the apartment Ellie rented. He knocked on the door and momentarily he heard, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She opened the door wearing loose shorts, a big T-shirt, bare feet, and was towel drying her hair. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just wondering...You\u2019re having the kids on Saturday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf nothing goes haywire. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with them?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cA park, maybe. I thought about packing up some PB&amp;J, chips, sodas, and heading to a playground for the day. Or Jo would love us to spend the day here, with her, but I don\u2019t want to take advantage. We\u2019ll play it by ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a kid movie?\u201d he asked. \u201cCould I tag along? If I treat and promise not to get in the way too much?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and frowned as she looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Noah? You look like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just kind of looking for something to do, and I like your kids. They\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>She made a face of disbelief. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Why don\u2019t we just cut to the chase here and you tell me. That\u2019ll save badgering time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had dinner with that nurse,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAt the hospital. Not a date. I meant it to be coffee, but it was her dinner break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. And she\u2019s after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Sort of,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019d like to make me dinner. It wasn\u2019t easy to stop her. She was almost quicker than me, and I thought I was ready for her.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed. \u201cCome in\u2014I have popcorn. You can tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m imposing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are, but you\u2019re also in the clutches of a horny nurse and I want to hear about it. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorny is stretching it,\u201d he told her, entering.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, and let me guess,\u201d Ellie said as she closed the door behind Noah. She hung her towel over the sink. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of pretty, aggressive, works the conversation around to the next time you\u2019ll be together and has a totally futuristic tone. It goes something like, \u2018And when would you like to do that?\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy God, are you psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, have you no experience at all?\u201d She sat cross-legged on her bed and offered up her bowl of popcorn. He perched on the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do have experience, I\u2019m just not interested in Gloria.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs she ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nice. But she just doesn\u2019t start my engine, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, be careful here. Don\u2019t tell me more than I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s boring,\u201d he said. \u201cNice, pretty, real determined and boring. She\u2019s exactly the kind of woman people try to fix me up with\u2014proper and polite. I don\u2019t know what it is about being a minister, it\u2019s like people don\u2019t want me to get too excited. And also, like they think it\u2019s good r\u00e9sum\u00e9 material for a woman to land a preacher. Or something. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Nellie.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cNoah, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the minister thing that makes you attractive. You\u2019re actually kind of cute.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened briefly. \u201cI am?\u201d he asked, though kinda cute was not exactly what a man was looking for by way of praise.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. You kind of make a girl want to shave above the knees. That was a compliment by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a big deal? Shaving above the knees?\u201d he stupidly asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPardner, for my last job I had to shave above the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he ordered. And she laughed some more. He helped himself to a handful of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cOne minute you want to hear all about it, then it offends your little sensibilities,\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not little,\u201d he said, opening his mouth and dropping popcorn inside. \u201cGood popcorn,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this microwave stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, but not bad. I love popcorn. Sometimes my gramma and I had popcorn for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot real nutritious. I mean, as a meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, we were poor. There were times we ran a little low. But we were happy. If my gramma was worried, it didn\u2019t show. We used to giggle about ketchup sandwiches. Pickle and peanut butter sandwiches. Popcorn or rice and tomatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRice and tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple cups of rice, a can of stewed tomatoes, voila. Another favorite for the end of the month was soft-boiled eggs on fried potatoes. Didn\u2019t you ever have things like that when you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>Not while growing up, he hadn\u2019t. \u201cThere were times we had pretty simple dinners, but...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>Ellie grabbed a handful of popcorn and shoved it into her mouth. \u201cWhat was your growing up like?\u201d</p> <p>He took a deep breath. \u201cEllie, I didn\u2019t grow up poor. I grew up in a big house\u2014practically a mansion. My father was a pretty famous preacher\u2014he was on television. He still is\u2014famous and on television. He was ten years younger than my mother. She inherited money, so before my father made his in the ministry, she had hers. I think it\u2019s fair to say she made him what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d she said, wide eyed, fascinated. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it\u2014I\u2019m getting used to it. I\u2019m an only child, my mother is dead and my father and I don\u2019t get along. But there was always plenty of money while I was growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d she said. \u201cMoney isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Ellie might\u2019ve grinned if Noah didn\u2019t look so serious. \u201cSo, did you always know you were going to be a minister?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I was going to be anything but a minister. I wasn\u2019t about to follow in my father\u2019s footsteps\u2014for a religious man, he sure had his failings. But while I was looking for some answers to questions I\u2019d had since I was about five years old, I ended up studying religion, among other things. Go figure. I discovered parts of the ministry that had nothing to do with being on television or being famous that appealed to me in a very personal way. It took me a really long time to get there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a student forever, Ellie. I have two undergrad degrees and two master\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. And I didn\u2019t even finish high school. Well, I got my GED later. So when did you get there? As you put it.\u201d</p><p>He chewed thoughtfully. \u201cThis really is good popcorn. I could eat this for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted, Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did you discover you were going to be a minister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. I was going to teach and counsel and study. Maybe get a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. I like counseling\u2014at least some kinds. But all along I\u2019d been doing some community service and I realized I was happiest when I was just being a good neighbor. When I was helping out, lending a hand, you know. And a minister\u2019s role is complicated, but a lot of it is helping out, acting as spiritual support. It\u2019s like a relay race, Ellie. The baton is filled with faith and knowledge and good works\u2014like community service, food for the hungry, food for the soul, and as it\u2019s passed to me, I can run with it to the next person, who can run with it to\u2014\u201d He stopped to laugh and shake his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the part I gravitated to. I have a mentor professor, George. I landed in the seminary because he couldn\u2019t stay out of my business and convinced me it would make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just went along with his idea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. It was more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for Pete\u2019s sake,\u201d she said, annoyed. \u201cWhat more?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a minute, chewing his popcorn. \u201cIt was about God,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I called out to him, he answered. Wasn\u2019t always the answer I wanted, but there was always an answer. I ignored that as long as I could.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head in thought. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a good enough reason,\u201d she said. Then she took one of his hands and pulled it toward her. \u201cBut these are not the hands of a preacher.\u201d She ran her fingers over the calluses on his palms and fingers, then a long fingernail over a couple of thin scars on his forearm. \u201cHow did you get so rough? So messed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked on the docks and on fishing boats and markets in Seattle from the time I was eighteen till I went into the seminary a few years ago. I worked my way through college that way, I wanted to get as far away from my father and his lifestyle as I could. I got most of these scars the first year or two. It was tough, physical work.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI loved it, but I wasn\u2019t born into it like a lot of the men I worked with. It took me a while to learn, and I got hooked, grappled, cut and scraped a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you still there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was time to move on. Past time\u2014I\u2019m thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>She ate more popcorn. Then she thoughtfully said, \u201cYou can stop being ashamed of growing up rich now.\u201d When he looked at her in shocked surprise, she said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not ashamed of growing up poor, why should you be ashamed of growing up rich? I think it\u2019s kind of cool. You shouldn\u2019t let that hold you back.\u201d And then she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he said. \u201cWere you lonely growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing up? Oh, hell no. I probably had too many friends. Of course, they were mostly friends in the same boat as me\u2014not a dime to spare, not going anyplace, couldn\u2019t even stay in school. But between my gramma and friends, I got by fine. Later, after I was a single mom with two jobs and my gramma gone, I was lonely all the time, but I was almost never alone. Growing up, I had friends. I always envied the girls who had good grades, cool clothes, went to lots of parties and stuff, but I wasn\u2019t ever lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t all those friends of yours have parties?\u201d</p><p>She smiled blandly. \u201cNo, Noah. We hung out. Usually around a convenience store with a big parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get good grades?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes I did okay, but I\u2019ve had at least one job at a time since I was fourteen. Full-time babysitting, housecleaning, waitressing, you name it. I worked when I was pregnant and I worked when the babies were small and my gramma watched them. Until she died. But I\u2019ve always worked\u2014from right after school till late at night and then on weekends. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to hit the books, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>He did know, but the difference was, he hadn\u2019t been the mother of two children when he\u2019d been working and studying. \u201cEllie, you\u2019re smart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re intuitive. You have common sense. I think you could do anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI have done anything, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d he said, grinning back. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re working for a church. God must be shaking in his boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019d better get going. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d He stood up. \u201cSo, can I come with you and the kids on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. But you have to promise to behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That\u2019ll give me something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>He stood in the open door and she held it a moment. \u201cNoah? When did you stop having a relationship with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez,\u201d he said, dropping his chin. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten along since I was a kid. He was continually disappointed in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when, Noah? When did you give up?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her steadily, peering into her large eyes. How did she know the things she knew? Could her grandmother have taught her so much about instinct? Or was she just plain an old soul? \u201cWhen he didn\u2019t come to my wife\u2019s funeral,\u201d he said.</p><p>And before she could respond, he walked down the stairs and away into the night.</p><p>As Noah walked away from Ellie\u2019s apartment, he thought, that was wrong, the way that happened. That\u2019s not the way you tell a friend about your past. And he realized suddenly, Ellie had become his friend. When you ask someone if you can join them for their very limited time with their children, that\u2019s about friendship.</p><p>Yes, she was a friend now. She trusted him with her personal challenges, even if they might be embarrassing. But that was what was odd and admirable about Ellie\u2014she might not want the town to know the details of her past, but she had no shame; she didn\u2019t waste her energy on it. For such a young woman, she was comfortable in her own skin. And then he realized with a shock of sudden clarity, she didn\u2019t treat him like a minister. She treated him like a friend. A regular man.</p><p>Too often, people approached him as someone whose approval they needed, and that was so far from his role. It not only made him uncomfortable, it created a barrier between him and friendship. And he didn\u2019t want only friends in the clergy. Ellie? She didn\u2019t much care if he approved of her. He loved that about her.</p><p>The only thing that seemed to rattle her were issues with her kids\u2014their welfare and safety.</p><p>Noah, however, had enough shame for both of them. What kind of fool laments his sad childhood to someone who ate popcorn for dinner and slept beside her grandmother on a sofa bed her entire life? Or how about the way he dropped that bomb about Merry\u2019s death? Ellie lost her boyfriend in an accident when she was a kid herself, a poor kid who was expecting a baby. She must have been devastated and terrified. But she somehow kept on trucking, determined. Hercules Baldwin. He would have to apologize to her in the morning.</p><p>He was behind his desk in his office the next morning when he heard the backdoor open. Lucy bolted for the door to greet Ellie. When he saw her in the doorway, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Noah,\u201d at the same moment.</p><p>And then in unison they both asked, \u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d she said. \u201cGo on. My list might be longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I told you my wife had passed away like that. That was cold. You deserved a more thoughtful explanation. She died of cancer about five years ago. She was very young and her illness was sudden. She went fast. I shouldn\u2019t have told you the way I did. What are you sorry for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry your wife died. I\u2019m sorry your father let you down and sorry I ask such personal questions. And sorry I confront you and push the point so much. And I know I tease you and torture you and I\u2019m very sorry that I have way too much fun doing that. I think I need to work on boundaries. First of all, it\u2019s not my business and second, you\u2019ll tell me what you want me to know when you feel like it. And I should show more respect for your\u2014you know, your position. That you\u2019re a minister. And everything.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI ask you about lap dances, but you\u2019re apologizing to me about boundaries? I have an idea\u2014let\u2019s just go back to being ourselves and not be sorry about any of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Except that one thing\u2014I\u2019m sorry your wife died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m not trying to keep it a secret, that I was married, that I\u2019m widowed. No one asked. And then someone did\u2014that nurse. Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess she had to be sure you weren\u2019t gay,\u201d she said, and grinned largely.</p><p>He grinned back. She was impossible. And wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some work done,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have flooring coming real soon and there\u2019s a storage closet under the stairs that\u2019s full of dusty old boxes. I thought I\u2019d get in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can if you want to, but I\u2019m not going to have the flooring extended into the closet. It\u2019s a big storage area; it makes no sense to spend the money there. The boxes won\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt should be cleared out anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something else...?\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head. \u201cGo for it. I only opened the first two boxes and found them full of rotting sheet music. Whatever is in there is probably destined for the Dumpster. After you look through it, I\u2019ll haul it over behind Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a salute and off she went. And Lucy, the traitor, followed Ellie downstairs.</p><p>Noah was supposed to be dreaming up a wedding script, paying bills, catching up on some e-mails\u2014but he was thinking. Merry would have liked Ellie. While most wives wanted their husbands to hire unappealing women to work for them, Merry was never that way. Ellie\u2019s bold sexiness wouldn\u2019t have intimidated Merry; she was a confident woman. Of course, Noah\u2019s total devotion might\u2019ve had something to do with that, as well.</p><p>And Merry wasn\u2019t one of those proper, boring types, either. She had been born and raised in Seattle and was a dangerous liberal feminist. Before they were married, she belonged to an organization working toward the decriminalization of prostitution. She\u2019d been arrested a couple of times\u2014once for chaining herself to a tree to protect the forest from decimation, once for picketing a federal building. She was also very involved with an AIDS hospice program. And she did volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity\u2014she said holding a hammer made her feel strong.</p><p>She\u2019d coveted breasts like Ellie\u2019s. She\u2019d often talked about buying herself a pair. And one night she said to Noah, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of getting a tattoo....\u201d So he drew one on her belly with a felt-tip pen and then they laughed themselves stupid.</p><p>What he liked best about her was her wicked and irreverent sense of humor. And her lack of inhibition with him. He never had to coax her to let go in their bed\u2014she was a free spirit. She believed everything that happened between a man and woman who loved each other was virtuous, and also believed what took place between husband and wife was sacred, no matter how wild and daring.</p><p>And while Merry wasn\u2019t shy about voicing her opinion when she sensed an injustice, she seemed to be able to find the inherent goodness in the most unlikely characters. Noah hiring a stripper? Merry probably would have liked that.</p> <p>\u201cI have to come up with vows,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cUnique but not sappy vows...\u201d He pushed back from his desk and wandered into the sanctuary, gazing up at the stained-glass window. It came to him suddenly, something he would try out on Shelby and Luke.</p><p>And then he heard a loud shriek from downstairs, a bark from the usually quiet Lucy, and Noah clamored down the stairs at top speed. He found Ellie on the floor clear across the hall, her back up against the wall, hugging her knees. She looked up at him. \u201cA rat,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cBehind that box. It\u2019s four feet long.\u201d</p><p>Lucy wasn\u2019t trying to get at anything in the closet. \u201cI think you scared my dog,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe rat scared her, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Noah entered the closet cautiously, kicked the box, and when nothing rustled, he pulled it out a bit. Ah. Behind the box was a dead mouse. Probably four inches long at best. It was very dead, dried out, kaput. He lifted it by the tail and held it toward her. \u201cIs this the rat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My rat is much bigger. That must be its baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you just got scared and it looked much bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rat the size of a Volkswagen in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a dead rat, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. It wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d</p><p>He went into the downstairs bathroom and dropped the thing in the trash.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she yelled, getting to her feet. \u201cWhat if he gets out of there and attacks me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s petrified. It\u2019s over,\u201d Noah said. Then he smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far you don\u2019t even have the real rat! What good are you?\u201d She stomped away from him in the direction of the kitchen and came back wearing work gloves. \u201cI hate rats,\u201d she said, pulling the box out of the closet into the hallway. She opened it slowly, cautiously pulling out what looked like wrapped bundles. She folded back some plastic, some towels. And said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d She lifted and turned an elaborate gold candelabrum toward Noah.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d he echoed, taking it. He was lifting it, weighing it. It was heavy. And while he was doing this, Ellie was opening another towel-wrapped package for its mate. \u201cThis is valuable,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d she said, holding up the second one, beaming.</p><p>They got busy opening boxes and found things Noah hadn\u2019t bothered to look for\u2014even though the church building and contents were part of the sale, they weren\u2019t listed as inventory of the property. He\u2019d assumed everything of value was gone. Yet here were valuable altar accoutrements, from candelabra to chalices to communion trays. Everything was packed carefully in plastic and linens, clerics\u2019 vestments and choir robes, neither dusty nor moth-eaten. Dishes for the kitchen, for community gatherings\u2014over a hundred sets of plates, cups, saucers, bowls, flatware, punch bowls and glass cups. More crosses, some wooden, some gold. Hymnals, Bibles, altar linens. Tablecloths and napkins. There were boxes of candles that, thanks to the cool mountain temperatures, hadn\u2019t melted in God knew how many years. Boxes and boxes of things the church could use. They unearthed a thirty-year-old IBM electric typewriter that actually still worked. \u201cExcept there will be no replacement ribbons on this earth,\u201d Noah said. The space under the stairs was a good eight feet long and four feet wide and Noah had virtually ignored it because the first boxes contained useless paper and the rest looked water damaged, dirty and crushed\u2014he couldn\u2019t imagine there was anything of value there.</p><p>\u201cBut this is incredible,\u201d she said, dragging a big box of dishes out of the hall and across the basement floor.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put these in the kitchen so I can wash them and put them away!\u201d she said, all excited.</p><p>Rather than paying bills or writing wedding vows, Noah and Ellie worked all day at emptying boxes. Noah took a big load of vestments, robes, altar and table linens to the dry cleaner\u2019s in Fortuna and picked up tarnish remover for the candelabra and cross. They shook dust off Bibles and hymnals and put them in clean boxes, washed dishes and put them away.</p><p>And the sun began to set, the eyes of the stained-glass image of Christ shining into the sanctuary. Noah looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at it all day without stopping for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got into it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to have a big meal at Jack\u2019s. It\u2019s time for Lucy\u2019s dinner anyway.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at herself. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m dusty and falling apart and probably look like a vagrant. I\u2019ll just go home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one over there cares, Ellie. And for heaven\u2019s sake, you\u2019re not eating popcorn tonight! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care, Noah! I\u2019m just getting to know these people. I\u2019m at least going to be put together when I go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said in a pout. \u201cFine. Okay. Tell you what\u2014figure out where we\u2019re going to eat and I\u2019ll take Lucy over for dinner and get takeout. I mean, we have dishes and stuff, right?\u201d</p><p>The smile on her face said she liked that idea. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>When he got back from Jack\u2019s with three bags of takeout, he found Ellie had spread a tablecloth on the clean basement floor, set two candelabra with lit tapers on the cloth and had put out plates. A picnic. Lucy plunked right down next to the tablecloth. Noah looked at it and said, \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this floor going to be too hard for you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour desk is covered with stuff and there\u2019s no table in the place. We could go to the RV or picnic on my bed at the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this.\u201d He put down the sacks and settled himself on the floor. He opened the first bag and pulled out two bottles of beer. From the second bag he removed cartons of brisket, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, warm bread and mostly melted butter. He put the third bag to the side and said, \u201cPie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you starving?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you? Because unless you\u2019re hiding the evidence, neither of us has eaten.\u201d He twisted the cap off a bottle of beer and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a beer in ages. At least a couple of years. I never drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably get all loopy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said, tipping the bottle up.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stripper doesn\u2019t even have a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sober one,\u201d she informed him. \u201cBut I have to admit, this tastes very good. What kind of minister drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus turned water into wine for a wedding. He was hip. I bet they all got trashed.\u201d He lifted his bottle toward her. \u201cTo your incredible find today. Good for you, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought I wouldn\u2019t work out,\u201d she said, toasting him. \u201cI bet I\u2019m the best assistant you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also the only one. Want me to dish us up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Now that I smell it, I think I\u2019m going to stuff myself.\u201d She watched him serve up two plates and it came to her he was very well trained. And she asked, \u201cDid you ever get in trouble as a kid, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who you ask,\u201d he said, passing her a plate. \u201cMy mother thought I walked on water, my father was never satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that father thing again,\u201d she muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe rule is, if I open the subject, you can ask questions,\u201d he told her. \u201cMy father is a lot like Arnold Gunterson. Arbitrary. Low tolerance. Rigid and unemotional. He used to ground me all the time for little stuff. The punishment never fit the crime. I\u2019d have to give up football because I was a half hour late on my curfew\u2014and I had the earliest curfew in town. I lost summer camp when I was about ten because I didn\u2019t curl the garden hose right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly moly,\u201d she said. She ate a forkful of mashed potatoes. \u201cThat\u2019s a little over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...He did trip on the hose,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut still, that\u2019s kind of a no-TV punishment, not four weeks of summer camp. I mean, it didn\u2019t kill him or even break any bones.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned at him. \u201cLike you wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bastard, Ellie. My mother was a plain, sweet woman on her way to being an old maid when a poor young minister married her for her money. And made her life miserable from that moment on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to tell me. I have no evidence, but I\u2019m pretty sure he screwed around on her their whole marriage. He was frequently in the company of pretty, young women and it tore her heart out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful, Noah,\u201d she said. She reclined on the floor, her long legs out to the side, her hair falling over her shoulder while she ate. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t go to his daughter-in-law\u2019s funeral would be a bastard in my book.\u201d</p> <p>Noah looked down uncomfortably. \u201cDammit, I can\u2019t lie. That was my fault. He wasn\u2019t invited to my wedding, which was small and private, and I made sure he found out about Merry\u2019s death, but he didn\u2019t hear it from me. I had a secret agenda\u2014if he came and was kind, I\u2019d give him another chance. He didn\u2019t. And I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s fork was hovering in midair, her mouth slightly open. \u201cWow,\u201d she finally said. \u201cAre there a lot of people you have these kind of secret deals with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly him. And only once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, were you in trouble as a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young, I tried my hardest to be the best kid in the universe and could still never do anything right. So when I hit about sixteen, I gave up trying to be good and started being as bad as possible. I really regret that. I hurt my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of bad things did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t really want to know...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOh, I really do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied. I hustled girls, and not with pure thoughts. I drank too much. Had a couple of fender benders because I was driving too fast. Skipped school to go out to the lake with friends. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteal any cars? Get anyone pregnant? Do hard drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you weren\u2019t really trying,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cSo, if you got punished for little stuff, what did the old man do to you for getting drunk and wrecking cars?\u201d</p><p>He smiled as if this was one of his few happy memories. \u201cHe almost lost his mind. He threatened to send me to boarding school, but I think we both knew no one would keep me for long while I was on that particular course. I was pretty incorrigible. Plus, I remember it was one of the few times my mother really stood up to him\u2014she said, \u2018Over my dead body, Jasper!\u2019 It was fantastic. But eventually he packed me off to seminary. It didn\u2019t work. I quit and went to Seattle where I tried to stay away from Bible studies.\u201d He took a drink of beer. \u201cSo\u2014were you in trouble a lot?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNever. Well, I missed some classes from oversleeping, but I worked late. My one big screwup was getting pregnant. I felt just terrible about that. My gramma was so sweet, but I really felt like I\u2019d let her down. And then when Jason was killed, even though my life was a disaster, I was glad for the baby. Jason was sweet. A good boy. We\u2019d dated since I was about fourteen. I guess in the end, there were just too many hormones between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must have thought you were in love,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn skippy,\u201d she said. \u201cI sure haven\u2019t felt that way since. We had it bad. We had big plans, too. Well, probably they wouldn\u2019t seem big to you...\u201d</p><p>When her voice trailed off, Noah prodded. \u201cWhat kind of plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, thinking. \u201cJason had this really good job in construction. He poured cement\u2014he made a good living for a nineteen-year-old. He lived at home with his folks, so he had money to burn. But he saved and saved. For us. We were going to get married after I graduated, live in something small and work hard, and then after a few years, we were going to buy a house. Two stories, big yard, nice neighborhood. Not fancy, you know, but real nice. To me it would\u2019ve been like a castle. Then the first baby a couple of years later...That would have brought me to about today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose sound like nice plans,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cHe drove the motorcycle most of the time because it was cheap. The only reason I wasn\u2019t on the back when that car hit him was because he wouldn\u2019t let me ride anymore. Because I was pregnant.\u201d She looked down. \u201cYou would\u2019ve liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked out for you the best he could,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been real proud of him.\u201d</p><p>The give-and-take went on through dinner. It didn\u2019t surprise Noah at all that Ellie told him anything he wanted to know\u2014she had been that way since the minute they met. She was unflinchingly honest. What surprised him was that he was so open. He rarely spoke about his father, and he only talked about Merry with their close mutual friends. \u201cShe was the sexiest, funniest girl in Seattle. I was twenty-seven, she was twenty-five, and she was not interested in some Goody Two-shoes who studied religion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you that?\u201d Ellie asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cShe did. She said it was her opinion religion got in the way of faith and she thought most religions did more harm than good. So I promised her that I\u2019d teach and counsel. Maybe just get a Ph.D. That way she\u2019d never have to be stuck with a good-goody minister. And she said I would still be a man, and that would be burden enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist her. She was maddening. Exciting. Beautiful. So funny she almost made me forget I was nurturing a private rage against my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you suppose you\u2019ll get tired of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to be done with it by now. I think I was moving away from that when I found Merry. And when I lost her, I got mad all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cNoah, losing someone you love is supposed to make you mad. First you don\u2019t believe it, then you get pissed. Aren\u2019t you the one with the big education?\u201d</p><p>After more talking, they picked up the dishes and washed and dried them companionably. And as Ellie dried the last pie plate, the towel slipped from her hand and fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he said, bending to pick it up. Just as she bent to pick it up.</p><p>Both of them were bent at the waist, reaching for the towel. Their faces came so close together, his cheek was nearly touching her cheek, his chin hooked over her shoulder. And when she could have moved away, he grabbed her upper arms in a firm but gentle grasp and said, very softly, \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t move for a second.\u201d And then slowly, carefully, he straightened with her until they stood, facing each other, his cheek against her cheek. \u201cBe still. For just one minute,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He let his cheek press gently against hers. Noah held her arms, but not tightly. If she wanted to pull back, pull away, she wouldn\u2019t have a problem. But she didn\u2019t, so he let his eyes gently close and inhaled deeply. She wasn\u2019t wearing perfume; she smelled of soap and shampoo and dust and woman, the first woman he\u2019d been this close to in quite a while. Her body was soft against his, though he resisted the temptation to pull her hard against him.</p><p>Yet he stood there, unable to break away. He breathed her in. Her arms remained at her sides, passive, and he just inhaled her. He enjoyed the velvety softness against his cheek; he thought maybe she was far softer and silkier than the average woman. He enjoyed the feeling of the smooth skin of a woman against his rougher skin. Why didn\u2019t she pull away? He lifted a hand from her upper arm to her face and placed his palm against her other cheek, just absorbing the sweet, delicate warmth, the texture, the scent that was only her.</p><p>At least a minute had passed. Maybe two minutes.</p><p>It\u2019s just an affectionate hug, he told himself. Not a big deal.</p><p>But when he stepped back, he looked into her large brown eyes and said, \u201cI apologize. That was probably inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said. \u201cYou being my boss and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that again,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d Words seemed to fail him.</p><p>\u201cJust that you wanted to be close to someone?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>To you. \u201cI did,\u201d he said, relieved that she had an explanation.</p><p>\u201cBut I let you, Noah. Don\u2019t you go thinking you can get away with things.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start thinking I\u2019m easy.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. She looked about one inch away from biker chick and she\u2019d been through the school of hard knocks, but there was something just plain pure about her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been the least bit easy since the minute I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was all that talk about your wife, Merry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you miss her. And miss being close to a woman in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cMerry\u2019s been gone five years. I\u2019ve been close to a woman or two since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same, you should think about it,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get your feelings all mixed up. You don\u2019t want to start thinking you like me in a certain way when all you\u2019re really feeling is lonesome. Which is natural. Easy to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be the counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, if we\u2019re going to work together\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s good sense took a hike. He put his hands on her narrow waist, pulled her close and covered her mouth with his. A little squeak of surprise escaped her, but it only took her a second to settle against his lips. Her hands slid up onto his shoulders and his tightened around her waist. He tilted his head to a new angle and rocked against her mouth, gently parting her lips. And he groaned in pure pleasure.</p><p>Ellie was lost in his kiss; his lips were so strong and soft, his mouth so deep and wet, his arms firm and confident. And, oh, she hadn\u2019t been kissed like this in her life. He left her lips for just a split second, long enough to look down into her startled eyes, and then he was on her mouth again, pulling her tight against him, bending her back with his hunger. She welcomed his tongue, joined him with hers, and her arms rose to circle his neck. And they rocked together, body to body, mouths together, tongues entwined, breathing coming harder and deeper. She liked this kiss, she thought. But this is not a good thing.</p><p>At long last he broke from their kiss, gazing into her eyes, and she asked, \u201cCan you fire me for letting you kiss me? Because you know I need this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou can probably sue me. But you\u2019ll end up with an old RV and a dog. An expensive dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I should never have let you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you taste like strawberries when you had brisket, beer and apple pie?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, Noah. You\u2019ve just been lonely...\u201d</p><p>He lifted one expressive brow. \u201cIs that so? And what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you, you\u2019re kind of cute, for a minister, and\u2014Oh!\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to watch that sarcastic sense of humor, it obviously turned him on. He grabbed her against him again and devoured her once more. And he was delicious. Powerful and starving and passionate. He licked her lips apart and invaded her with his tongue. Then he kissed his way down her neck and was back on her mouth, feeding her a wonderful kiss that wouldn\u2019t end. This is not what one expected from a good-goody preacher. Whoa, his chest and arms were so hard against her, his arms like vise grips. His kiss was hot, wet and wonderful, lasting a minute, then two.</p><p>Noah tried reciting the Psalms backward, but it was useless. He began to feel a burning lust, the tightness of desire and arousal. And it felt at once shameful and fabulous. He\u2019d been with a couple of women the past several years, looking for something solid and satisfying, but no one had stirred him like this in a long, long time. He welcomed the feeling of his natural sexual response. It was real, and really great.</p> <p>And she knew. She pressed against him, he held her tight, and there was not one secret between them. Finally, reluctantly, he freed her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned in spite of himself. \u201cCome on, Ellie. You can\u2019t make me not think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting mixed up with someone like you. First of all, I\u2019m all wrong for someone like you. Second, I\u2019m clearing out the second I have my kids. Third...\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t need a third. That\u2019s good enough. Don\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t kissed a woman like that in quite a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was nice. Are you angry?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cDid I taste angry?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. \u201cYou tasted wonderful. You\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s not such a good idea. Well, I mean, it is a good idea. But I see the potential for disaster.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and put a hand against her wild curls as if to smooth her hair into place. The hand trembled a bit; he\u2019d never seen her rattled before. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to get yourself in trouble with the Big Guy, and there\u2019s no point in making your life tougher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, God\u2019s not opposed to kissing. I think employers taking advantage of employees, however, could put a big black mark on the minus side of my chart. But you liked it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did. And I liked it. It felt pretty consensual to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of woman a man like you gets interested in, and we both know that. Eventually that could hurt me. And if you really are a nice guy, hurting me will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of that dancing thing?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat dancing thing, and I\u2019m poor, undereducated, strapped with kids and very, very temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make an argument for interest, because you might be right\u2014it might be a mistake that could get out of control. But you\u2019re smart, no matter how much or little formal education you have. And I don\u2019t believe you see your kids as a liability, and you know I don\u2019t\u2014I like them. And you won\u2019t always be poor, not with your ambition and positive attitude.\u201d He smiled gently. \u201cThe dancing doesn\u2019t matter a damn. I understand about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your bad girl. The one you take chances with for a little walk on the wild side. To break a few rules, have a little sinful fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, there\u2019s not a bad bone in your body. And we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t really the point, Your Holiness...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s be rational. I apologize, I won\u2019t do it again, but really\u2014it was just a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way you do it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ten</p> <p>Ellie was wrong about one thing; for the first time in years Noah wasn\u2019t lonely. He now had Ellie.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought he was going to kiss her. He hadn\u2019t even seen it coming. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d been aching to do but, in retrospect, it made sense. They had grown closer, sharing personal things about their lives, and despite Ellie\u2019s wisecracking, they had fun together. They depended on each other. He liked her better and trusted her more by the day. She might look and talk like a diamond in the rough, but she had a simple wisdom about her that was addictive. Her honesty alone was alluring. She had a sharp, teasing tongue, but she was kind and genuine. She listened with compassion, with sympathy and not pity, as he ranted about his father. She didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly. Anyone who doesn\u2019t go to his daughter-in-law\u2019s funeral would be a bastard in my book.</p><p>And there was that other thing that was overdue\u2014strong feelings for a woman, feelings of desire. He was a thirty-five-year-old man with a perfectly healthy libido and throughout his adult life had enjoyed normal feelings of arousal. The past few years had been a bit lightweight in that department. He\u2019d been out with women, even been in some very interesting clinches, but hadn\u2019t met anyone that made him crazy with longing. He missed that and needed that in his life.</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t a complicated man. He had to admire more than one thing about a woman to desire her. He had to like her, to start with. He had to feel comfortable with her\u2014all that teasing and arguing with Ellie, that was like friendship foreplay to him. Something that had been painfully absent from his life for the past several years\u2014playfulness. He\u2019d let his life get a little too serious. Ellie brought the laughter back to him.</p><p>The first time he laid eyes on her, her blatant sexuality had shocked him. She didn\u2019t shock him anymore. Either she was playing it down a bit or he was getting used to her. True, she wasn\u2019t wearing as much makeup, but why would she for cleaning and painting? But things that normally put him off, he\u2019d begun to find amusing. Kind of cute. So completely Ellie. Like the long fingernails, painted a different shade almost every day, decorated with sparkles. In his opinion she\u2019d gone from a spectacle of womanhood to pop art.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t felt this alive or happy in years. She not only made him feel again, but made him feel fun again.</p><p>But, after he walked her home, he went back to the church, stood in front of the now-dark stained-glass window, looked up and said to himself, I promise I won\u2019t let her down. I\u2019ll find a way to be there for her while she recovers the life she has every right to. Amen.</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d Noah said into the phone.</p><p>He was answered with a grunt. And then, \u201cGod, man! It\u2019s midnight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed her. Not a little affectionate peck on the cheek. I tickled her tonsils with my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d George said. He sat up in bed and felt around for his glasses. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re bragging or apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has disaster written all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Bragging. No one loves a good disaster like Noah.\u201d Then he chuckled. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I can\u2019t wait to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight want to put that off for a while, boy. Till you get settled down a little.\u201d</p><p>There were certain things about one another that did not require further explanation. George didn\u2019t ask Noah if he cared for her because Noah didn\u2019t get involved with women who meant nothing to him. No need for Noah to explain that he was starting to care way too much and it worried him. From the hour of the call alone, George knew that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just some good old-fashioned lust,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cHmm, probably,\u201d George agreed.</p><p>\u201cSome of the best lust I can remember,\u201d Noah said. \u201cChrist above, this is all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know what\u2019s wrong with it, son. Let\u2019s take a second to talk about what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything at the moment. Besides the lust, that is. And that she\u2019s incredible. I never thought this would work\u2014I thought it was a charity job, giving her the position to help her get her custody deal worked out. But I couldn\u2019t ask for more. And she makes me laugh. She\u2019s so sassy. And soft. Did I mention she\u2019s soft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you coerce her? Harass her? Emotionally blackmail her?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I told her she could sue me.\u201d</p><p>George chuckled. \u201cWell, Noah, what a sweet-talker you are. No wonder the women are just falling at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe depends on me and the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve explained. Is it likely she\u2019s afraid that if she doesn\u2019t yield, you or the job will vanish?\u201d</p><p>Noah took a breath. \u201cShe is afraid of nothing. Even when she should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, are you courting her?\u201d</p><p>Dead silence hung in the air. And finally he said, \u201cI\u2019m fighting my libido, and for a while tonight it was winning. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m courting\u2014it\u2019s too new. I like her, of course. She intrigues me as much as she annoys me. I admire her, but I admit she\u2019s strange to me. I\u2019ve never known anyone like her. And of course she\u2019s entirely the wrong kind of woman for me, in my circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Jesus hung out with Mary Magdalene. You don\u2019t get more provocative than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d Noah grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better come up there. I was going to wait till you got rid of all the mouse shit, but I\u2019d better come before you create some of your own.\u201d</p><p>On Monday morning a couple of work crews descended on the church and got right to it. A few men on ladders and scaffolds were scraping old paint off the outside of the church; the sander was running over the sanctuary floor at the same time a man was working on replacing broken windows. In the basement, the concrete walls were being textured, and flooring was due to be delivered along with ceiling panels. There was a plumbing truck outside and Noah heard someone banging on the pipes, looking for leaks. Feeling as if he was just in the way, Noah left Ellie in charge of the phone and went to run errands.</p><p>First he went to the Goodwill and grabbed a few second- or third- or fourth-hand jackets and a handful of wool socks\u2014fall was upon them and from what he heard, winter followed fall quickly. He wondered if his congregation, when he had one, would take on some of the needs in the town\u2014castoffs to the poor, Thanksgiving and Christmas baskets, that sort of thing.</p><p>Next he went to the nursing home in Fortuna to watch TV with Sal. He hung around for about fifteen minutes of I Love Lucy and a little conversation. Sal was grumpy as ever but couldn\u2019t disguise the way his eyes lit up when Noah stood in the doorway. Then Noah made a run by the hospital, visiting some young parents who had a seven-year-old in surgery.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t all that anxious to get back to Virgin River, to the church. He was giving Ellie a wide berth because of the memorable, unforgettable way her lips tasted. If he closed his eyes he could recall it all in amazing detail. But he was very proud of his ability to act natural around her. Neither of them mentioned the kiss; neither of them behaved oddly. They had spent Saturday with the kids together and for all the world\u2019s eyes, they were merely casual friends who worked together.</p><p>But he thought about her all the time.</p><p>Later that afternoon, after the hospital visit, he dropped in on Vanessa. He hadn\u2019t called ahead or made an appointment, he just wanted to see how she was holding up. She came to the door with the sound of children yelling and crying at her back. There were dark rings under her eyes and she looked a little unkempt. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said unenthusiastically. She ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get dinner ready for Paul and those two decided to skip naps. It gets a little wild sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Noah stepped inside. Both kids were reaching out of the playpen with tear-stained faces. \u201cHave they been crying long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, on and off the past couple of hours. Both of them are really cranky and tired.\u201d She just shook her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVanni, aren\u2019t you getting enough sleep?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cThey both sleep through the night. I go to bed with them\u2014I seem to be sleeping a lot. Maybe that\u2019s it\u2014maybe I\u2019m oversleeping because I just stay so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do? Hold a child, stir a pot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, backing away so he could come in.</p><p>Noah went straight to the playpen. He was saying, \u201cHey now,\u201d to the little ones, but he was thinking, Uh-oh. She\u2019s sinking. Whether under the strain of two small children or the emotional distress, it was hard to tell at first glance. But something had to be done here. He lifted Mattie out of the playpen first because he was the biggest. And then, when Hannah put her fat little arms around his neck, with his forearm under her bum, he pulled her up. Both children held on to him, one head on each shoulder. He jiggled and talked softly. They quieted at once; they had only needed to be held. They were as tired and frustrated as Vanni.</p><p>Vanni had disappeared into the kitchen and Noah just held a couple of armfuls of kids until the crying was under control. And then he said to them, \u201cWell, first things first.\u201d And he went down the hall in search of a nursery.</p><p>He kept talking in a soft voice while he put Mattie in one of the two cribs in the room and Hannah on the changing table. This was new territory for him. He\u2019d changed a baby or two, but not in a long time. He kept talking while he studied the disposable diapers kept in a diaper caddy that hung on the side of the changing table. There were two stacks in there and he took a smaller one for Hannah. He opened it, located the sticky tabs and held it up. Then he gingerly removed her diaper and said, \u201cEwww.\u201d She giggled at him. \u201cYeah, I bet you think that\u2019s funny. You should see it from my point of view. Hannah, that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d She giggled again while he looked around for wipes, finding them on a shelf underneath the changing platform. He was making a face that Hannah found hilarious as he gingerly wiped stinky poop off her rosy butt. It took a lot of wipes because he was reluctant to get too close.</p><p>He got her clean, but her bottom was pink, like maybe she wasn\u2019t being changed often enough. And he had completely destroyed a new diaper in the process, tearing the sticky tabs clean off, but he was luckier with the second one, though it seemed to be listing to one side. Mattie was a simpler affair; he wasn\u2019t muddy. With a child on each hip and one terrible diaper and one nontoxic, he found Vanni in the kitchen. She turned from the sink and saw the diapers and wrinkled her nose.</p> <p>\u201cWhich one of you had the present for Pastor Kincaid?\u201d she asked, taking the dirty diddies.</p><p>\u201cIt was madam,\u201d he said. He watched as Vanni folded the dirty diaper and deftly taped it closed in a nice, tight, odorless package. \u201cWow,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat was slick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put them in the high chairs,\u201d she said, taking Mattie and leaving Noah to settle Hannah. \u201cWhat brings you by, Noah? Checking on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on my mind and I wondered how it was going. I hope I\u2019m not imposing too much. Looks like you could use a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use nine hands,\u201d she said, but not much humor seeped through.</p><p>Once the kids were settled in high chairs, she put some crackers on their trays and fixed up two sippy cups with juice.</p> <p>\u201cHannah\u2019s bottom is kind of pink,\u201d he said. \u201cKind of too pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d she said.</p><p>Noah pulled a chair out from the kitchen table and sat down. \u201cYou could use a little help around here,\u201d he said. \u201cJust during the really busy times. Huh? So you can catch up a little, maybe steal a nap. Any friends or family available for that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and although dinner makings were spread across the island, she poured two cups and sat down with him. \u201cEveryone is willing, but everyone is also far too busy. Shelby\u2019s starting school in a few days; she\u2019s waited forever for that. Plus, she\u2019s planning her wedding and I\u2019m supposed to be helping her. My dad and Muriel are pretty caught up in running two ranches and doing some traveling for Muriel\u2019s new movie. Believe me, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased about that\u2014I haven\u2019t seen my dad this happy in years. Noah, I don\u2019t want to impose on anyone. This is our problem. We need to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be easier to figure out with a little help.\u201d</p><p>Vanni just glanced into her coffee cup.</p><p>And Noah thought, she wants it to be hard, because she\u2019s thoroughly pissed off. She\u2019s having trouble caring about this infant because Paul brought her home and she\u2019s angry with him, with the baby, and mostly with herself. And anger turned inward is depression. And depression can be deadly.</p><p>\u201cDid Paul mention that he has crews working on the church now?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She shrugged and said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember. He may have mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s loud, and it\u2019s going to stay that way for a couple of weeks, maybe a month. They\u2019re scraping the outside of the church, sanding the sanctuary floor, tearing windows out of the frames, that sort of thing. I have this girl working for me now\u2014nice young girl. Ellie Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I heard about her,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a million things to do every day that take me out of the church and I leave her to clean, paint, answer the phone, and I think she\u2019s about ready to kill me. I\u2019ll send her out here to help tomorrow. She\u2019ll thank me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA young girl?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s going to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twenty-five and has children of her own. They\u2019re with her ex-husband right now and she really misses them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they with her ex-husband?\u201d Vanni wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cReasonable question, before you let her help out with your children. The details aren\u2019t really mine to share, but I can assure you she\u2019s a wonderful mother. I\u2019ve spent a couple of days with her and the kids and she\u2019s devoted to them. She\u2019s brash with me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd nothing but sweet and gentle with the kids. The separation is real hard on her. Maybe this will serve two purposes\u2014give her some kids to cuddle and you a little break. Plus, she cleans like a genie in a bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m positive she\u2019d welcome it, compared to the crappy work I\u2019ve had her doing on that old church.\u201d And maybe Gramma Baldwin can counsel while she\u2019s at it. He smiled secretly.</p><p>When Ellie came to the church the next morning, Noah said, \u201cI have a special assignment for you. Today, tomorrow and for as long as you think it\u2019s necessary. Some friends of mine have a situation\u2014you know Paul? The builder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t miss him,\u201d she said. She dug into her tight jeans and pulled out a couple of cotton balls she clearly intended to stuff in her ears.</p><p>\u201cWell, a woman he barely knew and whom his wife never met died recently and, guess what? She named Paul as her baby\u2019s guardian in her will. Without any warning, with a son of their own only eighteen months old, they inherited a baby girl who is under a year. Vanni is struggling to keep up and they might be getting the best of her. Go out there and help, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know what to do. I wrote down some directions for you\u2014they\u2019re about ten minutes out of town. And, Ellie? If you can make her laugh, that would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on it. I have a bunch of preacher jokes I haven\u2019t tried out yet.\u201d</p><p>When Ellie rang the bell at Vanni\u2019s house, the door was a long time in opening. When Vanni finally answered, she had a little boy on her hip, the sound of a baby fussing behind her, and she was wearing her robe. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Ellie, Pastor Kincaid\u2019s assistant,\u201d she said. \u201cWant a hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d Vanessa said, turning away from the door.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll be happy. Your husband is making my life miserable!\u201d Ellie walked in and went immediately in search of the fussy baby. She found her standing in the playpen, reaching out. The second Ellie came into the room, her face lit up in a beautiful smile. She reached for the baby. \u201cWell, my little cupcake. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hannah, our newcomer,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cAnd this is Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Hannah. What a pretty name. Are you wet or hungry or just ornery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be wet, but they\u2019ve had breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s try a change,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cWhere are the diapers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight down the hall. I could do it if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, let me. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve changed a baby. I kind of miss those early days, difficult as they are.\u201d And off she went to carry through. When she returned a few minutes later, Vanni was sitting on the couch, holding Matt, looking pretty down in the dumps. \u201cThis one has diaper rash, but you probably knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been putting stuff on her. There\u2019s a tube on the changing table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, I found it, gave her a good smear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you have other things to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mission, assigned by none other than His Holiness Kincaid, is to see what I can do to help you. I understand Miss Hannah here was a surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put it mildly,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s my specialty. Both of mine were surprises. But what luck\u2014they\u2019re awesome. Danielle is eight and Trevor is four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem old enough to have an eight-year-old,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not.\u201d She laughed. \u201cLike I said, I specialize in surprise children. But I\u2019ve decided to give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul and I were just about to start on one of our own when Hannah showed up.\u201d</p><p>Ellie frowned. \u201cOne of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I guess Noah didn\u2019t tell you. I was married to Paul\u2019s best friend before. I was pregnant when he was killed in Iraq. And Paul stepped in to be my husband and Matt\u2019s father. And, as it turned out, a woman he\u2019d dated before we married died in a car accident and bequeathed that adorable little package to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, holy shit,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re a little out of sorts! So you\u2019re the mother of that one and Paul\u2019s the father of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hannah\u2019s not his. Sometimes I think it might be easier if she were. But she\u2019s not. And even considering Hannah has a father out there somewhere, Paul brought her home.\u201d</p><p>Ellie nuzzled the little girl. It was anyone\u2019s guess what Vanni struggled with most\u2014the fact that she suddenly had two small children, or that one of them was Paul\u2019s previous girlfriend\u2019s. Did Vanni wonder just how important Hannah\u2019s mother was to him? That would be enough to put anyone in a mood. But she said, \u201cListen, I have an idea. Since everyone is dry and fed, why don\u2019t I take over while you enjoy your morning rituals. Take some time. Have a long soak or shower, a primp, even a rest if you\u2019re tired. I can handle everything till lunchtime. Or even longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might find it to be more than you bargained for.\u201d</p><p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cOr, I could have more fun than I\u2019ve had cleaning and painting an old church. If I have trouble, I\u2019ll come for you. Go on now\u2014this is your big break. Unless\u2014gee, maybe you want to observe me for a while, to be sure I\u2019m okay with the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah says you\u2019re wonderful with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? Well, how about that. I should be\u2014I\u2019ve had plenty of practice. It\u2019s been just me and the kids for a long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go take a shower,\u201d Vanni said, without responding to that last comment. She handed off Matt. \u201cIf you have problems, holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take some time for yourself,\u201d Ellie said, bouncing a kid on each hip. \u201cI\u2019ll juggle for a while.\u201d</p><p>When Vanni disappeared, Ellie took the kids to the kitchen. Once there, she found the remnants of breakfast on their high-chair trays and the kitchen was a mess\u2014dishes in the sink, the floor sticky, dirty pots on the stove, the newspaper spread out on the table in front of a coffee cup with a ring around the inside. \u201cWell,\u201d she said softly to the kids. \u201cMommy\u2019s got issues. But, hey, we can deal. Right?\u201d</p> <p>Hannah said, \u201cMa!\u201d and Matt patted Ellie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Ellie cooed, kissing each cheek. \u201cCould you be any more delicious? Come on, let\u2019s settle in. There\u2019s stuff to do here.\u201d</p><p>Once she had them strapped in the high chairs, she cleaned off the trays. She found sippy cups in the sink, scrubbed them and filled them with juice. Then she put a handful of dry Cheerios on each tray and, talking and singing little ditties the whole time, began cleaning the kitchen. There was a thin, sticky coat of kiddie paste over everything, including the floor and high chairs, so when the dishes were loaded, she started the dishwasher, wiped down the stove, table and countertops. In the laundry room off the kitchen she found a bucket, mop and sponge. Also, loads of dirty laundry. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said, thinking. \u201cWell, whoever said \u2018one thing at a time\u2019 didn\u2019t know squat.\u201d She got a load of kids\u2019 clothes going. Back in the kitchen, singing the \u201cABC\u201d song, \u201cPeople on the Bus\u201d and \u201cLittle Soap,\u201d she washed down the high chairs while the kids were in them, stopping occasionally to make faces and noises and tickle. And then, dishwasher and washing machine humming away, she mopped the floor, scooting the high chairs out of the way one at a time.</p><p>She flipped the laundry and started another load. And then she took the kids to the great room where a playpen stood ready. She settled both of them, playing with them for just a moment before she left them to grab some Windex and Pledge and rags. If there was one thing a single mother of two had learned pretty well, it was how to make a small house presentable in record time. Well, this was no small house\u2014it was like a castle to Ellie\u2014and brand-new. She knew she would never live in such a house, not unless she won the lottery\u2014which she never played\u2014or fell in love with some rich guy, which was now off the table. But still...</p><p>She shined up the glass and wood furniture, found the vacuum in the front-hall closet and, talking to and singing to the kids, she ran it around the room. She glanced at her watch and saw that Vanni had been missing for well over an hour, but it had been time well spent. She was making great progress.</p> <p>Another hour passed and she had cleaned the kitchen and great room, folded some clothes on the couch while picking up toys that had been pitched out of the playpen. Since she had a couple of stacks of clean baby clothes, she put them in the nursery, rounded up towels and ran a bath.</p><p>Ohhh, they loved the bath, so she supervised while they played until the water was cooled. Little Hannah needed that soak on her rosy bottom. Next, clean clothes and a glance at her watch told her it was lunchtime. She took the little ones back to the kitchen. She found baby food in the pantry but, if memory served, there was one thing kids loved universally. \u201cMac and cheese,\u201d she said, grinning at them. It took only minutes in the microwave and then minutes to cool a bit. She managed to put away the clean dishes from the dishwasher, though if Vanni ever found them again, it would be a miracle. When the mac and cheese had cooled down enough, she gave each child a bowl on their tray.</p><p>Now, this was where aggressive supervision was required if they were going to get more in their stomachs than on her clean floor. She sat on a chair with a handy rag and helped Matt guide his spoon while she fed Hannah. \u201cI so knew you\u2019d love this,\u201d she said to them. \u201cIt was a big treat at my house.\u201d</p><p>There were bottles in the dishwasher. Since she didn\u2019t find any powdered formula anywhere, she was left to assume they were now on regular milk. So, she filled a couple of bottles, and with Hannah in her arms and Matt lying on the couch, his legs draped over hers, they relaxed together. Hannah played with Ellie\u2019s ponytail that fell over her shoulder and Matt held her finger.</p><p>These children needed to be touched! They needed kisses and giggles and cooing and pleasant smiles! They needed to feel the love! But their mother was sad, overwhelmed, hurt and exhausted.</p><p>Both children passed out with their bottles. Ellie scooted out from under Matt\u2019s legs and hefted Hannah into her arms. Matt slept with his mouth open and arms limply splayed outward, totally gone. To his sleeping form she whispered, \u201cDo not roll off this couch or I\u2019ll be fired!\u201d Then she took Hannah to her crib and went quickly back for Matt.</p> <p>Both children were settled and Ellie was folding another load of clothes when Vanni finally appeared. \u201cWell,\u201d Ellie said, smiling, \u201cyou look like you had a little rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t help you at all. I left you high and dry with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, angel-cakes. I was having a nice time. This is a magnificent house you have here. I enjoyed tidying up a bit. Are you hungry? Why don\u2019t I fix you some lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t bother. Now that you\u2019ve done so much and the kids are sleeping, you don\u2019t have to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still have things to do, Vanni. After the kids wake up, I\u2019m going to freshen their room. But while they sleep, I thought I could get you a fresh set of sheets, give your master bath a bit of a fluff and buff, maybe run the vacuum around in there.\u201d She smiled happily. \u201cYou should take advantage of me while you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll have a little lunch with me,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make us a couple of sandwiches,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>While Ellie made the sandwiches, Vanni snuck the clean clothes into the drawers in the nursery. Vanni stripped her own bed and got her sheets washing. Then they sat at the kitchen table together.</p> <p>\u201cSo your children came as surprises?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cI think stunned and scared shitless would be more accurate,\u201d Ellie said, biting into her sandwich. Vanni laughed in spite of herself. \u201cBelieve me, it wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that. I\u2019m laughing at the way you swear. Must be quite a challenge for Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He\u2019s talking swear jar in the church. Quarter a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel and Jack have one of those!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear. I also heard Mel\u2019s taking the town on a cruise in the spring, just on the contents. Really, just so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m completely terrible, I never swear in front of children. I don\u2019t even slip. I know that sounds far-fetched, but really. When I swear, I do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you\u2019ve got that going for you.\u201d Vanni laughed. \u201cSo\u2014the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I got pregnant with Danielle in high school. My boyfriend was killed in an accident\u2014motorcycle versus car, not his fault.\u201d Once again she conveniently left out the fact that she had two children by two different guys, neither of whom married her. She chewed a little more and swallowed. \u201cI was on my own. Well, with my gram\u2019s help, but she died when Trevor was two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Ellie. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of both your boyfriend and your grandmother. Is that the extent of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a mother somewhere, but she hasn\u2019t been around since I was, like, three months old. She drops in once in a while, but she never spends the night. She\u2019s pretty much consumed with her own life, which is fine. My mother\u2014she\u2019s a real load. She needs taking care of. If she ever got the idea I could do that for her, I\u2019d never get rid of her and she\u2019s very self-centered.\u201d</p><p>Vanni was quiet a moment. \u201cI lost my mother almost six years ago.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s hand that held the sandwich slowly lowered to the table. \u201cOh, man. A mother and a husband? Oh, sugar, you\u2019ve had such a rough time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as you,\u201d Vanni said softly.</p><p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cI miss my gram all the time, but sometimes it\u2019s like she\u2019s right on my shoulder,\u201d she said, patting the place. \u201cI can hear her, feel her. Like she never really left me. She was seventy when she died. She\u2019d been reading in her chair and died with her book in her lap and her glasses on her nose. We slept on the pullout sofa, Danielle on a small daybed and Trevor in the crib, all of us in one room. While I slept and she read, she passed. I found her in the morning. She must have been dead all night, but she went so softly, no one knew she was gone. Funny,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I dreamt about her that night. I dreamt I was lying on the couch with my head on her lap, on her favorite corduroy jumper, and she was rubbing my head. I was real little when she did that, but it\u2019s one of my favorite memories.\u201d She looked at Vanni and noticed she had glistening eyes. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019m sorry. My marching orders were to make you laugh, not make you cry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d Vanni asked, wiping her eyes. \u201cTo make me laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah. I asked him what I was supposed to do and he said, \u2018You\u2019ll know what to do.\u2019 And added that it would be good if I could make you laugh. Noah thinks I\u2019m a real stitch, but he\u2019d like to shove me under a pew and keep his future congregation from seeing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Vanni asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, he hasn\u2019t been real specific, but I believe it has to do with my potty mouth, my tattoo, my cleavage and, when I\u2019m not Mommy\u2019s helper or Pastor\u2019s painter, the way I like to do my hair and makeup. Kind of Dolly Parton.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI know it annoys him, but I can\u2019t seem to stop.\u201d</p><p>Vanni reached for her hand and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t change for anyone, especially a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, we are sisters. I thought so.\u201d The spin cycle stopped. \u201cI\u2019m going to put those sheets in the dryer, then we can make up the bed together. While they\u2019re drying, why don\u2019t I go see if your bedroom and bathroom could use a once-over. When I leave today, it\u2019s my goal to see that everyone is happy and can relax in a fresh house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Ellie. Your grandmother trained you very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, baby, it\u2019s such a great thing to have more than two rooms to clean, it\u2019s like you\u2019re doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>The girls talked while they worked on the master bedroom and bath, when Ellie wasn\u2019t running the vacuum, at least. They laughed like girlfriends, told sentimental stories about family members, and Ellie even tried on some old pants and tops that Vanni said she\u2019d never fit into again. Vanni was only an inch shorter than Ellie and wore her pants long to compensate for boots, so the fit was perfect.</p><p>\u201cTake them,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cIf you like them, that is. My feelings won\u2019t be hurt at all if they\u2019re not your style. I mean, I doubt Dolly would like them. I was going to give them to Goodwill, so they\u2019re yours if you want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice, Vanni. I didn\u2019t expect anything like this!\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cI think I hear something. That was a good long nap. With any luck, they\u2019ll be in good moods tonight. What do you usually do when they wake up, after a change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnack. Playtime till dinner,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cNothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a little cuddle time. Just waking up is awful sweet,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>As Ellie was leaving the master bedroom, Vanni touched her arm. \u201cUm, would you take care of Hannah, please?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>They collected their assigned children, changed them and cuddled them. As Ellie held Hannah close, she said, \u201cSo\u2014not really connected to this one yet?\u201d</p><p>Vanni took a moment to answer. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible, I know...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took me a while to feel like Danielle was really my baby. To believe I could love her more than anything, which was what my gram said would happen. Of course, I was just a kid myself. But if it took me a few days even though I\u2019d carried her inside my body and felt every movement, I guess it\u2019s natural for it to take you a little while when you didn\u2019t have any relationship with her at all before she was suddenly living with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m a terrible person?\u201d</p><p>Ellie smiled at her and held Hannah tighter. \u201cVanni, I barely know you, but I can tell already. There\u2019s not one terrible thing about you. Now\u2014what do we have for snacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYogurt,\u201d Vanni said with a smile. \u201cThey love it.\u201d</p><p>At four o\u2019clock, with the beginnings of supper ready, the house clean, laundry done, children bathed and happy and Vanni looking pretty good, Ellie was saying goodbye. She gave each child a loud smack, making them both laugh. She clutched Vanni\u2019s cast-off clothes close, very excited about them since they were a bit more conservative, though it killed her to think she had pleasure from the thought of pleasing Noah. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning about eight-thirty,\u201d she said to Vanni. \u201cLet\u2019s do it the same way\u2014you answer in your bathrobe and I\u2019ll take over. You can have the morning all to yourself. And whatever needs doing, I\u2019ll do. You can have the afternoon, too, if you need it. Maybe you have shopping or errands or something. Whatever you need.\u201d</p> <p>Vanni\u2019s eyes were round with surprise. \u201cI get more than one day of this special treatment?\u201d</p><p>Ellie grinned. \u201cBaby, you get the rest of your life if you need it. I think Paul gave Noah a deal on the redo and Noah\u2019s so happy I\u2019m not around the church to make his life difficult. See you in the a.m.\u201d</p><p>Ellie went to the church before going home. She found Noah in his office, and Lucy on the floor behind the desk. She stood in front of the desk, her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cYou might\u2019ve mentioned everything had gone to hell out there.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and cleared his throat. \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words? Were you able to help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, buddy, that woman needs more than household help. She needs a miracle. Inspiration.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you sent me because you can\u2019t clean and you don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that, too,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing back tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot of tomorrows before she\u2019s good to go,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cDo not screw up the painting while I\u2019m busy at the Haggertys\u2019.\u201d</p><p>After Ellie was back in her rented room, after a microwaved burrito and diet cola, she turned on the clock radio for a little music. And then she cried for her own children.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The rest of the week was a busy one for Ellie as she reported for duty at Vanessa\u2019s house every morning. Given there were two of them to tend the children and keep the house and laundry up to speed, everything went smoothly. Having a full-time babysitter allowed Vanni to run errands, have regular horseback rides for exercise and fresh air and, not least of all, have someone to talk to. It didn\u2019t take Vanni any time at all to start looking more rested.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before Vanni asked Ellie, \u201cNow, where are your kids?\u201d</p><p>Ellie took a deep breath; up until she lost custody of her children and went to work for a church, it had never occurred to her to lie. She felt she had to protect everyone\u2014her kids, her boss, even herself. But lying was complicated. And painful. \u201cWell, I met Arnie when I was all alone with two little kids, two jobs and very little means of holding it all together. My judgment must have sucked, because I married a real strange guy who was obsessed with controlling me. Talk about changing your appearance for a guy? Vanni\u2014that one wanted me to dress like an old woman and never leave the house. It was so bizarre. Of course, I left him almost right away\u2014we were married less than three months. But Arnie wanted me back. The only way he could figure out how to do that was to take a custody case to court.\u201d And she explained the same details she\u2019d given Jo Fitch.</p><p>\u201cEllie, wasn\u2019t there help available to you? I don\u2019t know\u2014like welfare? Food stamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything worse than working two jobs with little kids, it\u2019s trying to figure out how to live on the \u2018help.\u2019 Do you know what I qualified for? If I worked a job that paid eleven dollars an hour\u2014a real find\u2014I could get an extra two hundred and twenty from the state. You ever try to live on about two thousand a month with two kids? My money was long gone before I even got to things like clothes for them and school supplies. Just keeping a roof over our heads, usually two rooms, gas in the car and insurance, the lights on and a babysitter for Trevor, as well as a sitter for after school and evenings for both of them...Well, I never did get that far. After my gramma died and I didn\u2019t have a place to live anymore or a babysitter, I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your grandmother have a house to leave you when she died?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cMy gramma had a little tiny house that she\u2019d kept mortgaging over the years. Between the two of us\u2014her retirement benefits and my income from two jobs\u2014we could keep going. But when she was gone, I couldn\u2019t make those payments. I had to find something cheap to rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ellie. I\u2019m so sorry. And that\u2019s how you ended up married to that jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of sums it up. I thought Arnie would take care of us. He was so sweet to the kids before we got married, so hard on them the very first day we lived with him. It was just awful. He was only looking for some people to boss around\u2014I didn\u2019t see that till it was too late. He\u2019s still looking for control. It\u2019s a nightmare for the kids. But, we\u2019ll get through it and then we\u2019ll move on, legally, and get out of the pastor\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ellie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Vanni. Noah took a real chance on me, just so I\u2019d have a good job to take to court and get my kids back.\u201d Vanni didn\u2019t know the half of what Noah had taken on\u2014giving a job to a stripper who\u2019d lost her kids? A woman with two kids with two different dads, both times out of wedlock? One dead and one in prison? \u201cI just need my kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get them back, honey. And if you need my help on that, you just tell me what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Ellie said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Vanni said, \u201cis how you stay so positive after all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t take anything for granted. Good stuff doesn\u2019t come my way all the time, so when it does\u2014like this job that will get me my kids back, this town, friendship, people like you who can accept me even though I\u2019m a big mess\u2014that means something. And my gramma used to always say, \u2018Gratitude brings happiness.\u2019\u201d</p><p>On Friday, after four full days of togetherness while Ellie played mommy\u2019s helper, they were talking about the weekend while the kids had their lunch. \u201cSo, does Paul work on Saturdays?\u201d Ellie asked. \u201cThat\u2019s my day with my kids, so I can\u2019t miss it, but if you\u2019re going to be up a creek, I can go pick them up and bring them with me. They\u2019re fantastic and they\u2019d love playing with the little ones. They\u2019re very careful and I\u2019d watch every second. Danielle is so grown up at eight. Trevor\u2019s a little clumsy, but I wouldn\u2019t let him do anything with the tots that would cause harm. And while everyone\u2019s sleeping\u2014I could help with laundry and housework.\u201d</p><p>Vanni smiled. \u201cYou never stop lending a hand, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to see my assignment through. I might need a letter of recommendation someday.\u201d She sobered. \u201cSeriously, Vanni\u2014I don\u2019t want you to be stranded again. I can pick up the kids and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t. Just have a nice Saturday with them. I\u2019m all caught up, thanks to you. Maybe Paul will make it a short day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you Monday?\u201d Ellie asked, wiping little faces after lunch.</p><p>\u201cIf Noah says you\u2019re not needed at the church,\u201d Vanni agreed.</p><p>Ellie lifted Hannah out of the high chair. She had fixed two bottles and the women took the kids into the great room, settling in. Ellie held Hannah, and Vanni held Matt.</p><p>Ellie cuddled Hannah close. She was a precious little thing, her dark curls so silky and her cheeks so pink. Her eyes glittered with happiness. She held the bottle herself, but Ellie could tell she enjoyed being cuddled. \u201cMy gramma used to say, \u2018Hold them whenever you can, Ellie. Touch and the sound of your voice is everything.\u2019 And even now, when my kids are so big, it still seems to matter to them. Another thing she used to say was, \u2018All you really need to tell them is that you love them no matter what and that you wanted them.\u2019 Being wanted is very important in life. I don\u2019t think my mother wanted me, but my gramma did, and she told me all the time that I was her blessing, her dream come true.\u201d</p><p>Ellie sat on the sofa and Vanni in the chair with Mattie. And suddenly Hannah pulled the nipple of the bottle out of her mouth and turned her whole body away from Ellie. She held the bottle with one hand and stretched her other arm out toward Vanni. \u201cMama!\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cMama! Mamamamama...\u201d And then she turned back, put the bottle back in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cYou might not be there quite yet, but she is.\u201d</p><p>Vanni lifted her chin with a sniff, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe other thing my gramma used to say, \u2018You\u2019re not happy? Fine. Act happy and see if the right feeling catches up.\u2019 And you know what? Sometimes that works.\u201d</p><p>Vanni was quiet for a long moment, and then very softly she said, \u201cLet\u2019s trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ellie said. She stood with Hannah in her arms, carrying her the short distance over to Vanni. She put the baby on Vanni\u2019s knees and lifted the much heavier Mattie in her arms and went back to the sofa.</p><p>And Vanni held Hannah. Hannah snuggled close, putting her fingers into Vanni\u2019s mouth while she suckled. Then the suction broke with her smile. And without quite letting go of the nipple, she said, \u201cMama,\u201d in a very small, almost relieved voice.</p><p>And Vanni began to cry.</p><p>Noah was kneeling in the sanctuary on the sanded floor, inspecting some hardwood seams that might need repair. He\u2019d have to ask Paul about replacing the boards before the floor was finished. Lucy was beside him as usual. It was that magic hour, about five o\u2019clock, when the sun caught the stained-glass window and lit it up.</p><p>\u201cPastor?\u201d</p><p>He turned at the sound of Ellie\u2019s voice. She had never addressed him so.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like to know about the progress out at the Haggerty house. Everything is spic-and-span, and I think Vanni is warming up to Hannah. I\u2019ll go back on Monday morning, but I feel like they\u2019re doing better than when I found them.\u201d</p><p>Noah took several steps toward her. \u201cWhy do you look so tired? Was it real hard work?\u201d</p><p>Ellie shook her head. \u201cIt was hard on the heart. That baby girl is priceless, she\u2019s so wonderful. She needs a mother\u2019s love. I think it\u2019s getting closer, but it\u2019s been a tough adjustment. I guess you knew that or you wouldn\u2019t have sent me out there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he asked gently, his hand absently wandering to stroke the ponytail that hung over her shoulder.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNothing amazing. I cleaned, held the kids, let her talk, talked myself\u2014you know. Like girls do. But when I was leaving today, Vanni was holding Hannah, probably the first time she didn\u2019t absolutely have to. She was holding her close, kissing her little head, crying while that amazing child put little fingers in Vanni\u2019s mouth and called her mama. I think it\u2019s coming together. But, God, it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled, unsurprised. \u201cDid your grandmother contribute a lot to that evolution?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy gramma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said. \u201cMy gramma said this, my gramma said that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I do that a lot? I don\u2019t even know when I do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a liability, Ellie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I sent you.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, how sneaky is that! Really, I should be paid better if you\u2019re going to have me doing that, and especially if you\u2019re not even going to tell me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should be paid a lot more than I\u2019m paying you,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s what I can afford.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t I ever run into a rich man who wants to take advantage of me?\u201d</p><p>He just laughed at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a fine mess,\u201d a deep voice said from behind them. \u201cMuch worse looking than I expected. You must be thrilled, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Noah turned. There, standing at the other end of the empty church, was his best friend and mentor. \u201cGeorge!\u201d He left Ellie and strode toward him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I did. I just didn\u2019t say when. It comes as no surprise to see you looking happy, surrounded by this disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Noah laughed and embraced the older man in a fierce hug. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to see you! How long will you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to get the lay of the land. Now, who is your friend? You shouldn\u2019t leave a beautiful woman standing behind like that.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed George\u2019s arm and pulled him down what would eventually be an aisle in the church. \u201cGeorge, meet Ellie Baldwin, pastor\u2019s assistant. Ellie, meet George Davenport, my best friend and mentor.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread over George\u2019s face. He took Ellie\u2019s hand, raising the back of her fingers to his lips. He bent and brushed a kiss on them. \u201cEllie, it\u2019s an honor. I retired too soon\u2014I had no idea the assistants would be so beautiful down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPastor Davenport,\u201d Noah corrected. \u201cRetired, but still a preacher.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cA pleasure, Your Worship,\u201d she said.</p><p>Noah laughed at George\u2019s look of surprise. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean it, George. She\u2019s extremely disrespectful. And unrepentant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll do penance by sitting through dinner with us,\u201d George said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to try that little place next door, the one Noah\u2019s been bragging about. Come, Ellie, stay close to me. I want to know how you like working for this reprobate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hell, Your Reverence.\u201d</p><p>George felt he had met the entire town by the time dinner was over, but Jack Sheridan assured him he hadn\u2019t come close. \u201cThese are pretty much the regulars, though,\u201d Jack admitted. That included Jack\u2019s wife and two small children, the neighbors who lived nearby, Hope McCrea, who sold Noah the old church. George was introduced to young Rick Sudder and his fianc\u00e9e, Liz; Rick was recently returned from a tour of duty with the marines in Iraq. Somewhere along the line George learned that Rick had a prosthetic leg, but he never did figure out which one. The lad had a carefree manner and not the slightest limp.</p><p>And then there came a story that had half the bar in stitches\u2014it seemed that when Rick was struggling to adjust, the man sitting beside him at the bar, Dan, challenged him to a fight out in the street. Dan, over thirty-five years old, took off the prosthetic leg no one knew he had! \u201cIt was a circus,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut it seemed to turn Rick onto the idea that life could go on.\u201d</p><p>There were more stories; clearly the folks in town enjoyed sharing their tales with newcomers and strangers. And while they partook of some of the finest stew George had ever tasted, along with the softest, sweetest bread, he was able to get to know Ellie a little bit. Of course, he\u2019d heard all the details that brought her here from Noah, details that Ellie would never know George knew. George was interested in her children and how she was settling into town.</p><p>George was captivated by her. She was a pip, as George\u2019s father might have said. But what he saw quickly, what he was sure Noah was oblivious to, Ellie was very like Noah\u2019s late wife. She was unique, confident, funny and impossibly positive.</p><p>Noah and George enjoyed a brandy after dinner while Ellie and Jack had coffee, then both men walked her home to her rented room. And while Noah was walking George back to the RV for the night, he told him about some of the things he had found in the town and surrounding mountains that could use his attention. \u201cIf you\u2019ll stay a few days, I\u2019ll take you out to the vagrants\u2019 camp, give you a car tour of some of the more isolated cabins dotting the landscape, take you to Valley Hospital and the nursing home, and to meet the pastor in Grace Valley.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a gold mine for Noah, George found himself thinking. It has everything the young man has ever wanted or needed. A sense of family, strong community ties, not to mention the girl. But George said nothing about Ellie. What he did ask was, \u201cSomeone mentioned Ellie was helping some young mother with her children...?\u201d</p><p>Noah explained the situation at length. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what we were talking about when you arrived,\u201d Noah said. \u201cEllie seemed drained, not from the work of helping with the kids, but from the ache it gave her to think of an unloved child. I never asked her to keep that confidential, not any part of it. It would be futile, as the whole town knows about Vanessa and Paul. She\u2019s a natural, George. A helper by nature. She\u2019s armed with all these old sayings her grandmother left her with and they have roots in psychology, but they\u2019re all lore. The girl grew up in two rooms with her grandmother; they slept together on a pullout couch her whole life. Then she added two small children to the family and they all worked together to care for one another.\u201d He laughed. \u201cTalk about evidence that money can\u2019t make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d George agreed. \u201cIt needn\u2019t make you miserable, either. I may be an old fool, but Ellie strikes me as the kind of person who wouldn\u2019t be destroyed by a little money. I could be wrong, however. She\u2019s very inexperienced.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cGeorge, if there\u2019s one thing Ellie is not, it\u2019s inexperienced. Well, maybe with money, but in all other things, she\u2019s had way too much experience.\u201d</p><p>George thought, He\u2019s fighting for his life. And he smiled at that. No one loved a battle more than Noah! He wasn\u2019t your mother\u2019s preacher; not a sweet and docile guy, but a warrior. He\u2019d fought his father and his father\u2019s shallow television religion for so many years; then went on to fight the injustice and apathy of the world at large. He wanted to bring peace and love to his people, but inevitably he brought courage and muscle. And that part of Noah, the part he constantly resisted, that was the part that made George proudest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at least a few days,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in this place.\u201d But what really interested George was Noah in this place. With these people. With that woman.</p><p>The woman was perfect for him. She was one of the people\u2014not some female bred to stand beside a man of the cloth. She would bring laughter, excitement and passion to his life, his work.</p><p>On Saturday, Noah took George with him to bring the jackets and some wool socks to the boys in the woods. At George\u2019s stubborn insistence, they took a couple of Preacher\u2019s pies and two Bibles. The men in the camp sniffed appreciatively of the pies and wrinkled their noses at the Bibles. But, they turned over a few buckets for stools and Noah read to them for a little while. Of the whole camp, there were just a few who enjoyed that, but those few might as well have been a multitude for the way it made Noah feel.</p><p>They made the rounds of the nursing home, Valley Hospital and Sunday church in Grace Valley. George, being a fine figure of a seventy-year-old man, garnered the attention of some of the more mature ladies, though even the younger ones were inclined to look his way more than once, something he enjoyed perhaps a bit too much. He was a consummate flirt and flatly admitted he liked women. By the time they left Grace Valley, he was armed with e-mail addresses and promises to stay in touch, and of course to return. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by then the Virgin River church will be open and you\u2019ll have to attend services there. Noah will entertain you completely.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, they were prowling around the inside of the Virgin River church, talking about the possibilities in renovation. \u201cNoah, tell me about that stained-glass window,\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cI researched it. This was a poor church when it was constructed and pretty much depleted the funds of the congregation. The population was smaller then\u2014about three hundred. But one member went on a campaign to find something special for the church and wrote to every artist in the world until she found a man willing to donate the window, though he\u2019d probably never attend the church. His name was Josiah Piedmont and his only requirement in the deal was that it never be destroyed. It came to this church in the sixties and Josiah lived in Connecticut at the time. He has since died and left behind amazingly beautiful Christian art in all mediums. When the church was forced to shut down because they couldn\u2019t support it anymore, the people in town boarded up that window to keep it safe. Now, times having changed, you can find a Web site for the artist and see where his works are displayed. When I get organized, I\u2019ll add this piece to his Web site, with the location. It boiled down to one woman on a mission.\u201d</p><p>After dinner at Jack\u2019s, they indulged in an evening brandy at the bar. \u201cDid you enjoy your tour the past couple of days?\u201d Noah asked George.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re onto something here, Noah. I like this place. My only disappointment so far is that we didn\u2019t gather up Ellie to join us for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe deserves a day off, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you like her. And that it\u2019s about time,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not start all that again. I\u2019ve been around plenty of women,\u201d Noah said. His eyes twinkled. \u201cGeorge, who are you seeing these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. I\u2019ve been dating around, you might call it. There\u2019s a visiting professor at the college I see when she\u2019s in town. She travels quite a lot. And a neighbor lady and I like to have dinner in the city. She writes an \u2018about town\u2019 column for the paper and we enjoy some of the best restaurants, all on her tab, but that\u2019s not the best part about her. There\u2019s a waitress in Tacoma I like, a music teacher out on Bainbridge Island and a professor of veterinary medicine. She\u2019s the most trouble and I think I like her best.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes were round. He swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing five women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, on and off. Each one of them is completely irresistible in her own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t any of them want more of you than an occasional date? Like a serious relationship?\u201d</p><p>George sighed and looked upward. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to the idea of marrying again, Noah. But, as of this moment, the only woman I\u2019m seeing I would consider is the vet, Sharon. But she\u2019s forty-four. I think that might be a tad risky, don\u2019t you?\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cAlthough we do jog together on Sunday mornings. She\u2019s keeping up very well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah burst out laughing. This was what he loved about George and always had\u2014he was so unafraid to live life. He held nothing back. \u201cThey used to call men like you rogues,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cNot men like me,\u201d he protested. \u201cI care very much for these ladies. They are, each one, wonderful women. I treat them with genuine affection and respect.\u201d</p><p>Noah suspected George was sleeping with at least one of them, but he\u2019d never ask. In Noah\u2019s younger years, he\u2019d been frivolous where women were concerned and had been intimate with quite a few. When he was about to be ordained, he\u2019d struggled with the chastity issue. He wasn\u2019t big on chastity. He didn\u2019t think it was so much a sin as a recommendation, and in most cases there was a strong argument for the recommendation. Youth, for example. And there was no argument to support sex with partners you weren\u2019t committed to; he could admit he\u2019d been impetuous there. And he couldn\u2019t find anything to support adultery\u2014you didn\u2019t need a commandment to see how bad that could turn.</p> <p>For that matter, the Bible was riddled with suggestions that by modern standards were ridiculous. Isolation for menstruating women. No eating of fish without scales or fins; no wearing of linen and wool in the same garment. And there was a lot of stoning. Some were ageless rules that made perfect moral sense even today, others were cultural manifestos of the period.</p><p>Still, he had wanted George\u2019s take on it, especially if he was about to encourage members of a congregation to stand firm on something that bothered him hardly at all.</p><p>George was blas\u00e9. \u201cNo one knows the Bible better than you, Noah. And you have an impressive knowledge of related studies. There are obvious reasons why things like chastity are enforced even today. To keep women safe, for one thing. To keep men from acting like rutting beasts. To discourage promiscuity, to honor the sanctity of marriage. To keep the act of love holy and virtuous. And to keep children from coming into unblessed unions before the man and woman were prepared to parent them, to feed and protect them.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew this too well. The reasons for most of the Bible\u2019s rules were practical as opposed to arbitrary proof of one\u2019s discipline.</p><p>\u201cBut I suggest making use of the Eleventh Commandment. Moses ran out of stone, but its wisdom has survived the ages. Take responsibility for your actions.\u201d</p> <p>Noah had grinned largely and said, \u201cNow, that, I get.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>On Monday, George and Noah took a hint when they realized they were simply a bother to the workers who were trying to get some real work done in the church. They decided to drive over to Arcata to look at the bird sanctuaries, then they had a nice dinner in Old Town.</p><p>By the time they got back to Virgin River it was getting late so George took a book to bed while Noah sat up. He was on the couch with his laptop, trading late-night e-mails with a university friend who had moved to Los Angeles. It was after ten when there was a knock at the RV door. A soft knock. Noah typed, Gotta go. Company.</p><p>Noah answered the door and standing there, below him, was Ellie. She was upset; all color was drained from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s late and you were probably asleep and I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m so scared and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep. Come in,\u201d he said, putting out a hand. \u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone visited Arnie from Child Welfare today, talked to him, interviewed the kids, and he\u2019s furious! He says he knows I\u2019m behind it and he\u2019s gonna make me pay. Oh, God, Noah! What if he does something terrible to the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Noah said calmly. He led her to the couch and closed the laptop, pushing it aside. \u201cJust sit down and tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I didn\u2019t ask for that, which is the truth, but he was snarling at me, threatening me, telling me that two can play that game. If I bring trouble on him, he\u2019ll bring trouble on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call Brie?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI did. I have her business number and it went to voice mail, so I left a message. Then I called again and said I was coming here to talk to you, in case she tried to call me back. I feel like I should drive over to Arnie\u2019s or something. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>A tear suddenly emerged and he wiped it off her cheek with a thumb. And just at that moment, the door to the bedroom opened and George stood there in his bathrobe. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude. Is there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Noah asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I just heard voices, but it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s a problem,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cCome in if you like. This is not a secret,\u201d Noah said. \u201cEllie has a problem with her ex and we\u2019re going to talk it through.\u201d</p><p>George just smiled and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll leave you two to work it out.\u201d</p><p>Noah barely heard him as he was concentrating on Ellie. \u201cI have Brie\u2019s home number, if you\u2019d like me to call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a problem, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is what Arnie wants, Ellie. He made you blink. He delivered his vengeance, he scared you. He doesn\u2019t know where that Child Welfare worker came from. For all he knows, the judge ordered it. Those social workers are very slick, they know what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t let things slip that might hurt the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t believe the judge did this. What if he calls the judge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this works the usual way, no one can have an ex parte conversation with the judge\u2014you would have to be present, as well. We\u2019ll talk to Brie before the judge is in chambers,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. The problem is proving he threatened you. That\u2019s more he-said-she-said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. I should tell you, I got one of those thingamajigs. I taped him. When he started giving me trouble about talking to the kids or picking them up, I went to the electronics store and, even though it pretty much wiped me out, I bought a phone answering machine that could record calls even while I was talking. All I have to do is push a button before I pick up. So I have a tape. But that won\u2019t help, will it?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face split in a huge grin and he put his palms against her cheeks, gave a laugh and kissed her, quick and hard. \u201cHa!\u201d he said. He kissed her again. \u201cEllie, you got him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve always heard that if you tape someone when they don\u2019t know it, it won\u2019t hold up in court...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. When attorneys and judges, not to mention law enforcement, are aware that there\u2019s a real threat, the tables turn. It makes him the bad guy and you the victim! Any chance he knew what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cArnie doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d He laughed, grinning. \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Vanni\u2019s, I guess...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first, you go to Brie\u2019s office, play her the tape and ask for her help. Now we\u2019re done screwing around here\u2014I don\u2019t care what she might charge you, we\u2019ll work that out. I have a couple of bucks saved. Whatever she can do, hang the cost, get it done. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think anything can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you\u2019re so used to having the deck stacked against you, you stopped believing things can be worked out a long time ago, didn\u2019t you? Yes, we can get ahead of this.\u201d He pulled her back on the couch, his arm around her, her head on his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll get everything straightened out. This has gone on long enough\u2014we have to bring it to a close.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long moment before she said, \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>He gave her shoulders a squeeze. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t you feel like we\u2019re in this together? I want to help, Ellie. You got screwed, by Arnie, by the court, all around. You don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily and rested against his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t understand people like Arnie, Noah. What\u2019s the matter with him? Why does he want to hurt me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a borderline personality,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot exactly insane, he appears to be functional. But he\u2019s manipulative, angry, jealous, thinks he\u2019s omnipotent, and he\u2019s narcissistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Lotta ten-dollar words there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what every one of them means, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t have a happy childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so, making sure my kids don\u2019t have one, that\u2019ll make him feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronically, no. In fact, he\u2019ll probably feel worse and act worse. But he\u2019s a bucket of trouble, and he\u2019s not going to repent. They\u2019re the hardest ones to cure with therapy and counseling. Everything is justified in his mind. His perception is that he acts and feels the way he does because he has to, because other people drive him to it. It\u2019s a convoluted way of thinking to people like us who aren\u2019t that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again. And he\u2019s missing out on everything good. It doesn\u2019t cost you anything to be nice.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckled. \u201cGramma Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to understand is you, not him. Him, I get. But you, Ellie. You\u2019ve had one bad break after another and it doesn\u2019t seem to sour you on life. I\u2019m not sure I know how you do that.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI think about what I have, and what has gone right. My kids top the list. Coming here is another perfect example. I hate the circumstances, losing my kids and all, but the town has worked out for me. And if I can just get the kids back, this will have been one of the best times.\u201d She tipped her head and looked up at him. She smiled. \u201cI could use more money, however. You\u2019re a real cheapskate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much more?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnother two hundred a month would make a difference,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine?\u201d she asked, lifting her arched brows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve earned it. You were right\u2014I didn\u2019t believe you could get so much done. I\u2019m impressed. You should be compensated for that. And I realize it\u2019s still not enough, but when you work for a church, it\u2019s not easy. Wait till we have a congregation and a board of elders running the show. They\u2019ll come up with a budget and both our salaries will be hammered out based on what they can afford. In the beginning, it\u2019s going to be bleak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here then,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou might be,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job. There\u2019s no reason to run off till you\u2019ve thought it through and looked at all the options. At least if you\u2019re here, among friends, Arnie will not be able to harass you. He can\u2019t get anywhere. And you do have friends here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, I have one room and two kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s now. You said you\u2019d be comfortable in one room with them. And Jo Fitch likes having you around. Plus, you\u2019ve somehow tamed Nick. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, Ellie\u2014I never thought I\u2019d have such a versatile, energetic, efficient assistant in my life. You should keep the job awhile before you cut and run. Virgin River is a good place to raise your kids. It\u2019s a safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are problems with this idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have to be a Presbyterian, to work full-time at the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot necessary. I\u2019m the one with the calling, you\u2019re working for a living. Is that what\u2019s worrying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t work for someone who wants to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Well, I think we\u2019re doing okay with that. Don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, snuggling closer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been behaving, but it\u2019s right there, under the surface, I can feel it. You\u2019re dying to do it again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI am.\u201d He put his thumb and finger on her chin and turned her face up toward his. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I even remember it right.\u201d He touched her lips briefly with his. \u201cPah. Not that great. I can live without it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cFunny. That was a decoy, which is the same as a lie, Your Worship.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes grew hot and he put his mouth over hers again, rocking against her lips, licking them open and penetrating with his tongue. She shifted slightly and put her arms around his neck, holding him close, her tongue joining his in play, and she heard him growl deep in his throat, pulling her across his lap, tight against him. And they kissed, and kissed and kissed. His hands roughly massaged her back, her hip, her leg; her fingers locked into his hair and she made a soft moaning sound.</p><p>Noah was lost. He could no more stop kissing her than move a mountain. He continued to devour her, groaning as she added her own sweet sounds, pulling at her mouth, drawing her closer, until finally, breathless, he broke away. He took a few breaths, his eyes pinched closed. \u201cWhew, Ellie, I don\u2019t know who taught you to kiss, but you don\u2019t need any further instruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you like that too much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re headed for trouble.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t hate it, either, I could tell. I have some serious feelings happening here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another reason for me to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of here before I totally fall for you and end up with a broken heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really like me that much. You call me names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tease. Don\u2019t you know anything? Girls tease the boys they like. But before I run for my life, will you please help me get my kids back? Noah, I can\u2019t live without my kids. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s the one thing that could really break me. Do you get it? You could hurt me, but that could break me.\u201d</p><p>It was like a brick in the head. There was so much more to her than lips, than his desire, than wanting and caring. She had a family, and this situation with her kids was serious business. He would have to be careful here. He ran a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cYes. I am going to help. Tomorrow, first thing, you go to see Brie with your tape. And now, I\u2019m going to walk you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Virgin River, Noah. You don\u2019t have to walk me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-husband is threatening you, promising to get even. I\u2019m going to get you home, make sure you\u2019re in safely, and there\u2019s no discussion about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise something,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be looking at me like you want to kiss me. And I won\u2019t look at you like I want you to. This is a little scary. I can\u2019t afford to have anything go wrong before I get the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will go wrong, I promise. We\u2019re going to get this worked out. Come on,\u201d he said, standing and pulling her up. \u201cBecause if you stay, I\u2019m going to want to make out all night and I don\u2019t think we can take it.\u201d He tapped on the door to the bedroom and George opened it altogether too quickly, as if he\u2019d been pressed up against it. Noah smirked at him. \u201cI\u2019m walking Ellie home, and Lucy is staying with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cShe likes to sleep on the bed,\u201d Noah said, nodding at the dog.</p><p>Noah held Ellie\u2019s hand as he walked her home in the dark. Even though their pace was leisurely and they didn\u2019t talk, his mind was racing.</p><p>He cared about her so much that his chest ached. No matter how bad things got, she never gave in, so for her to cry signaled disaster and terror for her. He wanted to crush her to him and protect her and keep her safe like no one had been able to do in her life. Her grandmother had given her love and wisdom, but while she\u2019d been devoted, she\u2019d obviously barely kept the wolf from the door. By the time Ellie was a seventeen-year-old mother, it was she who was working to support the family.</p><p>But nothing seemed to ruin her; nothing embittered her. She was grateful for a horrible job because it allowed her to take care of her children. And she appreciated this job, though it didn\u2019t pay her enough to live, because it was a means to an end and would get her children back to her.</p> <p>She was so tough, yet so vulnerable.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t pity that drove his desire to hold her close. It was admiration. Respect. Friendship and loyalty...and, if he was honest, undeniable lust.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a personal question?\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAnother one? What now? I told the truth about the lap dances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. Did you date much besides Jason and the other guy\u2014I\u2019m sorry I just can\u2019t remember his name right now? Like in school? Like between relationships?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, I started going with Jason when I was fourteen\u2014he was almost my first boyfriend ever. After Jason, I was a mother who worked two jobs\u2014I didn\u2019t have time to date or see guys. That\u2019s probably what got me into trouble\u2014a complete lack of experience. I loved Jason with my whole being, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to care about anyone again, but then I met Chip at my night job at the convenience store and he was fun. He teased Danielle and made her giggle, and he made me laugh and feel wanted. It was the first time I felt like life might turn out okay if I just went with it. After all, being with Chip was better than crying over Jason. But when I told him I was pregnant, he said, forget about it. He wasn\u2019t ready to be a father, he didn\u2019t want a baby. He told me to get rid of it and we\u2019d think about that again in a few years, if things worked out for us. And right after he said that, he went to jail. I guess you know my decision. I kept Trevor and let Chip go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Noah said quietly. \u201cSo\u2014no boyfriends,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems impossible. Surely men noticed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was too busy for men. And for the ones who didn\u2019t understand the word no, I developed a very fast left hook.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her. \u201cPasses,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the polite term. I swear, men can be so fricking rude! Well, after Chip, I said I\u2019d never be that stupid again. And, in my immature mind, I thought that being practical where Arnie was concerned made so much more sense than letting myself get emotionally stupid and make a big mistake. Shows you what I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree men? In your life?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, two. Arnie wanted me, for whatever insane reason, but as it turned out, he didn\u2019t want to have sex with me.\u201d</p><p>Noah stopped walking. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cIt took me a long time to accept the idea of sleeping with him even if I didn\u2019t love him. It turned out that wasn\u2019t going to be a problem.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI asked him once what that was about. I didn\u2019t want him to change his mind, but I couldn\u2019t figure out him wanting a wife so much, but not wanting to have sex. He said his blood pressure medicine interfered, and that it wasn\u2019t the most important part of a relationship. Maybe he said that to be nice, maybe I just turned him off...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat makes his possessive behavior even more twisted. I bet it wasn\u2019t his blood pressure medicine. I bet it\u2019s some other kind\u2014some psychotropic medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething for a psychiatric condition. In addition to his personality disorder\u2014like depression, bipolar disorder or whatever. The upside to that would be that he\u2019s actually taking his meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you see, there really have been just two men in my life. Are you surprised? Did you think maybe I slept around a lot? Did you think that if a girl ends up as a stripper, it\u2019s because she\u2019s just a slut? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what most people think.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I asked. I just wondered if you\u2019ve been mostly alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Except for friends. I had friends where I worked, sometimes great friends, but it\u2019s hard to keep up with friends when you have two kids and two jobs. So, what about you? Until you told me you were married, I took you for a thirty-five-year-old virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I dated a lot. Had some girlfriends who lasted a pretty long time, like six months. Had a lot more I dated for several weeks or a couple of months.\u201d He grinned at her and pulled her closer. \u201cThere were a few I dated for one night. Before I was clergy, of course. Merry wasn\u2019t my first girlfriend, but she was the first woman I wanted to marry.\u201d</p><p>Ellie smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet. I guess you aren\u2019t exactly a late bloomer, huh, preach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I bloomed right on schedule,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI got an early start, but I didn\u2019t get serious for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I got serious too young. It felt real, and I\u2019d bet a million dollars that Jason and I could have lived happily ever after, but there\u2019s no getting around it\u2014it was kid love. If Danielle turns fifteen and tells me she\u2019s dead in love and can\u2019t be away from some young buck, I\u2019ll ground her for life.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be too surprised if that happens. Lots of wild hormones in youngsters.\u201d</p><p>They reached the bottom of her steps. \u201cThanks for the escort\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me come up,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be sure your room is totally safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, Arnie just called me a half hour ago. No way he could have driven over here and hidden under my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, point taken. Let me come up anyway. I want to kiss you good-night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m bad with men. I seem to make all the wrong choices, which is why I decided it would be best if I gave them up, at least until my kids grow up, move out and own their own real estate. And I\u2019m sure not getting involved with some guy who\u2019s just going to chuck me in a couple of weeks because, believe it or not, I\u2019m just not casual about stuff like this. And you\u2019re too easy to like, so stop trying to trip me up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cCome on, Ellie, it\u2019s good you like me. We shouldn\u2019t be kissing if you don\u2019t like me. And I would never chuck you\u2014I\u2019m considerate. Responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order for me to even think of going off my man-diet, I need more than considerate and responsible. I want someone who isn\u2019t going to die or stick up the night manager or treat me and my kids bad! Or leave! Or let me leave! I\u2019m looking for soul-deep, lifetime, unbreakable, unbearable passion. Love to the nth degree. The real thing for once, not some poor excuse for it. And certainly not just consideration. I\u2019m not looking for some polite version of love, but the real thing.\u201d</p><p>Then she backed away. \u201cNo, forget I said that. I don\u2019t even want that\u2014it would just mess up my already messed-up life. Don\u2019t make me want you. Now go home and don\u2019t press your luck!\u201d</p><p>And with that she stormed up the stairs, walked into her room and slammed the door. She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned against the door. That had to be done; he had to be sent away. Life was complicated enough without thinking romance was possible. Especially with someone as perfect as Noah....</p><p>There was a soft knock at the door. Ellie rolled her eyes. This was pure hell, being pursued by a good man, a sweet man, a sexy and adorable and very masculine man. Ugh. There was no reason she wouldn\u2019t fall right in love with him, and it wasn\u2019t going to work out\u2014it wouldn\u2019t last. A minister couldn\u2019t make a commitment to an ex-stripper who had two kids by two different men. It had to be against some major Presbyterian rules, had to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened the door with a frown. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressing my luck,\u201d he said. He walked in, pushed her gently out of the way and closed the door. He put his hands on her waist and pulled her to him, going after her lips at once. It took her exactly two seconds to melt to him, moan, reach her arms around his neck and return the kiss. They kissed as if they\u2019d been at it for years; they both knew when to open, tilt for a deeper fit, press harder, open wider, twine their tongues, breathe hard and deep. \u201cOh, God, stop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis is too good. And so not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it goes somewhere?\u201d he asked breathlessly.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t build me up for a big letdown,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand along the hair at her temple and looked into her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t do that to you, Ellie. I\u2019m not planning to hurt you\u2014I\u2019m not that kind of man.\u201d</p><p>She fell into his lips again, kissing him deeply, holding him close, her body pressed up against his. When she broke away, she had tears in her eyes. \u201cYou know what my curse is? I can\u2019t help but always hope, that\u2019s what. I have so wanted someone who\u2019s \u2018not that kind of man.\u2019 It\u2019s not so bad that I get let down, but it affects my kids, and they\u2019re everything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. I won\u2019t hurt you, I won\u2019t hurt them. These feelings just keep getting stronger. I feel it, and I can taste it in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed, letting her eyes fall closed.</p> <p>He carefully backed her up against the wall, pressing her there with his body. His aroused body. He placed the palms of his hands on either side of her head and expertly worked her lips, her mouth. Then he slipped to that place just below her ear on her neck. \u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want you so bad my hands shake. My eyes cross.\u201d</p><p>She put her palms against his cheeks and pushed him back a little. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been lonely,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014I haven\u2019t been lonely since you came to town. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you, feeling you, tasting you, imagining you. I should be stronger than the craving you set up in me, but I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m not just thinking about making love to you once, but making love to you over and over. And I think about how much I want to hear you laugh, how fun it is when you\u2019re teasing me. Then I think about our bodies, skin to skin. It\u2019s powerful, Ellie. And very real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Noah, you\u2019re confused...You just haven\u2019t been with a woman in a long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I can be with women anytime I feel like it, but I want to be with you. I want to feel you under me. I dream about that.\u201d He shifted slightly, pressing himself against her right in that vulnerable place where her legs were joined. He ground against her convincingly and heard a slight whimper escape her even as she held him closer. Tighter. And she moved her hips against him.</p><p>\u201cI want to undress you, touch you, kiss you, taste you. And then I want you to taste yourself on my mouth.\u201d He kissed her again, hot and strong and long. One hand crept to her clothed breast, kneading it. \u201cI want you hard and hot and deep and fast. And then I want you slow and sweet. I want you to wrap those beautiful long legs around me. I want you under me and on top of me and sitting and standing. I want to see your eyes when pleasure makes you light up. I want to hold you when you come down and try to find your breath. I want everything with you, Ellie. I care about you more than I\u2019ve cared about a woman in so long, I hardly recognized the feelings. I\u2019m dying for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered, moving against him.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cTell me you feel something for me. I taste it. Tell me you\u2019re not just lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I feel something, you big dope. Why do you think this scares the holy hell out of me? But I thought you\u2019d be the one with the great control! Besides, we\u2019re too different!\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down her bottom, down her thigh and to the back of her knee, lifting her knee to his hip so he could press himself closer.</p><p>\u201cBut the difference is what\u2019s so exciting, so beautiful. Sometimes I remember your last tease and laugh out loud when I\u2019m all alone. I wake up in the middle of the night and I smell your skin, like you\u2019re next to me. And I want you. I can\u2019t stop how bad I want you. I don\u2019t want it to stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she whispered, her arms around his neck, her mouth open and wet under his. And to her core, she was wet and quivering. He couldn\u2019t know how turned on she was, but as he pressed and gyrated, she just fell headlong into pleasure. She was balanced on the brink of orgasm, and no one had removed a stitch of clothing. He pressed harder, moved his hips against her.</p><p>\u201cI want to love every piece of you. I want to be inside you. I want our bodies together, to make the two of us into one. I want it all, and I want it hard, soft, anything that will make you happy. I want to hold you, keep you safe, make you scream...I want to make you gasp and tremble and lose control, like I\u2019m losing control. And tip over the edge. And fall.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cAnd fall,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cI want to make you fall in love with me. The way I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>With those words, she tumbled right over that edge and without even getting undressed, experienced a shattering orgasm. She tipped her head back so that it hit the wall, pressed hard against him, put both hands on his butt cheeks to hold him tightly to her, and enjoyed a very beautiful orgasm. Fully clothed, right against the wall. She closed her eyes, bit her lower lip and groaned as unbelievable pleasure washed over her, through her.</p> <p>Then she let out a long sigh and smiled. She moved her arms over his shoulders, dropped her leg from his hip and laid her head on his chest. She went so limp he had to hold her up.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cHmm, be with you in a sec.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a first,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot a first orgasm, I hope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. The first time I was talked into it. You sure have a way with words, Noah. I just got too turned on.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI guess you\u2019re in the right job. You can talk a person into anything.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a deep, gravelly, sexy laugh. He lifted her and carried her to her bed. He put her down carefully and kicked off his shoes to lie down beside her. Her eyes were closed; she was in afterglow. He could kiss her good-night and leave her now and he wouldn\u2019t have stirred up too much trouble.</p><p>But no, he couldn\u2019t. No more than he could summon thunderstorms.</p><p>He slowly began to undress her. He unsnapped her jeans, pulled her knit top up and kissed the top of her breasts. He licked her ear, kissed the inside of her elbow, unsnapped her bra.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow the foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in your case, I think it\u2019s afterplay. But I bet you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, you can talk to me anytime...But don\u2019t you have an RV guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge is asleep. And even if he\u2019s not, he wouldn\u2019t interfere in my private life. He\u2019s a grand proponent of private lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood...old...George...\u201d And she closed her eyes and let herself be stripped.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands were sweet on her body; his kisses were both tender, then not so tender. His touch was soft, then not so soft, causing her to rise off the bed to try to reach him. He was taking his time, though his breathing was becoming ragged and she knew he was struggling to wait for her. He filled his hands and then his mouth with her breasts, drawing on her until she felt she was going to fall over the edge again. He parted her legs gently, and found her slick inner parts.</p><p>When he took his clothes off, she found one of his many secrets\u2014a tattoo of his own on his upper left chest. A fish, of course. Not that religious symbol, but more like a trout leaping out of a river. She ran her fingers over it; she loved it.</p><p>He was a talker. \u201cI need you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Ellie. And soft and sweet. I love the taste of your skin, I\u2019m already addicted to your scent.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed out loud when she remembered swearing off men and realized that wasn\u2019t going to work for her, not with Noah around. She hadn\u2019t felt so much as a twinge of desire since long before Trevor was born; life was too hard and she couldn\u2019t even imagine a man making it easier. That had been until Noah kissed her, then touched her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say no to you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNoah, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would, either. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands against his bare chest and held him back. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do this, when you leave me, don\u2019t be all guilty and sorry. Please.\u201d</p><p>He touched her lips with his finger. \u201cEllie, I won\u2019t be sorry. Didn\u2019t you hear me? I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re in lust, that\u2019s all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>When he reached for his discarded pants and pulled a condom out of his pocket, her eyes widened. \u201cYou were planning this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fighting this, but I knew better than to be stupid. The last thing we need right now is to be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted closed while he suited up. And she said, \u201cI think we\u2019re already in trouble, but it\u2019s too late. Fill me.\u201d</p><p>Noah paused above her for just a second, because this was it, this was the moment. There would be no going back; this would bond them. He had certain values that had been set in stone for a long time. He didn\u2019t take the act of love lightly. It wasn\u2019t recreation, as it had been in his youth. It was more than just a part of life to him, it was a commitment. From this moment, he would belong only to her; he would be hers for as long as she would have him. And he was far past the point of regrets. He just hoped she wouldn\u2019t be sorry.</p><p>He pressed his lips against hers while he entered her slowly. She inhaled sharply, rising against him, bringing him deeper. As soon as he began to move, she surrendered again. Another powerful orgasm shook her, causing her to tremble in his arms. And in a breath, he said her name twice. \u201cEllie, Ellie...\u201d He held her still and deep, and when she was beginning to relax, he pumped his hips and let go with a deep, sexy groan.</p><p>He held himself above her so as not to crush her with his weight and he couldn\u2019t even make himself leave her body. \u201cSweet Ellie,\u201d he whispered, brushing her hair out of her face. \u201cI think you\u2019re saving my life.\u201d</p><p>When he began to pull away from her, she tightened her arms around him. \u201cNo. Please,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cStay inside me. A little longer. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that way before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he answered, lowering his lips to her neck, her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought ministers were probably boring in bed. Are you sure you\u2019re a minister?\u201d</p><p>His answer was a mere chuckle and a little squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about the whole waiting-for-marriage thing? I mean, I realize you don\u2019t want to marry me, but I thought ministers especially never messed that up. Isn\u2019t that a real special rule?\u201d</p><p>He put a finger under her chin and lifted it so he could look into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just a man, Ellie. I\u2019ve had to learn to accept that and so will you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you failed?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThis was not a mistake. This was supposed to happen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEllie, I\u2019m not going to let you down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm. You haven\u2019t so far.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cI thought you\u2019d make love in black socks,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBadly. I thought you\u2019d do it badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re okay with it so far...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOh, Noah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, I have to tell you something.\u201d Her drowsy eyes opened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push you into anything, take your time about me, but you have to know\u2014I feel pretty strongly about monogamy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t think I\u2019d be with another man! I wasn\u2019t even going to be with you! But there is one thing you have to do for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnything that makes you happy,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI want this to be only between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. It\u2019s personal. I agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone around here to know it\u2019s like this between us. I just work for you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to share our personal lives with anyone, but we don\u2019t have to hide the fact that we care about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do, Noah. No one can know about this. About us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, why? Are you embarrassed to find yourself attracted to a man who\u2019s a minister?\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little bit. \u201cNo. But no one would ever believe you seduced me. And you did, Noah. You did and I loved it. Not only are you the sexiest minister alive, you might be the sexiest man alive. But people will think I trapped you. They\u2019ll think I ruined your purity and dirtied you up. And I don\u2019t need that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019re wrong...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how much I try to do the right thing, no matter how determined I am to do the right thing, everything that happens ends up being my fault. And when people around here find out you like me...they\u2019re going to think I cast an evil spell on you and made you break your vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I didn\u2019t take a vow of chastity. I didn\u2019t promise not to love a woman. I never said I wouldn\u2019t have a perfectly normal sex drive. I\u2019m not fifteen, Ellie, I\u2019m thirty-five and I\u2019ve missed passion. Passion and intimacy, two things that are really healthy for a normal man. Don\u2019t argue with a man with seven years of theological training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t get that about you like I do. They think of you as different. As a minister. Please, Noah. Let\u2019s just act like I work for you, and that we\u2019re casual friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that, if that\u2019s what you need. Or we could change the way things have been for you. We could be honest without being indiscreet. We could hold hands, you could let me put my arm around your shoulders, smile at you like you\u2019re special. Treat you like the woman of my choice while I enjoy being the man of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you, Noah?\u201d she asked, shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how fragile this is? How much hangs in the balance for both of us? At some point\u2014maybe sooner, maybe later\u2014the people here are going to figure me out. They\u2019ll know I come from a dirt-poor background, that the men who gave me my children didn\u2019t marry me, that I was a stripper when you hired me. What if they hate me? What if they treat my kids like trash because of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see it\u2019s your future in this town, too? What if they ask themselves what kind of minister you could be if you\u2019d choose a woman like me? Oh, Noah,\u201d she said, running her fingers through his thick, dark hair. \u201cWe\u2019d get along okay in a bigger town where no one knows us all that well, where I\u2019m not hooked up with the local preacher. But here\u2014you and me? It could ruin us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be that way.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just a fool,\u201d she said. \u201cIt usually is that way.\u201d</p><p>He gazed into her eyes for a long moment, then he covered her mouth with his for a long, deep, luxurious kiss. He began to grow firm, still inside her. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t work. It will show in my eyes. Everyone will know, even if I never touch your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me to try, Noah. Please, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, if that\u2019s what you want. But, Ellie, one of the best parts of you is that you never have shame. You make your choices, you do your best, and guilt and shame\u2014the two most useless, negative emotions on the books\u2014just aren\u2019t part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of loving you, Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>Afraid yet one more thing in her life would go badly? Wouldn\u2019t turn out? Would punish her rather than bringing her joy?</p><p>Loving him? Was she talking about her feelings or her actions? he wondered. Both, his inner voice told him. She was hardheaded and sure of herself; she wouldn\u2019t do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. She loved him. And they had come further than they had planned, but she still wouldn\u2019t say it. She wouldn\u2019t say, Noah, I love you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure you\u2019re not afraid,\u201d he said gently. He pressed his lips against her temple. \u201cBut first, I\u2019m going to make love to you again, before I have to start pretending I barely know you.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d she said with a heavy, yielding sigh.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>It was after four in the morning when Noah kissed Ellie goodbye and made the walk back to his RV. He saw the lights were on inside and wondered if he\u2019d forgotten to turn them off when he left, but once inside he saw that George was up, sitting at the table with coffee and his laptop open.</p><p>George looked up, lifted a brow and gave a half smile, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Noah poured himself a cup of coffee and sat across the small table from George. Lucy rose slowly, wandered to Noah and put her head in his lap, looking up at him with those big, sad brown eyes. She looked incredibly sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cThis is a little awkward,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cBecause an old man twice your age caught you coming in at almost five in the morning?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cRelax, Noah. You know I approve of you getting on with your life. You\u2019re overdue.\u201d</p><p>Noah took a sip, swallowed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re going to approve of how I\u2019m going about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need my approval. I\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the spending-the-night part,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI know you\u2019re not going to give me a hard time about that. It\u2019s that I\u2019m not sure Ellie is ready for all I\u2019m willing to commit to. And I pushed her anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d George said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s up to you to make sure no one is hurt by your actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my very best,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this way in such a long time, I barely recall how it\u2019s supposed to feel. Ellie has a lot of doubts\u2014about me, about everyone I hope to welcome into a church losing all respect for me when they find out I\u2019m in love with her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not everything is in doubt,\u201d George said. \u201cI know you, Noah. You\u2019re not careless or impulsive. You plot. You think too much, actually. If I\u2019m right, you left here with her thinking you might spend the night, or at least that you\u2019d try to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was prepared. If it came to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Listen, son. I think Ellie surprised you. You weren\u2019t ready for a beautiful, bright and sassy young woman to make your world light up. And poor Ellie, she wasn\u2019t ready to fall for you. I\u2019d venture a guess that you\u2019re not her type at all. Now, while you two work through whatever issues you have, try giving thanks and being happy. Gifts don\u2019t come banging at the door every day. In a push-up bra, yet.\u201d George peered at Noah. \u201cIt is a push-up bra, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswering that would be indiscreet,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he muttered in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want anyone to know about us. Not just that we\u2019re intimate, but that we\u2019re interested in each other. She doesn\u2019t want a whiff of romance to be obvious between us. She said people will blame her, especially after they learn all about her past, which they inevitably will. She believes they\u2019ll think she threw her evil web around me and trapped me. But, George, nothing could be further from the truth. There\u2019s not a mean or insincere bone in her body. And I was on her like a duck on a june bug.\u201d Noah shook his head. \u201cIt puts an ache in my chest that she would feel undeserving. God, I\u2019ll have to work my whole life to deserve her.\u201d</p><p>George looked down briefly. \u201cI hate that she should have such self-esteem issues. With you, I\u2019m used to that. But Ellie has too much joy despite her problems to do that to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, with me you\u2019re used to that?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of the man in the flood. The flood swamps his house and he stands on the roof. A boat comes along and he says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about me, God will take care of me. Go save others.\u2019 Not long after, the waters rising, a second boat comes along and he says the same thing. Soon enough, he\u2019s perched on top of the chimney and a helicopter lowers a rope. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about me,\u2019 he shouts. \u2018God will take care of me.\u2019 Well, of course the silly ass drowns. When he has his first meeting with God, he rails, \u2018I believed in you, I trusted you, why didn\u2019t you save me?\u2019 And God says, \u2018I sent two boats and a helicopter? What more do you want?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Noah just stared into his cup. He knew the joke; it came up regularly.</p><p>\u201cStruggling is mandatory. Suffering is optional.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew that, too.</p><p>\u201cIf God rescued you, if God gave you a gift, do right by it.\u201d George got up and refilled his cup. \u201cI talk to you only because you want me to, Noah. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have said a word and I\u2019m definitely not asking questions. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m an early riser, because I don\u2019t want to stay away. I\u2019m leaving on Wednesday morning as planned, but I want to come back very soon. I want to see how this turns out. Stay out all night as often as you want\u2014I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disturbed,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>George laughed at him. \u201cI remember being your age. I believe my wife was leaving me about that time and everything in my life was chaotic. So melodramatic. You\u2019re going to like being seventy. Things change, especially where you choose to expend your energy. I probably have as many problems as I ever did, but I wake up every morning thinking all is right with my world. I couldn\u2019t seem to do that at thirty-five.\u201d George sat down and opened his laptop again. \u201cGet a shower, have another cup of coffee, get right with the world. You\u2019re a good man, Noah. You have a good and faithful heart. God isn\u2019t mad at you about anything.\u201d</p><p>When Noah got out of the shower, George had scrambled some eggs for the two of them. It was barely after six when he decided to head for his office in the church, only because it would give him a little quiet time before the work crews arrived and began pounding and whirring.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t being deliberately quiet when he entered and climbed the stairs, but he\u2019d left Lucy with George, and his entry must not have made a sound. He looked into the sanctuary and saw a most beautiful thing. Ellie knelt before the stained-glass window and, hands folded and looking down, she appeared to be praying. It made him smile to himself\u2014he had so many assumptions about her, so much he took for granted. He leaned in the archway to the sanctuary and just watched. He felt as if he was eavesdropping, though she didn\u2019t pray aloud. Her lips moved, however. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes passed before she raised her eyes and got to her feet. When she turned and saw him, she jumped and grabbed her heart.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was such a beautiful image, I couldn\u2019t look away. I didn\u2019t know you prayed.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath to steady herself. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWere you brought up in the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAny special denomination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll,\u201d she said. \u201cMy gramma used to think that passage when Jesus said, \u2018In my Father\u2019s house are many rooms,\u2019 didn\u2019t mean there was a big hotel in heaven. It meant there were lots of different ways to worship. We dropped into different churches for the occasional sermon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. And you weren\u2019t confused?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were never at one long enough for confusion to settle in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo, this wasn\u2019t a special occasion?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah, I\u2019ve spent so much time on my knees, they should be callused. That\u2019s figurative\u2014I usually pray in the shower. My gramma taught me that\u2014if you pray naked, you don\u2019t try so hard to hide things from God. She said, the Old Testament aside, God is our friend. He had a real short fuse in the Old Testament. Oh, and she also taught me that more important religion happens over the back fence with a good friend than anywhere else, so poo on your seven years of seminary training.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019d have to agree with that. What else? I live for her sayings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Gramma didn\u2019t have one for the morning after you spent all night having wild monkey sex with a minister\u2014\u201d she grinned \u201c\u2014that I know of.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin and looked into her beautiful brown eyes. \u201cWhy do you look so rested? I\u2019m exhausted and I look like I worked on a term paper all night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel fine. Finer than I\u2019ve felt in a hundred years. I\u2019m going to see Brie when I think she\u2019s got her office open. Then I\u2019m off to Vanni\u2019s to help her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you praying for forgiveness? For trapping me in a secret affair?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI was saying thank-you, for everything. For my gramma and her good years, for my kids, for this little town that\u2019s working out. And for you, but don\u2019t let it go to your head. Gramma didn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together, but she was always grateful. And happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I wasn\u2019t sure you even believed, much less practiced.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNoah, everyone prays in a foxhole. I\u2019ve been in one foxhole or another for the past nine years. I don\u2019t even count growing up poor\u2014I just count since Jason died. Gramma always said to trust that things would be as they should be. I just can\u2019t figure out why they shouldn\u2019t be easier.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little kiss. \u201cDid you ever hear the story about the man in the flood?\u201d</p><p>After a little private churchgoing, and a little chaste kissing, Ellie\u2019s next stop was Brie\u2019s office. Brie was incensed by what she heard on Ellie\u2019s answering machine tape.</p><p>I know you did this, you bitch, and you\u2019re not going to get away with it.</p> <p>What are you talking about, Arnie?</p><p>Child Welfare Services paid a visit, while I was at work! Asking a lot of questions, talking to the kids without me present. Got the staff all worked up and curious. I know you\u2014you told those little bastards what to say! But it\u2019s not going to work!</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything about this. Maybe it was something the court wanted...</p><p>You\u2019re going to pay for this, and pay big. I hate you, you skanky bitch, and I\u2019m going to fix you good. You think losing the kids because you\u2019re just a low-life slut was hard? Wait! I\u2019m just getting warmed up!</p><p>Brie had to take a couple of deep breaths before she could even respond. And then she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to file a motion at once. We have to revisit the custody issue now, in light of his refusal to let you visit or talk to your children, and his threats, one of which is recorded. Be warned, this will require a court appearance. If the judge doesn\u2019t dismiss my motion, he\u2019ll schedule a hearing where all parties can be present. The scumball will have a chance to defend himself and level his own accusations. So, tell me now, Ellie\u2014is there anything he\u2019s going to bring against you that we should be prepared for?\u201d</p><p>Ellie felt the heat rise to her cheeks. She had told Brie the entire story, including her work as a stripper, all in confidence. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Brie took a breath. \u201cJust lay it on me. Have you been dancing for extra money? Writing bad checks? Missing deadlines to return the kids? Using drugs or getting drunk? Anything you can think of?\u201d</p><p>Ellie swallowed. Her voice was very small when she said, \u201cNo, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I think there\u2019s something. Listen, we have confidentiality, just don\u2019t let me be surprised. It\u2019s critical that I be prepared for the absolute worst possibility.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cThe pastor. We have kind of a...thing. I asked him to please not let it show in public. I don\u2019t want people thinking I tricked him. And I know some people would think that\u2014but I didn\u2019t make the first move. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very, very new thing. Last night I was upset about the phone call and went to him. He walked me home.\u201d She looked away. \u201cHe stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d One corner of Brie\u2019s lips turned up with the temptation to smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been heading there, I let Noah kiss me.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile grew on Brie\u2019s face. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a very good kiss. A couple of them, in fact. Believe me, after all I\u2019ve been through with men, I sure wasn\u2019t about to get involved with another one, but I admit it\u2014I wasn\u2019t exactly put off. And then...Well, I just couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019s so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Brie laughed. \u201cEllie, adult relationships are not against the law. They\u2019re not considered indecent. You\u2019ve been divorced for almost a year and unless you\u2019re rolling around in bed under the same roof with your children, where they could see things they\u2019re too young to see, you\u2019re within your rights to date. You\u2019re single, you\u2019re young and healthy, and it\u2019s not a factor in custody agreements. And if you had to pick someone, gee, a lily-white pastor isn\u2019t a bad choice. Just the same, take no chances with that\u2014don\u2019t find yourself in a romantic situation with anyone while the children are present. We don\u2019t want any unnecessary trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawyers have said the judge should never have taken them away from me because of my dancing, since it was legal. I wasn\u2019t abusive, neglectful or doing icky things in front of them. The judge should have at least warned me, had me investigated to see if I was a bad mother, not made his decision like that, so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that ship has sailed,\u201d Brie said. \u201cWe could appeal his decision, and before it got to the court of appeals, not only would the period of your ex-husband\u2019s temporary custody be long past, your kids would be in junior high. No, the way to go is to do everything his way, and promptly. It often means kissing some unworthy butt, licking dirty shoes, but the goal is reversing the custody order based on this new information. Or, failing that, getting them out of his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though the judge is wrong?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong, but he\u2019s safe. You\u2019re not. He could retire before you get an appeal. Trust me, Ellie\u2014we just want this to go away. If the motion is denied, the best thing to do is serve the time, circle the wagons, load court up with solid citizens who can vouch for you and get this over with. Believe me, I know this judge. He goes his own way. We just say, \u2018Yes, sir, very happy to please you, sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think it looks promising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst-case scenario is ninety days. You\u2019re about two-thirds done with it. It could take a couple of weeks to get a hearing. So, we\u2019re not asking for much\u2014we\u2019re only asking to shorten this temporary-custody ruling by a little bit. Hope for the best. From my point of view, you\u2019re making a very reasonable request. You\u2019ve carried out the judge\u2019s wishes to the letter. Nothing says proper job like a pastor\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr pastor\u2019s lover?\u201d she asked, looking down.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to bring that up. It\u2019s not relevant. Okay? Now, is there anything else you should tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ellie shrugged and said, \u201cNo matter what names he calls them, the one that hurts the most is bastards. I don\u2019t want them called that. That\u2019s my fault, not theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, you have to be stronger than name-calling. You gave them life. You can rise above a dirty word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI manage to rise above a lot of things. That one\u2019s extra hard. I\u2019m so happy I have them. So sorry there\u2019s anything missing from their lives.\u201d</p><p>From Brie\u2019s office, Ellie headed over to Vanni\u2019s to play Mommy\u2019s helper. Her new friend looked much better than she had when Ellie began this special assistance. Vanni appeared rested and the house was holding up. In what seemed no time at all, it was a whole new scene. Rather than Mommy\u2019s helper, she was Mommy\u2019s friend. They worked together to tidy the house, caught up on the laundry and got an early start on dinner.</p><p>While they each sat at a separate end of the sofa with a load of clean baby clothes to fold between them, they talked. \u201cI haven\u2019t held Hannah enough since she first arrived here. I avoided holding her and, when I did, I don\u2019t think my heart was in it. Do you think that\u2019s going to be a lasting harm to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know much about that sort of thing, but my gramma used to always say, \u2018Children will tell you what they need if you just pay attention.\u2019 Hannah isn\u2019t even cranky. The only time she cries, she\u2019s tired or dirty or hungry or...reaching for you. If you\u2019re a little better about things now, you can cuddle more, catch her up. I mean, think about it, Vanni\u2014sometimes mommies are too tired, don\u2019t feel good, even get sick and go to the hospital. Sometimes they have to work more than one job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll never forget, on some subconscious level, that I was cold to her. I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m committed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. I always worried about that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Being cold toward your kids?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t cold, but I was never able to give them enough. I was wrung out. I mean, I had my gramma to watch the kids and I knew she was giving them tons of love. But they need their mother, right? And I worked day and night. By the time I could be with my kids, I was worn out and I just didn\u2019t have anything left. I\u2019ve always wondered if they suffered because of that. But if you knew them...\u201d She smiled wistfully. \u201cThey\u2019re so amazing. I probably owe it all to my gramma.\u201d</p><p>Vanni shook out a onesie and folded it. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty amazing,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you give yourself enough credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just having one of those emotional days,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have them too often, thank God.\u201d But she\u2019d been threatened by her husband, loved by her man, encouraged by her lawyer, depended on by a good friend. And it wasn\u2019t even noon.</p><p>By September in the mountains, the weather was beginning to cool. Fishing was good, hunting was around the corner and the bar was pretty full at dinnertime. Jack greeted a man he\u2019d never seen before. He gave the bar a wipe and said, \u201cWelcome. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks. Nice place you got here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPassing through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. How about a cola? That too much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, my friend. I\u2019m Jack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Arnold. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>While Jack served up a cola, he noticed that Arnold took a slow look around the bar, taking it in. There were a few couples in the place, three senior ladies occupied one spot near the window, and a couple of tables were pushed together to accommodate Mel, Brie, Paige and the small children, with Mike Valenzuela, Brie\u2019s husband the town cop, sitting at the end. Some fishermen played cribbage and shared a pitcher at one end of the bar and at the other end, a solitary man nursed a drink. Arnold was almost turned around on his stool when Walt Booth and Muriel St. Claire came in. Walt, a powerful-looking man with silver hair and black eyebrows, came up to the bar next to Arnold while Muriel wandered over to the table of women. Patrons greeted them both. \u201cHey, Walt! Hi, Muriel!\u201d</p><p>Arnold turned his attention back to the front of the bar and Jack saw him smile. Arnold picked up his cola.</p><p>Jack looked at Walt. \u201cBeer, General?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And a Chardonnay for Muriel. And a takeout from the kitchen, but no hurry on that. When you have a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jack said. And then he was busy at the other end of the bar, producing another pitcher.</p><p>Jack noticed Hope McCrea as she came into the bar wearing her standard uniform of big clown glasses, muddy rubber boots and what looked like a trench coat that had seen better days. She sat beside Walt and tapped the counter for her whiskey. Right behind her, Dan Brady arrived wearing his Shady Brady.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while, Brady,\u201d Hope said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on that old house night and day, trying to get it right so it can be sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? And then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find another place,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cGeneral,\u201d Dan greeted, leaning around Hope. \u201cHow\u2019re things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever better, son. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Jack made a quick trip to the kitchen to put in the general\u2019s order and was back at the bar quickly. \u201cHow you doing, Hope?\u201d he said as he served up the old woman\u2019s whiskey. And, \u201cBrady? You avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>The man said, \u201cA little bit of you goes a long way.\u201d Jack laughed at him.</p><p>Then Jack asked Arnold, \u201cCan I interest you in some dinner? Some outstanding corned beef and cabbage tonight with boiled potatoes and apple pie. The apple crop has been great this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be nice, thanks. I\u2019ll think about it a minute. And what do you know about the church next door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen boarded up for years,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cBut we got us a new pastor and he\u2019s fixing up the church. Presbyterian. Should be open for business in another month or so. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had church in this town. Way before my time, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Pastor\u2019s name?\u201d Arnold asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah Kincaid. You from around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so far away. Thing is, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the church where my wife took a job.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the bar seemed to go silent at once. Then finally Jack asked, \u201cWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie. Have you seen her around?\u201d</p><p>Jack knew only two things about Ellie. She seemed like a nice, genuine girl. And he knew she had difficult custody issues that concerned Noah, but Jack didn\u2019t know the particulars. And there was one more thing\u2014for no particular reason, he didn\u2019t like this man who said he was her husband. Jack said, \u201cNice young woman, Ellie. I was under the impression she was unmarried.\u201d</p><p>Arnold laughed. \u201cYeah, I suppose that would be her story, that she\u2019s not married. She has a long history of that kind of thing, good at stories, my Ellie. She\u2019s married and a mother, and the judge gave me the kids. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat someone\u2019s not telling the whole truth,\u201d Jack said, and his jaw twitched. He was a bartender. He didn\u2019t very often read people wrong.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go. I wondered if maybe someone should warn the minister about her. You know, before he gets in too deep. Gets in trouble with the town or his higher-ups because of her.\u201d</p><p>The silence was deafening. Everyone was listening except the fishermen at the end of the bar, and they were concentrating on their cribbage game.</p><p>Jack probably knew Ellie the best of everyone present, but others apparently had their own strong opinions about her. Ellie had been helping Walt\u2019s daughter, Vanni, with the babies, and Walt appreciated that. Hope and Dan had met Ellie several times, and Ellie made them laugh. Mel turned in her seat to stare at the man; Jack knew Mel got a kick out of Ellie and liked her, too. By now Brie actually stood up to listen to the exchange. Jack thought Ellie and Brie had met at least once in the bar; possibly Ellie had taken her issues to Brie for legal advice. The look on his little sister\u2019s face was venomous. The three little old ladies by the fire? They were all ears, and their legs almost twitched with the desire to bolt to their phones. And then Mike slowly got up from his table and went behind the bar to stand beside Jack.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would Noah have problems?\u201d Jack asked evenly.</p><p>Arnold laughed lightly and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s using him and the job to get out of trouble. Penance. Ellie worked in a strip joint. She was hooking. She\u2019s a whore. Selling her body and who knows what else. I kicked her out when I figured out what she was doing.\u201d He sipped his cola. \u201cI\u2019m divorcing her, of course, but for now I just have to keep the kids away from her. Who knows what all she\u2019s into.\u201d</p><p>The door to the bar opened with a ripple of friendly male laughter, and Noah and his friend George walked in. Without looking at his watch, Jack knew it was time for Lucy\u2019s dinner and knew she was leashed out on the porch. Noah and George said a few hellos, and didn\u2019t seem to notice that it was morgue quiet in the bar as they grabbed a couple of stools. Noah said, \u201cHi, Jack,\u201d and George said, \u201cMy God, something from the kitchen smells incredible.\u201d</p><p>Noah slowly became aware of the unusual silence that surrounded him and after looking around a little, he spotted Arnold. And, Jack noticed, Arnold smiled and narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThis man here was just explaining, in great detail, why he should warn you off that nice girl Ellie, who\u2019s been painting the church and helping Vanni with the babies. Noah, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is,\u201d Noah said with deadly calm. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking out this town,\u201d he said with an air of innocence. \u201cSeeing where Ellie got her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd making sure everyone in the bar heard him accuse her of some very unsavory things,\u201d a female voice said from behind them. It was Brie, and she looked furious. \u201cUntrue things, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Arnold said with a laugh. \u201cYou married to her? You live with her? I\u2019m telling you, the girl knows how to put on a real good show. You\u2019ll believe what she wants you to believe. I have personal knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married to her, Mr. Gunterson,\u201d Brie said easily. \u201cYou should probably go now, before you dig your hole any deeper.\u201d</p><p>And with a voice as smooth as silk, a half smile on his lips, he faced Brie down and said, \u201cAnd just who do you think you are, ordering me out?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand came down on the bar hard, clamping over Arnold\u2019s wrist, and he glared into the man\u2019s eyes. Jack\u2019s eyes glittered. Jack hated this kind of cheap, sissy maneuver\u2014trashing the girl to the town behind her back. He might not know exactly what was going on, but he knew this guy was wrong and Ellie was an okay kid. All he was lacking were the facts. \u201cThat\u2019s my little sister, asshole. And your fifteen minutes of fame are up. You\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Arnold started to laugh meanly. \u201cJesus, is she fucking all of you?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s stool scraped back and fell, he stood so abruptly. As if choreographed, as slick as a football play, Dan stopped Noah from mixing it up with Arnold, Walt grabbed Arnold\u2019s upper arm and held him firmly, while Jack and Mike came around the bar to escort him out.</p><p>Unfortunately, before they could remove him, the door opened and Ellie stood there. She saw Arnold and shock was etched on her features. \u201cArnie? What are you doing here? Where are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought I should pay a visit, make sure your minister here, and your new friends, knew that they were cozying up to a prostitute. A stripper, a druggie, a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, stunned. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d</p><p>Arnold just laughed. \u201cYour stories are just getting worse and worse, Ellie. You shouldn\u2019t have lied to all these good people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not true, you know that\u2019s not true. Arnie, who\u2019s watching the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have them handled,\u201d he said. \u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d Jack said, gripping one arm while Mike grabbed the other. \u201cYou\u2019re all done here.\u201d They walked him out of the bar and down the porch steps. \u201cJust in case you\u2019re wondering, you shouldn\u2019t show your face around here again,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt could be bad for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Arnold asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cPromising.\u201d</p><p>In the bar, Ellie looked around and found all eyes on her. Panic immediately set in\u2014would they believe what Arnie had told them? Brie said, \u201cEllie, come here. Right now.\u201d Brie grabbed her hand, and with Ellie in tow, immediately bolted for the kitchen phone to call the police. \u201cThis is just a hunch, but from what you told me about Arnold\u2019s isolationism, the kids might have been left alone, unsupervised. What\u2019s the address?\u201d</p><p>Ellie gasped. She put her hand over her open mouth.</p><p>\u201cEllie? The address?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>Ellie recited it and Brie reported the children as abandoned. She requested that the police check the house. \u201cThey\u2019re four and eight,\u201d Brie told the dispatcher. \u201cI\u2019m Brie Valenzuela, a friend of their mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The second Brie hung up the phone, Ellie grabbed it and dialed Arnie\u2019s house. There was no answer, but that meant nothing. Arnie could have demanded they not answer the phone, as he had when they all lived together. But what if it was something far worse? After letting it ring too many times, she hung up and fell into Brie\u2019s arms, sobbing. \u201cGod, what has he done...what has he done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying a little damage control, but it backfired on him. When we get a hearing, the judge will hear about that, too. Before we get that far, he was lying, wasn\u2019t he, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he was lying! I worked in a strip club, you know that. A clean club\u2014the boss was always on the lookout for funny business. Most of the women who danced there were single mothers, doing it for the money. I swear to God!\u201d She ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI have to get to my phone, in case they call me!\u201d And with that, she ran out the back door and down the street.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t even notice Jo and Nick sitting on their front porch as she ran past until Jo called her name. Ellie stopped for just a second, made a sound of despair and then hurried on to her apartment. She tried calling from her own phone, but she knew Arnie didn\u2019t have caller ID. At least he hadn\u2019t when Ellie lived with him; he didn\u2019t want the phone answered, period.</p><p>There was no answer. Again.</p><p>Ellie paced, but it wasn\u2019t very long before there was a tapping on the door and Jo popped it open without being invited in. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jo said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Ellie quickly ran down what had just happened in the bar. Then she added, \u201cJo, that bar I told you I worked in? It was a strip club and yes, I danced. But I swear to God, I never took drugs or worked as a prostitute! I promise you! And if I don\u2019t talk to my kids real soon, I\u2019m going to Arnie\u2019s and if I have to tear the doors and windows off the place, I\u2019m going to be sure my kids are\u2014\u201d She stopped as the phone rang and she snatched it up. \u201cHello?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, where are you?\u201d Ellie asked Danielle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m at Arnie\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said we could have supper when he comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny, are you alone? You and Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. The phone\u2019s been ringing and ringing, but he said don\u2019t answer the phone and if it was him, playing a trick, maybe we wouldn\u2019t get supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart, I want you to listen to me. You\u2019re not supposed to be left alone, so a police officer is coming to check on you. Ask who\u2019s at the door and if he says it\u2019s the police, you can let him in. Just so he can be sure everything is okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Mama,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can, honey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama, the door is locked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay for you to unlock it for the police, honey. In fact, I\u2019ll stay on the phone with you until they get there.\u201d</p><p>Over her shoulder, Ellie noticed that Jo had taken up the pacing. Nick came into the apartment, a look of concern on his face. There were pounding footfalls on the stairs and Noah appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mama, we can\u2019t reach the lock!\u201d Danielle said.</p> <p>Ellie sighed. \u201cPull a chair over, Danny. It\u2019s okay. But wait until the police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama! It\u2019s locked on the outside!\u201d</p><p>Ellie was speechless. She had to shake herself. \u201cDanielle, Mommy\u2019s coming right now. It will take me a while, but I\u2019m coming right now. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m being afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m coming right now. Jo Ellen is here and she\u2019s going to talk to you while I\u2019m on my way. You just stay on the phone with Jo and everything is going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she said. \u201cBye, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Ellie took a breath and, with her hand over the mouthpiece so Danielle wouldn\u2019t hear her, she looked at Jo, Nick and Noah. Her voice was softer than usual; deadly soft. \u201cHe locked them in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe door is locked on the outside. They can\u2019t get out. They\u2019re trapped.\u201d Then she handed off the phone to Jo, grabbed her purse, lunged out of the upstairs apartment and fled down the stairs. Noah was on her heels, moving fast to keep up with her.</p><p>When she hit the bottom, Noah caught her. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cWant me to drive?\u201d</p> <p>She wrenched free and literally dove for the car, throwing herself behind the wheel, digging frantically in her purse for keys. The passenger door opened and Noah jumped inside as she started the ignition. \u201cI grew up on these mountain roads. Buckle up and hang on!\u201d</p><p>Deputy Stan Pierce pulled up to the address he\u2019d been given and, as he walked to the front door, he scowled. He couldn\u2019t make it out from the curb, but as he got closer he could see that right inside the screen door, bolting the door closed from the outside, was a padlock. A padlock. Like an ordinary lock a firefighter could just release wasn\u2019t enough? Like a dead bolt with a key they could turn on the inside wouldn\u2019t do the trick? He opened the screen, pulled on the lock and felt a groan escape. He knocked on the door.</p><p>A very small voice asked, \u201cWho\u2019s there, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a police officer. Are your parents at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just me and Trevor. Arnie went on an errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to get this door open. It\u2019s going to make a noise, but don\u2019t be worried. It\u2019ll just take a minute.\u201d</p><p>Pierce went back to his car, opened the trunk and pulled out a crowbar. He radioed his dispatcher that he\u2019d need a social worker from Child Welfare Services, but in the meantime he was going to open the house and look around inside. Rather than trying to cut the lock, he pried the whole contraption off the door and frame. Screws fell to the ground; the padlock bounced on the walk and into the bushes.</p><p>He pushed the door open gently. The house was dark inside because the blinds and curtains were drawn. In the light from the open doorway he could see two young children sitting on the sofa in a sparsely furnished living room. \u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Deputy Pierce from the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d He got closer and crouched to get to their level, sitting on the heel of his boot. \u201cHow long have you been by yourselves?\u201d</p><p>The little girl shrugged. \u201cSince right after school. Arnie\u2019s the principal of our school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Stan said. \u201cYou call your dad Arnie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not our dad,\u201d the girl said, slipping an arm around her brother, pulling him close to her. \u201cHe was our stepdad for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Do you know where I can find him now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, honey?\u201d Pierce asked.</p><p>\u201cDanielle,\u201d she said, tightening her arm protectively around her brother. \u201cThis is Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. Do you mind if I look around a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Again, she just shook her head.</p><p>So Stan did a quick inventory. Most situations like this were real easy to figure out. If the house was filthy, the kids thin and hungry and the food in short supply, it was a no-brainer. This was a little weird. The house was immaculate, even the kids\u2019 beds were made up. It was dark; all the blinds were closed, very little food in the fridge...Absolutely no clutter. With two little kids? No clutter? He checked the back door\u2014another padlock. The locks...This was just plain scary.</p><p>He went into the kitchen to call his sergeant and explain the situation. \u201cThe kids seem to be okay, but I have a real bad feeling. The scene is too controlled, the blinds all closed, the doors locked from the outside and it\u2019s creepy clean\u2014no toys or anything lying around. The kids are weird, just sitting on the couch like they were told to stay put. They\u2019re clean, but scared. My kids? If we were out of the house for a couple of hours, they\u2019d have the place torn apart. You know? I want to bring \u2019em in, get CWS involved. Something about this is too off. Well, the locks\u2014right there we\u2019re looking at some serious endangerment. Neglect and endanger\u2014\u201d He stopped and listened. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m bringing them in.\u201d</p><p>He went back to the front room. He crouched again. \u201cKids, I want you to go find a couple of things to take on a possible overnight. A toothbrush. Pajamas. Clean clothes to put on in the morning. Anything special like a teddy bear or blanket or pillow you can\u2019t be away from. Maybe a book or toy that\u2019s special. Can you do that? Do you need my help? I have kids\u2014I could help.\u201d</p><p>Silent, Danielle shook her head. She got up from the couch very stoically, and pulled her brother along behind her. They went to their bedroom and Stan just stood up and sighed. They\u2019d done this before. Packed their own bags.</p><p>While the kids were in their rooms, a car pulled up out front. Stan went to the doorway and was standing there when a big man got out of his dark SUV and came to the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where are my kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re packing up a bag, Mr....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnold Gunterson. Packing a bag for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking them to the police department, sir. We have a big problem with the locks on the outside of the doors, trapping the children inside, unsupervised.\u201d Stan shook his head. \u201cYou can meet us at the sheriff\u2019s department and talk to the social worker from Child Welfare Services. I\u2019m not going to cite you right now, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my house, my kids\u2014what business is this of yours?\u201d he asked hotly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s neglect and endangerment, Mr. Gunterson. You can\u2019t leave minor children alone in a building, locked in and trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t trapped,\u201d he growled. \u201cI had to make sure they didn\u2019t open the door for anyone dangerous!\u201d</p><p>Deputy Pierce lifted an eyebrow and tilted his head. \u201cWould that include firefighters and paramedics? Mr. Gunterson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine\u2014not a good idea. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the sheriff\u2019s department substation. I\u2019ll have to write up a report,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cYou can meet us there. Give you time to make up your story.\u201d Pierce stepped aside so he could escort the kids to his patrol car.</p><p>It was impossible to ignore\u2014both kids backed up when they spotted Gunterson.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look, Deputy,\u201d Arnie said. \u201cI apologize. I can see where you\u2019re coming from here, that wasn\u2019t such a good idea. I give you my word, I\u2019ll be much more careful. We\u2019ve been through a lot, the kids and me, and I just wanted to be sure they were safe from their crazy mother. That\u2019s all. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can explain all this at the station, Mr. Gunterson,\u201d Stan said. \u201cI\u2019ll take the kids in the squad car and you can meet us there.\u201d Stan put a big hand on Danielle\u2019s shoulder and urged the kids around their stepdad.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d Arnie said. \u201cLet them be, you\u2019re scaring them. You want a report? I\u2019ll bring them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, sir,\u201d Pierce said, urging the kids toward his vehicle.</p><p>A silver PT Cruiser rushed up to the house, screeched to a stop and a woman jumped out of the driver\u2019s side. Both kids immediately shot across the lawn to her, yelling, \u201cMama!\u201d She fell to her knees and caught them, holding them. A man got out of the same car and came around the front to approach Stan, his hand out.</p><p>\u201cReverend Noah Kincaid, Officer. Are the kids all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be okay, but as I was explaining to the gentleman here, I\u2019m taking them to the station. I\u2019d like them to sit down with someone, talk about what went on here, and while they\u2019re doing that I\u2019ll write up a report. You call it in? Kids left unsupervised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it was a friend of their mother\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cDo they have to go with you?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Stan said, knowing he had some kind of big-time domestic situation on his hands. The husband and wife calling the cops on each other, the reverend showing up for ballast. If it weren\u2019t for the weird house and the locks and the nervousness of the kids, he might assume the wife was playing out some vengeance on the husband. \u201cThat Mrs. Gunterson, there?\u201d Stan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cShe\u2019s Ellie Baldwin. The kids are Danielle and Trevor Baldwin. Miss Baldwin hasn\u2019t been married to Mr. Gunterson for about a year. They were only married a couple of months. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>Stan snorted. It always was. \u201cWell, there will be plenty of time. Let\u2019s gather up these kids. You can all come to the station while we figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d Then, under his breath, he said, \u201cMy sergeant\u2019s gonna be thrilled....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you, Officer,\u201d Arnie said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can straighten this out without too much confusion.\u201d And with that, the big man strode stoically and confidently to his SUV.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Thank God for Noah, Ellie thought. She was angry enough to kill, but on the way to the sheriff\u2019s substation, he talked her off the ledge. He emphasized that she had to stay calm and try her hardest not to act out. \u201cArnold will be cool. He\u2019ll do what he can to appear to be the sane, stable one, to smooth things over\u2014he\u2019s obviously good at it. Don\u2019t let yourself get sucked in.\u201d</p><p>And of course, that was exactly what happened. While Ellie and Arnie were separated from the kids, Arnie finagled a moment alone with the sergeant in charge. After hearing what Arnie had to say to the locals at Jack\u2019s, Ellie could only imagine. And he\u2019d been in there a long time. \u201cI guess that whole ex parte thing doesn\u2019t apply to sheriff\u2019s deputies,\u201d Ellie muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little substation, but you can bet the sergeant has dealt with this before, Ellie,\u201d Noah said. \u201cLet him do his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about the kids,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in that back office awhile now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was the right thing to do,\u201d Noah said. \u201cGiving permission for them to talk to the social worker alone\u2014that was smart. Arnie couldn\u2019t prevent that happening without bringing some suspicion on himself. Danielle will tell her how it is at that house. And that whole business with the lock\u2014that\u2019s sick. The guy is seriously twisted.\u201d</p> <p>A giant tear ran down her cheek. \u201cOh, Noah, this is all my fault. What was I thinking, getting mixed up with him? Look what I\u2019ve done to my kids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, kiddo. This is a bad time for a meltdown.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with such remorse, such despair, her eyes all liquid, her voice so soft, so unlike Ellie. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too much of a sacrifice for me, you know? I get by any way I can. If Arnie could give them a good home, I could manage. I thought I was making a good decision for my family. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, baby,\u201d he said, pulling her against him, holding her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, what\u2019s wrong with me? I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllie, stop. You were doing the best you could.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cI should have put more energy into keeping us independent. On our own. At least we could trust each other.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin and looked into her frightened, wet eyes. \u201cNothing like this is ever going to happen to you again, Ellie. I\u2019ll make sure of it. I don\u2019t know how yet, but I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Noah, that\u2019s not what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d</p><p>She was cut off by her name being called. She turned to see Jo Fitch rushing toward her, Nick close on her heels.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ellie asked, giving the wet on her cheeks a nervous swipe.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d end up here. Honey, are they all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. Arnie\u2019s with the sergeant and I\u2019m out here and the kids are\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sergeant\u2019s office door opened and Arnie came out. He walked toward the front door, paused to glare at Ellie, then exited the building. \u201cOh, God,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cWas that a good sign? Or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left without the kids,\u201d Noah said, an arm around her shoulders. \u201cSo far, I\u2019d call that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThis is killing me.\u201d</p><p>The woman from Child Welfare Services came from the room where she\u2019d been interviewing the kids. She held a couple of thin files in her arms and approached Ellie. \u201cMrs. Baldwin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cMiss Baldwin. Ellie would be even better. Are they doing all right? The kids?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey seem to be holding up just fine\u2014but after I make a couple of phone calls, I\u2019ll need your help to talk to them. They\u2019re not going back to Mr. Gunterson\u2019s house tonight, but because of the court order, I have to locate some emergency foster care for them. Hopefully we can keep them together, depending on what\u2019s available. But I can\u2019t make any promises about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said pitifully. \u201cCan\u2019t I take them with me? At least until we can see the judge again? My lawyer filed something, asking for another court date. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a licensed foster parent,\u201d Jo Fitch said abruptly. \u201cI was a foster-care provider and kept up my license. It\u2019s been a few years, but I know these children. And what\u2019s more important, they know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your relationship to the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie has been renting the furnished room over our garage since she\u2019s been working for Pastor Kincaid. It\u2019s on the same property as the house, but it\u2019s not attached. And we have two extra bedrooms. On some of Ellie\u2019s Saturdays with the kids, they spent the day with Nick and I, baking, painting, reading. I think they\u2019d feel safe there\u2014and their mother\u2019s nearby. Listen,\u201d Jo said to the social worker, \u201call custody orders aside, this is a fine young woman, a wonderful mother. Believe me, I\u2019ve been around the block with parents whose kids were in the system and I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a total of nineteen,\u201d Nick said, stepping forward, slipping an arm around Jo\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Ellie prayed. \u201cPlease. I could tuck them in. I could have meals with them. And with Jo, I know they\u2019d be safe.\u201d</p><p>The social worker looked down while she considered this. She looked up and said, \u201cYou understand, the foster parent is in charge? Even if they\u2019re right next door, even if you have access to them, the foster parent has the last word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Ellie assured her. \u201cI won\u2019t interfere. As long as they\u2019re safe, I won\u2019t interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go back to the office and check your credentials,\u201d she said to Jo. \u201cJust so we don\u2019t muck up the procedure and make it worse on these kids, I\u2019ll get a judge on the phone. It shouldn\u2019t take long. Then if everything is in order, you can take them home. Since you haven\u2019t provided foster care in a while, expect a few unscheduled visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jo said, following behind the social worker.</p><p>A half hour later they were under way, herding the kids into the sheriff\u2019s substation parking lot. And there, leaning against his big black SUV, was Arnie. He was glowering at them. It brought Ellie up short with a gasp.</p><p>Noah grabbed her upper arm and whispered in her ear, \u201cSay nothing. Absolute silence. Let\u2019s get these kids away from here with Jo and Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. She quickly settled Trevor into his seat belt while Jo made sure Danielle was fastened in. And as they pulled away, Ellie leaned against Noah and gave a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s relief was short-lived. Noah took the keys from her hand and drove, despite her protest that she was just fine. And they\u2019d no sooner cleared the parking lot of the sheriff\u2019s substation when the headlights of that big, black SUV beamed through the PT Cruiser\u2019s windows, nearly blinding Noah as they hit the rearview mirror. The roar of the engine was loud; Arnie was driving within inches of the back fender.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing?\u201d Ellie said, turning to look into the glare.</p><p>\u201cHarassing. Don\u2019t turn around. Don\u2019t look at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, turn around. Go back to the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d he said, pulling up to a Stop sign. \u201cNot yet. I want him with us, not with Jo and Nick and the kids.\u201d He sat at the Stop sign for far longer than necessary while Arnie revved his engine. Then he pulled away slowly. \u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d get out, charge the car, pick a fight. I\u2019m a little surprised. Happy, but surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Noah, he\u2019s going to get us going up the mountain. He\u2019ll rear-end us right off the road, down the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d He adjusted the mirror to get rid of the glare. Then he took a couple of turns, stopped a couple more times and lingered, staying in town. \u201cEyes front, Ellie. We\u2019re not going to engage him. Um\u2014does Arnie have guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he did, but that they were locked up safe. I never saw them. He didn\u2019t take time to go in the house before following the deputy to the station. Unless he has one in the car...\u201d She slid down in the seat as Noah drove through a motel parking lot, back out onto the main street, the SUV close on his tail.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he never hit you or the kids? While you were with him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSometimes he looked like he was going to either explode or coldcock me, but he didn\u2019t. He brooded. Pouted. Grumbled and accused and demanded, but he was never physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a powder keg,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so close! How does he manage to keep from hitting us with his car?\u201d she asked. \u201cPray, Noah. Really.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed softly and thought\u2014two boats and a helicopter, and made yet another right turn, that big SUV inches from his bumper. There were only a few Stop signs in town and he slowed down as he approached the only light while it was green. He purposely caught the end of the yellow and forced Arnie to run a red light. \u201cWhere\u2019s a cop when you need one?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Giving me a tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving Jo, Nick and the kids a good head start,\u201d he said. He glanced at the console clock. \u201cYou know what? This is a good little car, Ellie. She\u2019s got some zip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the zip of eight cylinders and all that weight. And she\u2019s got a lot of miles on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s maneuverable. I like that in a car.\u201d He turned a couple more times, drove through an alley and a parking lot, then pulled right into the parking lot of the sheriff\u2019s substation again, right up to the front door, in a No Parking zone. \u201cYou go in and ask for advice. I\u2019ll ask Arnie what we can do to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Noah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuick now,\u201d he said, putting the PT Cruiser in Park, and getting out.</p><p>But of course the second he approached the driver\u2019s door, Arnie put his SUV in Reverse and left the parking lot. He left nice and easy.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Noah and Ellie had a highway patrol escort up Highway 36 into the mountains and hadn\u2019t gone far when they passed a black SUV parked by the side of the road, waiting. The SUV was facing the direction of Virgin River. When they passed en route to Virgin River, the SUV made a U-turn in the middle of the road and headed out.</p><p>Ellie laughed and clapped her hands. \u201cHa! That worked!\u201d</p><p>Noah was quiet for a long moment. \u201cEllie, that guy is scaring me,\u201d Noah finally said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fearless.\u201d</p><p>By the time Ellie and Noah got to the Fitch household, the kids were sitting at the kitchen table with Nick, having ice cream. They both jumped up and ran to Ellie, hugging her so hard she had to peel them off. \u201cHey now,\u201d she said, laughing nervously. \u201cLooks like you have an ice-cream party going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had a sandwich first,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI thought some ice cream, bath and bed, in that order. I think these two have had a little too much excitement for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cHow about it, you two? Finish up here. Would you like me to take care of baths?\u201d she asked Jo.</p><p>\u201cMama, I have my own bath,\u201d Danielle said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Jo agreed. \u201cAnd guess what? There are two tubs in this house, one in the hall and one off my bedroom. While your mom makes sure Trevor gets clean behind the ears, you\u2019ll have your own bath. We\u2019ll put bubbles in the tub...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want bubbles,\u201d Trevor said to Ellie.</p><p>\u201cBubbles for you, too,\u201d Jo said. \u201cThen bed. You don\u2019t have to go right to sleep, but you have to get comfortable, quiet, and slow down a little. All right?\u201d</p><p>While both kids agreed, Ellie mouthed thank you to Jo. And Jo just smiled.</p><p>\u201cNick, do you have a phone in your den that I could use for a private call?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, Pastor. You know the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, thanks. I won\u2019t be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, while Ellie was settling her kids in their beds, Noah was having coffee in the kitchen with Jo and Nick. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s our situation. Arnie followed Ellie and I for a while after we left the station. He was dangerously close to her car, until I circled back to the station and they helped me out with a CHP escort up the hill. I made a call to the California Highway Patrol and the sheriff\u2019s department from your den, Nick. Arnie\u2019s a loose cannon and I can\u2019t guess what he\u2019s thinking. Be sure the doors are locked here tonight. You probably haven\u2019t bothered to do that in years....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever had to worry about that before,\u201d Nick said. \u201cBut we have precious cargo in the house. We\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re safe. I\u2019ll even check the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo, no way they go to Arnie\u2019s private school in the morning. I don\u2019t know how the CWS system works, but if you have to take Danielle to some school, it can\u2019t be that one. I\u2019m going to talk to Ellie about having Brie Valenzuela get a temporary restraining order. Check with whoever supervises you about how to handle school. And keep sharp\u2014I\u2019m worried about Arnie\u2019s behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should mention this to Mike V,\u201d Jo said. \u201cDo you think Ellie should spend the night here tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can run that by her. Nick, is the phone line to that apartment accessible? Should someone have a desire to cut it and leave Ellie without a phone, is it possible?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cIt runs underground and through the inside of the garage walls. It\u2019s safe, unless someone broke into the garage\u2014and I\u2019ll be sure those doors are locked also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she wants to stay in her room, I\u2019ll make sure she gets in safely. She\u2019ll have the phone if she has a problem. I\u2019m not letting anything happen to her\u2014she\u2019s the best assistant I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take your advice and mention this situation to Mike Valenzuela. You\u2019re right\u2014he should be in the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d Jo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick together and keep them all safe. That girl\u2014she means a lot to me. So do the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Noah said. \u201cListen, do you have a can of soup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie hasn\u2019t eaten anything. She should keep her strength up. I think she has a battle ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sure do that,\u201d Jo said, going to the pantry.</p><p>It was ten in the evening before Ellie had finally eaten something, knowing her kids were safe and sound asleep. Noah walked her to her apartment and when he followed her up the stairs, she didn\u2019t protest. Instead, she unlocked the door and left it open for him to enter behind her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you feel all right here tonight?\u201d Noah asked her. \u201cIf you\u2019d like me to, I can stay.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say George is leaving in the morning? You should be home tonight, Noah. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her gently forward and held her against him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a grueling day. You must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most important things are taken care of,\u201d she said, leaning her head against his shoulder. \u201cNoah, this could have been so much worse. At his worst, Arnie wasn\u2019t that scary.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cYou just have no idea how relieved I am that they\u2019re right next door to me, safe and asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Jo was a licensed foster parent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut it never occurred to me it could benefit us in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to lock your door tonight, Ellie....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe pull the trunk in front of it, or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d She laughed. \u201cTry not to wig out on me now. The lock is good and if I hear a sound, I\u2019ll call you. I\u2019ll call Nick and Jo, too. Do you think after Arnie struck out with the sheriff and highway patrol tonight, he\u2019d come around here and try something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI think he\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thinking about it, Noah, Arnie\u2019s nuts. I\u2019ll lock the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He ran a hand up and down her back. \u201cI\u2019m impressed, Ellie. It was an emotional, scary day, but you kept your head.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI came real close to losing it a couple of times. If you hadn\u2019t been there, who knows...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need to talk about before I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like the fact that Arnie told everyone at the bar that I was a stripper, that I was a hooker and drug addict?\u201d Ellie pulled back and looked up into his eyes. \u201cNoah, sometimes people are just waiting to believe the worst. I can\u2019t do anything about that. But the people who know me, the people who I consider my new friends, they know I\u2019m not like that. All I\u2019ve really cared about since the second I got here was getting my kids back. Arnie\u2019s just full of jealous shit, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cShit\u2019s not even on the cusp\u2014it\u2019s full-out swearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not in front of your church people or the kids and you\u2019re all grown up. Let\u2019s not worry about things we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly and her eyes grew round. \u201cOh, Noah, I\u2019m sorry! You must be worried about how this will look for you, starting a new church! It could be bad for you because you hired me and helped me so much.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAw, people have found plenty of reasons to judge me. I\u2019ve made a lot of waves in the church\u2014I\u2019ve got a rebellious nature. I can\u2019t worry about things like gossip. It would take precious time away from important work. No, I was only worried about how you were holding up under that slander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world could anyone say about you? You\u2019re the most Goody Two-shoes guy I\u2019ve ever been around. And for sure the most straitlaced guy I\u2019ve ever been involved with.\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cExcept for sex, but I won\u2019t tell. What could anyone be judgmental about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised. I hate my very well-known, saintly father. I was wild in my youth and wasn\u2019t even married in the church. There are about a hundred things I did before hiring a stripper as my assistant. And that turned out to be the smartest thing I ever did. Now, would you do something for me before I kiss you good-night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to look behind the shower curtain and under the bed. Then lock me out and put the trunk against the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, did you have monsters under the bed when you were little?\u201d</p><p>He touched her nose. \u201cNo. Because I checked.\u201d</p><p>It was the smell of coffee and the sound of shuffling coming from the RV\u2019s bedroom that first woke Noah early the next morning. Then it was a cold, wet nose right on his temple. Whoever made up that old wives\u2019 tale that if a dog\u2019s nose was wet and cold, it was healthy, would be pleased to know Lucy was fine. He sat up on the couch and threw the blanket back. Then he watched the coffeepot perk. He glanced at his watch: 5:30 a.m. \u201cWant a trip out back?\u201d he asked Lucy. She went straight for the door. Noah stood outside his RV in his boxers while Lucy had her morning constitutional.</p><p>When the coffee was done, he grabbed himself a cup and sat back down on the sofa, trying to get his morning bearings. George appeared in the bedroom doorway, dressed, perky and grinning.</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning,\u201d George said cheerfully.</p><p>Noah made a face. \u201cIf we had married, it wouldn\u2019t have worked,\u201d Noah grumbled. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name gets you up so damn early?\u201d</p><p>George laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is\u2014when I was younger, I liked sleeping through the sunrise, liked staying up late. Somewhere along the line, that changed. I might be a lot happier in the morning if someone didn\u2019t take up most of the bed,\u201d he said, peering at Lucy. \u201cWhy does she have to sleep across the bed?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSo tell me\u2014is everyone safe and sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d Noah said. Since George had been asleep when Noah got back from Ellie\u2019s the night before, he explained all about Jo showing up at the sheriff\u2019s department, Arnie following them, and all the rest of the drama from the night before. \u201cSo\u2014the best of a bad situation, the kids are in Jo\u2019s house and Ellie is able to see them all the time. And, better still, the Child Welfare worker isn\u2019t likely to let them go back to Arnie\u2019s house. The judge shouldn\u2019t have any excuse to undo this small victory, but I\u2019ll go ahead and cross my fingers on that. This is all good for Ellie, as long as Arnie doesn\u2019t try anything bizarre, or scary. She\u2019s going to lock her door and be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s all right?\u201d George asked while he poured himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, it\u2019s a miracle that nutcase didn\u2019t hurt her or the kids. He\u2019s off balance. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him, exactly. But he\u2019s one mixed-up dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Ellie and the kids are all right now,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be okay\u2014maybe more worried about the effect all those lies Arnie was spreading at Jack\u2019s will have on my reputation. And I could care less about that as long as I can take care of her and the kids.\u201d He smiled to himself. \u201cHercules Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. So, you\u2019re up at the crack of dawn, ready to head out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d George said. \u201cWhen\u2019s the church going to be ready?\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cSoon. It had better be\u2014we have a wedding coming up. Probably my debut and inauguration of the church. I\u2019m sure I could wrangle you an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great, Noah. Now, how about breakfast at Jack\u2019s? I don\u2019t feel like cooking for you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on. I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was up early, dressed and at Jo\u2019s back kitchen door before the kids were even awake. Ellie tapped very softly on the door, not wishing to disturb the house. Jo was up, however, having coffee in the kitchen while reading the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d see you bright and early,\u201d Jo said. \u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little too lightly,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cBut, there were no suspicious noises and I just couldn\u2019t wait to see the kids this morning. Is it okay? That I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than okay. Get yourself coffee and I\u2019ll go jostle them. They should get up for breakfast. I\u2019m going to drive Danielle over to Valley Elementary School and enroll her; I\u2019ll take Trevor along. I\u2019m going to make sure they know never to release her to her stepfather. There\u2019s a school bus, but until things are all calmed down, I\u2019ll drive her and pick her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you money for gas,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>Jo put a hand on Ellie\u2019s arm and looked into her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the least of our worries right now. Emergency foster care usually lasts forty-eight hours or less, but I suggest we leave things as they are until your hearing. With your consent, and if your lawyer doesn\u2019t protest, I think your caseworker would go along with that. For right now, let\u2019s just make sure they feel comfortable here, and that they can make this adjustment. I think the last couple of months have been real hard on them. I\u2019m going to see if I can line up some counseling for them through CWS. And how about you? Is there anything you need to help you cope?\u201d</p><p>Ellie actually got tears in her eyes. Since her grandmother, no one had ever worried about whether she was handling things all right. And she couldn\u2019t remember anyone ever asking whether she could use some professional help. There hadn\u2019t been any available, for that matter. Her load, always heavy, belonged to her alone. She hadn\u2019t thought there was another option.</p><p>Ellie put her hand against Jo\u2019s soft cheek and smiled just as a big fat tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I lied to you. About the club. About...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Jo said. \u201cFirst of all, you had to protect yourself and your kids. Second, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, working at that club. Let it go. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, that doesn\u2019t matter at all in how I feel about you. I care about you and the kids and it has nothing to do with your previous job. It has only to do with the kind of human being you are. Now\u2014should I line up some counseling for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellie sniffed back a tear. \u201cI have everything I need, Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, this is not a sacrifice for me,\u201d Jo said softly, pressing her own hand against Ellie\u2019s. \u201cThis makes me happy. I feel good with you and the kids around. I feel useful. Connected. Let\u2019s lean on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over that,\u201d Jo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Now, do you want to wake your kids or shall I?\u201d</p><p>Ellie pulled her hand back. \u201cNo, you do it. It\u2019s your house, you\u2019re their foster mother. I\u2019m right here if they ever need me, but I\u2019d like them to understand that you\u2019re calling the shots here. I want them to trust you. Like I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl,\u201d Jo whispered. \u201cIf I\u2019d actually had a daughter of my own, I doubt I could have brought one up so fine.\u201d</p><p>Ellie helped Jo with the breakfast, talked with Danielle about another new school and washed up the dishes while Jo helped them dress. All the kids had to wear were the clothes in their backpacks, so Jo decided that she would arrange to go to Arnie\u2019s house with an escort to pack up their belongings.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do about that?\u201d Ellie asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can give me his work phone number. And then, stay out of it. You really can\u2019t be involved with him at all, not in the least way. I\u2019ll make sure Nick comes home from work early to supervise the kids while I go over there. I\u2019ll take Nick\u2019s SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to come home early,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, you can be here with them whenever you want to be, as far as I\u2019m concerned, but you have to let me act as guardian for the moment. I can\u2019t rely on you to parent right now. Let\u2019s do this by the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Right,\u201d she relented. \u201cGet a very big escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done this before, sweetheart. It\u2019s been a while, but my foster kids tended to come from some very scary places. Usually with only the clothes on their backs.\u201d</p><p>That was a thought that stayed with Ellie as she went off to work at the church. She thought about her own kids, sure, but it weighed even more heavily on her mind that too many kids grew up hard. She\u2019d lived from hand to mouth with her grandmother, but they\u2019d always managed. She\u2019d had friends who hadn\u2019t managed as well, some of whom were in the system, but they hadn\u2019t had a Jo or a Nick. The ones she knew were placed in crowded homes where living was tough. It wasn\u2019t unusual for them to be tossed in with a group of kids with an established pecking order and have to defend themselves or suffer abuse from either other foster kids or even the parents. Foster care was a big, scary monster among her crowd while she was growing up.</p> <p>It was not a pretty, clean house like the Fitches\u2019, with an experienced, kind couple prepared to give their hearts as well as their space.</p><p>By the time she got to the church, Noah was waiting in his office and the construction crew was already starting to work. Noah stood and went to her immediately, giving her a brief embrace and kiss on the cheek. \u201cGood, you\u2019re all right. You must not have had any problems last night.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI bet you\u2019re glad you didn\u2019t hire Mrs. Nagel. Wouldn\u2019t she be a sourpuss to kiss? Everything is fine or I would have called you. What\u2019s on your schedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have calls to make. You?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss. But if it\u2019s no big deal, I\u2019d like to stay in town, in case Jo needs something to do with the kids. I think Vanni\u2019s doing fine with her babies, but I\u2019ll call her, explain what\u2019s going on and be sure she can do without me for a couple of days. I\u2019ll start painting your office if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe noise is going to make you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m about as crazy as I\u2019m going to get. Is George gone?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be back when the church is open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on then. Go do your pastor thing. I\u2019ll paint and answer the phone and be close by in case Jo needs me for the kids. She\u2019s not going to need me, though. She\u2019s got this situation wired\u2014she knows exactly what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that, kiddo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what a break it is\u2014having someone like her fill the bill. I don\u2019t think all the court motions in the world could have worked out better. Sometimes I end up being so goddamn lucky.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked up and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI guess you wouldn\u2019t have exactly put it like that, huh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He leaned forward and gave her cheek a kiss. \u201cNo, I might not have. But I know you didn\u2019t mean any disrespect. Remember, I\u2019m the guy who saw you on your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d\u2019a believed it would finally pay off, huh?\u201d She grinned widely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here before I do something crazy and get caught by a construction worker or something. I\u2019ll call to check in from time to time, make sure you\u2019re doing okay and there aren\u2019t any new developments. Call Brie first thing and ask for a restraining order. Arnie isn\u2019t worth trusting.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was back at the Fitch house before Jo had returned from fetching clothes for the kids from Arnie\u2019s. Nick was in charge. The kids were watching a little afternoon TV and he was in the kitchen. \u201cJo told me to get started on dinner. I\u2019m not trusted with anything more complicated than peeling potatoes and carrots,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to take over?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done here. I expect her any minute. And she said no more than an hour on the TV, so I have my eye on the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, this is wonderful of you\u2014watching out for my kids like this. I owe you an apology. That first day I met you, when I wanted to rent that room, I made some assumptions about you that were wrong. You haven\u2019t been anything but respectful to me. I\u2019m sorry I was so rude.\u201d</p><p>He stood at the sink, peeling carrots. He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cNo apology necessary, Ellie. Your assumption wasn\u2019t far off base. I\u2019ve done some real dumb-ass things in this little town. I should be the one to go around apologizing, not you. But you and your kids are completely safe here. I\u2019d never let anything happen to them. And, my God, it is good to see Jo so happy.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him and spoke to his back. \u201cThen why?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy did you get yourself that terrible reputation? I can tell you\u2019re crazy about Jo. You\u2019d be lost without her, I know you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And I don\u2019t know why. Lonely, maybe. Cross because I wasn\u2019t getting my way? A couple of times I thought maybe Jo would be jealous and\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s been a long time since I did anything as stupid as make a pass, and that\u2019s when I almost came up against Jack Sheridan. Whew,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThat was years ago, and if Mel hadn\u2019t put me straight right quick, Jack would have killed me. That was before they were together, you know. But Mel was already his woman in his eyes.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder again and smiled sheepishly at Ellie. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to know this, Ellie. Men can be very stupid.\u201d</p><p>She took another step toward him. She put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cNick, listen to me. Don\u2019t waste another minute. This thing with Jo has gone on too long. Fix it.\u201d</p><p>He looked down. \u201cI wish I knew how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk her forgiveness. Say you were stupid and wrong and that you need her. And, for gosh sakes, tell her how much you love her. It shows all over you when you\u2019re within ten feet of her. The two of you have already wasted so much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might not make any difference, you know. Jo might not want things back the way they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two choices, Nick. You can find out, or you can go on like this and never know.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, six-five or otherwise, and the only judge I know is my worst nightmare.\u201d</p><p>He grinned back. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Vanni was doing much better at keeping up with two little ones and a house, thanks to Ellie\u2019s help. She\u2019d even gotten pretty adept at putting two toddlers in car seats and carting them off for shopping errands. Her days were a bit more tiring, of course; there was no way to minimize the work involved, nor the amount of cleaning and laundry. And diapers? She was up to her eyeballs in diapers without the energy to begin potty training Matt. But Ellie promised to be back\u2014she had just needed two or three days in town so she could be available to her own kids. Just one day of help from Ellie would probably put Vanni right again.</p><p>Much of the time lately, when Vanni was in the same room, the kids were set free. If Vanni wasn\u2019t exactly doting on Hannah, little Matt certainly was. Hannah followed him around\u2014he, toddling; she, crawling at top speed and pulling herself up to a standing position on any piece of furniture that she could reach. Matt would bring her toys; she would offer hers to him. It was when Vanni noticed Hannah taking a couple of tentative steps from her spot leaning against the coffee table that Vanni realized she would be a year old in a month.</p><p>Her first birthday.</p><p>When Matt was taking first steps, Vanni and Paul and anyone else within shouting distance would be coaching him, reaching out hands for him, praising him, taking movies. But Hannah was doing it on her own.</p><p>Was this because she was the second child, or because she was Terri\u2019s child? Vanni asked herself.</p><p>When Matt was about to have his first birthday, Vanni and Paul and Walt were planning a wonderful big birthday celebration to include all their friends. But, with some shame, Vanni realized she was going to have to look at the documents that came along with Hannah to find out her exact date of birth.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Hannah said triumphantly. Then she went splat on her diaper-cushioned butt and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vanni said, smiling at her, \u201cyou\u2019re walking! Big girl!\u201d</p><p>Thankfully the doorbell interrupted her thoughts and she went to answer it. It was a UPS delivery, a very large box addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Haggerty. She signed for it and brought it into the great room where the children played. She put the box on the floor in front of the couch and sat down. \u201cWhat do you think we have?\u201d she said to the kids, who migrated nearer, curious. She opened the box and found a letter on the top of the Bubble Wrap. \u201cHmm, a surprise, I think,\u201d she said. She opened the letter and read:</p><p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Haggerty,</p><p>Mr. Hanson told me you hadn\u2019t made a decision about Hannah yet, but I thought maybe you could take care of these things. I have nowhere to store them and I don\u2019t want to lose track of them. They belong to Hannah. If you decide she\u2019s going to be adopted by someone else, please be sure her new family gets them. I\u2019m in a nursing home now, my MS is pretty serious, so the nurse is writing this for me. I know it\u2019s a lot to ask, since I haven\u2019t done anything to help out, but if you or her new family can ever work it out, I would sure love a chance to see Hannah.</p><p>Thank you for taking care of her.</p><p>Roberta Bradford</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Vanni whispered. She put the letter down and pulled aside the Bubble Wrap to reveal a box full of pictures. The one on top was an eight-by-ten framed picture of a baby that looked exactly like Hannah. She removed it and beneath it were a couple of shoe boxes full of snapshots. She fanned through a few and caught shots of Terri at a birthday party, Terri as a pudgy two-year-old in a bikini, grinning that big, huge-eyed grin, all dark curls. Terri with people Vanni would never know and Terri sitting on the same woman\u2019s lap a lot\u2014that must be her mother in younger, healthier times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beneath the shoe boxes, a treasure trove. While Hannah hung on her knees and Matt tried to grab at the things Vanni removed from the box, Vanni pulled out picture after picture\u2014school pictures, those cute toothless, pigtail pictures, pubescent shots of what Vanni had always referred to as the \u201cbig-teeth\u201d age. Terri in braces, Terri in dance class, Terri helping someone wash a car. And then there were prom pictures and winter-dance formals and the homecoming game with Terri right out in front, a trim and beautiful high school cheerleader who could not have imagined her life would be cut short at the age of thirty, leaving a baby behind.</p><p>Vanni tried looking through the pictures though her eyes clouded with tears. She simultaneously kept rescuing photos from Matt\u2019s eager little hands. Finally, frustrated, she leaned Hannah against the couch and picked Matt up. She found his favorite blanket with the satin binding and snuggled it to him, putting him down in the playpen. It wasn\u2019t exactly nap time, but when the blanket came out, it meant quiet time. He did a little insulted fussing before his thumb found his mouth and he nestled down.</p><p>She went back to the sofa and lifted Hannah onto her lap. She continued to sift through the pictures, showing them to Hannah, saying, \u201cHannah\u2019s mama, see?\u201d Hannah didn\u2019t grab or fuss, but leaned against Vanni and just looked as each picture was pulled out. And then there was a framed wedding picture. Terri had been married? Vanni didn\u2019t know that. Obviously she hadn\u2019t been married while Paul dated her, and if she\u2019d been married afterward, Hannah would have had a stepfather. She looked very young in the picture; she must have been divorced before Paul met her.</p> <p>There were several albums that Vanni pulled out and stacked on the couch, one of them a wedding album.</p><p>Beneath the albums was a smaller box. Inside, carefully preserved, were several items. A white, lacy christening gown wrapped in tissue paper, a silver cup and spoon, badly tarnished, a couple of rattles, a pink knitted baby sweater with a hood and matching mittens. And inside more tissue paper, a floppy, sorely used stuffed puppy with one eye. \u201cOh, Hannah,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cOh, Hannah, Mama\u2019s puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah-bah,\u201d Hannah said, hitting the stuffed toy.</p><p>\u201cSweet puppy,\u201d Vanni choked out, pressing the toy to Hannah and holding her tight. Vanni rocked Hannah back and forth, tears running down her cheeks.</p><p>Hannah settled back against Vanni and looked up at her face. She put a pudgy little hand against Vanni\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cMama.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my little angel,\u201d Vanni said with a sniff. \u201cI\u2019m going to be your mama. Yes. Mama loves you.\u201d</p><p>By the time Vanni had given the kids lunch and settled them in their cribs for afternoon naps, she had everything from that box spread across the dining-room table. Then she called Jack. \u201cCan you give me Rick Sudder\u2019s phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said in some confusion. \u201cYou all right, Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay\u2014it\u2019s just real important that I talk to him right away and I don\u2019t know when he works or goes to school, or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he and Liz just moved into their own place in Eureka near the college. It\u2019s a little dump, but they think it\u2019s the frickin\u2019 Taj Mahal. He has classes three days a week, works for Paul on Tuesdays and Thursdays and some Saturdays, so he\u2019d be in Eureka today. I have no idea of his class schedule and I don\u2019t know if they have an answering machine. Here\u2019s the apartment number,\u201d he said, reeling it off. \u201cBut, hey\u2014he\u2019s got that cell phone I gave him when he was in the hospital. He gets no reception in Virgin River, but it works fine in Eureka. Whether he carries it or stuffed it in the back of some drawer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. Here\u2019s the number,\u201d he said, reciting it. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay, Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Vanni immediately dialed the apartment number and of course, there was no answer and no machine. Then she tried the cell phone and it went directly to voice mail. \u201cRick, it\u2019s Vanni Haggerty. God, I hope you actually carry that cell phone so you get this message. I really need to talk to you the second you get this. Nothing\u2019s wrong, Rick, but it\u2019s real important. Please call.\u201d</p><p>While Vanni waited, she continued looking through the dozens of snapshots and pictures. She had put Hannah to bed with the stuffed puppy. If she didn\u2019t hear from Rick by early evening, she would call his grandmother, Lydie Sudder. But really she\u2019d rather\u2014</p><p>The phone rang and she grabbed for it. \u201cHi, Vanni, it\u2019s Rick. Is everything okay? You sounded a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaked out?\u201d she asked with a nervous laugh. \u201cRick, you know we have Hannah with us now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, yeah. Paul said he was living in some kind of day-care center.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but there were tears in her throat. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a true statement. Listen, Rick, I hope this doesn\u2019t make you uncomfortable, but there aren\u2019t too many people I can ask. I know your parents were killed when you were really young...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCar accident,\u201d he said. \u201cI was two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Hannah\u2019s mother, but she\u2019s not even a year yet. What I want to know\u2014did you cry for your parents? Did you grieve? Did you miss them? Want them? Feel like something was missing out of your life?\u201d</p><p>Silence answered her while he thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I cried for them when my grandma first brought me home to Virgin River\u2014you\u2019d have to ask her. But growing up? Vanni, I don\u2019t remember them at all. Sometimes, when I look at the old pictures, I think I remember them a little bit, but really, I don\u2019t have a single true memory of them. I hate that.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBut how could you help it? If you can\u2019t remember, you can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of questions, growing up. And I had some pictures. Not a lot of pictures. First of all, my gram didn\u2019t take a lot of pictures of my dad when he was growing up. They were kind of poor, picture taking wasn\u2019t a big thing. My mom had hardly any family\u2014her folks died when she was real young, and no one knows what happened to pictures of her, if there were any. But there were pictures of them with me when I was a baby, and I had my gram to answer questions about my dad\u2019s growing-up years. And she said they were real in love and happy to be having a baby.\u201d</p><p>Terri wanted her baby, Vanni remembered. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what Hannah will need,\u201d she said, almost more to herself than to Rick.</p><p>\u201cShe doing okay?\u201d Rick asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing great. She has no idea all she lost,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s one thing I remember from growing up. My gram was so great to me\u2014I couldn\u2019t ask for more. I never knew my grandpa, but my gram took good care of me. And I had Jack. Then Preacher. But there was one thing...I always wished I could have had a mom and a dad, like other kids. You know\u2014a regular family. But, hey, accidents happen to families. I had the next best thing. I have to say, there wasn\u2019t anything about my growing up I\u2019d call bad. But a regular family...That would have been good.\u201d</p><p>What if Paul and I were killed in an accident like Rick\u2019s parents? Like Terri Bradford had been? Who would take care of little Matt? Matt was luckier than Hannah\u2014his paternal grandparents were alive and well, Vanni\u2019s father a young sixty-two and her brother, Tom, twelve years younger and devoted to Mattie. Paul\u2019s parents and brothers considered Mattie their own. There were many people to keep Mattie\u2019s parents alive for him, to assure him he was loved and wanted, to be sure he knew the details of his ancestry.</p><p>Vanni was quiet for a minute. Then she said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a regular family. A ton of pictures of her mom and details about her life, her family, so she knows what she needs to know about herself.\u201d And she will never doubt, Vanni vowed, that she has a loving home.</p><p>Paul should have shot straight home after he was finished supervising work on the church, but, gee\u2014Jack\u2019s Bar was right there. He knew that Ellie had family stuff going on and hadn\u2019t been to his house to help Vanni and, frankly, his house with a tired wife and two wild little kids wasn\u2019t exactly a relaxing place most days. So he clapped Noah on the back and said, \u201cLet me buy you a beer, pal. I need one and it probably wouldn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t kill me, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>They walked out of the church and across the street and Paul said, \u201cSo, there was a big deal going on at Jack\u2019s last night and I missed the whole thing. Ellie\u2019s ex showed up and spewed a whole lot of bad trash about her being a stripper and stuff, and the whole thing ended with her kids living with Jo and Nick Fitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all that already?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I could\u2019ve found out from Jack, but I was still home this morning when Ellie called Vanni. That true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThe kids are with Jo and Nick now?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d Noah said. \u201cTurns out Jo and Nick are certified foster parents, though they haven\u2019t had any kids in a few years. And the social worker from Child Welfare was up a creek\u2014had a court order saying the kids were to be with the stepfather, and that turned out to be a bad choice. So it was a solution. And a good one for Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. And it\u2019s true? She\u2019s a stripper?\u201d</p><p>Noah stopped walking and looked at Paul. \u201cNo. She\u2019s a pastor\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Paul said, losing that boyish grin the second he saw the angry tic in Noah\u2019s jaw. \u201cOkay, my bad. That wouldn\u2019t do so much for you. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Noah started walking again. \u201cSure makes life interesting, though,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all this has made Ellie\u2019s life a challenge, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all that other stuff? Vanni says that other things he said\u2014like about drugs and stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a kernel of truth to it,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Both men walked up to the bar and Jack was right there. \u201cPaul,\u201d Jack said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on out at your place?\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged and shook his head. \u201cSame old stuff, far as I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni called here earlier. She was looking for Rick\u2019s phone number and she sounded a little...frazzled or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick\u2019s number? Why?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say, just that it was important and she was in a big hurry. I asked her if she was all right and she said she\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>Paul turned questioning eyes to Noah. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t have the first idea,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t think about it long. He turned on his heel and without saying goodbye, he darted out of the bar, jumped in his truck and drove home. All the way there he was saying to himself, Please let it not be any more nuts than usual.</p><p>When he walked into the house, he could hear Vanni talking to the kids in the kitchen and the sound of little fists and little spoons banging on high-chair trays. There was a huge mess scattered around the dining room. A box sat beside the table and there were smaller boxes and pictures and stuff everywhere. And of course the great room was strewn with baby gear and toys. On some bizarre instinct, he peeked into the master bedroom. He saw a couple of suitcases on the bed. And he thought, This isn\u2019t happening to me.</p><p>He went to the kitchen. \u201cHi, honey,\u201d he said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Paul, you\u2019re home!\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t look as though she was leaving him.</p><p>\u201cHave you been cleaning out closets or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Will you turn on the oven, please? Three-fifty. I\u2019ve got a frozen lasagna to put in there. I hope you\u2019re not starving, because I\u2019ve been really busy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned on the oven. \u201cVanni, are you leaving me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cFor a few days. I\u2019m taking the kids to Grants Pass. I\u2019ve already talked to your mom and she\u2019s going to help me with them and watch Matt for me. I could\u2019ve called the Rutledges,\u201d she said, speaking of little Matt\u2019s biological grandparents. \u201cBut frankly, I\u2019m not up to explaining Hannah to Carol just now. What I have to do is take Hannah to see her grandmother\u2014I don\u2019t know how sick she is. What if she doesn\u2019t have long to live? What if I miss a chance to ask her questions about Hannah\u2019s mother? There are things Hannah is going to need to know.\u201d Vanni was rambling, talking more to herself than to Paul, it seemed. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be family Terri was close to while growing up. I don\u2019t dare waste a second. I\u2019m afraid to even wait till the weekend. I\u2019m going to pack tonight after the kids are in bed and leave right after breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Paul was really sorry he hadn\u2019t had that beer. It felt as if the ground was moving under his feet, things were shifting so quickly. He reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a bottled beer, popped the top and sat down at the kitchen table. Vanni was trying to referee dinner, two kids in two high chairs with Matt pretty adept at getting the food from his bowl to his mouth, while Hannah was just barely getting the occasional spoonful there. Her hands sure worked good, though.</p> <p>\u201cHannah took steps today, Paul. All by herself. Didn\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d she said to the baby. \u201cSuch a big girl.\u201d Then to Paul, \u201cHer first birthday is coming up in just a month and we haven\u2019t even talked about it. I got the digital camera out and took a few shots of her standing, but I want a movie camera. Right away. The digital will do a two-minute movie and that\u2019s not good enough. I don\u2019t care what usually happens\u2014the second child in this house isn\u2019t going to have an invisible childhood just because I\u2019m really busy. Maybe I\u2019ll pick one up on my way into Grants Pass so I can get some movies of Hannah with her grandma.\u201d</p><p>Paul took a big slug of beer. Then he said, \u201cUm, Vanni? I\u2019m a little behind here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling. My head is spinning. I\u2019ve been thinking so hard today, about everything. Hannah\u2019s grandma, Terri\u2019s mom, sent a big box full of memorabilia. Pictures of Terri, her cup and spoon, her stuffed puppy...Terri\u2019s whole life fit in a box and her mother\u2019s very sick with MS. I need to bring Hannah to see her right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack said you were trying to find Rick today....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Uh-huh. I had to find out from Rick how he felt growing up, with his parents gone since he was a baby. He said he had his grandma to answer his questions about his mom and dad. If I don\u2019t find out as much as I can about Terri while her mother is able to tell me, I won\u2019t be able to answer Hannah\u2019s questions when she\u2019s older.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Paul said dumbly, thunderstruck and afraid to ask anything more.</p><p>\u201cI asked Rick if he felt he missed out on anything and he said, not really\u2014his grandma was great. But there was one thing he said\u2014it would have been nice to have had a regular family. A mom and a dad. Paul, I want Hannah to have a mom and a dad who love her. I have to get to work on that!\u201d</p><p>Paul felt his eyes sting. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping her?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAs my friend Ellie would say, you\u2019re damn skippy.\u201d</p><p>Paul swallowed hard, afraid he might burst into tears. He took a drink of his beer and set it down. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll take a couple of days off, take you to Grants Pass...\u201d</p><p>She focused on Paul. \u201cAre you sure? I know you need to work. You have so many projects. And if we\u2019re going to have a houseful of kids, you\u2019re going to have to make a decent living.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dan Brady,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe loves it when I leave him in charge. I don\u2019t want you to have to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Vanni got a little teary. \u201cI looked through those pictures, Paul. And I realized that if I didn\u2019t act soon, a real important part of Hannah\u2019s babyhood could be lost. I don\u2019t want her to have one month of her life without a mom and dad who adore her. While we\u2019re in Grants Pass, we should give Mr. Hanson a call and tell him to get our paperwork going. Unless you have reservations.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good with the idea. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a lot of things to consider. But I thought about it just a little too long. Hannah calls me Mama. And she is not going to lose another mama. Not this precious girl. We need to get on the road first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed down his emotion. \u201cSure. Of course.\u201d Filled with relief, his heart bursting with pride in his wife, with respect for her generosity and compassion, all he could do was get up from his chair and put a soft kiss on her brow. \u201cWant me to do baths while you cook lasagna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd please, don\u2019t forget the hard-to-get places\u2014neck wrinkles, backs of ears, between toes. Your mother checks those things.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little emotionally. \u201cShe does, huh?\u201d And he thought how lucky he was to have a mom like that. And now both Hannah and Matt would have one like that, too. Fussy. Committed.</p><p>Noah was researching Arnold Gunterson again. Besides his age and current address the only thing Ellie could tell him was that Arnie said he grew up in Southern California. Noah found nothing to match. Nothing anywhere. In fact, his house was owned by a woman\u2014he must be renting it. Noah even bit the bullet and plunked down a credit-card number to a couple of online-search companies and there was still nothing. Funny enough, he could look himself and George up on Google and get way too much information on a couple of relatively dull Presbyterian ministers.</p> <p>Yet the only thing he could find on Arnold Gunterson was his marriage to and divorce from Ellie Baldwin, which was less than two years old. He wasn\u2019t even pulling up Arnie\u2019s current address or place of employment. And the Brightway Private Elementary School gave the bios for the board of directors, but only the names of the teaching staff and director.</p><p>There was something so eerie and sinister about those locks on the outside of the door, about the way he\u2019d followed them, about his threats. Noah had a gut feeling there was a lot more to Arnie than met the eye. Upon researching, there was in fact less information than he expected.</p><p>But\u2014as the principal of a private elementary school, there would have to be information available to the parents of prospective students, not to mention fingerprinting, which was required in almost all states. He would have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9; he would list his credentials and the universities from which he received them. There would probably be framed degrees on the walls and a packet of information for prospective students and their parents that outlined policies. Clearly, Arnold would not happily give any information to someone like Noah or Brie. Nor could Mel or Jack, Jo or Nick, or anyone who Arnold might have seen before visit the school and inquire.</p><p>Noah knew he needed more information.</p><p>He decided to get a few chores done to keep his hands busy while he was thinking. That old faded blue pickup he drove had been misfiring and sputtering a bit lately, so he went outside and got under the hood. Before long he found himself changing the points and plugs, cleaning off the battery, adding water to the radiator.</p><p>Jack wandered out of the bar and, as men will do, got his head under the hood, as well, lending a hand. While this was going on, Noah was thinking out loud, complaining about the lack of information he had on Arnold Gunterson and his inability to think of a way to get more.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Jack finally said. \u201cI know someone Arnold hasn\u2019t seen before, and they happen to have an elementary-school-aged son.\u201d</p><p>Before the afternoon was over Jack and Noah were talking to John and Paige Middleton about visiting a private school in Redway to discuss enrolling their son, Christopher. And to see what they could learn about the school and its director.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>It seemed to Ellie that people were just a bit uncomfortable around her, as if they\u2019d love to ask for the details about all that trash Arnie had spewed. Of course, she had explained to Vanessa and Jo Ellen immediately what parts were true, and what were just malicious attempts to make her look horrible. It was the vast number of people she didn\u2019t know well that she imagined were looking at her strangely. Perhaps judgmentally. Perhaps thinking less of Noah because of her. There wasn\u2019t much she could do about it, but it bothered her.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for that nagging worry, Ellie wouldn\u2019t have a care in the world. She went home from her work at the church, showered off the paint and grime, and went to Jo\u2019s to be with her kids. They were sitting at the kitchen table while Jo prepared dinner. Jo was asking Danielle spelling words for her upcoming test and Trevor was coloring.</p><p>\u201cCan I help, Jo?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter we finish our spelling, you can set the table. Danielle will help. Danielle, tell Mommy about your school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, Mama,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wish I could ride the bus, but Jo said not till we get more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have to agree with that,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cDid you like the teacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Mrs. Spencer, and she\u2019s not even as old as you, Mama. And guess what? She says I\u2019m a little bit ahead in the class. I took a couple of tests for her and she was very happy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Did you make any friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the hello-goodbye friends. You know\u2014the kind who are nice to you, but they have other, better friends. I kind of had to eat my lunch alone.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s heart ached. \u201cKind of?\u201d she asked. She noticed that Jo smiled over her shoulder at Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI went to a table by myself and then some other kids sat there, too. Except they were already together. So I was with them, but by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow Danielle is going to take some extra cookies in her lunch,\u201d Jo said. \u201cSometimes if you have something to share, it gets conversation going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one boy in my class who\u2019s in trouble all the time. I think he\u2019s one of them hyperactive boys. He sits in the hall a lot when he makes Mrs. Spencer\u2019s head hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that? That he\u2019s hyperactive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Spencer said, \u2018Joshua, did your mother remember your medicine this morning?\u2019 and he said he wasn\u2019t sure. And, Mama, he\u2019s a wiggle worm and he makes a mess and picks his boogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cGoodness.\u201d She saw Jo\u2019s shoulders shake with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sit by him,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cBut I like Mrs. Spencer. Mama, do you think I\u2019ll be in that class very long?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, Ellie thought. She\u2019s already worrying about moving again. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honey. We\u2019re going to have to take it one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanielle, help your mother set the table and we\u2019ll run through the spelling words one more time before bed,\u201d Jo said. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, putting her notebook aside.</p><p>\u201cSet the table for five,\u201d Jo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just eat in the kitchen tonight. And remember place mats.\u201d</p><p>When dinner was done, Ellie got her kids ready for bed, then went back to the kitchen to help clean up dishes. Then back to the bathrooms to make sure they were cleaned up, tubs scoured, sinks wiped out, towels hung. And before long the house had quieted down, with only the sound of the TV in Nick\u2019s den.</p><p>Jo came back to the kitchen after kisses good-night and got down a couple of mugs. \u201cWill a cup of coffee keep you up?\u201d she asked Ellie.</p><p>\u201cNot if I just stick to one,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s talk. I can feel the rough edges, Ellie. You\u2019re worried about taking advantage of me, about eating my food and straining the space in my house. I want you to let that go. I asked for this arrangement because, selfishly, all my life I have wanted to have family around. And even though we\u2019re not related by blood, we\u2019ve become good friends. Please, don\u2019t be in a hurry to leave as some favor to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be resolved soon, Jo. The judge isn\u2019t going to have any excuse to keep me from having custody...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jo said. \u201cBut nothing has to change, Ellie. Even Nick is happy with our situation. Can\u2019t you tell? I\u2019m certainly not going to pressure you to stay\u2014it\u2019s your life and your family. But, if you\u2019re okay with this\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJo, I can\u2019t let you feed us, shelter us, drive my kids around forever. It would be irresponsible of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jo said. \u201cPay your rent on time. Go to the grocery store sometimes. Help with chores, just like you\u2019ve been doing. Earn your keep. But what we have here is a safe environment for you and the kids, comfortable living conditions, and you even have a little privacy with that room over the garage\u2014a single woman your age should have a little privacy now and then. Ellie, you\u2019re not a burden. You fill a place in my life that\u2019s been empty for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we can\u2019t live like this forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf things work out for you, even if you don\u2019t live in my house, we might be in the same town for a long time. I might be able to meet the school bus while you\u2019re working. We might shop together, have tea on the porch, and I\u2019d love to teach you to quilt, if you\u2019re interested. My mother was a master quilter. And have you ever canned? Because the fruits and vegetables from the farmers\u2019 markets and roadside stands in this part of the country are just incredible. I\u2019ll show you how. Oh!\u201d Jo said, noticing a tear on Ellie\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m being too pushy, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Ellie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cI think you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. At least since my gramma...\u201d</p> <p>Jo shrugged. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re my only shot at something that resembles a daughter and grandchildren. And I intend to nurture the opportunity. I\u2019m just saying\u2014this is your home for as long as you want it.\u201d</p><p>Ellie hugged Jo good-night at the front door and went to her room\u2014the room she loved. She took a book with her\u2014a romance novel that Jo thought she might enjoy. She put on her comfy boxers and T-shirt, propped herself up in her double bed with the firm mattress and read for a couple of hours, feeling completely decadent and self-indulgent. And relaxed.</p><p>There was a soft knock at the door and she glanced at the time on the bedside clock radio; it was after ten. She opened the door and smiled at Noah.</p><p>\u201cNever do that again,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know how far we can trust Arnold.\u201d And then he brushed past her to enter.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was you, Noah,\u201d she said, closing the door. \u201cI could hear Lucy panting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you knew it was me. It could have been Arnold panting. I don\u2019t think it would take much to say, \u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 before you open the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she said, smiling. Lucy made herself comfortable at the foot of the bed on the corner of the area rug. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Noah?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou going to make me say it?\u201d he asked, and couldn\u2019t suppress a smile against her lips. \u201cI\u2019m here to make that kind of love you like, when it\u2019s a little wild and out of control, which is just how I feel when I\u2019m close to you. Out of control. Desperate. Famished. Starving for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said in a breath, her eyelids dropping closed. She leaned into him. \u201cOnly if you have protection....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart. I wouldn\u2019t put you at risk.\u201d He kissed her deeply, licking her lips apart to let him inside. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you on the pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Because I gave up men....\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, low in his throat. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fine until you. You\u2019ve messed up a lot of my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou played hell on mine, too,\u201d he groaned, lifting her T-shirt over her head, tossing it and steering her toward the bed. He eased her back and kneeled over her, kicking off his shoes and tugging at her boxers. She didn\u2019t even think about resisting him, but rather lifted her hips so he could slide them down. \u201cI guess we both have to be flexible.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at him, reaching for him. \u201cFlexible? Come here. I just can\u2019t resist you.\u201d She pulled him down and tugged his shirt out of his trousers and he finished the job, tossing it aside. Her hands were on his belt buckle. Then the button. Then the zipper. Then inside, causing him to draw in his breath sharply.</p><p>As her hands ran down his hips, pushing his pants down so he could kick them free, he fell on her, taking her mouth almost savagely. \u201cYou. Taste. Wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best thing about going crazy wanting you is the way you want me right back. This feels so right...\u201d He scrambled through his pants pockets for a condom. \u201cI crave you, and I love the feeling.\u201d And that fast, he was inside her, buried deep in her, moaning with the pleasure it gave him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He was utterly still. Even his breathing stopped for a moment. He knew he was unresponsive for too long, then he gently lowered his lips to hers and in a solemn whisper he said, \u201cI love you, too, with my whole heart. I wondered if you were ever going to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if loving me is one of your smarter moves,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s like trouble follows me wherever I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, Ellie. From now on, it\u2019ll only be the good stuff. For the rest of our lives together, only the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019ll try to concentrate on good stuff for one more day, maybe one more week. I\u2019m afraid to think any further ahead than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but I want you to know that I\u2019m thinking lots further. And, honey, I don\u2019t see any dark clouds. Maybe pretty soon you\u2019ll forget to be afraid....\u201d</p><p>She smiled and pulled his lips back down to hers, wrapped her legs around his waist and moved against him in a powerful way that had him gasping for breath and groaning with desire. Her eyes were opened enough to watch the clenching of his jaw as he held himself back, waiting for her. And the wait was not long; she exploded into pleasure so blinding, her back arched beneath him and she threw her head back, baring her throat.</p><p>He put soft kisses on her neck and shoulder while she shuddered. And then, his movements slow and luxurious, he joined her. And then he stayed with her until the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>Once Vanessa and Paul got to Grants Pass and could leave little Matt with Paul\u2019s mom, they were off to the nursing home. Vanessa put Hannah\u2019s cutest outfit on her along with her new high-top sneakers\u2014good ballast for those early steps. When they got to the nursing home, they left the box of pictures in the car. Vanni carried Hannah on her hip. Hannah clutched the stuffed puppy that had been Terri\u2019s. Vanni, a woman on a mission, went directly to the receptionist and asked if someone could direct her to Roberta Bradford. A nurse\u2019s aide was called to the front and when she arrived, she reached a hand out to shake Vanni\u2019s. \u201cThis is a good thing you\u2019re doing, Mr. and Mrs. Haggerty,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHannah and her grandmother need this time,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d the aide replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been so concerned about her since the loss of her daughter. Come with me. She\u2019s been waiting in the lunchroom.\u201d</p><p>Vanni followed along. There were a few elderly people playing cards, some watching soap operas on TV. Over by the window, in a wheelchair, was an attractive woman in her midsixties; she looked across the room at them.</p><p>Vanni walked toward Roberta, Paul following closely. When she was right in front of her, Vanni said, \u201cMrs. Bradford?\u201d</p><p>A couple of large tears ran under her thick glasses and down her cheeks. She reached trembling hands toward them and said in a soft voice, \u201cMy God, thank you for bringing her. It\u2019s like a trip into the past. Hannah looks just like her. My sweet little Terri.\u201d</p><p>And Vanni was reminded, not for the first time, that the loss of a child is probably the most brutal loss of all, no matter that child\u2019s age.</p><p>A couple of days later when Noah went to the bar for breakfast, Paige came out from the kitchen with a file folder containing some papers. It contained information from her visit with Arnold Gunterson at the private elementary school. \u201cI found him likable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a guy who padlocked his unsupervised children into a house and I found him likable? What\u2019s going on with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot only the padlock deal, but he followed Ellie and I at a deadly pace\u2014we were in her little PT Cruiser and he was in a huge, black SUV with darkened windows. There were only inches between us. No telling what he\u2019s capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scariest thing is, I\u2019d put my son in his school in a second. The only good news is, John didn\u2019t like him, almost on sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThe handshake, he said. First of all, it was too firm, and second, it was a politician\u2019s shake\u2014Gunterson used two hands and squeezed John\u2019s hand real hard. Who would dare do that to John? What if he squeezed back? And John said that while Gunterson smiled, his pupils shrank to pinpoints. So, look through this stuff. It\u2019s all yours. I hope it tells you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Paige. We have to figure this out, get ahead of him, for Ellie\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me Ellie said he came from Southern California?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not this Arnold Gunterson. He came from Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaine?\u201d Noah repeated. \u201cMaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paige said. \u201cThink he could\u2019ve gotten any farther from home? You know, every time I hear some news story about a creep who\u2019s hurt or molested a kid, he or she\u2019s in a position to work with kids and they were supposed to be fingerprinted, but they weren\u2019t. Do you think maybe it\u2019s possible that this guy should have been checked out and wasn\u2019t? Because he can be convincing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into that,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cWell, go get \u2019em, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Noah looked at his watch\u2014it was only noon, which meant 3:00 p.m. on the East Coast. He looked through Paige\u2019s collected papers and notes. Then he called the private university in Maine where Arnold Gunterson had obtained his degree in early-childhood education. He was directed to the office of the dean.</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is Reverend Noah Kincaid of the Virgin River Presbyterian Church in California. I\u2019m looking at a private elementary school in Redway, California, for some children in our church, and the director and principal is a graduate of your college. I just want to verify that, if it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble at all, Reverend,\u201d the woman on the line said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small school. The name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan by the name of Arnold Gunterson,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s a graduate with an advanced degree in clinical psychology. He specializes in children\u2019s art psychology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou looked that up fast.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you must have the wrong Arnold Gunterson. Dr. Gunterson is still here, teaching.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah felt ice dash through his veins. \u201cWill you check and see if there was, by chance, another Arnold Gunterson who graduated with a degree in early-childhood education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Gunterson is an old friend, Reverend. I\u2019d know if there had been another student in his field with his name. Did the man you\u2019re researching graduate more than thirty years ago? Because that\u2019s how long I\u2019ve been here, as well as Dr. Gunterson. We\u2019re both sixty-two and I\u2019m thinking of retirement, but he\u2019ll never stop. Now, who is this man?\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cObviously not who I think he is. You might want to give my number to Dr. Gunterson and have him call me. He might be the victim of identity theft.\u201d</p> <p>While he waited for a call back, Noah did an Internet search of a couple of the private schools Arnie had listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and found that they\u2019d closed. One of them was an Arizona school and there was an article in an Arizona newspaper archives online. Small private schools are very hard to keep going. A regular infusion of money was required\u2014high tuition, lots of fund-raising and often corporate sponsors. There was no shame in having worked for an accredited private school that couldn\u2019t keep the doors open. And this particular Arizona school had a successful fifteen-year history. And no one around to answer questions about teachers who had worked there years ago.</p><p>Could Arnie have convinced the current board of this new school of his positive role at the old school and his grief over its closure?</p><p>Noah immediately told Ellie what he\u2019d learned\u2014or not learned\u2014about Arnold Gunterson. That night after her kids were tucked in at Jo\u2019s, he showed up at her apartment with Lucy in tow, as usual. She was confused by his information, but not surprised. Of course, after the things Arnie had done, it hadn\u2019t come as a shock that he was a liar. \u201cBut why?\u201d she asked Noah. \u201cWhat does he hope to get by doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innocence in this, Ellie. There\u2019s no reason to take on a false identity without a motive. We\u2019ll take this information to Brie at once. You have to tell Jo and Nick and be extra careful until the facts are in. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf he calls you or comes around here, get away from him fast and don\u2019t tell him what you\u2019ve found out,\u201d Noah said. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet on it. The shitbag,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, there was another swearword, not even on the cusp, even though he is definitely a shitbag.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve just about had it with me, huh?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with you, all right. And not enough of it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Noah,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think you\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to spend the night with you, but I don\u2019t have to. If you\u2019d rather be alone....\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and snuggled into his embrace. \u201cI love it when you stay, but I think you\u2019d better go. I feel like I\u2019m playing with fire every time I let you talk me into bed. I don\u2019t want to become too dependent on you. And I don\u2019t want the whole town to know we\u2019re sleeping together. I have children to think about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you cutting me off?\u201d he asked nervously.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cDid you just whine?\u201d She chuckled at him. \u201cNoah, much as I love cuddling up to you, I don\u2019t want your new town, your future congregation, to think the worst of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. I think I\u2019d get a standing ovation for finding you. But, to ease your mind and your reputation, I\u2019ll be very discreet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about half the problem...There are also children to think about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be very cautious there, sweetheart. They\u2019re your top priority, which makes them mine also.\u201d</p><p>Then he pulled out his secret weapon. He kissed her. Hard and deep. He pulled her against him and it took her less than fifteen seconds to melt into him and fully enjoy his arousal. When he released her lips, she said, \u201cYou are a very bad boy and no one with an ounce of sanity would take you for a minister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I be taken for a man who wants the woman he loves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you qualify,\u201d she said. She melted to him again. And he stayed. Again.</p> <p>Brie Valenzuela listened very patiently while Noah laid out what he\u2019d learned about Arnold Gunterson, Ellie with him while he did so. Brie asked for the pages he held. When he was finished, she asked, \u201cHave you heard from Dr. Gunterson in Maine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to him early this morning. He took a year\u2019s sabbatical to research and finish his dissertation right about the time Arnie was settling into his new school, so if anyone from the school board tried to check his credentials, they would only learn that he was a graduate working on his Ph.D. Dr. Gunterson can\u2019t imagine who would do something like this to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Gunterson,\u201d Brie said. \u201cNow, listen. No more amateur sleuthing. Stay away from Arnie and his school, keep the kids away from him. If you see him around here, call me at once. I\u2019ll take it from here. I\u2019ve already filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. I\u2019m going to talk to the district attorney about this, but more importantly, I\u2019m going to ask Mike to speak to the sheriff about a possible fraud and identity theft.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I want from you, Ellie. Vanessa is out of town with the little ones right now, but she\u2019ll be back next week. I want you to pay a call on her and ask her a favor. Ask her to dress you for court. Borrow something from her, something conservative and appealing, and be ready. Vanni will know exactly what to do\u2014she\u2019s the best. And you two are almost the same size.</p><p>\u201cBeyond that, stay alert and cautious. And hear me when I say this\u2014no more investigating. If you make one little slip, he might find out what you\u2019re doing and it could spoil everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoil what?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are very few reasons for identity theft, Ellie. One is to profit from the victim\u2019s bank accounts. The other is to hide who you really are because who you really are is not lawful. Since Dr. Gunterson never suspected his identity was borrowed, I assume there was no theft. I bet our Arnie has priors. He\u2019s done something wrong somewhere and needs to be someone else. And if he\u2019s hiding, he\u2019s probably hiding from the police. And if he\u2019s hiding from the police, there are probably warrants. And if there are warrants, I believe it would serve our purpose to let him be arrested.\u201d Brie lifted an eyebrow. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI should have known. If he\u2019s nothing but a criminal, shouldn\u2019t I have known?\u201d</p><p>Brie shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that one for you, Ellie. I spent years in the district attorney\u2019s office in Sacramento, prosecuting crimes like this. I met a lot of very intelligent women who were victimized by manipulative men, as well as perfectly sharp men taken for a wild ride by clever, dishonest women. It\u2019s a con, and you were at a vulnerable time in your life. Cons can smell that a mile away. Sadly, it\u2019s common in the world of criminal law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get beyond this?\u201d Ellie asked. \u201cI can\u2019t even think about my kids dealing with this in the years to come!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, if we get law enforcement help in handling this, we have a good shot at resolving the situation. If you see him or hear from him, call me at once. I\u2019ll give you the house number.\u201d She leaned over her desk and scribbled on the back of a business card. \u201cI wrote down Mike\u2019s pager number, as well. Your next call is 911. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Ellie took the card.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Brie said, relaxing visibly. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a church to finish, and a wedding to organize for Shelby and Luke? All sorts of really important things to get done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Ellie said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThen do them. If I learn anything at all about your ex-husband, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou just have to hunker down for a little while longer. I\u2019ll do everything I can think of to get this business behind you.\u201d</p><p>By the time the weekend arrived, Vanessa, Paul and the kids had been in Grants Pass for three days. While Vanni had daily visits with Roberta Bradford at the nursing home, Paul spent a lot of time with his father and brothers at the corporate headquarters of Haggerty Construction. Additionally, they had a couple of meetings with Scott Hanson about adoption. That legal transaction was typically an expensive affair, but because Terri Bradford had worked for Scott and because the Hanson family happened to be quite fond of little Hannah, they were getting a good deal. The Haggertys would be charged just the filing costs. And the Hansons asked to see Hannah whenever it was convenient.</p><p>The good news was that Roberta Bradford was not lingering at death\u2019s door. She was disabled and her condition would not improve, but if she could avoid illness and infections, she\u2019d be around awhile. Long enough to have many visits with her granddaughter and supply information about their family.</p><p>Paul had spent most of the day out with his brothers, looking over some of their building projects, and when he went back to his mother\u2019s house he found her in the kitchen, kneading dough.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d she said, lifting her flour-covered hands. \u201cBe very quiet. Vanessa and the babies are exhausted. All this running around, visiting, working things out...they\u2019re shot. They\u2019re napping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re baking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bake off stress,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the weather turned cool at last\u2014I love it when the leaves have turned and I can use the oven and fireplace again. It\u2019s been just beautiful here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stress are you baking off?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave we been too much for you this visit? Two little kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, I love having the babies,\u201d she said, kneading. \u201cI just want everything to go smoothly for you and Vanni, and for the children. I want Hannah to be content. And...\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cAnd I want you to get one of your own, like you and Vanni were planning, and yet I don\u2019t want Vanni to be overwhelmed. This thing you\u2019ve taken on\u2014it\u2019s a huge undertaking. And I\u2019m so proud of you both.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at his mother. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a houseful. And me and Vanni? We\u2019re not that young. Not as young as you and Dad were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we were young and dumb and poor. At least you\u2019re not poor. You should\u2019ve seen how we lived in the beginning. And every time your father walked by the bedroom door, I was pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and went to his mother, putting his arms around her despite the fact that her hands were messy with flour. \u201cThank you for helping, Mom. This was so sudden, Vanni\u2019s need to make this trip. I could see her warming up to Hannah, but it was overnight that she made her decision.\u201d</p><p>Marianne smiled at him. \u201cShe must have wanted to kill you for bringing an old girlfriend\u2019s baby home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMom, I liked Terri, but it wasn\u2019t out of affection for her that I took Hannah home. Have you held that little girl? Let her put her arms around your neck? Who, in their right mind, could have left her behind?\u201d</p><p>Marianne put her hand against Paul\u2019s cheek, leaving a trail of flour there. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Paul. I don\u2019t know where you got it, but you\u2019re a good boy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI know where I got it. I\u2019m going to look in on my family, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re napping together in your room. The kids were a little overtired and fussy and Vanni wanted them close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He went up the stairs to the largest guest room, the one he shared with his wife. There was a smaller room right next to it for the kids and there were two cribs there. The door to the bedroom was ajar an inch or so and Paul pushed it open. Vanni had the kids on the bed with her. She was lying on her back with Matt curled up against her on one side and Hannah on the other, both of them sleeping with their mouths open. Vanni was sound asleep, but there was the smallest smile on her lips. She had her arms around them, holding them close, one of Marianne\u2019s afghans pulled over them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Paul fell in love all over again.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>The first of October brought a very hectic schedule of events for the Virgin River Presbyterian Church, beginning with the delivery of the kitchen appliances. Next came Noah\u2019s personal shipment, which was stored in the newly finished basement. In that shipment, the piano arrived and as soon as it was tuned, Ellie couldn\u2019t wait to try it out. Her out-of-practice attempts, accompanied by the occasional muffled curse, could be heard all over the church, causing Noah to laugh to himself.</p> <p>Timing was on their side; Paul was finishing up in the sanctuary just as the pews were delivered for installation. New desks, a conference table and chairs, bookcases and filing cabinets for the upstairs offices were delivered, which meant a lot of sorting, organizing and file building. Ellie loved organizing. This work would barely be finished in time for the MacIntyre-Riordan wedding less than a week later.</p><p>Needless to say, both Noah and Ellie were extremely busy and, in the midst of this, Brie reported that the end of that first week of October, after almost exactly ninety days since her children were removed from her care, Ellie would finally get her court date. \u201cI need a brief meeting with you, Ellie,\u201d Brie said. \u201cMy office, tomorrow sometime. Call when you\u2019re on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to brief you on the hearing and some other details.\u201d</p><p>When Ellie told Noah, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost over, Ellie. This can only go one way for you.\u201d</p> <p>Ellie had quite a few questions for the man who was creeping into her bed night after night, questions she was not planning to ask. What should we do about us? was first on her list. When he said he loved her forever, that he loved her with his whole heart, that her children were his priority, too, was that a suggestion that they marry? There was no way she\u2019d ask him. And waiting to see what Noah would do next was almost as hard as waiting for her children to be legally returned to her.</p><p>Noah was managing to keep up with everything despite the increased activity in the church. He had a couple of counseling sessions with Vanni and Paul while they waited for their adoption paperwork to be filed and found them to be coping better all the time. Ellie was still giving Vanni a hand a couple of mornings a week, for which Vanni was enormously grateful. He\u2019d meet with Shelby and Luke and Father Demetrius from Arcata to discuss the particulars of their wedding service. Noah managed to get over to visit his friends in the woods. As well, he was kept busy with a couple of elderly women in town who appreciated being looked in on now and then.</p><p>Ellie sat in a chair facing Brie\u2019s desk, listening to her lawyer\u2019s briefing on the hearing that would take place.</p><p>\u201cAll set with a conservative outfit to wear to court?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Vanni hooked me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the judge will decide to make this whole thing go away before he comes under public criticism for the corners he cut with his last decision. An attorney ad litem has been assigned to the children, protecting their interests, and I don\u2019t expect your ex-husband to make an appearance. Based on his \u2018incident\u2019 with locking the children in the house, I suspect he\u2019s done with this particular mischief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? You think?\u201d Ellie asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cThere have been a few developments, Ellie. I phoned Dr. Arnold Gunterson of the University of Maine. The poor man was understandably upset and confused by anyone\u2019s desire to use his name and credentials, but when I explained the circumstances of the custody situation, the locking of the children in the house, it jogged his memory. It seems a former student from almost twenty years back had some real issues in that same area. He was a very troubled young man. As he was growing up, his parents disciplined him by locking him in the cellar or the closet. A cellar during a Maine winter, Dr. Gunterson explained, can be brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Ellie said. She scooted forward in her chair. \u201cThe basement,\u201d she said, remembering. \u201cOnce, only a few days into our marriage, Arnie said something at dinnertime...He said that bad children were locked in the basement. I really freaked out at that comment. I pitched a fit. I unloaded on him, told him that if he ever tried anything like that on my children, I\u2019d have him behind bars. And if he ever said anything like that again, we\u2019d be gone. It was one of the only times he ever backed down without a fight. He said it was just talk\u2014he\u2019d never do anything like that. I\u2019d almost forgotten...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe student Dr. Gunterson remembers is named Robert Beck,\u201d Brie said. \u201cDr. Gunterson imagines he was studying psychology to see if he could get a handle on what damage had been done to him, growing up. He was obsessed with Dr. Gunterson, a kind of hero worship that ended just shy of stalking. Beck taught young children for a short time in Maine, but was terminated for treating the kids too harshly. He got in trouble for locking one child in the closet in his classroom. He spent some time in a psychiatric hospital, and that was the last Dr. Gunterson heard about him. A little further checking turned up some minor scrapes with the law. Our sheriff\u2019s department will arrest him for fraud and identity theft, but whether there\u2019s any extradition remains to be seen.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how long he\u2019s been using a second identity as Arnold Gunterson,\u201d Brie went on. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been months or years. He was hard to trace because he got his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration in his legal name, rented his house and took his job using his false identity. Frankly, Dr. Gunterson would like to have sole use of his identity, but he\u2019s not anxious to see Beck again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we got married I realized he was weird,\u201d Ellie said. She swallowed. \u201cTurns out he was once a frightened child. An abused, frightened child.\u201d She shook her head sadly.</p><p>\u201cTreating people the way he\u2019d been treated. I can\u2019t tell you how often that\u2019s the case,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Noah said as much. He said that mistreating my kids wouldn\u2019t bring Arnie relief, it would make his life more miserable, but that probably wouldn\u2019t matter. Oh, Brie, thank God my kids weren\u2019t hurt any worse than they were!\u201d</p> <p>Brie was writing something down on a piece of paper. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re getting along fine, now that they\u2019re reassured you\u2019re near and they\u2019re safe. Just the same, make an appointment with this counselor. Get them evaluated. No point in borrowing trouble. And I\u2019ll see you in court at nine o\u2019clock Friday morning.\u201d</p><p>Ellie stood. \u201cAre you sure he won\u2019t give me any more trouble about custody? Because no matter what a judge says, I can\u2019t let my kids be alone with him. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be arrested before court on Friday, Ellie. He might make bail, but he\u2019s not taking on custodianship of any minor children. I can almost guarantee that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ellie said softly. \u201cReally, thank you isn\u2019t enough, but...It may take me a while, but I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re paid for your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whenever,\u201d Brie said. \u201cThing is, I have a daughter. Before long I\u2019m going to be looking for a good school. Right after this custody case is finished, I\u2019m going hunting. I want to know why none of the teachers or directors at that private school were fingerprinted. Then I\u2019m going to find out if all the employees of the rest of our county\u2019s schools have had the required background checks. For that, Ellie, we owe you. And the price you could have paid is way too high.\u201d</p><p>When she got back to town, Ellie checked at the Fitch house, but no one was home. It wasn\u2019t quite time for Nick to be home after work and Jo often ran errands after collecting Danielle from school. She walked down the street and saw the carpenters who\u2019d been tasked with installing pews loading up their trucks, finished for the day, and Noah\u2019s old truck was gone. But unless Noah said otherwise, he would be home in time to be sure Lucy had her dinner. Ellie went in the side door and up the stairs to the sanctuary.</p><p>Ah, it was looking good. Just a little spit and polish, the accoutrements like kneeler, pulpit and baptistery in place and it would be absolutely beautiful for Saturday\u2019s wedding. Ellie had offered to join Vanni, Shelby and some other women in decorating the pews with flowers. A florist from Grace Valley would bring a truckful and, while the women concentrated on the pews, she would adorn the front of the church. The church would be barely done and Noah would have his debut. Ellie sat in the front pew and imagined it. Her eyes were drawn to the stained-glass window. The peace in his eyes comforted her. Calmed her.</p><p>There was a voice from the back of the church. A deep, familiar voice. \u201cYou have to give me a chance.\u201d A man she\u2019d known only as Arnie spoke.</p><p>She stood and turned toward him. He was standing at the back of the church, a big, homely, unhappy man. \u201cRobert? Or is it Bob?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI never hurt them,\u201d he said. \u201cI took good care of them, Ellie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou locked them in your house! And you scared me that night you followed me in your big SUV!\u201d She wrinkled her brow. \u201cWhere\u2019d you park that big thing? I didn\u2019t see it outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, if you\u2019ll just cooperate for once, I can make this right. All I ever wanted my whole life was to do a good job with a family. Do it right. Be respected. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have followed you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were with him. You weren\u2019t supposed to be with him. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re divorced! We\u2019ve been divorced over a year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never accepted that. Marriage is forever,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of the plan, wasn\u2019t what we agreed. I let myself get mad about the way things went. You know me\u2014I don\u2019t often get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get mad all the time!\u201d she said hotly. \u201cYou get mad, you threaten, you harass and badger! You punish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI just try to keep things on track, that\u2019s all. You know.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her and she said loudly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Is it Robert? Is it Bob? What?\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the aisle. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been Robert in a long time and I\u2019ve been better off for it. Listen, just listen to me for once, if I apologize to the professor, all this will be over. We can pick up where we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick up what? We were never even really married! Why in the world do you want me at all? We never even...You know what we never did! And you know you can\u2019t be around children! You hate children!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said, shaking his head, taking another step. \u201cI wasn\u2019t mean to them, Ellie,\u201d he said, taking another step toward her. \u201cI was strict and I didn\u2019t mollycoddle \u2019em, but I didn\u2019t mistreat them. I mean, that business with the house locks\u2014really, I did that so no one could get in and hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cried every night, you wouldn\u2019t let them talk to me on the phone, they were scared and lonely\u2014\u201d She backed away a step. \u201cArnie, you need to see someone. You need help and I can\u2019t give it to you. And even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t take the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand about the help,\u201d he said, appearing frustrated. \u201cThe help doesn\u2019t work. I take medicine for depression, but it\u2019s not good. As long as things are calm, I\u2019m just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you, Arnie\u2014things can\u2019t always be calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLook, you\u2019re just upset, that\u2019s all. Mad about what I said in that bar. That won\u2019t matter, Ellie. We\u2019ll just start over. You\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll apologize to everyone, you\u2019ll just say it was a misunderstanding and we\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said calmly and firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, Arnie or Robert or whoever you are. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll get a lawyer, tell him you have problems and need some help. You probably won\u2019t go to jail that way. And, for sure, you should talk to someone about, you know, the stuff you went through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, stepping toward her, scowling down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happened to you that makes you want to control people, that makes you depressed, makes you want to lock up little children,\u201d she said, backing away.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. All I want to do is make it up to you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I liked you. I really did. I could take care of you. And them. It was really easy to see you needed someone like me\u2014someone who could take charge and take care of you. You admitted it yourself\u2014you just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly you no longer have any kind of job,\u201d she said to him. \u201cWhat am I saying? I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re president of General Motors! No, Arnie. Never. No way. Be smart\u2014get a lawyer, get some help. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>He made a growling sound and moved toward her, taking three quick steps.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Noah shouted from the side doorway into the sanctuary. \u201cDon\u2019t take another step. Back away from her. I mean it!\u201d</p><p>Arnie stopped. He grinned at Noah. \u201cYou again?\u201d</p> <p>Ellie skittered to stand beside Noah and Lucy. Noah slipped his arm around her waist, pulled her against him and said, \u201cEllie gave you excellent advice. Find a lawyer to help you. Get some help for yourself. You\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about me and Ellie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing there anymore, Arnie,\u201d Noah said. \u201cMove on. Before this gets any more complicated for you.\u201d</p><p>The man gave a short laugh and moved quickly toward them. He reached out to grab Ellie by the wrist. Noah\u2019s hand gripped Arnie\u2019s forearm instantly, so the three of them were locked together. And Lucy lost it. Without warning, she snarled and lunged, sinking her teeth right into Arnie\u2019s leg. With a howl of pain, Arnie kicked the dog off his leg and sent her skidding and yelping into a nearby pew.</p><p>In the melee, Noah lost his hold on Arnie, but Arnie continued to grip Ellie\u2019s wrist. Ellie twisted her wrist sharply toward his thumb rather than fingers, breaking the hold. And then she kneed him hard in the groin. With a grunt, he doubled over for just a moment.</p><p>Noah stepped between Arnie and Ellie, grabbed Arnie\u2019s arm and twisted it behind his back. \u201cEllie, get out of here,\u201d he growled. Then, with Arnie\u2019s arm as leverage, he marched him back down the church aisle toward the front entrance. As Noah pushed him toward the exit, he informed him, \u201cYou ever go near her again and I can\u2019t be responsible for my own actions. You have no claim on Ellie, as if you ever did, and I intend to keep her safe from the likes of you. The sheriff has been called and until he gets here\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The front entrance to the sanctuary opened and Jack and Preacher stood there. \u201cRight here, Noah. We got him,\u201d Preacher said, as they stepped forward, taking one arm each, dragging him toward the door. Noah was Arnie\u2019s equal in height, though trimmer, but these two at six-two and six-four with shoulders like door frames, dwarfed him. Arnie moaned with each step, no doubt still hurting from that shot to the testicles. \u201cSheriff\u2019s deputy, Henry Depardeau, should be here in ten minutes,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Noah turned back into the church and saw Ellie on her knees in front of Lucy. Lucy was alert, but down on her belly. When Noah came toward her, she looked up at him and gave a wag of her tail, but she didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s just stunned, Noah,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cAfter her accident, maybe you shouldn\u2019t chance it. Maybe you should take her to the vet, just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Noah knelt in front of Lucy, gently petting her head. \u201cRemind me never to get into a fight with either of you girls,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to come with me?\u201d he asked Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI have to see my kids,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI stopped by Jo\u2019s and they weren\u2019t there. I came here looking for you, to tell you all about Arnie. Brie has a ton of information on him. He must have seen me come in here. Noah, did you hear the way he was talking? He just wanted to do it all over again. He said we could start over and this would all go away. He said I was his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s delusional,\u201d Noah said. He stood up and pulled gently on Lucy\u2019s collar. \u201cYou gonna stand, girl?\u201d Slowly, Lucy got up, then started wagging and panting. \u201cI think she\u2019s all right. But I\u2019ll take her over to Nathaniel anyway.\u201d He looked at Ellie, who seemed to be staring at Lucy, but not seeing her. \u201cEllie? Forget him, he\u2019s crazy.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond. \u201cAre you in shock?\u201d Noah asked her.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his face. \u201cHmm? No. No, just thinking. Take Lucy, Noah. I\u2019m going to check on my kids. I have to tell Jo about court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. He leaned toward her and gave her a peck on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then.\u201d He looked at her closely, frowning. She was completely pensive, which was unlike Ellie. \u201cEllie, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. Sorry. Thinking.\u201d</p><p>So Ellie went to the Fitch house and found everyone there\u2014Nick was in his den, reading the newspaper while the kids had their one hour of after-school TV in the same room. Jo was in the kitchen, working on dinner. Ellie stepped right in without needing to be asked, getting out the salad makings and going to work on it. While Jo seared meat and cleaned and cut vegetables, Ellie worked on their salad and told Jo all the news of the day. At the end of a softly told tale, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the kids need to know about court on Friday morning\u2014it will just stress them out. They\u2019ve already had a short meeting with their attorney, which didn\u2019t seem to upset them, and they don\u2019t have to be in court. Better to tell them when it\u2019s over, I think. I mean, if I thought there was some reason to prepare them for the worst, I\u2019d do that,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cIt will be so nice to tell them when it\u2019s over. That we\u2019re a family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to court right after I drop Danielle at school. Nick is going to take the morning off to keep an eye on Trevor. I haven\u2019t exactly taken a poll, but I understand a number of friends will be there\u2014Jack and Mel, Preacher and Paige, Vanni, her father the general. Maybe Shelby and Luke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get out!\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have time for that. There\u2019s a wedding happening on Saturday. They have family from out of town coming, and lots to do. And don\u2019t they have Friday-night rehearsal and a dinner? And I\u2019m helping to decorate Saturday morning...\u201d</p><p>Jo covered Ellie\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cSweetheart, getting your custody resolved is just as important. And your friends are committed to that. We\u2019ll get everything done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I was afraid people around here would think the worst of me after what Arnie said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jo said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThey really plan to go to Eureka for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue,\u201d Jo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to take chances at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Ellie said. Ellie took a deep breath and smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do between now and Saturday night. This is the opening of the church, a wedding the whole town has been looking forward to, and before we can see that all done, I have to go to court. I might be a little tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, take it easy, honey. We\u2019re going to be fine. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>By the time Noah got out to Nate Jensen\u2019s stable and veterinary office, the sun was lowering in the sky, and Lucy seemed to be moving around just fine. But since he\u2019d come this far, Noah decided to proceed with the visit. The vet office attached to the stable was locked, so he went to the house and knocked on the back door. He saw Nate and a woman in the kitchen, apparently having a drink and snack at the breakfast bar; Nate answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Noah,\u201d he said, popping the last bit of a cracker into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, Nate. Something came up with Lucy and I thought I\u2019d better have you check her out.\u201d Suddenly a chorus of barking came from inside the house and three fluffy, black-and-white dogs with pointy ears came racing into the kitchen. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cWinkin, Blinkin and Nod,\u201d Nate said with a laugh. \u201cMostly border collie, we think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonner, Dasher and Blitzen,\u201d the woman said, joining them at the back door. \u201cWe call them Don, Dash and Blitz. Hi, I\u2019m Annie, Nate\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d She put out her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. Nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe had an incident. I got into a little altercation in the church. It wasn\u2019t serious, but a man and I locked horns, grabbed each other, and Lucy bit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy?\u201d Nate said, looking down at the dog. \u201cEven-tempered Lucy?\u201d</p><p>The three almost full-grown pups were busy sniffing her and she was standing stock-still, letting them. The pups were dancing around a bit, whining, stumbling over each other, crowding Lucy.</p><p>\u201cThe situation must have made her nervous,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnyway, she latched on to the guy\u2019s leg and the guy kicked her off, throwing her into a pew. She couldn\u2019t get right up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Nate wasn\u2019t really listening. He crouched near Lucy, in the midst of a throng of prancing pups. And then Lucy got down on her belly and the pups laid down, as well. They continued to sniff while Lucy started to smell and lick them. One of the pups rolled over on his back and Lucy went to work on his closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that something, the way she does that?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cDo all female dogs just take over the cleanup on instinct? I thought only cats did that. I\u2019ve seen her do that to another dog in town.\u201d</p><p>Nate looked up from his crouched position. \u201cComet? Christopher\u2019s pup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Nate stood up and grabbed Annie\u2019s hand. \u201cSilas was training Lucy and she was coming along just great. But Silas also had ranch dogs that roamed pretty free\u2014he kept cows and other livestock. A couple of \u2019em were border collies. I think if Lucy got friendly with another border collie, these might be her pups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut she was in an accident. When would she have had pups?\u201d</p><p>Nate was shaking his head. \u201cJack Sheridan found a box of abandoned puppies under the Christmas tree last December. They were too little to be weaned; it was a surprise they survived the cold. I put them at about three weeks old. They had to be eyedropper fed and kept warm.\u201d He chuckled unhappily. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past old Silas. He wasn\u2019t the type to have a litter of eight in his house or likely to go to any trouble to place them. I\u2019m kind of surprised he didn\u2019t drown \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou think it\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>The three adults stood around, looking down at Lucy and a big pile of playful pups. Even though they were almost as big as she was, they certainly acted like puppies. Lucy seemed to be on the bottom of the pile, and very content, snarling an occasional warning, nudging them, licking them, pushing them around with her snout.</p><p>\u201cThe town named them after the reindeer. There were four females in the litter\u2014Dancer, Prancer, Vixen and Cupid. I got these guys because they were left over.\u201d Nate connected with Noah\u2019s eyes. \u201cLucy wasn\u2019t trying to find her way home,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was trying to get back to her kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eighteen</p><p>At the Fitch house, after the children had been settled in bed and Ellie had gone to her apartment, Nick wandered into the kitchen where Jo was brewing a cup of tea. \u201cThink I could have one of those?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou hate tea,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cJust the same, could I? And sit with you a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, totally confused. \u201cBut tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to get it myself?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to. You wait on me too much anyway.\u201d</p><p>She went for a cup and saucer, put a tea bag in it and poured boiling water from the kettle. \u201cI just do what I\u2019m expected to do.\u201d</p><p>He let that go a beat, until he was busily dunking the tea bag. \u201cYou do way more than what\u2019s expected. What you\u2019re doing for Danielle and Trevor, for example. If those kids didn\u2019t have you, life just wouldn\u2019t be fun for them right now. For that matter, if Ellie didn\u2019t have you in her corner, I hate to think...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should give yourself a lot of credit, too, Nick,\u201d Jo said.</p><p>He took a courage-building breath. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bad team, despite all. Jo Ellen, I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d like to apologize to you for my mistakes, but as it turns out, there are too many to count. I could start right now and still not be done by next Tuesday. But in my gut, I\u2019m aware of every mistake I ever made, and I\u2019m sorry. I love you and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d she questioned, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cSeems like the turning point for us had to do with the adoption issue, but I don\u2019t kid myself that that was all that was wrong between us. I bungled a lot of things, and somewhere along the line, I lost you.\u201d He reached across the table to take her hand. At first she jumped, almost pulling her hand away. But then she thought better of it and let him hold it. \u201cCan you ever accept my apology? I\u2019m just not a very smart guy. I knew I was making mistake after mistake, but it was like I was helpless. Once you went to your own room, I wanted to pull you back to me. But instead, out of hurt pride, I pushed you further away. God, what I\u2019d give to undo that, to be able to change course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why you didn\u2019t want to adopt children,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI never could accept it, but at least I knew your reasons. But what possible reason could you have for making passes at women? For making me a laughingstock?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and looked down. \u201cLord, I don\u2019t have a reason. I was always looking for attention, I guess. Wanted you to think you had some competition, maybe. But you weren\u2019t a laughingstock\u2014it was you the town respected. I heard them say it\u2014what is she doing with that idiot? Why does she stay with him? They knew why I stayed, even though it looked like I wasn\u2019t satisfied in marriage. Because, Jo Ellen, there\u2019s not a better wife in this town than you. You take better care of me and our home than any woman ever could. But even though you made sure I was never without a good meal or a sewed on button or a perfect house, our days of hugs and kisses have been over for decades. You know everything I like and don\u2019t like, know everything about me, even though we hardly ever have a real conversation. I miss you, Jo Ellen.\u201d</p> <p>Jo felt the moisture rise in her eyes. \u201cThis is so sudden...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably seems like it. If you only knew how many times I wanted to bring it up, and didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why now, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Jo Ellen, seeing you with Ellie and the kids, I realize it\u2019s not too late for us. It might be too late to adopt children, but...I\u2019d like it if we get to keep Ellie and the kids as part of our family from now on. But even if that\u2019s not possible for some reason, it\u2019s pretty obvious we can make it our mission to have family. We can get involved in community stuff to do with children\u2014they\u2019re always begging for volunteers for everything. Make A Wish, Special Olympics, Parks and Rec, Little League, everything. We got us a new church in town\u2014we can help out there. I bet there are single parents everywhere in this county that could use a hand...\u201d</p><p>Jo started to laugh and squeezed his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare volunteer us for anything without talking to me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said. \u201cJo Ellen, honey, can we start over? We used to have something pretty special, you and me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I think I know what you want. Pretty sneaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cBedroom stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, phooey,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m after. I just want some good feelings to go with the great way we manage this marriage. Know what I mean?\u201d He leaned toward her. \u201cI want to hug. I want a kiss on the cheek sometimes. I want to help with the dishes and talk about our days.\u201d Then he got a twinkle in his eye. \u201cBut, if I remember, we did have that bedroom stuff pretty well figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick!\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to think about this a little bit. You took me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about this, Jo Ellen,\u201d he said, taking both her hands across the table. An unaccustomed dark stain rose up on his cheeks, like a youth looking for romantic courage. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a fancy wedding on Saturday. In our brand-new church. We could hold hands while they say their vows and we could silently say ours to each other. Nothing official, no big announcement, but a private renewal for you and me. A new start. If you can forgive me for everything I did to screw us up, that is.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a minute. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my list is long, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, sweetheart,\u201d Nick said softly. \u201cI just want a chance to live the rest of our marriage in love again, like we used to be. Like I\u2019ve been all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Will you think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said. And by the way she said that, he knew she wasn\u2019t going to say no. He could see relief in her eyes that matched the relief he was feeling in his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d he said. \u201cThink I\u2019ll have a brandy. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate tea,\u201d he said. Then he smiled at her.</p><p>Noah couldn\u2019t wait to tell Ellie about what Nate Jensen suspected\u2014that Lucy was the mother of eight pups left under the Virgin River Christmas tree eight months ago. He had to be patient, however. It wouldn\u2019t do to go bursting in on the Fitch household. And he\u2019d be sure to run it by Ellie before sharing this story with the kids. It made him grin, though, knowing how the kids would enjoy it.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have to wait to tell Jack and Preacher. He leashed Lucy to the porch rail for her dinner, went inside for his own and said, \u201cWait till you hear this....\u201d</p><p>When Noah repeated the story, Jack said, \u201cNo way! I never even knew Lucy before you brought her back to life! \u2019Course, I never knew Silas, either. His ranch was on the other side of the valley. Heard about the wreck, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack turned and banged on the wall, bringing Preacher out from the kitchen. And when Preacher heard the story, he said, \u201cNo way! Lucy? Two of \u2019em didn\u2019t get the border collie markings, just the long hair and pointy ears, but those pups could definitely belong to Lucy. Well, Noah, isn\u2019t that just unbelievable? I\u2019m going to have to look that up on the computer, see what I can find out about breeding, about mother dogs being reunited with their pups after a long separation.\u201d And with that, he turned and went back to the kitchen.</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s going to keep him busy for days. He won\u2019t stop till he knows everything.\u201d Jack leaned close. \u201cNoah, Henry Depardeau took your man Arnie away. Said he\u2019d broken some laws in another state and that he\u2019s not going to make quick bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBecause Ellie has her custody hearing on Friday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt got leaked. Me and Preach, we\u2019re closing up shop and heading for Eureka with our wives. I think we\u2019ll have a good showing for her. I know it doesn\u2019t really count for the judge\u2019s decision, but it\u2019ll make Ellie feel good.\u201d</p><p>Noah was touched. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Jack. She\u2019ll appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>When the light tapping came at her door, Ellie didn\u2019t have to ask who was there. Arnie was tucked away in jail and it was Noah\u2019s usual visiting hour, which he liked to stretch out till dawn. When he walked in, Lucy by his side, Ellie said, \u201cOh, thank God, she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than all right,\u201d Noah said, taking off his jacket and tossing it in her chair. \u201cWait till you hear this. It turns out that little Christopher Middleton\u2019s dog, Comet, and seven other pups that were abandoned in the cold of last Christmas, left to freeze, rescued by the town, are probably Lucy\u2019s pups. Taken from her too early. She might have been trying to find her way back to them. That\u2019s what Nate Jensen thinks could have happened.\u201d</p><p>Ellie knelt in front of the dog and began to massage her neck and jowls with loving hands. \u201cIs that a fact, my dear girl? Good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that remarkable?\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cIt is if you don\u2019t know much about women and mothers,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing all right?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cWhen I left you earlier, you were kind of strange. Preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. \u201cI\u2019m real edgy. Facing that custody hearing, even though Brie said it can only go one way, is bigger than I am. I thought it could only go one way the last time, and look what happened. It\u2019s going to be a long night, getting ready for court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you pass the time,\u201d Noah said, reaching for her. He pulled her against him and sighed. \u201cThe church will be done, the Booth and Riordan families have all arrived for the wedding, George is coming tomorrow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything right on schedule,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cJust like we planned.\u201d She pulled back and looked into his eyes. \u201cWhen I tricked you into giving me this job, I said I\u2019d get out of your hair the minute I had custody again. It would free you up to get a real pastor\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThe joke was on me. I couldn\u2019t have found a better pastor\u2019s assistant if I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr at least a more accommodating one,\u201d she teased. \u201cI doubt you\u2019d have snuggled up to Mrs. Nagel this well. Noah, I can stick to the deal. If I do get through this hearing and get my kids, I won\u2019t owe anybody as much as I owe you. If you hadn\u2019t given me a chance, it wouldn\u2019t have worked at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave you my word, my commitment, that I\u2019d stand by you, wouldn\u2019t let you down. I\u2019ll love you forever, never let you down, stay with you from now on. I couldn\u2019t have made love to you under any other terms. It\u2019s not just some notion of mine, Ellie, but part of who I am. When I make promises like that, I don\u2019t back out. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, peering at him. \u201cThat\u2019s really something, Noah. You must have great willpower. God must be so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I fall short more often than make him proud.\u201d He gave her a little kiss. \u201cI\u2019m sure you made similar promises...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say, I\u2019m not as devout as you. I wasn\u2019t thinking of promises or commitments at all\u2014just that I loved you. Really, I tried not to. I thought it might complicate both our lives. But I hadn\u2019t felt anything like that in such a long time, I just gave in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry you did,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, Ellie. It\u2019s going to work out for us. And you can have the pastor\u2019s assistant\u2019s job for as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, then she said, \u201cWhy, Noah, you might be the most generous man I know....\u201d</p><p>Early on Friday morning, Ellie dressed very carefully in the nice pantsuit and conservative pumps Vanessa had loaned her. She straightened her hair so it wouldn\u2019t be wild and wore light makeup. Her nails were shortened and done in a clear polish. And her stomach was upside down.</p> <p>She walked down to the church and used her key to go in the front entrance rather than the side door she usually used. She walked up the steps to the wide foyer and pushed open the double doors to the sanctuary. Then she walked slowly down the aisle.</p><p>The October sun was barely rising above the tall trees at 7:00 a.m., but the inside of the sanctuary was resplendent in shining hardwood, glittering altar accoutrements, including the gold candelabra and cross she had polished herself. She and Noah had worked until past eleven a couple of nights, making sure all was ready for the wedding rehearsal that would take place late Friday afternoon. She had spent hours the day before making sure every last speck of workman\u2019s dust was wiped from the floor and pews. Tomorrow morning Shelby and her family would attach floral arrangements to the end of each pew for the afternoon ceremony. Ellie had promised to help. Shelby and Luke had decided on 5:00 p.m. to exchange their vows.</p><p>Ellie was so proud she could burst. She\u2019d helped make all this happen. She\u2019d worked hard. She gave thanks every morning that she\u2019d had the chance. \u201cLittle melodramatic of you, messing with my motherhood to force me into the position,\u201d she said to the holy stained-glass image before her. \u201cI know\u2014I can\u2019t be sure that was your idea. But I can let that go if you just settle down on the big life lessons. Really, I\u2019m so damn tired. Gimme a break, couldja?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d a voice said. Noah stood in the hall door that led to his office. He was wearing a very sharp dark suit, blinding-white shirt and royal-blue tie. It brought out the sheen in his black hair, which had finally been trimmed, and his magnificent blue eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said, stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you had good clothes! That\u2019s amazing\u2014you look so handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this minister business doesn\u2019t work out for you, you could be a model.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou worried I\u2019m going to fall on my face?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve actually done this before, you know. I know how to get people married. Only once, but I\u2019ve even been complimented on my performance. And you look pretty\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of a door opening and feet on the stairs cut him off, quieted them. Then Brie was standing beside Noah. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone ready?\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s stomach took another flip. \u201cReady,\u201d she said.</p><p>It was a long ride to the Eureka courthouse. Noah made small talk while he drove Ellie\u2019s car. He told the story of Lucy and the pups yet again. He explained to Brie who George was and that he\u2019d be in town by early afternoon; George wasn\u2019t about to miss the very first service Noah performed in the new church. Noah wouldn\u2019t leak the secret vows Shelby and Luke had agreed on but said, from what he\u2019d heard, the rehearsal dinner party that would take place at Walt Booth\u2019s house would be one gala night. And the wedding reception would take place in Walt\u2019s pasture under tenting and complete with linen, crystal, space heaters and a dance floor. It would put the Taj Mahal to shame. \u201cI doubt any president has done it better,\u201d Noah said cheerfully.</p><p>Ellie wished he\u2019d just shut up. She was a wreck. A sick worried wreck.</p><p>When they pulled into Eureka, Brie said, \u201cEllie, we\u2019ve already talked about this, but one more time\u2014the judge has had all the paperwork pertaining to your case for over a week\u2014the motion, the temporary restraining order, arrest report, paperwork from Child Welfare Services, the letter from Reverend Kincaid verifying your employment\u2014everything. He may have all he needs for a decision. Or, he might have a few questions for you. Answer honestly and politely. And, Ellie, no matter what happens, hold your emotions in check. By all means, your temper. If we hit a bad patch and things don\u2019t go well\u2014a very very remote possibility\u2014please let me handle it. For your own good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Brie repeated all this several times in very soft tones while they waited right outside the courtroom doors until the bailiff called Ellie\u2019s name. And while they waited, familiar faces began to appear. Her friends and neighbors\u2014Jack and Mel, Preacher and Paige, Vanni and Paul, Walt and Muriel. Even Hope McCrea. Of course, Jo Fitch arrived before they were called. All Ellie could do was smile tremulously and nod. Yes, she told someone in a uniform, they were all approved to be present in her closed hearing. Closed because it involved juveniles.</p><p>When the double doors opened to admit them to the courtroom, her eyes focused on the dais where that blasted judge would sit. She was so oblivious to her surroundings, she didn\u2019t even hear all her friends behind her. She followed Brie to the front, Noah walking behind them. The judge came in and the bailiff ordered them to all rise. The case was announced. The judge said good-morning. Ellie shook inside.</p><p>\u201cMiss Baldwin, what kind of arrangements have you made for housing for yourself and the children?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not making any immediate changes, Your Honor. Mr. and Mrs. Fitch have invited us to stay on their property until I can save a little money and look for something. The kids are very happy there and we each have our own bedroom. I have breakfast and dinner with them every day. I put them to bed at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, flipping through the documents. \u201cVery generous. Are Mr. and Mrs. Fitch here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Your Honor,\u201d Jo Ellen said from behind Ellie. \u201cMr. Fitch is with Miss Baldwin\u2019s four-year-old, Trevor. Trevor doesn\u2019t attend school yet.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Ellie turned and really took notice of the encouraging faces in the courtroom. Shelby and Luke were there, even though Luke\u2019s entire family was in town for the wedding. Mike Valenzuela had arrived.</p> <p>\u201cThis works for you, Mrs. Fitch? Because part of the recommendation of the court is adequate housing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie is like a daughter to me, her children like grandchildren. Nothing could make me happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the order of custody is changed, the minor children won\u2019t be in foster care,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThere will be no stipend for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be paying additional rent, Your Honor,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take advantage. Jo\u2019s been so...I mean, Mrs. Fitch has been so wonderful to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019d say we\u2019re done here. Do a good job with these children, Miss Baldwin. I don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>It burned on her tongue to say she probably wouldn\u2019t see him again as long as she was working in a church, but thankfully he banged his gavel, closing the case. And rather than words coming to her tongue, tears came to her eyes and she lost it. She put her face in her hands and just cried. She felt arms around her; Brie hugging her. She heard a loud murmur go up from behind her\u2014subdued cheers from her new friends. She felt strong arms grab her by the shoulders, turn her, embrace her. \u201cYou did it, honey,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cYou did it. It\u2019s over.\u201d And she put her face against that beautiful dark suit and wept.</p><p>Ellie knew she had been wound too tight for the hearing, but she had no idea how much energy had bled out of her with the decision. She was weak as a kitten as she accepted congratulatory embraces from her friends. Out on the courthouse steps, there was a mood of victory, which she tearfully and meekly accepted.</p><p>\u201cCome out to the house, meet the Riordan clan and my little brother,\u201d Vanni invited. \u201cBefore all the wedding stuff officially starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst we\u2019re going to pick up Danielle from school,\u201d Jo said, pulling Ellie against her. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet Nick and Trevor for lunch and tell the kids that the whole thing is fixed, they have their mother back. Noah? Will you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019m back to town to meet George.\u201d</p><p>Ellie just nodded numbly. But she snagged Brie\u2019s sleeve and asked, \u201cHe can\u2019t change his mind, can he?\u201d</p><p>Brie smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re done with this, Ellie. And I\u2019ll watch the proceedings involving Arnie to make sure he\u2019s out of your hair. I\u2019ll let you know how that goes when something happens there, but don\u2019t even worry about it. I\u2019d say that\u2019s over, as well.\u201d</p><p>As Ellie walked with Noah to her car, he took her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Ellie. You never gave up. Meet Hercules Baldwin.\u201d Then he grinned.</p><p>Because Danielle and Trevor were so comfortably ensconced in Jo and Nick\u2019s house, Ellie was pretty sure the impact of the ruling was lost on them. They had already moved on, emotionally. Once children feel safe, they can relax. All they wanted to be sure about was that they didn\u2019t have to pack a bag and that they didn\u2019t have to live with Arnie again. Beyond that, Danielle wanted to get back to school in time for her spelling contest\u2014she was sure she was ahead of the class. And she wondered how soon she could start riding the bus to school. Nick had promised Trevor a PlayStation tournament if he ate his vegetables and had a little afternoon nap. With things so settled, Jo urged Ellie to go on to Vanessa\u2019s house.</p><p>It was that visit that gave Ellie her second wind. She\u2019d been to Vanni\u2019s so many times to help out, finding her friend collapsing under the weight of two babies and a lot of emotional baggage, but all that had changed. Her house was full of people \u201cstaying clear of the general\u2019s house while caterers set up for tonight\u2019s party.\u201d Vanni grabbed her by the hand, led her around, introducing her to people, including Luke\u2019s visiting family.</p><p>She was embraced by Maureen Riordan, Luke\u2019s red-haired, green-eyed mother who held a contented Hannah on her hip. The general almost broke Ellie in half with his bear hug, then introduced her to his son, Tom, home from West Point for the wedding. Muriel kissed her cheek and pressed a glass of wine in her hand. Then there were the Riordan men, of whom Luke was the eldest. Next in line, Colin, just back from an assignment in Iraq in the Blackhawk. Then came Aiden, a very handsome navy doctor who bent elegantly over her hand. Before that introduction could even be complete, she was embraced by good-looking, playful Sean, who said, \u201cThank God above\u2014I was afraid there\u2019d be no beautiful women to dance with at the wedding!\u201d And finally the baby of the family, Patrick, on leave from a naval aircraft carrier stationed in the Gulf where he flew fighters. She learned they ranged in age from thirty-one to thirty-nine, all single, Luke soon to be off the market.</p><p>When she could catch her breath, she whispered to Vanni, \u201cOh my God, would you look at these men? You should have warned me!\u201d</p><p>Vanni laughed. \u201cNice eye candy for the unattached female,\u201d she said. \u201cKnow any?\u201d</p><p>Ellie just smiled. But she had a fantastic time, honored to be a part of the wedding party and their afternoon of reunion and celebration. Those present were all included in the party following the rehearsal, but Shelby and Luke had decided on only one attendant each. Shelby\u2019s matron of honor would be Vanessa, and Sean would stand up with Luke. Shelby\u2019s uncle Walt would give her away and from what Ellie heard around the house that afternoon, the rest of the Riordan boys planned to drink just enough to keep from getting some famous ear twist from their feisty red-haired mother.</p><p>Late in the afternoon, Vanessa snagged her arm and said, \u201cCome with me just one second.\u201d She pulled Ellie to her bedroom and closed the door. \u201cMy timing might not be the best, but before this crowd descended on us, I had to do some cleaning and clearing. I went through the clothes that aren\u2019t horribly out-of-date and put some aside for you. Keep what you want and give the overflow to Goodwill. There could be a pair of jeans or sweater in there you can use.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Vanni, you shouldn\u2019t have. Really,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cI should be sending your firstborn to college, for all the help you gave me. But keep this in perspective here\u2014we\u2019re talking hand-me-downs. I just hope I\u2019m not insulting you. These things may not be what you like. By the way\u2014you look gorgeous today.\u201d She grinned. \u201cDid I mention I can\u2019t fit into that suit anymore? It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Ellie plucked at her borrowed slacks. \u201cBut you will again...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. I\u2019m planning to get pregnant. Just give me a chance to potty train little Matt, the most obstinate of male children. I swear, he likes sitting in poop. But, I have to get down to one in diapers before I take another plunge.\u201d She smiled. She beamed. \u201cYou have no idea how happy it makes Paul to think about actually fathering one of his own. Men, huh? How predictable are their egos? If they had to push \u2019em out, it would be a whole different...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah looks so happy,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>Vanni\u2019s voice softened and she smiled sweetly. \u201cWe\u2019re doing fine, Ellie. Thank you. We should have our adoption final in a few months, but she\u2019s already ours. We\u2019re moving ahead.\u201d Then she opened the door to her walk-in closet and there stood some packed suitcases. \u201cThe luggage is old and is going the way of Goodwill also, so I just put the clothes in them. Really, my feelings won\u2019t be affected if you reject them all. I\u2019m going to have a couple of the boys load the stuff in the back of your car for you.\u201d</p><p>George had a hard time believing how beautiful the church had turned out, from the perfect white paint on the outside to the rich, shiny hardwood finish on the inside. Noah and George stood at the sanctuary entrance to take in the full view. Lucy sat patiently between them. \u201cHave any of the town people seen the finished product, or are you making them all wait for the official unveiling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust about everyone in Virgin River has tromped through here at one time or another,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI learned it\u2019s a favorite pastime around here\u2014when Paul\u2019s building a house, especially for someone local, whole families get in their cars, drive to the building site and do regular walk-throughs, commenting on the structure, choice of stone or wood, paint color. Mel Sheridan says it\u2019s all part of being in each other\u2019s affairs at all times. But\u2014Ellie and I barely finished the final cleanup, so you\u2019re among the first to see it like this.\u201d Noah looked at his watch. \u201cWhere is she? I thought she\u2019d be down here to say hello by now. And she\u2019s helping with the music for the rehearsal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much help?\u201d George asked dubiously.</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cPoor girl, she really wanted to play for them. Once the piano arrived and was tuned, she got right on it. But I guess Ellie\u2019s been away from the piano a little longer than she thought\u2014it was pretty rough. Not to mention the language this old church had to endure. We decided together that it wasn\u2019t right that Shelby would have to stop walking down the aisle suddenly when the pianist hit a bad note and muttered \u2018shit\u2019 loud enough for an entire congregation to hear.\u201d</p><p>George laughed loudly at that. His laughter echoed in the empty church.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going with some wedding CDs. Preacher loaned us a real nice stereo setup so the music is piped in\u2014it\u2019s fantastic. Once things slow down a little, I\u2019ll get a unit up and running and find some speakers for the high corners in here,\u201d he said, pointing around the sanctuary ceiling.</p><p>\u201cIt must feel good, Noah. You\u2019ve worked hard. Did a fine job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie worked hard, too,\u201d he said proudly.</p> <p>\u201cShe must be so relieved,\u201d George said. \u201cChurch is finished, kids safely back with her, crazy ex-husband gone.\u201d</p><p>Noah looked at his watch again. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had time to talk to her since we got back from Eureka. She spent the afternoon out at Vanessa\u2019s, being introduced to the bride and groom\u2019s visiting families. They\u2019re all so grateful to her for her help, not just with this wedding stuff, but to Vanni while she was overwhelmed with the little ones. Ellie...\u201d He chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cShe can be so in your face one second and the next, utterly oblivious. She doesn\u2019t even realize what a good neighbor she\u2019s been to these people.\u201d</p><p>George grinned. \u201cI take it you have that relationship ironed out now....\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed again. \u201cGod had to send me four boats, two helicopters and several flotation devices. But I don\u2019t feel so bad\u2014Ellie hasn\u2019t found it much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you proposed. At least told her you\u2019d be a worthless failure without her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her\u2014\u201d Noah stopped. He looked at George in silence for a moment. \u201cI told her I\u2019d made a commitment to love her forever and would never let her down. She said she thought I was real ethical.\u201d</p><p>George smirked and shook his head. \u201cWhy, Noah, I bet that just swept her off her feet. She must be out shopping for a trousseau as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Noah muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll get that straightened out tonight. I\u2019ll steal her away from the rehearsal party and make sure\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He was cut off at the sound of people entering the church, laughter accompanying them. The Booth and Riordan parties entered from the front of the church, just those partaking in the ceremony, to keep things simple. The group included Walt, Vanni and Shelby; Luke, Sean, Maureen and two ushers\u2014Tom Booth and Aiden Riordan. Noah shook hands, bussed the lady\u2019s cheeks and made introductions. The bride and groom and their attendants wandered to the front of the church, murmuring in awe at how beautiful it finished up, Shelby pointing out where the flowers would go.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d Walt blustered to Noah. \u201cThey\u2019re setting up some mighty fine-looking food back at the house and those Riordans are circling like starving dogs. I\u2019d like to get back there while they\u2019re still sober enough to make the toasts.\u201d</p><p>Noah looked at his watch yet again. \u201cLet\u2019s give Ellie another minute\u2014she\u2019s helping with the music tonight. Tomorrow is a no-brainer, she can just start the CD and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure she\u2019s coming, Noah?\u201d Walt asked. \u201cI saw her wrangling a couple of big suitcases down the stairs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were driving into town, past the Fitch house. She was on the stairs with a big suitcase\u2014one still on top, one already sitting behind her car. I thought maybe she was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no,\u201d Noah said. \u201cGeorge, handle this for a few minutes. Lucy, stay!\u201d And then he bolted out the side door and ran down the street like the seat of his pants was on fire. Or like he might be losing the love of his life.</p><p>When he got to the Fitch house, he saw exactly what Walt had described\u2014a big suitcase sitting beside the open hatch of her PT Cruiser and the door to her apartment standing open. He took the steps two at a time. When he got to the top of the stairs and looked inside, his heart stopped. There she stood, beside her bed, an open suitcase sitting amidst several neatly folded piles of clothing ready to be packed.</p><p>\u201cEllie! No!\u201d He rushed to her. \u201cGod, no! You can\u2019t be leaving me! Don\u2019t!\u201d He grabbed her face and covered her mouth in a hard, desperate kiss. Her eyes flew open in stunned disbelief; she stopped breathing. He released her mouth but not her face, which he held in his hands, his fingers threaded into her hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t go, Ellie, you can\u2019t. Don\u2019t you know how much I love you? God, I\u2019d be nothing without you. I never thought I\u2019d get to feel like this again, but you brought me back to life. You took the loneliness away and brought laughter back into my life. Ellie, you\u2019re everything to me\u2014I can\u2019t make it without you. If you leave, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him, a slight smile on her face. \u201cReally? You don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I know I\u2019m not a good romantic, I know that. I realized just a little while ago that I\u2014Oh, hell, I told you how responsible I was, not how much you light up my life. I told you about my vow and how I could stick to it, not how life without you would be all gray and sad and awful. I didn\u2019t tell you everything you mean to me. I promised myself I\u2019d take care of that tonight, for sure. I was almost too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d he asked, dropping his hands from her face.</p><p>\u201cRight now,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t prepared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s the whole idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cEllie. Dammit, you saved my life. I was a wallowing, pathetic, self-pitying\u2014\u201d He stopped talking at the sound of her soft laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to laugh at my attempts to be romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, that wasn\u2019t romantic. That made me wonder what I ever saw in you. Start over.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her face in his hands again. \u201cI want to be with you forever. I want to lie beside you every night, holding you close, whispering to you that I love you more than anything in the world, that you turned my whole world upside down just when it needed to be turned upside down. I want to make forever promises to you out loud, in front of God, and I want you to promise to be my woman, my wife, my one and only love, my best friend and my conscience. You\u2019re never easy, Ellie, but you\u2019re sure never boring...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that last part,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you so much. If I lost you, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I\u2019d go after you, that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. I\u2019d find a way to get you back. You know we\u2019re perfect together. I know you feel it because I can feel you feel it.\u201d He grinned roguishly. \u201cWe sure fit together perfect, don\u2019t you think? You told me you loved me\u2014tell me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Noah. I tried not to. I usually screw up love situations. But, apparently, we have that in common.\u201d She grinned. \u201cA good start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I leave you? I adore you. And unless I\u2019m completely stupid, you just asked me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. We should give the kids some time to get used to the idea. And we should find a house that can hold us, but as soon as we can work out the details, we should get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I late for rehearsal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were waiting for you,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen Walt said he saw you struggling with luggage and thought maybe you weren\u2019t coming, that you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a bit. \u201cNoah, these are Vanni\u2019s hand-me-downs. I thought I had time to unpack them before the rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>He was shocked silent for a moment, absorbing this, then he grabbed her and kissed her hard. And he said, \u201cI have a feeling I bit off more than I can chew with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo question about that, Your Holiness.\u201d</p><p>The church was decorated in fall floral arrangements. The ribbons that held turning leaves, dark yellow roses, coral tulips and red calla lilies together were brown, orange, yellow and red. Two big sprays at the front of the church tied the whole look together. The decorations were an amazing complement to the shining dark wood of the pews.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s role in the ceremony was small but important. When everyone was ready, she pressed Play on the stereo, then went back to sit beside Paul Haggerty so she could hang on to Hannah. The priest and Noah entered from the right, standing together at the front of the church. Luke and Sean Riordan entered from the left. Vanessa came down the aisle and, Hannah, standing in Ellie\u2019s lap, raised a fat little hand and yelled, \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Vanni beamed at her and blew her a kiss as she passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellie glanced over her shoulder to smile at her children, seated with Jo and Nick. As she did so, she noticed that Jo and Nick were holding hands and it gave her a lift in her heart.</p><p>Right behind Vanni was Shelby, her glorious long hair pulled back and held away from her face with a few small flowers and flowing down her back to her waist. She looked so petite next to her towering uncle Walt; so radiant as he passed her hand into Luke\u2019s.</p><p>Noah began the ceremony. \u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God\u2014and in the face of this company\u2014to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is commended to be honorable among all men and therefore\u2014is not by any\u2014to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly\u2014but reverently, discreetly, advisedly and solemnly. Into this holy estate these two persons present now come to be joined.\u201d</p> <p>The priest was next with his part. \u201cMarriage is the union of husband and wife in heart, body and mind. It is intended for their mutual joy\u2014and for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity. But more importantly\u2014it is a means through which a stable and loving environment may be attained.\u201d</p><p>Next the reading of 1 Corinthians 13, which they also shared, reading every other verse, beginning with Noah. \u201cIf I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud,\u201d said the priest.</p><p>\u201cLove never fails,\u201d said Noah, nearly completing the verse.</p><p>And then the priest finished with, \u201cAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\u201d</p> <p>Ellie watched Noah with admiration in her eyes, but Noah didn\u2019t watch Ellie\u2014he was busy. He focused on the couple before him, on the priest beside him. They presented the bride and groom their candles and they lit a unity candle together. He was so at ease, at peace before his own congregation. He was so beautiful. His smile was filled with joy and love; his eyes glowed. He spoke to the bride and groom softly, so softly no one but the couple could hear. He chuckled at something Luke said.</p><p>\u201cThere is no wedding sermon today,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThe bride and groom have decided that the exchange of their vows will provide their message, after which Father Demetrius and I will have the honor of pronouncing them husband and wife. Shelby? Luke?\u201d</p><p>Shelby handed off her bouquet and faced Luke, taking both his hands in hers. And she began: \u201cLuke, I love you. I promise that each day I have you in my life, I will show you my love.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes drifted to Ellie\u2019s and a smile played about his lips as the bride and groom spoke.</p><p>\u201cShelby, I love you. In each day of our lives together, I will show my love. And where there is injury, I will pardon without hesitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere there is doubt, Luke, I will have faith in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn times of despair, you will be my hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn times of darkness, I will find my light in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen there is sadness, let me bring you joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, I will not so much seek to be consoled as to console.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will seek to understand, not just to be understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will love, not just crave love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pledge you my heart, my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I pledge mine to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI, Luke Riordan, take you, Shelby MacIntyre, to be wife, my best friend, my lover, my partner, the head of my family and other half of my heart. Forever.\u201d He slid a ring on her finger.</p><p>Shelby slid a ring onto his finger. \u201cI, Shelby MacIntyre, take you, Luke Riordan, to be my husband, best friend, lover, partner, head of my family and other half of my heart. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith God\u2019s blessing,\u201d Noah said. \u201cFather Demetrius and I pronounce you husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>The priest made the sign of the cross over them and invited them to seal their vows with a kiss.</p><p>As their lips met, the setting sun shone through the stained-glass window behind them, casting a glow over them. Ellie looked over their heads to Noah\u2019s eyes and smiled. The shine in his eyes lit her to the marrow in her bones.</p><p>He was home. And she was home with him. Forever. </p> </body></html>"]
