Though his office door stood open\u2014he wasn\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d to talk to her otherwise\u2014they were as alone as they\u2019d been in weeks. It was now or never. He had an important question to ask.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Raine. Your period is what, five days late?\u201d</p><p>Blood leached from her face. \u201cWha\u2014I... How would you even know that?\u201d</p><p>Because it was his business. After six years of being her mentor, caretaker, and employer, he\u2019d recently given in to his gnawing hunger and fucked her in every way known to man. And recklessly, he\u2019d done it without a condom. Since admitting how much he wanted her, he couldn\u2019t seem to stop. But the elaborate collar that now dangled from her neck strangled him with one indisputable fact: She was owned. Taken. Completely off limits. Property of another.</p><p>That son of a bitch, Liam O\u2019Neill. His former best friend.</p><p>\u201cKind of blows your theory that I\u2019ve always looked through you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He smirked. \u201cSince you came to Shadows, I\u2019ve kept tabs on your cycle every single month. You promised you\u2019d let me know if you were so much as a minute late. I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to scan through the pages of her notepad. \u201cI promised to tell you if I was pregnant. Right now, I don\u2019t know anything. We need to finish discussing the Thanksgiving menu. I hope you bought cranberry sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranberry sauce? Really?\u201d He cocked his head, his tone a warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Hammer.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, it was my cock riding your pussy, precious. So I\u2019m not shutting up until I have an answer.\u201d</p><p>A rosy flush suddenly stained her cheeks. Hammer smiled. She hadn\u2019t forgotten the passion they\u2019d shared any more than he had. It had haunted him, day after day, night after night...</p><p>Raine scrambled to her feet, clutching her notepad and pen. \u201cI have enough for the menu. We\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d he barked. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her things on his desk and crossed her arms, glaring up at him. The swells of her pillowy breasts spilled from her V-neck tank. She looked sexy when she was mad. \u201cSo you can harass me again?\u201d</p><p>Yes, Raine would see it that way. Christ, he needed to dial back on the confrontation, figure out how to drag information from her without distressing her even more.</p><p>\u201cSo we can finish talking. It\u2019s not my intention to upset you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She gave him a skeptical stare.</p><p>\u201cSit. Please.\u201d He waited until she complied, then he sat across from her. \u201cYou know I\u2019d normally rather fucking swallow glass than say I\u2019m sorry, but I owe it to you to shove this apology past my pride. That night, my need to mark you as mine overwhelmed my better judgment. It was selfish and reckless. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Raine sighed, some of the starch leaving her. \u201cYou were drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse. I was pissed off, too. And hurt. To me, Liam\u2019s claim on you didn\u2019t mean shit. He messed with your mind and played you, just like he played me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide if my relationship with him is meaningless. I was afraid, and Liam took care of me. He still does.\u201d</p> <p>A fact Hammer hated. \u201cWhy do you think he took such a sudden interest in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care? You and I were a mistake. Move on. I have.\u201d</p><p>No way. \u201cI made love to you that night, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed and looked away. \u201cAnd your \u2018love\u2019 was so meaningful, you couldn\u2019t wait the next morning to tell me that I wasn\u2019t woman enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer reached across the desk and grabbed her chin, forcing her gaze to his. \u201cSixteen days, ten hours, and thirty-seven minutes ago, I heard your screams of ecstasy as I drove into your sweet little pussy. And you were so much woman that it changed me.\u201d</p><p>Raine shivered in his grasp. She tried to act like he didn\u2019t affect her, but he knew her way too well to believe that.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want a slave you chain to your bed every night anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always want that.\u201d In fact, he could picture her as his, collared, naked, wet, kneeling... He swallowed down a surge of arousal. Raine wasn\u2019t built for that kind of submission, and he couldn\u2019t expect her to change for him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted you, too.\u201d He reluctantly released her. \u201cAnd every time you submit to Liam, I can hear that son of a bitch all over you through the thin walls. It hurts like hell, but I still listen and remember the taste of you on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d The pulse picked up at Raine\u2019s throat. She pushed out of her chair and whirled for the door, leaving her pad and pen behind.</p><p>Hammer rushed around the side of his desk and grabbed her elbow. He\u2019d tried not to crave her. Impossible. Raven hair, rosy lips, porcelain skin. Striking. Sensual. Soft-hearted. For weeks, he\u2019d struggled to overcome his addiction to Raine, but every time he looked at her, he suspected he\u2019d relapse really fucking soon.</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Her breathing sounded rushed, shallow. Aroused. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one more minute.\u201d As he pulled her closer, she trembled. \u201cFor six years, I wasn\u2019t honest with you about how I felt. I\u2019m sorry for that, too.\u201d He spun her around and delved into her blue eyes. \u201cBut I won\u2019t apologize for touching you. That would be a lie.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said as much as he could without confessing that he loved her and always would.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Hammer. You can\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo honest?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cInappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe passed inappropriate when Liam...\u201d Sank balls deep into your virgin ass, and I had to watch you thoroughly enjoy it. Hammer cleared his throat. \u201cClaimed you.\u201d</p><p>Her black lashes fell softly to her cheeks as she closed her eyes. \u201cMacen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done. You seem to have everything you\u2019ve ever wanted. If Liam makes you happy, I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Or he was trying to be. But standing this close to Raine and knowing he couldn\u2019t slide her beneath him again was eviscerating his restraint.</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never tolerated anyone blowing smoke up your ass. Neither will I.\u201d</p><p>Hammer pressed closer, barely resisting the urge to rub his hard cock against her. \u201cWhat do you want to hear? That it\u2019s not smoke I want to fill your ass with, precious?\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cI think you\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>Because she belonged to Liam. Right.</p><p>Hammer sighed. He\u2019d been the center of her life for years. Now Liam had stolen her away and taken his place. Hammer\u2019s only consolation was that he suspected she shared even less of herself with the Irish prick. Her stubborn, sometimes secretive behavior was a far cry from the loving deference a Master sought from his collared submissive. Which meant she probably wouldn\u2019t tell Liam about this conversation. She should, but...that was Raine. He loved her independence, even if it sometimes made his palm itch.</p><p>The vixen needed firm guidance. She might seem fragile on the surface, but her will could be iron. Idly, Hammer wondered if Liam would figure out that overindulging Raine wouldn\u2019t give her the boundaries she required before she crashed and burned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cBut I\u2019m being honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else, let me go. I\u2019ll have Thanksgiving dinner ready on Thursday at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more question. Has your period ever been late? I can\u2019t remember a single instance.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cLeave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. I didn\u2019t take responsibility for you like I should have that night, but by god, I will now. If your period hasn\u2019t started by Black Friday, you won\u2019t be shopping. I\u2019ll be taking you to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Raine jerked from his grip. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of visiting a doctor myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know you won\u2019t go without a push. Consider me your personal bulldozer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your responsibility anymore. I\u2019m Liam\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that a kick in the balls?</p><p>\u201cI want to be very clear, Raine. If you get a positive result from that test, everything changes. Every. Fucking. Thing. I will take care of you\u2014in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>In a flurry of dark hair, lace, and ruffles, Raine dashed toward the door. Hammer surged from his chair, caging her between the wall and his body, breathing on the back of her neck. God, she smelled good.</p><p>Fear, desire, dread\u2014he felt them all pinging off of her as she shivered. \u201cHammer...\u201d</p><p>Pulling together his restraint, he eased back, trying not to torture himself with what he couldn\u2019t have. Nearly three weeks without a woman\u2014without her\u2014was killing his self-control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you run away for now since it\u2019s what you do best, but I\u2019m not letting this go. Be ready by eight a.m. Friday morning.\u201d</p><p>Liam O\u2019Neill clutched the little box in his hand and rehearsed the speech in his head again. He prayed this package contained the key to his future with Raine. Maybe they could finally find some bloody happiness\u2014and he could convince her that he intended to stay. Would she stop hoarding chunks of herself then? Of course, she\u2019d push back at first, but she needed this. One day, she would agree.</p><p>As if his thoughts had conjured her up, his little hellcat tore out of Hammer\u2019s office and barreled down the hall, fists clenched. She nearly charged straight into him.</p><p>He pocketed the box. \u201cRaine?\u201d</p><p>She stopped short, trembling, blue eyes wide with panic. His fury\u2014always simmering these days\u2014began boiling.</p><p>Hammer, that fuckwit, had rattled her.</p><p>The need to protect rode Liam hard as he gripped her shoulders. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Raine\u2019s walls went up, and she shut down. Here we go again... Every day the same shit\u2014him struggling to reach her, her hiding behind her defenses. So far, no amount of gentle cajoling or patience had convinced her to believe in him. After a couple of weeks as her Master, he\u2019d seen only the merest glimpse into her soul.</p><p>Most men would have given up on her, but Liam\u2019s divorce had proven that if he wanted a relationship to last, he had to try harder. He\u2019d never bothered to work his way into his ex-wife\u2019s soul or bared his own to Gwyneth. He couldn\u2019t make that mistake with Raine. She\u2019d seized his heart, gripping it more tightly every day until he wondered if he could even breathe without her. He had no bloody idea if she would ever love him in return, but he\u2019d do whatever it took to earn her trust.</p><p>Liam pinned her to the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve asked you what happened. Answer me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to wriggle free. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>An evasion and a lie. Bloody hell.</p><p>Maybe things would be different if he could persuade her to leave Shadows, Hammer, and all the distractions. Maybe then he could win her over. But Raine refused to budge. This was the only place she\u2019d ever known safety, and she felt obligated to Hammer for taking her in as a teenage runaway. But that wasn\u2019t her only reason. How fucking long would she pine for a man who refused to give her any part of himself that wasn\u2019t temporarily engorged?</p><p>\u201cGive me the truth,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Worry furrowed her dark brows, strained her delicate face. \u201cJust hold me. Please don\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>Her begging reached into his chest and tugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure, love, as soon as you tell me what Hammer did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him. Or anything.\u201d</p><p>She clutched his lapels and brushed her lips over his. Then she did it again. Her next kiss turned urgent. He drowned in her sweet mouth for a lingering moment, knowing he should pull away.</p><p>Too often, Raine tempted him to carry her off to their bed, bare her pussy, and sink deep inside her when she sought to divert his attention. More than once, he\u2019d lost himself in the pleasure that eclipsed everything but the explosive desire between them. When he succumbed, they never discussed what troubled her\u2014which suited her fine and dandy. For Raine, talking through her problems was akin to peeling the flesh from her very bones.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t smiled in a week. Giving into her manipulation wasn\u2019t going to help that.</p><p>Liam forced himself to set her away. \u201cWait for me in our room. I\u2019ll be along in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it. Please.\u201d Raine plied him with another desperate kiss. \u201cI\u2019d rather be with you.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a stern scowl. \u201cWhat part of \u2018wait for me\u2019 did you not understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide that.\u201d He pointed down the hall. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she plodded down the hall, a sad slump pulling at her shoulders. Liam gritted his teeth against the stab of guilt. Sorting out this mess would do a lot more to help her than sex.</p><p>Dragging in a steadying breath, he watched her disappear into their room, then charged toward Hammer\u2019s office. Steeling himself, Liam shoved his way inside and slammed the door.</p><p>The bastard looked up from his paperwork and frowned.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d Liam demanded. \u201cI let Raine spend a few minutes with you, and she left distraught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come into my office looking for a fight, O\u2019Neill. You won\u2019t like how it ends, and neither will Raine. For some reason, she likes your face the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my sub?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Hammer stood with such force, his chair rolled and hit the metal filing cabinet behind his desk. \u201cWorried that I grabbed her tits? Copped a feel of her pussy? Fucked her? All with the door wide open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her. So whether the door was open or closed wouldn\u2019t matter if you thought you could get away with it. Of that, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Raine say? Or haven\u2019t you figured out yet how to make her communicate with you?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cI want your side of things.\u201d</p><p>Hammer snorted. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t tell you shit. Let me clue you in on a little secret: You\u2019ll need a crowbar to open her up when she walls herself off, like she\u2019s doing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no secret. I\u2019ll deal with that. Did you touch her, yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break the Code of Conduct.\u201d He tugged stiffly on his suit coat.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend that honoring the Code would mean a damn thing to you if not for your fellow Doms\u2019 disapproval. Respect Raine enough not to make this situation any more difficult and tell me what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not making it more difficult; I\u2019m ensuring that she runs back to me when you figure out she\u2019s more than you can manage. I know how to handle her.\u201d</p><p>The silky threat in Hammer\u2019s voice crawled up Liam\u2019s back. He swallowed an answering insult. He needed answers more than he needed a fight\u2014no matter how badly he wanted one. Hammer blamed him for losing Raine, obviously so enraged that he could barely see straight. And Liam couldn\u2019t forget\u2014or forgive\u2014that Hammer had done his bloody best to plant a seed in her womb the moment Liam took her for his own.</p><p>He rubbed at the knot at the back of his neck, staring at Macen. \u201cIf you care about her at all, put her needs first for once. Tell me what has her rattled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take any liberties, so stop busting my balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your balls. I\u2019m here to protect Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Hammer gave him a hard glare. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too worried. Do you know how many days late her period is? I sure as hell do.\u201d</p><p>There was the proverbial punch in the gut. Raine\u2019s monthly was late...just as he\u2019d suspected. Liam closed his eyes, damn near crippled where he stood.</p><p>Hammer knew the answer to the question Liam had asked Raine many times. No matter how Liam had tried to wrest it from her, she\u2019d danced around the truth, as though possibly being pregnant by another man was none of his goddamned business.</p> <p>What else was she keeping from him? Time to pry Raine open and find out.</p><p>Liam turned away and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Hammer called him back. \u201cI want you to know that night with Raine was the only time I haven\u2019t gloved up since Juliet. I\u2019m clean. She really is just scared and lashing out. It\u2019s how she copes. Don\u2019t take my mistake out on her.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t turn back, just curled his hands into fists. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Raine paced, wringing her hands, her head a tangle of a thousand thoughts. Damn it, she always let Hammer push her buttons. Why hadn\u2019t she gotten him out of her system? She bit her lip. In three days, he was going to force the truth on her, and it terrified her.</p><p>What if she was pregnant? God, did she even know how to feel about that? On the one hand, blessed. She loved kids. She loved Hammer. She loved the idea that her six years of unrequited love for him might bear fruit. On the other hand, if she was carrying the child of Liam\u2019s former friend, she didn\u2019t expect the man to stay. Despite his assurances, why would he?</p><p>As she fingered her collar, Raine felt her expression crumble. Crying wouldn\u2019t change the fact that she loved two very different men for very different reasons. If Liam left her... Well, she had no one to blame for her stupidity but herself.</p><p>Suddenly, the door opened, and she spun to face him, bracing herself for the confrontation she\u2019d desperately tried to avoid. He looked somewhere between somber and furious. Her heart sank. She had no doubt what he and Hammer had discussed. Today she\u2019d gotten the message loud and clear that Macen wanted to separate her from Liam. One topic could do that very quickly.</p><p>Raine ran to him and threw her arms around his neck, all too aware that if things turned out as she feared, this might be one of the last times she held him. She clung and inhaled his musky scent. He was all man. Her rock. Her greatest comfort. Her most tender lover. And he was slipping through her fingers because she was an eternal fuckup.</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d She pressed her lips to his, willing him to kiss her back, lower her to the bed, and forget about everything else.</p><p>He cupped her face and studied her. The dark eyes that usually caressed her with such caring now dissected her with a razor-sharp stare. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Panic seized her heart as Liam led her toward their bed. Though Raine knew she owed it to him to discuss her problems, that only made them more real.</p><p>As she sank to the mattress beside him, she looked into his beloved face. His stormy eyes wrenched her heart. She\u2019d done this to him, taken this strong, gorgeous man and turned him inside out. Guilt crushed her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we talk later?\u201d She caressed a hand down his chest, letting it drift lower and lower... \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Her eyes teared up. \u201cI\u2019m begging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d enjoy more than to bury myself between your thighs, love, but you can\u2019t distract me from this. Stop trying.\u201d</p><p>If they had this conversation now, it would only end in disaster. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. Hammer and I got into an argument. We were discussing the menu for Thanksgiving and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving?\u201d He scowled. \u201cDid you make plans of your own, then?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201cNot plans of my own. I just assumed... I always cook for Hammer.\u201d Immediately, she saw that Liam had taken her words the wrong way. \u201cWhat I mean is, I always cook so that he can host a Thanksgiving dinner for the \u2018orphans\u2019 of Shadows. You know, the people with no other family and nowhere else to go. They\u2019ll spend it alone if I don\u2019t fix this dinner, and it\u2019s too late to hire a caterer now.\u201d</p><p>Liam cursed. \u201cAnd when were you thinking of telling me? Am I even invited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Dismay spread through her. He looked angry. But worse, he looked hurt. \u201cI assumed you knew about the group dinner. We have it every year, but...\u201d Oh no. A fresh wave of worry overcame her. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t been here long enough to know. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t soften one bit.</p><p>Raine swallowed. \u201cReally. I\u2019ve been so...\u201d Preoccupied. \u201cBusy. I didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a special surprise planned just for the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Shit, she just kept digging herself a deeper hole with him. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think that you might want to do something else. Next year...\u201d</p><p>Raine couldn\u2019t finish that sentence. Next year, if nature had taken its course, she\u2019d have an infant, and Liam would be long gone. Even the thought filled her with terror. Still, what else could she do? Hammer and the others were counting on her. Serving this meal every Thanksgiving was one of her greatest pleasures.</p><p>\u201cIf we can do whatever you had planned on Thursday night, I\u2019d be thrilled and honored to go with you,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>And maybe, if she was lucky, Liam would have her somewhere else on Friday so she could avoid Hammer and the doctor appointment he\u2019d threatened. Yes, she was putting off the inevitable, but she just couldn\u2019t face the future now.</p><p>He glared at her, his face forbidding.</p><p>Raine rushed to reassure him. \u201cThursday night, I\u2019ll be done with my responsibilities here and I\u2019ll be all yours again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not all mine now, sub?\u201d He rose to his full height. \u201cAm I only your Sir when it\u2019s convenient for you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit... \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. Of course I\u2019m yours.\u201d Liam usually wasn\u2019t much for protocol and honorifics, but she couldn\u2019t mistake his demeanor. Raine resisted the urge to shrink back against the headboard. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>The title had almost no impact on him. He still glared at her with dark eyes full of disapproval. \u201cDon\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d God, she hated feeling unworthy, like she never did anything right.</p><p>\u201cThe private Thanksgiving I had planned for us? I\u2019ll flush that down the fucking toilet.\u201d</p><p>Her dread soared. \u201cI feel terrible about disappointing you, especially on Thanksgiving. I want to enjoy what you planned, but I can\u2019t let twenty-five others down. How can I make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy telling me how late your period is.\u201d</p><p>She felt the blood drain from her face. \u201cI told you last week that I wasn\u2019t late.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow jetted up. \u201cAnd this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He glowered, tangling his hand in her hair, pulling just enough for her to feel the sting.</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Now answer me. Hammer apparently knows exactly how late your period is, while I have no bloody clue.\u201d</p><p>Damn Hammer for not keeping his mouth shut. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s been counting days. I\u2019ve tried not to upset you\u2014or anyone\u2014until I knew something for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have some idea whether you\u2019re pregnant, Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I? I\u2019ve never worried about this.\u201d</p><p>Liam whirled away and stormed into the adjoining bathroom. After the rustle of plastic, he returned a moment later, carrying a box. He slammed it on her nightstand.</p><p>A pregnancy test.</p><p>Her heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cI bought this for you last night. Let\u2019s end the worrying.\u201d Liam crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>She backed away. \u201cDon\u2019t make me. Please...\u201d</p><p>Her pleading did absolutely nothing but make his expression colder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been patient.\u201d</p><p>He had been, just like he always was. She had no right to expect more. But she needed it so badly.</p><p>Raine shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m too scared to pee on that stick and find out for sure. I\u2019m afraid the truth will drive you away.\u201d</p><p>That was as honest as her courage allowed.</p><p>His mouth turned down in a disapproving scowl. \u201cIs that why you and Hammer fought?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe threatened to take me to the doctor on Friday if I still haven\u2019t started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted to avoid that so badly, you were going to \u2018let me\u2019 take you away Thursday night, after dinner at Shadows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really do want to be with you,\u201d she choked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About the test, Thanksgiving...\u201d She tried, but nothing would stop her tears. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be sorry. I want you to be honest,\u201d he shouted. \u201cOpen up and tell me what\u2019s bothering you. Your fears. Your insecurities. What the fuck you want for dinner. Whether or not you\u2019re pregnant. I\u2019m sick to death of being in the dark. I won\u2019t be treated like the bloody wanker you find ways to dodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, I swear. Liam...I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, but if you won\u2019t face the truth or trust me to help you...\u201d He gritted his teeth. \u201cThen my hands are tied.\u201d</p><p>Shame engulfed Raine. She knew she didn\u2019t share things with Liam the way she should. He\u2019d stripped her soul so naked once before, and she\u2019d cowered behind her walls since. They couldn\u2019t have a genuine exchange if she continued this way, but anxiety drove her to shut him out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d She couldn\u2019t make the tears and the sorrow stop. \u201cYou may not believe me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d believe you if you\u2019d take the damn test.\u201d</p><p>Raine crossed her arms over her chest, every muscle in her body shriveling. \u201cI\u2019m not ready. I can\u2019t face it. Not yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long do you need? How many days is enough? Or will you still be burying your head in the sand when you\u2019re giving birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long should it take me to accept that my whole life could be changing and I could lose everyone who means anything to me?\u201d she shouted back, tears streaming. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been patient. I know I\u2019m being illogical. I know you\u2019re pissed off. I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you tried when I had you alone at my lodge. You opened up that night. The minute I brought you back here to \u2018help\u2019 Hammer because he so desperately needed you...\u201d Liam rolled his eyes. \u201cYou stopped. You\u2019ve fed me nothing but shit since. Clearly, I overestimated your desire to submit to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is your problem? I\u2019ve told you time and again that I\u2019ll stand by you, no matter what. But I might as well be talking to a brick wall.\u201d He tossed his hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cBecause no man has ever lied to a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever lied to you, Raine?\u201d Mouth flattening into a grim white line, he released her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing else to say now.\u201d</p><p>Liam turned his back on her.</p><p>Shock blanched her system, followed by an icy drench of guilt. He hadn\u2019t lied to her\u2014ever. Her father had. Hammer had. And she\u2019d accused Liam of their sins.</p><p>Raine stood, looking at the tense set of his broad shoulders, his muscled back, his clenched fists. She forced herself to approach him. \u201cThat was unfair. I\u2019m sorry. Liam... You\u2019re right. You\u2019ve always been wonderful. I don\u2019t know how I could possibly deserve you.\u201d</p><p>No apology or verbal bridge-mending was going to reach him now. Raine wanted to tell Liam how much she loved him, but saying it now would seem disingenuous. And making herself that vulnerable to him petrified her.</p><p>God, she was like a yo-yo, swinging between revealing the vulnerability he coaxed from her and shrouding herself behind her barricades like a coward. Raine knew she couldn\u2019t keep holding out like this, but years of fears and insecurities didn\u2019t melt away overnight.</p><p>And that test on the nightstand\u2014the elephant in the room\u2014only magnified everything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI always manage to screw up everything good that happens to me. And you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>She worked up the courage to reach for his shoulder, but he jerked away. His rejection hurt like a physical blow.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t shut me out.\u201d Raine sniffled, dying inside. \u201cI want to open up and share everything with you... I\u2019m trying to trust and believe you. But I\u2019ve never done that with anyone. Honestly, I\u2019m lost. I\u2019m not trying to be a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He whirled around with narrowed eyes. \u201cDid you just swear at me?\u201d</p><p>Raine winced. \u201cIt slipped. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She just kept fucking up the words. He was too angry to hear them now anyway. Time to show Liam how much he meant to her. She only knew one way to do that.</p><p>With shaking fingers, Raine peeled off her lacy tank, shimmied out of her short skirt, unclasped her bra, then removed the last of her barriers, her thong. With shaking hands, she folded everything at his feet and sank to her knees, bowing her head. \u201cPunish me, Sir. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve more than earned it.\u201d</p><p>As the weight of his words settled over her, Raine felt his stare rake her, scorch her. She couldn\u2019t stop trembling.</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d A hint of coaxing warmed his voice as he hooked a finger under her chin and lifted it. She had no choice but to meet his gaze. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p> <p>Despite his size and strength, Liam was gentle at heart. Of course, he\u2019d punished her before, but always in a way designed to make her think more than hurt. Right now, he was all big bad Dom. Though she\u2019d never seen this side of him, he didn\u2019t frighten her. In fact, as anxious as she was, his power was like a beacon. She was deeply drawn to it.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen present.\u201d</p><p>Her tummy knotted as she leaned forward and skimmed her palms along the rug until they stretched above her head. Ass lifting from her heels, she arched up in offering to him and rested her forehead on the carpet. Then Liam knelt beside her.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d His too-controlled tone sent a chill down her spine. She forced herself to comply, bracing for the worst. The heat of his body surrounded her. His warm breath fluttered over her ear. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared and worried about the \u2018what ifs.\u2019 But I\u2019ve told you over and over that I expect you to share everything with me. You\u2019re not doing that.\u201d</p><p>Her heart wanted to. Her head hadn\u2019t yet gotten the memo.</p><p>\u201cFive days.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI\u2019m late by five days.\u201d</p><p>Liam sucked in a breath like she\u2019d punched him with her words. Raine closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you to look at me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and did as he\u2019d commanded, wishing he wouldn\u2019t force her to see his disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAre your cycles often irregular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since I lived with my dad. I think stress caused it. I\u2019m under a lot of pressure now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, some bloody honesty. Was it really so hard for you to tell me that?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to start the conversation. \u2018Hi, honey. I\u2019m worried I might be pregnant by your best friend.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared the results will disappoint you. I hate that.\u201d Tears flowed again. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>The silence dragged on. Pain and frustration filled his face. God, she just kept hurting him. Maybe it would be better if she left. She hated to stay where she only made matters worse, and the urge to escape now pressed down on her chest until she couldn\u2019t breathe. But he and Hammer were both right; she always ran. She couldn\u2019t honestly say that she\u2019d done her part to hold the relationship together if she left now.</p><p>\u201cSay something. Please...\u201d</p><p>Liam sat back on the bed, his face closed. \u201cPut yourself across my lap and spread your thighs for me. Show me your cunt. I want to see what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Raine rose from her knees and stepped closer, knowing any display of uncertainty would only make the punishment more painful\u2014not physically. She wasn\u2019t concerned about that. But mentally? Emotionally?</p><p>She tried to snare his gaze, but he looked right through her. Disquiet filled her all over again. Still, she dredged up the courage to sprawl across Liam\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cTell me your safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Liam gave her a sharp nod. \u201cCount until I stop.\u201d</p><p>Raine drew in a rough breath, knowing he\u2019d light into her ass at any moment. Instead, he made her wait. She twitched, wondering when he\u2019d get on with it. The seconds dragged into minutes, which seemed like days. Still, he did nothing for a long, silent while but stare at her vulnerable bare backside. She resisted the urge to fidget.</p><p>Finally, he smacked her ass, his hand branding her with the feel of his palm and each finger. It burned into her like fiery, oozing lava. And it was oddly soothing.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d She sobbed.</p><p>He kept going.</p><p>Today, he didn\u2019t warm her up and he didn\u2019t hold back. Each slap stung like a bitch. Pain sizzled over her skin, burned down into her flesh. He scorched her through and through. She focused on the sensations he gave her and welcomed them.</p><p>Slowly, with each rhythmic smack, the cacophony of thoughts all yelling through her brain quieted. Suddenly, there was a blessed peace, broken only by the whoosh of his hand, the slap and its echo reverberating through the room, the high-pitched sounds of her crying out the count, his heavy breathing...before the cycle started again. Somewhere along the way, she lost count and lost herself, fading out to a lovely place where she began to float away from all her problems. From everything but Liam, her anchor. Her love.</p><p>Raine didn\u2019t know how much time had passed when the spanking abruptly stopped. Her muscles felt like melted chocolate, her thoughts like oozing honey. She breathed him in as he grazed his big palm over her hot flesh.</p><p>Long moments passed as she curled her arms around his leg, holding tight. \u201cThank you, Sir. I feel calmer.\u201d</p><p>As he sat her up on his lap, Liam ran a soothing hand down her spine and cradled her to his chest. Her head lolled back, and she stared up at him, feeling her heart in her eyes. That didn\u2019t scare the hell out of her as much as it used to.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d Raine whispered. \u201cHow do you always know what I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did. I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers, but I\u2019m here and I can bear the burden. Do you not realize how much I need to do that for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cStop telling me what you think I want to hear. Show me.\u201d</p><p>Raine wanted to please him. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer her, just lifted her up and laid her out on the bed, bound her wrists in the cuffs attached to the frame, then grabbed her ankles and spread her legs wide. Despite all her angst, arousal bloomed. She ached for his attention, but stilled her writhing to please him. Raine knew she didn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded, but she needed him desperately.</p><p>He tore free of his clothes, dropping them where he stood. She watched hungrily. The sight\u2014strong jaw, broad chest, corrugated abdomen, muscled thighs, and a hard cock in between\u2014made her yearn for him. His rigid flesh jerked in need as he crawled between her splayed thighs.</p><p>With a feral gleam in his eyes, he hovered over her and stroked his long, thick shaft. A mewl of impatience slipped from her lips.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want, Raine?\u201d With his free hand, he dragged his finger through the folds of her moistening slit and teased her clit. \u201cWhat you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Instead of giving her more, he lifted his finger away. His expression blanked.</p><p>\u201cSir. Sorry. Yes, please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her what she wanted. \u201cDo you like it when I share myself with you? Does it make you feel close to me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreasured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like watching me stroke myself, don\u2019t you, Raine? Does it make your cunt juicy with desire? Do you want my dominance? Ache for me to fuck you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded feverishly. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, love,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHow do you want me? In your ass? Down your throat? Filling that tight pussy until you\u2019re mindless with wanting to spill over me as you come?\u201d</p><p>He circled her straining clit. She moaned in utter supplication, her stare riveted to his every move, silently begging for more.</p><p>\u201cAny of it. All of it,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you want me.\u201d His silky rasp reverberated in her ear. \u201cI smell your arousal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d she cried breathlessly.</p><p>Then his voice hardened to steel. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you understand, Raine. You will tell me what hurts you, keeps you awake, frightens or upsets you, makes you laugh and cheer and every fucking thing in between because you are mine. Until now, you\u2019ve given me nothing except what I yank out of you under duress. Even then, you dance pretty around the periphery, clinging to me with your soft body and batting your lashes to distract me from your problems. I\u2019ve given you a lot of slack in your rope. All you\u2019ve managed to do is hang yourself.\u201d</p><p>His words sliced her to the bone with guilt. From the time he\u2019d approached her about becoming the best submissive she could be until this moment, he\u2019d tried everything to reach her. Still, she remained half-frozen\u2014in love with him but torn. Yearning to surrender everything but terrified.</p><p>\u201cI know I need to do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to decide what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Liam. Always you. Your touch. Your approval. Your understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to do your part. I won\u2019t tolerate just some of your effort or half of your soul anymore.\u201d</p><p>He meant it. Raine saw the gravity on his stern face, in the hard glint of his eyes. If she wanted to keep him, she had to find the courage to surrender. She had to figure out how to give him the power to hurt her and trust that he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Raine teared up. \u201cYou\u2019re so capable of making a woman feel special and showering her with devotion.\u201d She didn\u2019t see what she could possibly give him in return, and didn\u2019t that sound pathetic? \u201cI feel like I\u2019m bringing you nothing but problems. Wouldn\u2019t you rather just have my body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have your body, sub, splayed out and wet just the way I want it.\u201d Again he teased her cunt, sliding his thumb upward to rub her clit while inserting first one, then two fingers through her cream and deep inside her. \u201cMaking you beg and scream has been a heady pleasure from the start.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raine cried out and arched up for more, trying to drown the dread snaking through her with the euphoria of his touch.</p><p>He bent to her ear, his voice brutally gentle. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem communicating when I\u2019m fucking you into oblivion.\u201d Then he withdrew his fingers, leaving her cold. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d Liam tapped her forehead, right between the eyes. \u201cThis is where I lose you, where all our troubles lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I know. I said I\u2019d try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what you meant is that you\u2019ll find more creative ways to hide from me. Close your mouth. Don\u2019t deny it. If you lie, I\u2019ll truly punish you and I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Foreboding mixed with her arousal to create something so confusing, Raine had no idea what to say. \u201cI understand, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove to me that I\u2019m important enough for you to knock down your walls and learn to trust. Show me I\u2019m not wasting my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. But it\u2019s not that simple. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>His brows slashed down in a thunderous frown. \u201cReally? Your father hurt you and Hammer pretended he didn\u2019t want you for years, so now you think you\u2019re not good enough for any man, and if I see the real you, I\u2019ll run screaming in the other direction like some bloody nancy? Is that what you think I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><p>God, it was as if he\u2019d shoved her in front of a mirror, then sliced her to the bone so he could force her to watch herself bleed. Though she\u2019d done her best to hide, he still saw right through her. It felt like being naked in the middle of a crowd. Panic threatened. She tugged at her bonds, struggling, though she knew it was pointless.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Liam growled. \u201cDamn it, Raine, how do you expect to learn to surrender when you spend so much of your energy fighting me and yourself?\u201d</p><p>She had nowhere to escape his penetrating stare. Her heart chugged. The moment felt so intimate. So petrifying.</p><p>Raine closed her eyes and turned her head away.</p><p>He grabbed her cheeks and forced her to look back at him. She didn\u2019t have the guts to open her eyes and see what was on his face. Disappointment? Anger? Scorn?</p><p>\u201cThe only way you\u2019ll be escaping me now is by using your safe word. Say it or look at me.\u201d</p><p>Using her safe word when he wasn\u2019t physically hurting her would be the coward\u2019s way out. He was trying to help her learn to give more of herself. She needed this lesson. But he\u2019d already seen so deeply inside her, more than maybe anyone ever...</p><p>On that fateful morning he\u2019d offered to train her, he\u2019d told her that he intended to split her open like a ripe peach. She\u2019d been almost smug in the belief that she\u2019d never give him that power. Damn, she\u2019d been a fool.</p><p>Hitching in a sob, she forced herself to open her eyes, though she couldn\u2019t see him through her thick tears.</p><p>A voice in her head told her that sharing all of herself wouldn\u2019t be as scary as facing an executioner. It would probably be beautiful. Raine still didn\u2019t know if she could do it.</p><p>\u201cI know the fact that I\u2019m not giving myself over to you is damaging. I just keep trying to solve my problems so I don\u2019t have to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>In her head, Raine did. A plea for his reassurance sat on the tip of her tongue, but she silenced it. She had to give him control.</p><p>\u201cRaine...\u201d He wiped her tears away, his fingers terribly gentle.</p><p>Her heart wept. Liam was so kind, so tender... She blinked up at him, resisting her every instinct to crawl back inside herself and hide.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Stay with me now.\u201d</p><p>He eased down her body, his lips dragging over her skin, sucking slowly at each nipple before he lowered his mouth to her pussy and took a long, slow lick. She shuddered with the sensations of her soul splitting open and oozing need, her body wired and alive.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThe taste of you, love... So perfect on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she sobbed and writhed. \u201cHelp me. Tell me... What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Raine. All of you. From the sweet to the tart and everything in between.\u201d He sucked her clit between his lips, pulling and scraping the bud with his teeth. She arched her hips, desperate for more of his mouth on her. Liam only pulled back and slapped her clit. \u201cYou\u2019re not in control here. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a cry, her pain melding to pleasure as he slid two fingers in deep, grazing the sensitive bundle of nerves.</p><p>\u201cWe could be so good together, if you\u2019d just trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d she swore.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I want to be the man you finally let in.\u201d</p><p>His incessant fingers drove into her pussy, his thumb swirling over her clit. Panting and whimpering, she arched, waiting and hoping for his command to come.</p><p>\u201cYou burn so sweetly for me. And you\u2019re so close to orgasm you can almost taste it, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her quivering pussy, then straddled her body. His engorged cock hovered inches from her mouth, the weeping crest glistening. Mouth watering, she opened to take him deep between her lips.</p><p>Instead, he leaned over her and unfastened the cuffs, setting her free. Then he rolled to her side, no longer touching her. \u201cAll right, then. Stroke your pussy for me, Raine. Make yourself come. Show me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>Raine would far rather have Liam touch her, but he\u2019d given her a direct order. He was allowing her pleasure. She didn\u2019t dare question him or ask for more.</p><p>With a jagged sigh, she slid her fingers to her swollen clit. In seconds, she was panting, falling over the edge as a hard, fast climax tore through her. Even as her thighs tensed and her body shook, the orgasm was hollow, a parody of pleasure. It left her wanting.</p><p>And she knew exactly what was missing... Liam.</p><p>Reaching for him, Raine murmured his name.</p><p>He grasped her wrists. \u201cDid you enjoy that?\u201d</p><p>Physically, she had. But emotionally, knowing that he hadn\u2019t allowed her to give him pleasure in return left her feeling wretched, empty, and wracked with guilt. \u201cNot without you. I feel like...you gave and I took, but it was one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He backed away from her and off the bed. \u201cNow you know what I feel every damn time you try to satisfy me with scraps of yourself. I can\u2019t dominate what you won\u2019t submit. I\u2019ve tried to do it all for us, but I can\u2019t, no matter how much I want you.\u201d</p><p>His words were a silken slide down a razor blade, delivered so softly. But it cut her heart wide open.</p><p>He picked up his clothes and silently began to dress. Raine sat up and watched, pressing her lips together in mute horror and trying to hold onto her tears. There was no sense arguing with him when he was right.</p><p>Once he\u2019d zipped his pants, Liam looked down at her with such profound sadness. \u201cHear me well. Half of you is no longer an option, Raine. I\u2019ll have all or nothing. I won\u2019t make you take the test before Thanksgiving. That gives you almost three days to prepare yourself for the result. But if you haven\u2019t started by Friday, you will be going to the doctor. I\u2019ll be taking you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Liam resisted the urge to slam the door between him and Raine. As he eased out, he released a ragged breath. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t see Hammer. But Liam had few doubts that his old mate had been listening to his entire exchange with Raine through the wall. The fuckwit probably itched to insist again that she was more challenge than he could master.</p><p>Unfortunately, Liam\u2019s problems didn\u2019t end there. His cock stood as hard as a ship\u2019s stern and twice as swollen. His balls ached so badly he couldn\u2019t walk straight, let alone think. As he adjusted himself, he considered finding an empty room and some privacy. Of course, he\u2019d ten times rather have drowned in Raine, helpless and tethered to his bed. The ferocious need to own her all the way to her pretty toes twisted him inside. But no matter which way he took her or how often, Raine never truly surrendered.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d finally reached her today. At least she\u2019d been more honest. But did that mean anything? Raine was like a damn jigsaw puzzle. The tactic that revealed a part of her today wouldn\u2019t work tomorrow. Just after he\u2019d collared her, he\u2019d whisked her up to his lodge and chipped away at her defenses until she\u2019d exposed her soft side. Now that he\u2019d breached her again, he feared she would only hide once more.</p><p>Liam resisted the urge to punch the wall. Where the hell did he go from here? He couldn\u2019t give up. If he ever solved her, the heart he uncovered would be big and beautiful. And his.</p><p>If that day never came... Hell, he didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>In his pocket, his phone buzzed. Liam grabbed it and scanned the screen, smiling at the name of his friend and fellow Dominant back home.</p><p>\u201cHello, Seth.\u201d Liam ducked into an empty room down the hall. \u201cEnjoying the snow in New York?\u201d</p><p>The other man scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be enjoying it soon yourself, so don\u2019t gloat too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be home for Thanksgiving?\u201d No mistaking the surprise in Seth\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not. I made other plans, but they fell through. Now it\u2019s too late to get a flight, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I\u2019ll have to fist this turkey all alone?\u201d</p><p>Liam rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a sick bastard, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd proud of it. So why are you staying in L.A. for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, I don\u2019t want to freeze my balls off,\u201d Liam teased.</p><p>\u201cIt might be cold as fuck here, but at least I don\u2019t have to worry about the state falling into the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Liam leaned against the wall and rubbed a thumb and forefinger at his gritty eyes. \u201cLook, I know I said I\u2019d come back for the week, but circumstances have changed. There\u2019s this woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty and a spitfire, Seth. You\u2019ll like her, assuming I can ever figure out how to persuade her to come home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that serious? You haven\u2019t spent more than fifteen minutes of \u2018quality time\u2019 with anyone since Gwyneth, but it sounds like you have more than a hard-on for this girl. What\u2019d she do, put you under some kind of spell with her voodoo pussy?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed for the first time all day. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re always cool, collected, and smart. You\u2019ll figure out how to sweep her off her feet. If not, you know some awesome knots. Just tie her up and carry her away.\u201d Seth chuckled. \u201cWhat about Hammer? When we talked last month, you said he wasn\u2019t himself. Did you figure out what\u2019s up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, funny that. His problem is the same as mine. Raine. She\u2019s the girl I told you Hammer took in years ago, remember? He\u2019s in love with her. The fucked up part is that she\u2019s in love with him, too.\u201d Liam sighed. \u201cAnd now, she\u2019s wearing my collar, but there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019s knocked up with Hammer\u2019s bairn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! What the... It sounds like a fucking soap opera.\u201d</p><p>Liam grunted. \u201cIt feels like a fucking soap opera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did all that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor years, Hammer refused to admit how he felt about her. But he wouldn\u2019t allow any other man near her. I tried to help them both, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp? Meaning that you gave her attention to see if Hammer would claim her in a jealous fit?\u201d</p><p>Seth knew him well. \u201cRaine needed a bloody guiding hand and some damn affection. What woman doesn\u2019t deserve that? Hammer sure as fuck wasn\u2019t giving it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he finally did or she wouldn\u2019t be knocked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he did. As soon as I took her for my own. So now he hates my fucking guts. I\u2019m not too fond of him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Seth whistled.</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cJesus bloody wept, it really does sound as fucked up as it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo which one of you is Raine actually with now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be me, but I don\u2019t rightly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shit are you guys smoking out there?\u201d Seth huffed.</p><p>\u201cI almost wish I had some. Half the time, I don\u2019t know whether to laugh, scream, or jump off a bloody bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the easy answer. Share her, like you did Juliet.\u201d</p><p>It sounded so simple. Nothing could be more impossible.</p><p>\u201cNo chance in hell,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You\u2019d both get the girl. She\u2019d feel more secure, get more guidance...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer may have shared his wife with me, but Raine? I think he\u2019d rather castrate himself. I don\u2019t want that daft prick touching her, either. Besides, he seems convinced that sharing Juliet caused her death. I\u2019m not sure why exactly, but he won\u2019t risk it again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes and didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that a thousand times. Hammer and I have never talked about the end. He was so shut down, and I wasn\u2019t there. I never wanted to pry. I just know that Juliet wasn\u2019t communicating with either one of us. Neither is Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Do you think she\u2019s unstable enough to pull a Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. She\u2019s emotional but bloody obstinate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should tread carefully until you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cI know, but...I\u2019m in deep, man. I love this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cOh dude, but if her heart belongs to Hammer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cares for me, too. At least, I think she does. But Raine is confused, Seth. And so damn vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that suggesting you pack a bag and take a red-eye home is out of the question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck that. I don\u2019t hear a fat lady singing yet. It\u2019s not over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not wearing earplugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019d like to, but Raine\u2019s crumbling. I can\u2019t leave her now. Everyone else in her life has.\u201d</p><p>Seth blew out a stunned breath. \u201cDo you have a game plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it. First, I need to find out if Raine is pregnant. Then...we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she is, what the fuck are you going to do?\u201d</p> <p>Liam shook his head as the image of Raine swelling with Hammer\u2019s spawn made him grit his teeth. \u201cNot much I can do except be there for her. But fuck...\u201d</p><p>The silence hung between them, the gravity of the conversation weighing them both down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the hell you\u2019re going through.\u201d And Seth\u2019s voice said that he meant it. \u201cEither way, you need to reach Raine before she falls apart. I know you\u2019ll hate this idea, but can Hammer do it? Does she trust him?\u201d</p><p>Did she? Liam had always assumed she did. But Hammer had figured out how late her period was; Raine hadn\u2019t volunteered the information. So maybe not. \u201cAs much as she trusts anyone, I suspect, but it\u2019s not a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a suggestion, but maybe you and Hammer need to stop trying to claim your territory by planting your um...flag, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd work your shit out,\u201d Seth continued. \u201cIt might take both of you to reach her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t lift a fucking finger to help me now.\u201d Not that he wanted Hammer\u2019s help.</p> <p>That saddened Liam, too. Over a decade of friendship gone in a flash, ripped apart by their unyielding determination to possess and claim the same woman.</p><p>What a bloody fucking debacle.</p><p>\u201cOne of you has to swallow your pride. Working together might help you and Hammer kiss and make up. You\u2019ve been friends too long to fight like this,\u201d Seth pointed out. \u201cRemember, Raine has to come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. But she has to want to do the work. So far, she\u2019s dodged every attempt I\u2019ve made to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not trying at all? That changes a lot, then.\u201d</p><p>They talked about Raine\u2019s behavior and pounded out a rough idea designed to help him reach her.</p><p>\u201cYou hate it.\u201d Seth didn\u2019t even ask; he knew.</p><p>\u201cEvery bit,\u201d Liam admitted. \u201cBut I see the wisdom. I\u2019ll have to think on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a move to make lightly, for sure,\u201d Seth advised. \u201cBut you won\u2019t be happy unless you\u2019ve earned her whole heart and total surrender.\u201d</p><p>The following morning, Raine chopped some nuts for a loaf of banana bread, pausing to flip on the light in the oven to check her red velvet cake. Fresh baked chocolate chip cookies cooled on her left. Their scent wafted to her nose and should have tantalized her. But it didn\u2019t. Hammer\u2019s favorite, apple spice muffins, sat on the table behind her. Their smell should have perked her up too, but no. The yeasty bread rising under the dish towel nearby looked ready for the oven. She\u2019d already baked a plate of cinnamon rolls and set them nearby.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t any calmer than when she\u2019d walked into the kitchen at three a.m.</p><p>Liam hadn\u2019t come to bed last night\u2014at least not the bed they shared. Raine tried desperately not to believe that he\u2019d found someone else\u2019s. Never before had he disappeared without a word. But she knew exactly what he meant to convey: he was more than frustrated with her refusal to take the pregnancy test, Thanksgiving... everything.</p><p>If something didn\u2019t change, she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep him much longer. At the thought, panic gripped her throat.</p><p>She\u2019d texted him this morning to tell him that she missed him, but he hadn\u2019t replied. Her only consolation was that his clothes still hung in the closet. She hoped that meant he was coming back, but she was also aware that he could send for them from New York.</p><p>What if she\u2019d driven him away for good? She pressed her hand to her lips to hold in a sob.</p><p>In the doorway behind her, she felt a presence. Just by the way the air stirred, she knew Hammer stood, watching her. He\u2019d see all the baked goods\u2014and he\u2019d know exactly what they meant.</p><p>She dragged in a steadying breath, then dumped the nuts from the chopper into the batter, avoiding his gaze. \u201cGood morning. I\u2019m just baking. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>Hammer crossed the room and stepped into her personal space, telling her without a word that she wasn\u2019t going to escape whatever he had to say. His thick fingers gripped the counter near her waist, and she felt his body heat along her back. Why the hell hadn\u2019t she worn more than her panties and a tank top? Under his stare, she felt naked.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks delicious, precious. Tell me, is it that bad?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to shrug. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bored, so I baked.\u201d</p><p>A humorless chuckle rolled from the back of his throat. \u201cThis is me you\u2019re talking to. You only bake enough for an army when you\u2019re deeply troubled. Tell me, did the bed feel a little empty last night?\u201d</p><p>Why the hell was he taunting her?</p><p>She slammed her spoon on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your goddamn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d He waited until she complied with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this official club business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam may let you negotiate. You know I won\u2019t. Sit down. Now.\u201d</p><p>She braced her hands on his chest, pushing him away. \u201cWhat the fuck do you want from me? To hear that I screwed up? Yep. You\u2019re right. I royally muffed everything. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam is sleeping off a bottle in a spare bedroom down the hall.\u201d He paused, his voice softening. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>God, he could have said most anything else to her and she would have held it together. A fight? Bring it on. She\u2019d love one of those now. Instead, he\u2019d disarmed her with compassion. Damn him.</p><p>She and Hammer might have had a bumpy personal relationship, and he might have blown arctic and heat wave on her in the past, but he was still the person she trusted most on this planet. She knew without a doubt that he always wanted what was best for her\u2014even if they had different ideas about what that was. So Raine had a hard time resisting the urge to throw herself against him and cry out her concerns, wrapped in his familiar arms. She couldn\u2019t. He would take on her burdens without hesitation, but that wasn\u2019t fair to either him or to Liam.</p><p>She had to keep it to herself. And that made her feel so damn alone.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Please don\u2019t make this tougher for me. If you\u2019re here to remind me that this is day six without a period, believe me, I know.\u201d</p><p>With a grim expression, he pulled out a chair and extended his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about your period. Friday will come soon enough.\u201d He poured a cup of coffee, then plucked a muffin from the plate and took a bite. And he moaned. \u201cYou spoil me with these. They\u2019re the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. Now put your ass in the chair.\u201d</p><p>Raine hesitated. There would be no avoiding him. Tenacious bastard.</p><p>With a sigh, she eased her butt, still sore from Liam\u2019s paddling, onto the hard wooden chair, trying not to wince.</p><p>\u201cA little tender, are you, precious?\u201d he drawled. \u201cYeah, I heard.\u201d</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that completely embarrassing? \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I like hearing you moan, even if it\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. Then when a little ache tightened behind her clit, guilt pricked her. She looked away. \u201cHammer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I was going to be honest from now on, remember?\u201d He sat at the head of the table and leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be honest, too. I don\u2019t want to discuss Liam with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad because we\u2019re going to chat. Look at me, Raine.\u201d She raised her gaze and wished her heart didn\u2019t stutter in her chest every time he stared at her. \u201cWhat did Liam punish you for yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to guess? You couldn\u2019t wait to tell him how late I was. I\u2019d been holding him off with vague answers, trying not to worry him until there was something to worry about. But you basically goaded him into demanding I take a pregnancy test. When I refused, we stumbled onto the topic of Thanksgiving...and now everything is a fucking mess. Don\u2019t be surprised if he packs up and leaves.\u201d At the thought of never being with Liam again, tears spilled like acid from her tired eyes. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be to blame for both coming between you and your best friend, and driving away one of the kindest men I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Raine stood, her chair scraping the tile floor. She tried to dart past Hammer. Since he sat between her and the door, he merely leaned back and grabbed her wrist. He stood, his heavy brows slashing down with...what? Anger? Concern?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re unhappy with me, take a number.\u201d She swiped at the hot tears on her cheeks. \u201cI should have left, you know. That night we fought. If I had just walked out, you and Liam would still be pals. You\u2019d both be happier. And I wouldn\u2019t be around to fuck everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Raine, and stop beating yourself up.\u201d Hammer exhaled, his stare heavy. He waited until she complied, then sat again. \u201cNow talk to me.\u201d</p><p>God, she didn\u2019t want to spill her guts. Just the thought of this conversation made her stomach roll. And Liam would be furious if she opened up to another man, especially Hammer.</p><p>Shaking her head, Raine blinked back more tears. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then listen. You didn\u2019t come between Liam and me. I don\u2019t want you carrying that weight on your narrow shoulders, girl. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve butted heads, and I can pretty much guarantee it won\u2019t be the last. We may not have fought this seriously before, and I might be pissed as hell at him now, but I still love him like a brother.\u201d</p><p>He tried to smile, but she could see it was strained at best. Another avalanche of guilt pressed down on her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Liam punish you?\u201d he asked again. \u201cIf it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t started your period yet, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not why, and you can\u2019t. What happened yesterday between Liam and me is our business. But you\u2019re smart. You can read between the lines. Put yourself in his shoes and imagine why you\u2019d be deeply disappointed. You won\u2019t be far off the mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can read between the lines, but I want you to explain it to me. Let me hear your interpretation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this to me? Stop trying to pry me apart. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s done. The lesson for me is that I suck at relationships.\u201d</p><p>Hammer slammed his fist on the table, rattling the plate of muffins and her nerves. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, he didn\u2019t like the way I tried to spare him the pregnancy scare. I hate dumping my crap on him. Or on you. I\u2019m capable of taking care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the fucking question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d she insisted. \u201cGod, you\u2019re like a damn dog with a bone. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>Hammer leaned back in his chair, crossed his arms over his wide chest, and flattened his mouth into a tight line. His pissed-off Dom face.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good...</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me what submissive rule you broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably all of them. Why do you give a shit?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Hammer stood and walked to the counter. He grabbed a clean wooden spoon and returned to the table, hovering over her and clutching it in a white-knuckled grip. \u201cWhat lesson was Liam teaching you? You either tell me now or I\u2019m going to bend you over the table and beat your ass with this.\u201d</p><p>Raine hunkered down in her seat and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she hated sounding like a pouty teenager. She needed to get her shit together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn a fucking heartbeat,\u201d Hammer tossed back.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to remind you again that I\u2019m not yours to punish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about your needs more than I care about Liam throwing a hissy. And frankly, I think if he\u2019d seen the way you behaved this morning, he\u2019d agree with me. Now talk or I\u2019m going to enjoy every fucking whack.\u201d</p><p>Ugh, talk! She hated that word. But at least being angry with Hammer was better than being the guest of honor at her own pity party. \u201cCommunication, all right? I wasn\u2019t totally honest, I guess. And he thinks I don\u2019t trust him. God, do you have to badger me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously I do.\u201d He set the spoon down gently and sat again. \u201cAnd I suggest you stop provoking me to change the direction of the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d kind of figured he was onto her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid Liam is going to leave you? Well, if you behave with him the way you just did with me, I guarantee he\u2019ll walk out that door and not look back. A Dom thrives on total surrender. You\u2019re not letting go. You\u2019ll have to, Raine, in order to receive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d Sadness, anger, and disappointment in herself all formed a lump in her throat that threatened to choke her. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. But you\u2019re too fucking stubborn for your own good. Do you like being this miserable? You must. You\u2019re not doing a thing to change it, and you\u2019re the only one who can.\u201d</p> <p>Raine bit her lip, despair rolling over her. How did she change herself? \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI can see how badly you\u2019re falling apart. Don\u2019t think for one second that Liam can\u2019t, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRooting for your rival?\u201d She swiped at her leaking eyes. \u201cThings were easier when you thought of me as your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be a twisted fuck, but I\u2019d never masturbate to thoughts of my sister, precious.\u201d</p><p>She felt a flush crawl up her cheeks as heat burst through her body. It might be wrong, but on some level it gratified her to know that Hammer wasn\u2019t any more immune to her than she was to him.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m walking a thin line even talking to you like this since you wear Liam\u2019s collar. So instead, consider this some friendly advice. Stop being so damn afraid to share yourself. If you won\u2019t be honest with Liam, then for fuck\u2019s sake, take his collar off and stop wasting his time.\u201d</p> <p>This tumultuous crap plaguing her, mostly of her own doing, completely exhausted Raine. But she didn\u2019t know how to get off the merry-go-round. She didn\u2019t know how to stop hurting. \u201cI need him.\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed in Hammer\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen you have a decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Liam said.\u201d Morosely, she snagged a muffin from the plate and picked at it. \u201cAre you pushing me so hard toward him because you still think you\u2019re bad for me?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a change in you. As much as I hate to admit it, that\u2019s Liam\u2019s doing. He reached you in a way I hadn\u2019t. Obviously not deep enough yet.\u201d</p><p>She laughed bitterly. \u201cWe both know he\u2019ll give up before then, if he hasn\u2019t already. I\u2019m kidding myself if I think that ripping my soul open for him is going to make much difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you go through life scared that the other shoe is going to drop, you\u2019re going to miss out on a hell of a lot of good things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she whispered. But trusting that someone would be there tomorrow? Nothing was more difficult\u2014or terrifying\u2014for her.</p><p>\u201cRaine...\u201d He swallowed tightly and leaned toward her, cupping her chin with his broad hand. \u201cAm I bad for you? Probably. You\u2019re not wired for what I want, and I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I crushed your spirit. But I\u2019m happy you\u2019re in my life. Will I always want more? Yes. Is that your fault? No.\u201d He bent, his hazel eyes delving deep. \u201cI want you to be happy. Promise me you\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u201d</p> <p>He was willing to sacrifice his heart for hers. It was kind and noble\u2014two things that didn\u2019t come easily for Hammer.</p><p>Raine had never felt more unworthy in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen learn. It will be uncomfortable, maybe even painful, but you can. Now do it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The tantalizing aromas of Thanksgiving dinner made Hammer\u2019s mouth water as he entered the dungeon, now transformed into a makeshift dining area, complete with buffet tables, draped in turkey-themed cloths. He cast a nod to the club members seated at the long table as several submissives carried in platters of food, adding them to the already bountiful spread.</p><p>Raine set a heaping bowl of mashed potatoes down and headed back to the kitchen. Hammer\u2019s focus naturally slid to her ass as she scurried away. Had she taken his advice yesterday morning and opened up to Liam?</p><p>The Irish prick sidled up to him. \u201cStop staring at Raine or I might change my bloody mind about you living another day.\u201d</p><p>Hammer turned to scowl at him. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine started her period this morning.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s declaration slapped Hammer. He froze, rolled the words around in his head. Finally, the meaning of those words dawned on him. They seized his guts, sucked his veins dry, stabbed his heart. His faint but stupid hope of sharing a life with her died.</p><p>Goddamn it, he\u2019d wanted Raine to be pregnant.</p><p>Without a word, he stormed away from Liam toward the privacy of the liquor storage room. Slamming the door behind him, Hammer took refuge in the small, shadowy space. He leaned against the steel-framed racks of booze, dragged in a jagged breath, and closed his eyes.</p><p>What if Raine had been pregnant? Would he have hauled her to a Justice of the Peace for an unfulfilling five-minute ceremony? Then what? Watch her pine for Liam? Worry that she\u2019d come to regard their marriage as a mistake? Hammer roughed a hand down his face. Would he have shoved his inner beast deep into the recesses of his soul and ignored the clawing hunger to make her his slave until it drove him insane?</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. But that didn\u2019t stop his slew of regrets. Visions of a precious little girl with raven hair and big blue eyes, just like her mommy\u2019s, raced through his brain. She\u2019d be inquisitive, headstrong, and need his protection. He could almost hear her sweet giggles as he slung her on his back for pony rides or see her yawn as he tucked her into her frilly pink bed and kissed her little button nose good-night.</p><p>Or would they have had a boy? Hammer blinked against the sting burning his eyes as he pictured a little imp with Raine\u2019s eyes and a mischievous smile. He and his son would have played ball in a lush green yard and rolled around in autumn leaves. The boy would have sneaked frogs and worms into the house to scare his beautiful mother with a grin.</p><p>Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Hammer heard the little voices calling in his head.</p><p>None of that would happen now.</p><p>Grief sat on his chest like an elephant.</p><p>Hammer pounded his fist against the wall. Until this moment, he hadn\u2019t let himself acknowledge how much he yearned to be a father, a role model, a defender. And how much he wanted all that with Raine.</p><p>With a few words, Liam had managed to dash all those hopes.</p><p>Hammer believed things happened for a reason. And he knew what that was: Raine deserved better than him. He\u2019d had years to claim her, but he hadn\u2019t tackled his fears and seized the opportunity. Now he could only man up and stop dreaming about what would never be.</p><p>With a curse, he jerked three bottles of wine off their rack, turned on his heel, and braced himself to see relief in Raine\u2019s eyes.</p><p>As he entered the dungeon again, she carried the turkey, all sliced and steaming, to the table. Her black dress showed a hint of cleavage and bared thighs he remembered locking around him as they rocked together in pursuit of pleasure. God, would he ever look at her and not crave the chance to make her his own?</p><p>Hammer looked Raine\u2019s way. Her red-rimmed eyes stood out in her pale face. She\u2019d been crying. Not in the last ten minutes or her nose would be red, too. But recently. Their stares locked for a moment. Her chin trembled. Those blue eyes looked so tormented with...what?</p><p>Before he could decide, she jerked away with a frown and set the turkey on the table. Then she pasted on an overly bright smile. \u201cCome on, everyone. Time to eat.\u201d</p><p>As everyone took their seats, Hammer pulled out Raine\u2019s usual chair, directly to his right, for her. With her sitting close, they might be able to talk discreetly. Instead, Liam led her to the opposite end of the table and helped her into a chair, widening the divide between them more.</p><p>Hammer\u2019s stomach took a nosedive. A volatile mix of anger and pain skewered him.</p><p>He should be thankful for a thriving business, food aplenty, as well as the good friends he had and the good times they shared. Right now, he could only focus on what he didn\u2019t have: Raine, the chance to have a family with her, or even any of her goddamn warmth in his life.</p><p>To his left, his friend and Shadows\u2019 resident sadist, Beck, nudged him. \u201cEveryone is staring at you, man. Stop looking at Raine like she\u2019s dessert, make a quick speech, and let everyone dig in.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, Hammer raised his glass, thanking his extended family for coming to share this day with him because he treasured each and every one of them, blah, blah, blah. He was running on autopilot, probably reciting the same speech, more or less, that he had for the past eight years. In the back of his head, he kept wondering why he hadn\u2019t changed his ways and snapped Raine up when he\u2019d had the chance. If he would have put the past behind him, he could have had a new life with her. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.</p><p>As the guests all raised their glasses to him, he watched Liam cup Raine\u2019s cheek. She sent his old pal a shaky smile, then downed most of her wine in two swallows. Hammer didn\u2019t like how pale she looked. And he would kill to know what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cDude, you really have to stop staring at Raine,\u201d Beck warned in a low voice. \u201cLiam is going to take your head off if he catches you. What the hell is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine\u2019s not pregnant,\u201d Hammer hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou should be happy, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look happy?\u201d He flashed a seething look Beck\u2019s way, then stared down the length of the table at her again.</p><p>Had she been crying in relief that she\u2019d started her period? Or disappointment that his child wouldn\u2019t grow there? Hammer wasn\u2019t sure when\u2014or if\u2014he\u2019d ever find out.</p><p>Without looking away, Hammer filled his fork with food and slid the contents in his mouth. He had no doubt everything was delicious as always, but he couldn\u2019t taste a thing.</p><p>One of the newer Dommes, Mistress Hillary, complimented Raine\u2019s cooking. The girl smiled stiffly and murmured her thanks. When the exchange was over, Raine\u2019s brows drew together. She rubbed at a spot between her eyes. Hammer studied her pained expression. Damn it, of course she was hurting. He knew the symptoms. He\u2019d seen them dozens of times. And from the blithe look on Liam\u2019s face, he didn\u2019t have a clue. Raine obviously wasn\u2019t letting her Dom in on her problem.</p><p>Clenching his jaw, he tossed his napkin on the table and stormed over to her, leaning down to whisper in her ear. \u201cLet me get your medicine. You need to take it and lie down.\u201d</p><p>Raine shook her head in refusal. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn little brat.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Hammer marched down the hall. Her stare raked his back. Once in his quarters, he rummaged through his bathroom cabinet and picked through his toiletries until he found Raine\u2019s medication.</p><p>Frustrated with her and wishing like hell that she was his to punish, he stalked back to the feast and slammed the bottle of pain killers on the table in front of her.</p><p>Liam raised his head, scowling as he picked up the bottle and read the label. \u201cWhat the hell are these pills for?\u201d</p><p>Hammer ignored Liam and stared down at Raine with a raised brow. \u201cDo you want to tell him or shall I, precious?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in Liam\u2019s eyes as he studied Raine. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her guilty gaze. \u201cHammer, I planned to take one and explain everything to Liam after dinner,\u201d she said in a low whisper. \u201cPlease sit down. I\u2019ll handle it. Everyone is staring.\u201d</p><p>They were, and Hammer didn\u2019t give a shit. He resisted the urge to shake her. Did Liam have any idea how badly she deserved to be taken over a knee and thoroughly spanked? He stomped back to his chair, then eased down and glared at her. She raised her chin and still didn\u2019t take a fucking pill. In fact, she whispered furiously to Liam and ignored the bottle, pushing food around on her plate. More color seeped from her face as the pain obviously grew worse.</p><p>Why was the stubborn minx refusing to help herself?</p><p>Jaw tight, Liam set the bottle aside and pinned Raine with an expression that promised confrontation after dinner. Hammer approved. If she wasn\u2019t going to take care of herself, and he couldn\u2019t, someone had to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the awkward meal, Raine served dessert and coffee. She was moving slowly, but thankfully the other subs helped. After a blessedly brief chat, most everyone agreed to follow Beck to his place for beer and football. The rest of the members headed home, leaving him alone with Liam and Raine.</p><p>The second the door shut behind the last of the dinner guests, Liam turned on her, grinding his jaw and gritting his teeth. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Raine tried to assure him. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain, yes or no?\u201d All hint of nice had disappeared.</p> <p>She dropped her gaze. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take the damn pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She sent him an imploring stare. \u201cLiam, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s just a headache. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a headache?\u201d Hammer scoffed. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m Godzilla.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in disbelief. He hadn\u2019t seen her this shut down in years. Before this week, she\u2019d been making strides with Liam. Little ones, but...progress. What the hell was going on inside her head now?</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s all.\u201d Then she turned a pleading stare on Liam. \u201cAs soon as I do the dishes, I promise to be a good girl, pop a pill, and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Liam snarled. \u201cYou\u2019ll take the fucking pill now, sub. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Hammer had never heard Liam speak to her so harshly. But she needed it.</p><p>Raine looked like she wanted to argue, but a jolt of pain hit her again. She winced, then silently opened the bottle and swallowed down a pill.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Liam nodded. \u201cNow I\u2019ll clean up the mess. You go to bed. We\u2019ll talk about this later. And Raine, there will be consequences.\u201d</p><p>What little color had been in her face drained away.</p> <p>As raw as it chaffed Hammer to see her under another\u2019s care, the time had come to share a bit of insight with his ex-friend. Someone needed to clue Liam in, and if she was too bottled up or independent to do it, he would. After all, Raine\u2019s welfare wasn\u2019t a point of contention. Which one of them got to fuck her was. But the girl\u2019s health was by far more important than this pissing match.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018just a headache,\u2019\u201d he told Liam. \u201cShe\u2019s suffering from a migraine. I\u2019ve taken her to several specialists over the years. Each said these episodes are hormone related. Every month, she gets a migraine early in her cycle. When they start, you\u2019ll need to make her stop what she\u2019s doing and give her a pill, then put her to bed. The medication she should have taken when I brought the bottle will knock her out. She needs that and about ten hours of sleep in a dark, quiet room to recover.\u201d</p><p>Raine sighed wearily. \u201cMacen, you didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain.\u201d She turned to Liam, her gaze pleading. \u201cCan we talk about this privately?\u201d</p><p>That expression tore at Hammer because he remembered when she used to look at him for forgiveness and approval.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll talk in front of him, Raine. He knows more about you than I suspect you\u2019ll ever allow me, so there\u2019s not much point in doing this in private, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...hear me out. I was feeling all right until right before I served the food, so I thought I could make it through dinner and finish playing hostess before the pain hit. But it got bad really quickly. I didn\u2019t want to announce my problem to everyone or hold up the meal.\u201d She sent Hammer a quick glare. \u201cSo don\u2019t make it sound like I intentionally withheld information from Liam.\u201d She reached for the other man. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if it seemed like I was keeping you in the dark. I wasn\u2019t, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Liam raised a skeptical brow. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely speech, but I\u2019m not convinced you would have explained if Hammer hadn\u2019t forced your hand. I doubt you\u2019ll ever let me know the real you.\u201d</p><p>His voice iced over with a cold rage Hammer had never heard.</p> <p>Raine gaped at him, the fear and heartbreak naked on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cI wake up each day wondering when I\u2019ll step into the next pile of shit because you\u2019ve either forgotten, decided I didn\u2019t need to know, or simply hadn\u2019t bothered to forewarn me. How do you expect me to care for you, love\u2014and I do love you\u2014if you won\u2019t share?\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s knees nearly went out from under him. For the last month, he\u2019d been imagining that Liam would knock on his door someday, Raine in tow, and wash his hands of the girl because of her stubborn, wary ways. But hearing Liam talk so openly about the love he felt for her, and knowing that Raine thought she needed him...Hammer feared that day wouldn\u2019t be coming anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cYou say you care about me and want my dominance,\u201d Liam went on. \u201cYet you don\u2019t trust me enough to communicate something as basic as your health. That\u2019s sub 101, and you know it. I\u2019m deeply disappointed, Raine.\u201d Liam turned away as her eyes spilled over with tears. \u201cHammer, thank you for informing me about my sub\u2019s problems. I\u2019ll take it from here and ask you to mind your own fucking business from now on.\u201d</p><p>Hammer bristled. Liam wanted him to mind his own business? Never going to happen where Raine was concerned, especially now that he knew she had walled herself off nearly to the point of suffocation. He had to get more involved, not less.</p><p>Suddenly, Raine blinked rapidly, swallowing hard, swaying on her feet. Hammer inhaled a sharp breath. Fuck, he knew the signs...</p><p>Surveying the disheveled dinner table, he lunged to retrieve an empty bowl that had previously held green beans. As he raced back to her, Raine slapped one hand on her stomach, then doubled over with a cry and fell to her knees.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d Hammer shouted, trying to shove the bowl under her face. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>Raine pushed the bowl away, squinting against the light streaming through the open windows. Pain wracked her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Hammer growled, then addressed Liam. \u201cShe waited too long. It\u2019s about to get bad.\u201d</p><p>Worry stamped Liam\u2019s face as he lifted Raine into his arms and strode from the room with her. After Hammer snagged her pills off the table, he pushed past Liam and jogged backward to keep the bowl under Raine\u2019s face, just in case.</p><p>\u201cTake her to the bathroom,\u201d he called out as Liam kicked open the door to their room.</p><p>Raine winced and turned her face from him. \u201cGet that bowl away. I smell green beans.\u201d</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Once inside the bathroom, Liam eased Raine to her feet. She shoved the man out, then slammed the door, locking it between them.</p><p>Hammer gaped, itching to shake Liam and demand that he knock Raine\u2019s door\u2014and her fucking walls\u2014completely down. Another part of him felt sorry for the poor bastard. Liam had done everything right as a Dom to reach her. Now, he just looked stunned. No, flattened. The man didn\u2019t know how to help Raine. And fucking aliens would invade before the proud girl ever asked for what she needed.</p><p>As anger soared, Hammer pounded at the portal. \u201cOpen the goddamn door, Raine!\u201d</p><p>Seth was right; this was just like a fucking soap opera. Nothing that had happened during these last few hellish days made a lick of sense. The only good thing had been Raine starting to bleed. But his relief hadn\u2019t lasted long before her silent tears had cut him to the quick.</p><p>Liam shut his eyes. The bloody Thanksgiving feast had been a special hell all its own. He\u2019d been unable to be thankful for a fucking thing. Just when he\u2019d assumed the rage festering inside him couldn\u2019t get any worse, Hammer had proven again that he knew Raine intimately, in every sense of the word. It was a blow far more effective than any punch Hammer could have thrown. Liam was all too aware that, though he learned something new about her every day, it was never enough.</p><p>Did Raine need him at all? Would she ever?</p><p>Furious and wrung dry, he stared at the bathroom door. Never had the temptation to walk away from someone equaled his determination to stay and see it through to the bitter end.</p><p>The time had come to force this intolerable situation to a head. His conversation with Seth circled through his brain again. And Hammer pounding on the bathroom door, demanding Raine let him in so he could care for her... Liam shook his head. Hammer didn\u2019t want him here, either. It was the final bloody straw.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Raine protested weakly from behind the door.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams. Open the door,\u201d Hammer yelled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cOpen the fucking door, Raine, or I\u2019m busting it down!\u201d Hammer pounded on the wooden slab again.</p><p>Liam shoved Hammer aside. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her. She\u2019s my responsibility. Bugger off.\u201d</p><p>Hammer flipped him an incredulous stare. \u201cDo you know how to take care of her when she\u2019s sick like this? Do you know what she needs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop screaming.\u201d Her frail voice cracked with pain. \u201cYou\u2019re making it hurt worse.\u201d</p><p>Then Raine\u2019s retching came, a terrible choking hurl. The sounds of her suffering breached the door. Once, twice, she emptied her stomach. Liam closed his eyes. He felt so bloody helpless.</p><p>Hammer growled, then shoved his left shoulder into the portal.</p><p>The wood creaked, but held tight\u2014until Liam pushed him aside and kicked at the handle with all his might. The lock gave way and the door opened, flooding the dark room with light.</p><p>Raine knelt on the floor totally naked, one hand braced on the porcelain commode. The other held back her raven mane. Her dress was a puddle on the floor. As Liam rushed in, she turned and winced, squeezing her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>She turned to sag limply against the nearby wall, her knees curling to her chest. Even in the dim light, she squinted, looking spent and pale and defeated. \u201cThe light. Hurts.\u201d</p><p>The sight of her cut him to the bone. He ran to the blinds and yanked on the cord, muting the afternoon beams filtering through the window. But he had no fucking idea what to do next.</p><p>Hammer skidded to his knees at her side, stroking her hair. \u201cPrecious, are you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly. \u201cBed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Hammer\u2019s tone sounded almost like he spoke to a beloved child.</p><p>Ignoring her nakedness, he flushed the toilet, grabbed a glass of water and a cold cloth, then set them on the basin before he helped her to her feet.</p><p>Liam stared. How could he protest? Raine needed care, and he didn\u2019t know how to give it to her. All he could do was watch and absorb the never-ending nightmare.</p><p>Hammer wiped her face gently and instructed her to rinse her mouth. She did it slowly, her eyes half closed. Carefully, Hammer gathered Raine\u2019s long hair in a gentle grip, searched around for a band, then secured it inexpertly away from her face.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he bloody thought of that?</p><p>Then Raine\u2019s strength seemed to give out. As she melted against him, Hammer scooped her up and took his woman to the bed they shared. Liam raged at the sheer injustice of the moment. Though Hammer was helping her, it chafed.</p><p>It would be easy to turn and walk through the door, leave the two of them to sort everything out and catch that red-eye to New York Seth had suggested. Had that been just yesterday? But the Dominant inside Liam roared, as did his heart. Mine!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Hammer. She can thank you for your care and consideration once she\u2019s well. I\u2019ve no doubt she will. But I\u2019ll see to her from here. Anything I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll figure out. Once she\u2019s settled, I\u2019ll meet you in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t raise his voice, but the hard tone brooked no argument as he tore off his shirt and toed off his shoes.</p><p>Hammer gave an angry jerk of his head. \u201cFine. Raine needs another pill since she threw up the one she took earlier.\u201d He fished out the bottle, set one tablet on the nightstand, and pocketed the rest.</p><p>Liam glared. \u201cWhat if she needs more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come find me. I\u2019ll start cleaning the dishes.\u201d Hammer walked out before Liam could object.</p><p>Unfuckingbelievable.</p><p>After retrieving another glass of water, Liam climbed on the bed and drew the blankets over her naked body. Curling up beside her, he drew her into the circle of his arms. Holding her close now felt so bittersweet.</p><p>\u201cTake another pill, lass.\u201d He lifted the glass of water to her white lips and held her head up so she could swallow.</p><p>Pain had carved itself into her features. Raine could be so strong that he\u2019d never imagined seeing her this weak.</p><p>Bloody hell...</p><p>\u201cThere, love,\u201d he crooned. \u201cCan I get anything else for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cThank you. Will you hold me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Rest now.\u201d</p><p>Raine seemed to use the last of her energy to blink up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...about everything.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was, too.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Hammer stepped up to the table and began clearing plates. \u201cI\u2019ll be cleaning this mess up all fucking night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He worked on autopilot, stacking the dishes next to the sink while his brain whirled. Liam might be fed up with Raine now, but the minute the man eased up, she would revert to giving only the tiniest morsels of herself so she didn\u2019t have to truly bare her soul. When would she realize that refusing to share the real her with everyone who cared wouldn\u2019t lead her to the fulfillment she craved?</p><p>Cursing, he carried another stack of plates into the kitchen. The entire room looked like an atomic bomb had detonated.</p><p>\u201cAnd she was going to clean this mess up with a goddamn migraine? Right...\u201d</p><p>At the sound of angry footsteps, Hammer turned to see Liam striding into the room, barreling down like a train. The prick didn\u2019t say a word, just launched a solid right hook into his jaw. Dazed, Hammer stumbled back, colliding with a stack of dishes that teetered on the edge of the counter, a breath away from crashing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cBack the fuck away from Raine. She\u2019s not your \u2018precious.\u2019 She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, massaging his chin, and stared at Liam. \u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019d rather smash your teeth down your throat, you selfish wanker. You could have had Raine any bloody time in all the years she\u2019s been here, but ever since I collared her, you can\u2019t seem to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? She got sick. I tried to help her, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy undermining me. And I still haven\u2019t forgiven you for dragging her to your bed the second I claimed her. Why won\u2019t you go the fuck away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my club, thank you very much. We both know that last-minute training collar was a convenient way for you to get her into bed. Pot, meet kettle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss off, fuckwit.\u201d Liam rubbed at his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really got your dick in a twist? That she loves me? That she wants me? Or that she feels safe with me and doesn\u2019t want to leave Shadows?\u201d Hammer expected to feel his friend\u2019s right hook again any second. Instead, hurt flared in Liam\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bloody stuck here because a BDSM club is the closest thing Raine\u2019s ever had to a real home. And she can\u2019t break her connection with you because you won\u2019t leave her alone long enough to let her.\u201d</p><p>Guilty. He should have given Raine a proper home outside the club. He should have backed the hell off when she\u2019d accepted Liam as her Dominant. But if he had, he would have lost Raine, probably for good. His guts clenched at the thought of her no longer in his life.</p><p>\u201cYou break her heart and fucking make her cry,\u201d Liam railed on. \u201cAnd me? Hell, you can\u2019t stop laying on the accusations, taking every cheap shot you can.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t that make him feel like a thousand kinds of an asshole? For years, Hammer had clung to Raine like a safety line. He never drew her to his shore, just gripped the goddamn rope tighter and tighter, afraid of losing her and the contentment she gave him, equally terrified that if he embraced her, he\u2019d destroy her. If being with Liam made her happy, he should drop the rope and let her go.</p><p>His lungs burned as he tried to suck in a breath. Panic set in. His conscience screamed in the back of his brain that he should do the right thing...for once. But even if he kicked himself in the ass for not giving her what she needed, he was still a selfish bastard. In the end, he couldn\u2019t give her up.</p><p>\u201cLiam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up. Sometimes I wonder why I\u2019m bothering when neither one of you seems to want me here. I\u2019m sick to death of fighting you both.\u201d</p><p>Liam sounded damn close to giving up on Raine. Somehow, that wasn\u2019t nearly as satisfying as Hammer had imagined. In fact, he\u2019d never seen the man so near the end of his rope, not even when Gwyneth had betrayed him.</p><p>Guilt oozed through his pores. Hammer would rather cut off his nuts with a rusty blade than examine this shitstorm, but no avoiding it now. He\u2019d been blinded by his goddamn jealousy. He\u2019d been too busy backbiting and lashing out to see that he was not only neglecting to consider Raine\u2019s needs, but destroying a brotherhood.</p><p>Hell, he had been a fuckwit. He should say something, offer an olive branch of some sort. This feud wasn\u2019t helping Liam, himself, or Raine.</p><p>\u201cListen\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot another bloody word.\u201d Liam gave Hammer a mighty shove, sending him stumbling back. \u201cRaine needed guidance for six fucking years, and you did little but isolate and ignore her. You would have contorted yourself to help any other sub grow. If another Dom had treated her the way you have, you\u2019d have killed him. What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Juliet.</p><p>\u201cI used to look up to you,\u201d Liam went on. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck you are anymore.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s temper and accusation sparked his own. \u201cYou\u2019re not perfect yourself. You didn\u2019t have my permission to touch Raine, but you took her anyway. You knew I was in love with her. Some friend you are, forcing me to watch you fuck the only woman I\u2019ve cared about since Juliet. You don\u2019t know who I am? Fuck you. That street runs both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quit your bellyaching about how I stole Raine from you when you were too daft to make her yours in the first place.\u201d Liam\u2019s face tightened, his fists clenching. \u201cI won\u2019t apologize for falling in love with her. At least I\u2019ve tried to put her first. For years, Raine begged you for attention, but you were too busy dancing the mattress tango with every other sub. Think what you want of me, but the way you\u2019ve treated the so-called \u2018first woman I\u2019ve cared about since Juliet\u2019 is despicable. If you truly care for Raine, you\u2019ll let her go. If not, you\u2019re going to destroy her. And there\u2019ll be no mending this rift between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI share a decade with you\u2014a roof, a bed, my goddamn wife\u2014and you\u2019re ready to toss our friendship out for a woman you\u2019ve been fucking for three weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a relationship guru now who knows exactly how long it takes to fall for someone? I love Raine. That eats you up. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight it does, just like the fact that I love her too crawls up your ass and festers. You know the difference? I shared. I opened my fucking marriage to you because I thought Juliet needed you. Raine needs me. And you tell me that I can only talk to her about work with the door open? Nice reciprocation, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited you back to New York after I married Gwyneth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do in the middle of your newly wedded bliss besides be your third wheel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to live with us so we could share her. I didn\u2019t think I had to spell out the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted no part of that bitch. Liam, she didn\u2019t give a shit about anyone but herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with her. You were too bloody busy with your club and your endless parade of fuck bunnies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery one of those subs kept me from returning to New York so you didn\u2019t have to go through the hell with Gwyneth that I did with Juliet.\u201d</p><p>Liam gaped at him. \u201cYou dipping your wick in every hole was somehow for my benefit? I\u2019ve got to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t share Gwyneth with you because I worried it would ultimately drive her to something reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Juliet? That\u2019s ridiculous. Your wife was quiet and meek\u2014nothing like Gwyneth. Juliet was a bit screwed up, too. Lousy excuse, Hammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Hammer whirled around, panting between clenched teeth as he searched for something to throw, to hit, to fucking break. \u201cWhen you called to tell me that you were filing for divorce, what was the first question I asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked why.\u201d Liam shrugged. \u201cSo? What are you blathering on about? You know why Gwyneth and I split up. She liked my money. Oh, and she liked fucking her personal trainer and his boyfriend. What does any of that have to do with Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you why you left Gwyneth because I gave a shit. Because I cared about you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer kicked the wall, then grabbed a plate from the counter and hurled it across the room. Hearing the crash and seeing the white china shatter wasn\u2019t nearly as satisfying as he\u2019d hoped.</p><p>\u201cWhy the devil are you breaking the dishes?\u201d Liam stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou never asked me why,\u201d Hammer whirled back on Liam, his chest heaving. \u201cDidn\u2019t you care why Juliet swallowed a whole fucking bottle of pills in the middle of a Sunday afternoon? You called. You said all the right things.\u201d He choked. \u201cBut you never asked why. You weren\u2019t fucking there when I needed you most.\u201d</p><p>Rage poured out from him like hot bacon grease, sizzling his skin, burning away all his self-control. He wanted to hurt something, destroy it, preferably Liam. The dumb prick stood gawking at him like he was still trying to figure out the puzzle. Goddamn if that didn\u2019t infuriate him, too.</p><p>Hammer reached for the next plate on the stack and zinged it across the room, the splintering of the delicate china firing up the beast inside him.</p><p>Liam stared, blinking, barely breathing. \u201cHammer, I didn\u2019t... Can you stop destroying the place long enough for me to say something? Christ, man. You\u2019ll wake the fucking dead! Or worse, Raine.\u201d</p><p>Liam grabbed the next plate away, and Hammer felt a fresh wave of fury crash through his head as he lurched to snatch it back. \u201cGive that to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You obviously want to talk about Juliet and what I didn\u2019t do right. How was I to know? Before I could even come home, you had her cremated and buried, like you\u2019d filed her away in a dusty cabinet. I didn\u2019t even get to say good-bye. I thought you just wanted to forget her and move on.\u201d</p><p>Hammer clenched his jaw. He\u2019d been keeping the lid closed on this can of worms for years. Keep pushing, and I\u2019ll open it right up. \u201cYou assumed, but you didn\u2019t care enough to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pry,\u201d Liam insisted, putting the plates out of Hammer\u2019s reach, then crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>He scoffed, his temper rising. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to know why my wife and your lover killed her goddamn self without expressing an ounce of unhappiness to either one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Liam stepped closer, his voice dropping. Goddamn it if he didn\u2019t look somewhere between concerned and compassionate. \u201cI offered to drop my project at work and come home. You said not to bother, so I tried to talk to you over the phone. But you were aloof, so I backed off...\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t disinterested, Macen. Jesus, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you felt like this. When you kept pushing me away, I thought you needed time to process. When you moved out here, I assumed you needed space, a fresh start...\u201d He hung his head. \u201cI worried that I was a reminder of a time you wanted to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to fuck I could,\u201d Hammer said miserably. \u201cI changed coasts, changed careers, and changed lives. Nothing made me want to really live again until Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I didn\u2019t start with her to hurt you. I know I\u2019m a bit late, but...\u201d Liam swallowed. \u201cWhy? Why did Juliet end herself, then? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do or I wouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><p>The backs of Hammer\u2019s eyes ached. His throat closed up. \u201cShe left me a note. She wanted more attention.\u201d</p><p>Liam rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cFrankly, mate, I\u2019m not sure either of us could ever have given her enough attention. She was a bit starved, no matter what we did. I suppose it didn\u2019t help that work kept me away for the last six weeks or so, but I called her. She knew I was coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was tired of being our \u2018fuck doll.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet said that?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and neither of us realized she felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Liam blew out a breath. \u201cThe last time I saw her, she kissed me and told me to hurry home. Why didn\u2019t she tell us that? She always struggled with communication, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pregnant.\u201d Hammer dragged a hand through his hair and let loose a jagged breath as he slid down the wall and sat surrounded by broken crockery, miserable and defeated. \u201cEight weeks.\u201d</p><p>Liam gaped. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I read it in her note. I should have paid more attention.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, looking visibly pale. \u201cWhose baby was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t sure and she couldn\u2019t handle the shame of not knowing whose name to list on the birth certificate. She knew we\u2019d never let her go if she was pregnant, and she didn\u2019t want to raise a child in our \u2018den of depravity.\u2019 Instead of communicating, she chose sleeping pills over life with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me dazed.\u201d Liam slid down beside him, staring at the wall on the far side of the kitchen. \u201cDidn\u2019t you think the truth was important enough to share? Or did you imagine that I wouldn\u2019t care?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI tried not to dump this on you. I tried to be a friend and save you this shit. Look how you repay me.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s rage went from zero to zoom. He turned red, betrayal in his eyes. \u201cYou son of a bitch! You tell me all this now and pass it off as a favor? I would have been by your side in a heartbeat if you had bothered to fucking tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as a friend, you should have asked why. And now you\u2019ve taken Raine from me. What sort of friend does that? All I\u2019ve got left is Shadows. You want that, too?\u201d He jumped to his feet and fished the keys out of his pocket. \u201cHere you go. Don\u2019t come back to me for anything else. I don\u2019t have a goddamn thing left to give you.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes widened as he staggered upright. His mouth hung open as if Hammer had just punched him. \u201cI don\u2019t want those.\u201d He shoved the keys out of Hammer\u2019s hand. They skittered across the floor. \u201cNow what the fuck are you saying? That Juliet was my fault?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Hammer roared, shoulders back, chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d he railed in return. \u201cI didn\u2019t shove the pills down her throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides not being there for her, you still hit the clubs, still fucked all the subs. She knew that, and it crushed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that in her suicide note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was obvious. And she knew that you were hardly a monk while you were in Miami on business. I know exactly what you were doing the night of her birthday. Or who you were doing. How do you think that made her feel?\u201d</p> <p>Liam scowled. \u201cWe spent hours negotiating everything before we started sharing her. Exclusivity wasn\u2019t part of the deal. She\u2019d seen me with other women and never seemed to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she minded,\u201d Hammer shouted. \u201cDo you think she liked feeling as if she wasn\u2019t enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Liam sent him a sharp glare. \u201cAnd Juliet told you she felt this way? Or is this how you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Pin it on me.\u201d Hammer threw his hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken two women from me, but you won\u2019t take an ounce of guilt. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>With fists clenched around the chair, Liam ground his teeth. \u201cFine. You want it to be all my fault? Okay, it is. It\u2019s all my fucking fault. Juliet would have been beyond happy if I hadn\u2019t agreed to your invitation, invaded your marriage, and fucked up your lives, so I\u2019ll take every ounce of blame. Now you can sleep at night. Feel better?\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t, not one fucking bit. His whole body clenched in knots.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he lied. \u201cYour turn to carry this load around, asshole. And if you fuck up Raine too, I\u2019ll rip your head off and shit down your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019ll take care of Raine. All day, all night, in every way she needs.\u201d</p><p>Hammer surged closer. \u201cYou barely know her. I might not have watched over her perfectly before you barged in, but she wouldn\u2019t even tell you the date she should have gotten her period. I can damn well make her talk. She needs a strong Dom. She needs me. And if I get a chance to be with Raine again, you can bet your ass I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that you hoard this secret, then lay it on my shoulders eight years too late. But you also spew out that you\u2019ll fuck my Raine again, given the chance. I ought to shove your fucking balls up your ass and make sure the only way you can find them is with a toothpick.\u201d</p><p>Hammer opened his mouth to rage back, but the door pushed open suddenly. Raine stepped in, squinting against the light. She surveyed the damage with a frown, her hair pulled haphazardly away from her pale face. The ancient T-shirt she wore looked at least four sizes too big and swallowed her up.</p><p>With a pained frown, she stared at them both as if they\u2019d lost their minds. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you shouting?\u201d</p><p>Liam glared at him, then scooped Raine up in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, love. Let\u2019s get you back to bed. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer could only watch the other man take the woman he loved away, maybe this time for good.</p> <p>Two hours later, Hammer sat on the edge of his bed, swirling a tumbler of Scotch, his thoughts circling like the amber liquid. He\u2019d lost the grip of his icy control in the kitchen with Liam. Why the hell had he suddenly unloaded years of anger and dumped it on the man? Had he expected Liam to magically wash away the layers of blame and make everything better? Hammer scoffed. By finally vomiting out the truth, he\u2019d managed to purge a lot of resentment. Why didn\u2019t he feel any better? He should have confronted Liam and his own guilt years ago. He just hadn\u2019t had the balls to wade through the shit. He really didn\u2019t want to now.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>Hammer zipped his stare to the doorway to find Beck leaning against the frame, his arms folded across his chest, eyeing the decanter of Scotch on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d Hammer nodded, raising his glass in the air, toasting his own stupidity. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you\u2019d taken everyone back to your place for beer and football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe caught the last half of the game, then they all bailed. I came back to see if the club was still standing. What the fuck, man? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever sat through a more uncomfortable Thanksgiving. What do you have planned for next year, pissing in the gravy?\u201d</p><p>Hammer issued a humorless chuckle. \u201cYou missed the fun part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kind of figured. When I couldn\u2019t find anyone, I peeked in the kitchen.\u201d Beck gave a low whistle. \u201cIt looks like World War Wedgwood hit that place. So who won?\u201d Beck asked, cocking a brow as he pulled up a chair across from Hammer and took a seat.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Hammer sighed in disgust. \u201cI royally fucked up, man.\u201d</p><p>Beck swallowed down a healthy gulp of Scotch and hissed. \u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d</p><p>Hammer filled the sadist in on all the ugly details as he refilled their glasses.</p><p>When he was done, Hammer closed his eyes. He could still see Juliet\u2019s pale, naked body lying on their bed. Her blonde tresses spilled out over the gray silk sheets; white foam congealed around her blue lips. Her eyes were open, lifeless, staring past him as if he wasn\u2019t there. And he hadn\u2019t been when she\u2019d taken her own life. When the world had crumbled beneath Juliet\u2019s feet, she\u2019d given up, welcoming the end without him.</p><p>\u201cI should have told Liam how much guilt I was drowning in a long time ago. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d Hammer rubbed at his forehead. \u201cHe was so young, and I thought I was protecting him because he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the truth. Besides, she was my wife. Liam had signed up for sex and good times, not...all that. I didn\u2019t know how to cope, so I shut down. I shouldered all the responsibility for her death. When he moved on to a normal life and got married, I resented the fuck out of him. I just kept getting more and more pissed off. I ended up blaming him for pretty much everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass.\u201d Beck shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Hammer groused, then downed the contents of his glass and filled it once more. \u201cI accused him of helping to push Juliet over the edge because he frequently fucked other subs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d Hammer sighed. \u201cShe never told me how she felt. About anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an even bigger idiot than I thought. You blame Liam for maybe upsetting Juliet because he couldn\u2019t keep his pants zipped. But you know your manwhoredom crushed Raine and you didn\u2019t take responsibility for that one whit. Really, dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was just pissed as hell and looking for a way to unload my guilt.\u201d Shaking his head, he swirled the liquid in his glass and watched it turn. \u201cWhat Juliet did completely shell-shocked me. I didn\u2019t have a fucking clue how to deal with it. I sure as hell couldn\u2019t bring myself to examine my own role too closely. Blaming him was easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you examining it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to. Hence the Scotch,\u201d Hammer replied, then tossed back a healthy swig.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll really do the trick,\u201d Beck drawled.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t. Trust me. I\u2019ve tried for years.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop him from pouring another. He tipped back the glass in a futile attempt to wipe away the memory. Sure, it numbed his guilt, but never eradicated the stain from his soul.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe you should stop trying to drown your crap. Dissect it and then let it go. Hell, who knows, you just might end up a happier son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I have no clue.\u201d Beck shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come clean with Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that after he stole Raine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStole? Let\u2019s cut the shit, shall we?\u201d Beck leaned in and narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou owe Liam an apology. And then you need to pull your balls out of your purse, cupcake, and tell Raine how you feel about her. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a home to go back to?\u201d He glared, nursing his drink.</p><p>\u201cAww, but digging in your head is a lot more fun.\u201d He slapped Hammer on the shoulder. \u201cBesides, you need a friend who\u2019s not afraid to put a stop to your big ol\u2019 boo-hoo pity party.\u201d</p><p>Hammer winced. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back, Beck. Tell me how you really feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying. Pull your head out of your ass, unless you enjoy the smell. If you didn\u2019t tell Liam anything about Juliet\u2019s death, how could you expect him to take half the blame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed herself, and he never asked why. What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done in Liam\u2019s shoes? The woman you\u2019re sharing in an open relationship offs herself, and her husband won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer drained his glass, wishing he could strangle Beck for such an ugly goddamn question. \u201cI guess...\u201d He sighed. \u201cFuck, if I\u2019d been Liam, that would have been my sign to keep out. He said he didn\u2019t want to pry, but I think he blamed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re assuming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Freud.\u201d He poured more Scotch. \u201cYou\u2019re a vascular surgeon, not a shrink.\u201d</p><p>Beck shrugged. \u201cI did my nine weeks\u2019 psych rotation. I\u2019m almost qualified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you examine your own life? There\u2019s plenty of shit there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m screwed up, but not nearly as much as you.\u201d Beck chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Stop drowning in your booze and go apologize to Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t listen to a damn thing I have to say, especially after I told him I\u2019d fuck Raine again when I got the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided to pour gasoline on the fire, why? Weren\u2019t the flames hot enough for you?\u201d Beck shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got way too much pride, Macen, and it\u2019s biting you in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd probably not the last.\u201d Beck paused. \u201cWhat drew you both to Juliet? What was she like?\u201d</p><p>Hammer sloshed back another stiff swig. \u201cQuiet. Refined. Proper. She was a lady. The downside was, she didn\u2019t like conflict or confrontation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t see you with a quiet girl. You need the challenge of a spitfire sub.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cLike Raine.\u201d</p><p>Hammer winced. \u201cI know. Her sassy attitude makes me want to smack her ass and fuck her breathless. I can\u2019t get her out of my blood. I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you haven\u2019t tried being honest with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the door, fucker.\u201d Hammer pointed. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you in to unravel me. I\u2019m not one of your pain sluts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to shove me out, like Liam. Newsflash for you: I don\u2019t have a dog in this hunt. I don\u2019t care what you do, except that I\u2019d like to see my friend smile once a decade. We don\u2019t have to talk about a damn thing. We can get staggering drunk, then you can deal with your own mess tomorrow. And while you\u2019re at it, stop badgering Raine for not communicating because you\u2019re no better.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Beck just kept digging in his head and figuring all his shit out. Wasn\u2019t this fun? Hammer downed the last of the liquid in his glass. Beck snatched it away.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Hammer scowled.</p><p>The other man laughed. \u201cGood, then I\u2019m doing my job. We drinking or talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking,\u201d he conceded, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHappy to hear it. Now tell me how Juliet went from good girl to sex slave for you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got off on pushing her past her comfort zone. It was like pure power pumping through my veins, and it fed the fuck out of the beast inside me. So I kept pushing and pushing...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to do that as a Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she almost never pushed back. Once, I brought in a Domme. Juliet did safe word out of that. So I took her to a dungeon to see what tripped her trigger. The only thing that seemed to catch her eye was Liam sceneing. When I approached him about Juliet, he was all over it. Hell, he was twenty-one, but he had a firm understanding of the power exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he joined you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a night, at first. But I loved it. I thought she did, too. Knowing I could make a proper wife fuck another man did it for me. I thought she liked connecting with her inner bad girl, and they seemed to click, so I asked him to stay for good. By the time I found out it made her feel like a whore, it was too late. I mistook her silence for submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask a ton of questions before you changed the relationship?\u201d</p><p>Hammer hung his head. \u201cNot enough. I was drunk on power and not a shining example of a Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s not the man I know. I seriously can\u2019t see you not forcing Juliet to communicate. You nearly talk subs to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I tried to talk to Juliet, believe me. Every time I sat her down and told her I needed to know how she felt, she\u2019d give me a placid smile, tell me she loved me, shower me with kisses, then usually give me a blow job. I bought into her acquiescence, thinking she was the perfect submissive. I should have dug harder, but she never gave me any reason to. But she taught me a valuable lesson. That\u2019s why I harp on subs now about communication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer, she didn\u2019t give you anything to work with. You did the best you could with what you knew. After all, there were two people in that marriage. She made her choices.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, but he couldn\u2019t unload the boulder of guilt from his back. Instead, he took his glass from Beck and poured another shot. \u201cBut it was my job to take care of her, physically, emotionally, and mentally. I failed her in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter her death, I shut down. I was alone and miserable. I couldn\u2019t stay in New York. Too many memories. Too much hurt. I didn\u2019t know where to direct my rage, except toward Liam. I couldn\u2019t pin it on Juliet. She was a victim of my desires and my ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. She wasn\u2019t a victim. She didn\u2019t tell you how she felt and she didn\u2019t give you a choice. She took the power. Weren\u2019t you pissed at her for taking her own life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivid. I know that\u2019s part of the death process, but I wondered if I\u2019d ever really known her. I thought I loved her, but how could I love a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking ill of her, but it sounds like she was repressed, depressed, and just fucked up.\u201d</p><p>Hammer flubbed through a laugh. \u201cMaybe. A little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you beat yourself up enough yet? Are you sure you don\u2019t have a little bit of a masochist in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d With a shrug, Hammer stared down into the alcohol. \u201cGood strategy. Wait until I\u2019m drunk so I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sir Prick.\u201d He snickered. \u201cSo neither you nor Liam had any hint that Juliet was unhappy or contemplating suicide? Or that she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That mistake cost me dearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains why you dole out Raine\u2019s medication. And why you\u2019ve always kept track of her cycles. I had no idea it was that bad, man. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Beck\u2019s words were slathered in sympathy. Hammer didn\u2019t need it. He just wanted the regret and shame eating him up inside to go away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been carrying this crap around all these years.\u201d Beck looked as blown out of the water as Liam had earlier.</p><p>\u201cYep, until tonight when I puked up every ugly bit of it, right onto Liam.\u201d The memory of utter shock on his old friend\u2019s face slid through Hammer\u2019s veins like black, oily sludge.</p><p>Beck\u2019s eyes grew wide as if suddenly struck with understanding. \u201cWell, now I know why you won\u2019t tell Raine you\u2019re in love with her. All these years you\u2019ve wanted to claim her, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no good for her,\u201d Hammer interrupted. \u201cShe deserves a better man and Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? And everyone can see you\u2019re doing so great without her,\u201d Beck mocked.</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all the submissives you take to bed are what? Substitutes for Raine?\u201d</p><p>Hammer leveled a look of warning toward Beck. \u201cYou\u2019re stepping over a line. Watch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to candy-coat it for you, and deep down you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>True. \u201cThey\u2019re not substitutes. They\u2019re able to handle what I need. When I\u2019m rough and strict, it silences the guilt screaming in my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the night you spent with Raine. Guilt then?\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s hand tightened around his glass. \u201cShe silenced it all. There was nothing but peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve to have it silenced. Don\u2019t you understand? I failed Juliet. I\u2019ll be damned if I fail Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Raine might check out like Juliet someday?\u201d he asked Hammer.</p><p>\u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ve gotten that much through your thick skull. Raine may not be the greatest communicator, but she\u2019s a fighter, Macen. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. All the years he\u2019d spent with Juliet he\u2019d never truly seen his wife\u2019s soul. No matter how he\u2019d tried, it had been like looking through smoke. He could see Raine\u2019s bright beacon as clear as day. She wasn\u2019t a quitter. The girl could be so damn self-sufficient. She\u2019d left that prick of a father as a kid, and without fear of how she\u2019d survive, drew from her inner strength to forge a better life for herself. Hammer knew what Raine would do if she were unhappy, and it sure as hell wasn\u2019t swallow a bottle of pills.</p><p>\u201cI might have to hunt her down,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never have to bury her. If I\u2019d thought for two seconds that I might, the possibility of her being pregnant would have sent me into a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop projecting your guilt over her and Liam, and start being honest with them both. Hasn\u2019t Juliet taken enough from you? Maybe your child, nearly a decade, your happiness? Do something, idiot! Otherwise, you\u2019ll just keep wasting away your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for holding back.\u201d</p><p>Beck snorted, but he was right. Hammer had wasted so much time. How much longer was he willing to throw away over shit he couldn\u2019t change?</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Unleashing his frustration on the punching bag had done nothing to alleviate Liam\u2019s rage. Every morning in the week following Thanksgiving, he\u2019d slipped away to the gym to escape Shadows and the pressure cooker of problems there, if only for a while. After nearly an hour of the repetitive rhythm, sweat dripped in his eyes and his muscles screamed...but he still couldn\u2019t fatigue himself enough to silence the chaos crowding his head.</p><p>Finally, he stripped away his gloves and headed to the shower. As he sagged against the tile wall and let the hot spray cascade over him, he tried to decide what the fuck to do next. His options were limited. Stay or go? Fish or cut bait?</p><p>Liam sighed. Hammer was a secretive asshole and his rival for Raine. But he also made a hell of a sounding board, and ironically Liam missed him now.</p><p>Once dressed, he headed out of the gym and fought the morning rush. As soon as he pulled into the car park of the first beach he encountered, Liam took out his cell and rang Seth.</p><p>When his friend answered, he heard the sound of a woman\u2019s soft voice in the background.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis had better be good, Liam. The things I\u2019m willing to forego for a friend has its limits.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the laughter in Seth\u2019s voice and smiled faintly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call any of this good, but I could use an ear.\u201d</p><p>Seth sobered. \u201cYou got it. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned his seat back a bit and stretched out. \u201cHow much did you know about Juliet\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that she committed suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Seth answered. \u201cI figured you\u2019d know far more about that than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have thought so, too.\u201d Liam sighed. Exhaustion and frustration tugged at him. He swiped at gritty eyes. \u201cMacen finally told me.\u201d</p><p>He related the conversation to Seth. Afterward, his friend said nothing for a long moment. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sums up how I feel. Hammer held all that in for eight fucking years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never hinted why Juliet had done herself in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once. Not during any of our phone calls, not when I stood beside him at Juliet\u2019s grave on the anniversaries of her death and we talked about old times. Not in the two months since I moved out here. Never...until last week.\u201d</p><p>Seth whistled. \u201cYou must feel run over by a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in shock at first. Now, I just keep thinking what the fuck? Hammer blindsided me. Then he blamed it all on me. Fuckwit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel betrayed.\u201d Seth didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cI do. And how am I supposed to feel about the fact that Juliet might have killed herself because of my baby?\u201d Somewhere between incredulous and wretched, for sure. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t know and I can\u2019t do anything about it now, guilt is eating me.\u201d</p><p>Juliet\u2019s suicide was ancient history, but Liam\u2019s wound felt fresh.</p><p>\u201cShe chose to end it without talking to either one of you,\u201d Seth pointed out. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up. So are you and Hammer talking now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t since that night. I can\u2019t decide if I should beat the fuck out of him or apologize for missing the boat completely.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t bury his anger toward Hammer...but he could only imagine what the man had assumed all these years. That he didn\u2019t care. That Juliet hadn\u2019t mattered. That the grief of losing his wife meant nothing. Strictly looking at Hammer\u2019s version of events, Liam supposed he came off like an insensitive prick. He cursed himself for not following his instincts and rushing home from Miami.</p><p>Had Hammer\u2019s resentment spurred him to take Raine to bed the night Liam had first claimed her? It wouldn\u2019t surprise him if Macen had purposely tried to get her pregnant, too.</p><p>Bloody rat bastard.</p><p>And no matter how fucking angry he was, Liam couldn\u2019t rail to anyone at Shadows. Who would listen? Hammer? Liam rolled his eyes. Raine? Well, if Hammer had never told the man sharing Juliet\u2019s bed about his wife\u2019s tragic suicide, Liam doubted his old pal would have whispered a word of it to Raine. Not that Liam wanted to spill their dark past to the bruised, half-broken girl. He wanted to earn her trust, and telling her that story wouldn\u2019t help the cause.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough break, man,\u201d Seth commiserated. \u201cBut how the fuck were you supposed to know what happened if no one told you?\u201d</p><p>True. But that didn\u2019t eradicate his guilt or halt the need to unleash his wrath.</p><p>\u201cTo add insult to injury...\u201d Liam gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white. \u201cHammer made it clear, that he\u2019ll take whatever opportunity presents itself to drag her back to his bed again.\u201d</p><p>Seth paused. \u201cClearly, he\u2019s being a douche, but what\u2019s more important to you? Is it preventing Hammer from taking Raine to bed again or serving the needs of your sub? We already talked about this. If she needs you both\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the last sub you cared about, you wanted your friends fucking her?\u201d Liam countered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to make this about me. Focus on Raine. What are you really afraid of? Is it just that she\u2019ll spread her legs for Hammer again? Or that she\u2019ll ultimately choose him over you?\u201d</p><p>The question made Liam\u2019s heart seize. Hell, Seth saw right through him. \u201cHammer is too screwed up for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe confessing to you means he\u2019s finally letting go of the past. I understand you\u2019re pissed off at him, but what does she need?\u201d Seth sounded infinitely patient.</p><p>That made Liam want to grit his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll give her what she needs, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m hearing is your jealousy. You\u2019ve got to put Raine before Hammer and your anger. So far, you\u2019ve done everything right for her. Don\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>Why did Seth have to be so damn right?</p><p>Liam sighed in defeat. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s asking a lot of you, I know, especially when you\u2019re not sure where you stand with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shouted her love for Hammer to the rafters. But me? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that you\u2019re afraid that Raine will run back to Hammer, maybe for good. But you can\u2019t control the choices either of them make. You can only focus on your own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe plan we discussed last week...\u201d Liam swallowed tightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever done anything more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me then that she\u2019s crumbling. If she doesn\u2019t get what she needs, what then?\u201d</p><p>Liam raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI know, you bastard. Shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to me for help\u2014twice. We came up with this plan together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you then it was fucking terrible. It could all blow up in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could. But if you do nothing, it will. Unless you\u2019re not sure Raine is worth the effort and sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do what you know you\u2019ve got to. I\u2019m here if you need anything, but you have to keep it together and focus on the needs of your submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bloody good at nagging,\u201d he groused.</p><p>Seth chuckled. \u201cDo you want me to come out there and help you keep your head screwed on straight?\u201d</p><p>It would be damn nice to have someone in his corner. \u201cIf you can, I\u2019d be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way, Faultline U.S.A.\u201d</p><p>Liam let out half a laugh. \u201cThanks, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now fuck off and leave a man in peace. I\u2019ll let you know when I land in L.A.\u201d</p><p>After a somber trip back to Shadows, Liam sat at the foot of his bed, watching Raine sleep as he gathered his fortitude. She looked so damn beautiful\u2014peaceful\u2014in his bed.</p><p>The serenity on her face wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>The lass would never be whole if he didn\u2019t follow through with his plan. And he would never be whole without her. Dread nearly crushed him. But Seth was right; he had to put his fears aside and help her. The worst part was knowing that it wouldn\u2019t matter how gently he proceeded, the impact could be vicious.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>His heart twisting, Liam reached out for Raine, stroking the luscious leg she\u2019d thrust out from the covers, reveling in her soft skin. It was his...at least for the moment\u2014just like she was.</p><p>How had the girl branded his soul so quickly? Raine was everything he\u2019d never known he sought. Parts vulnerable, funny, tart, giving. Mysterious. Clever. She oozed sex. The Dom in him wanted to own her. The man in him wanted to conquer her. Liam shook his head. Hell, he sounded like a knuckle-dragging ape.</p><p>What he should be pondering was the ways in which he could imprint himself on Raine in return. He\u2019d told her he loved her a hundred times. She\u2019d never returned the sentiment. Liam felt sure it was, at least in part, because she didn\u2019t believe him. How could he make her understand his devotion before their conversation? How could he make her believe his love?</p><p>\u201cRaine, wake up.\u201d He caressed his way up her body, then scooted closer, bending to smooth the dark locks back from her sleep-soft face, willing himself not to get lost in her.</p><p>God, he wanted to make love to her again. It had been eleven days, but it felt like forever.</p> <p>Her dark lashes fluttered open to reveal her sleepy blue eyes, her expression welcoming as her lips curled up in a little smile. \u201cMorning, Liam...\u201d</p><p>She sat up and snuggled into his arms. He embraced her, savoring her closeness while he could, breathing her in, tangling his fingers in her silky hair, nuzzling her smooth cheek.</p><p>\u201cRaine,\u201d he whispered finally. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She purred into his neck, her breasts soft against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s so early. Come cuddle with me again. You\u2019re so warm, and I\u2019m happy when you\u2019re next to me.\u201d</p><p>In typical Raine fashion, she stalled any discussion that might result in him peeling away her layers and exposing her vulnerabilities. She kissed her way up his neck, across his jaw, angling toward his mouth, enticing him. Liam gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cNot now. I\u2019ll give you ten minutes to use the bathroom and ready yourself. Then I want you back here, flat on the sheet, hands above your head, with your thighs spread wide and that gorgeous pussy open. And I want your full attention. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened wider at his low demand. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sparks ignited down his spine. \u201cBest get a wriggle on, then. The clock starts now.\u201d</p><p>Raine sent him a kittenish smile as she rose and disappeared into the bathroom. When he heard the soft snick of the door closing, Liam prepared the space with everything he might need, methodically setting items in their place. He slid into that heady Domspace he always enjoyed with Raine. Not since their time at the lodge had he felt so in control of himself and their scene. He\u2019d allowed too many distractions to derail him since then, but now, thanks to his conversations with Seth, he felt focused, steady.</p><p>He just hoped like hell that Raine understood the message his actions meant to convey.</p><p>Moments later, she emerged from behind the closed door, hair and teeth brushed, face scrubbed and glowing, collar on. She wore nothing else, and that was precisely the way he liked her. His cock stood tall.</p><p>As she surveyed the room and saw everything he\u2019d set out, a smile of anticipation lifted her lips. That, he expected. But the hope in her blue eyes surprised him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you. The last few weeks have been so...\u201d She stopped herself, just when she might have said something important, and caressed his face with a soft, clinging stare. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here and that you want me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice said that she\u2019d been worried by the possibility that he hadn\u2019t after their Thanksgiving row, but she didn\u2019t verbalize it. That frustrated Liam. \u201cNo matter what you think, I\u2019ve always wanted you, Raine. From the very first minute I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and he swore he could see her heart in her eyes. Something far deeper than desire lay there. Why wouldn\u2019t she just bloody tell him?</p><p>Liam caressed the silky hair at her crown, then cupped her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to voice how I feel about you. I\u2019m still not sure you actually understand how strong my feelings have become, but now isn\u2019t the time for talking. Open yourself to me and let me show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at telling you my feelings.\u201d She brushed a kiss across his lips. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do my best to show you, too.\u201d</p><p>Then she lowered herself to the bed, legs parted, arms over her head, just as he\u2019d requested. It was a sight to behold. Her rosy nipples cresting plump breasts, the long, lean line of her torso leading down to sleek thighs, and the strip of dark hair above her otherwise bare folds made him ache and sweat.</p><p>As Liam hovered above her, he couldn\u2019t look away. Sexually, everything between them had always been as hot as a live wire, urgent, connected. This was one place her submission shined. Raine gave him everything in bed. But sharing her whole body was a thousand times easier for her than sharing even a part of the woman beneath.</p><p>Unbuttoning his shirt and shrugging it off, he toed off his shoes, and sat on the chair opposite to strip off his socks. He still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her, all gracefully arranged and spread out before him. He growled in satisfaction as she spread her thighs even wider, displaying his cunt and his ass, both reserved for his pleasure alone. Sorrow and pride blended, beautiful and bittersweet.</p><p>He pushed the melancholy aside. By god, regardless of today\u2019s outcome, she would feel him so deeply inside her\u2014mind, body, and soul\u2014that she\u2019d forever hold a piece of him close.</p><p>He unfastened his belt and unzipped carefully over his straining erection. His cock already wept for her, throbbing to be enveloped in her silken heat. He forced himself to be patient.</p><p>Walking to the bed, he reached for the cuffs, securing her wrists and ankles. He heard the soft quiver of her indrawn breath, then watched her test his restraints.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not be going anywhere until I say so. While you\u2019re with and under me, I\u2019m going to talk to you with my mouth, my hands, my body. I want you to listen and tell me what I\u2019m saying to you. Be specific, Raine. I want to hear about the sensations, your level of intensity.\u201d He leaned over her, knee pressed to the mattress between her legs, and delved into her eyes. \u201cMore important, find the words to tell me how my actions make you feel. Do that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to communicate.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into her face, pinning her to the bed with a firm stare. \u201cYour very best, Raine. Nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Sudden apprehension rolled across her expression. She grasped his displeasure, lingering since Thanksgiving. She felt it. But she didn\u2019t broach the subject. In fact, they hadn\u2019t spoken at all about that day. He\u2019d tried. The first time she\u2019d lured him to silence with a blow job, and he cursed himself for letting her lead him astray. The second time, she\u2019d suddenly remembered a task she\u2019d neglected to finish to ready the dungeon for play that night. Liam had followed her, still talking...only to be stopped short when he spied Hammer and Beck already in the room. He hadn\u2019t bothered trying to talk to Raine again.</p><p>Now he\u2019d get her attention.</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll let me know how you\u2019re feeling with the colors of the traffic lights. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell me your safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He released a little slack in the chains attached to the cuffs at her ankles and bent her knees to make a cradle for him.</p><p>Wretchedly eager to feel her, Liam covered her body with his own\u2014and forced himself to do nothing more than rub his cock along the wet, engorged lips of her sex. Raine whimpered and tried to wriggle her hips to align the head with her opening. Sliding inside her was so tempting. It would be so easy to simply let the pleasure take over. But so unfulfilling in the end.</p><p>Liam pulled back. \u201cI told you to communicate what you want, not wiggle. Do I have to punish you before we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She swallowed, hesitated. \u201cI, um...like it when you touch me. I miss having you inside me. I want to feel you now.\u201d</p><p>At her words, he barely managed not to snort. Raine had a bad habit of topping from the bottom that made his inner Dom roar to subdue her. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her ear, laving the lobe with wet kisses. As she moaned in appreciation, he reared back enough to cup the hot, silky weight of her breast in his hand, kneading it firmly all the way to the tip. Rolling and pinching her tight nipple, it swelled and lengthened between his fingers. He rolled beside her and nipped at the base of her throat, then suckled her nipple, even as he reached for a clamp.</p><p>She hissed as he slid the little alligator-toothed implement into place. She gasped sharply with the shock of pain and pleasure. He waited for her to speak. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>Running his hand over her warm skin and reaching for her other breast, he pinched and laved its tip, then applied the twin clamp, reveling in the way she tensed, then exhaled out all her tension with a low moan.</p><p>\u201cRaine?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? Use your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the sensations in my body are centered around my nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod, inky strands of her hair brushing the tops of her pale breasts, flirting with the clamps. The sight of her flushed and aroused beneath him played hell with his self-control. He forced himself to rein in the urge not to fuck her.</p><p>\u201cI love it. The pain is just enough to excite me. It sounds odd, but I feel so female and submissive when you bind me this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot odd at all. It\u2019s designed to.\u201d</p><p>Liam tugged on the little chain between the clamps, loving her shaky little gasp. \u201cHow does it make you feel, knowing I\u2019m giving you these sensations?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered before she focused on him. \u201cDesired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You are, love.\u201d</p><p>On hands and knees, he settled himself over her, then brushed the hair from her eyes, waiting until she met his stare. \u201cSo beautiful. You\u2019re not like any woman I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile played at her lush mouth. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m more challenge than submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both. You\u2019ve always intrigued me. How did I make you feel when we first met?\u201d He cradled her breast, thumb caressing the inner curve.</p><p>\u201cIntimidated,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou were polite to a fault. With a smile, you tried to set me at ease. But I realized you were assessing me and drawing conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was studying the woman who had Hammer tied up in knots. How did the way we spoke make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrutinized.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head, pointing to her chest. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>She took in a shaky breath. \u201cNervous. Dizzy. Watched. A little excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You filled my head that day. Your face, your scent, your voice. You were like a tingling in my spine, surprising but not unwelcome.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face toward him, and Liam didn\u2019t resist the need to kiss her. Rather than diving into her mouth and taking all he wanted, he teased her with a brush of lips, then lifted away. He did it again, lingering a little longer before he pulled back. But fuck, she lured and addicted him. He parted her lips and dove in for a long, exhilarating moment, moaning when she arched beneath him. Before he lost himself in Raine, he eased back, peppering her cheeks and neck with his kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop pulling away!\u201d</p><p>Liam heard the frustration in her tone. It ramped up his need. \u201cDo you give the orders, sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, suitably chastened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you demand more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a billion dollars, but you don\u2019t see me robbing banks for it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right in front of me, looking at me like I mean...something to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou mean everything to me.\u201d</p><p>Raine lowered her gaze. She was still afraid to believe him, damn it to hell.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen you look at me like that, I...it makes me feel good inside,\u201d she spoke, but she\u2019d gone quiet. \u201cWorthy. Your touch says you value me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek, then caressed his way down to cup her chin, lifting it to make sure she had nowhere to look but at him. \u201cDo you feel treasured when I touch you this way?\u201d</p><p>A little flush splashed across her cheeks. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou feel that I care for you, love?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Liam felt her body tighten, saw her expression start to retreat. He was approaching her comfort zone. She didn\u2019t have a hard time loving, he realized. She had a hard time believing that anyone loved her. If he could change that, she would feel secure revealing her devotion in return. His chest twisted up. Raine might be closed off, but she had such a big heart to give. He wanted it for his own.</p><p>\u201cI do, Raine,\u201d he reassured her. \u201cI\u2019ve told you many times.\u201d</p><p>He bent to press his mouth fully onto hers, sinking in for a slow melding of lips, an unhurried stroke of her tongue, and a shared breath. Liam anchored himself in the moment, never rushing, always simply letting her feel how much he wanted and adored her.</p><p>Her response began cautiously, as if she wasn\u2019t sure whether to believe all the affection in the kiss. With every sweep, he met her, giving her a bit more, always there to guide her, catch her, encourage her.</p><p>The hesitation left her gradually, an inch of starch at a time softening, until she opened completely and whimpered, giving him all her passion in that one kiss. Desperation poured from her. And need. With every moan and glide of her tongue, she told him that he mattered to her. She loved him. Liam felt waves of it from her. This was part of what addicted him to her, not just her beauty or sexuality, but the way he could feel her vulnerability, need, and caring when he held her.</p><p>With one fist in her hair to keep her close and the other clamped onto her hip, he broke away. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery green,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that kiss make you feel?\u201d</p><p>Raine shrank back a bit. A little furrow appeared between her brows. He tried not to grit his teeth in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong answer, love. I only ask because I care.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cLanguid. Connected to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped you would say that.\u201d For starters, anyway. He ran a hand up her soft, smooth torso to her breast, brushing his knuckles across the swell. \u201cWhat did that kiss tell you about my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were there for me.\u201d She had a harder time getting the next words out. Liam watched her struggle and urged her to fight. \u201cThat you care.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t be news to her. \u201cOf course I do. But I always want you to feel it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She didn\u2019t speak, but her stare never wavered. Hope and need and a silent pleading for his affection all lay there. She wanted more and wanted to share herself.</p><p>Anticipation charged his blood. \u201cSomething you want to say, love?\u201d</p><p>Raine blinked, bit her lip, then shook her head and lowered her gaze. She was so bloody bottled up. Liam forced down more disappointment. He refused to give up.</p><p>Lowering himself to his elbows, he settled his face closer, brushing his lips over hers. \u201cYou can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. He sighed.</p><p>Shimmying down her body, he knelt to kiss the insteps of her little feet and nip at her toes. The ticklish girl giggled, then watched him with wide eyes, her expression somewhere between awestruck and afraid. Bloody hell, there was a wealth of information on her face. She\u2019d been fucked\u2014by the bastard who had taken her virginity, by Hammer, even by him\u2014but no one had truly taken the time to show her his caring through touch. It made him doubly determined to reveal his heart without words now.</p><p>He kissed his way up her smooth legs, lingered at the soft caps of her knees, laving his way up her thighs, until he breathed over her pussy. The lass was wetter than he\u2019d ever seen her. The closer his lips came, the more ragged and uneven her breath turned. She thrust her hips at him. He pinned her gently to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cNo, love. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get the word out fast enough.</p><p>He smiled, then blew a hot breath on her slick folds and rubbed the pad of his thumb right above the plump flesh. \u201cWhat does my touch make you feel now? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than wanted. Like...no one else matters more to you. It sounds crazy, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re exactly right. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>With both thumbs, he opened her cunt to his gaze, his tongue. Liam lifted her hips high, his hands banded about her thighs, as he buried his face in her folds, eating her slick flesh like a man starved. He kissed the most feminine part of her with his whole body, giving her all the thoroughness he\u2019d bestowed on her mouth. Even though his cock wept, hard as steel and pounding with need to be inside her, he lingered, aroused, encouraged, brought her higher.</p><p>Intoxicated by her slippery musk sliding across his tongue, he hummed his approval against her softness. \u201cDoes that make you feel cared for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head is swimming,\u201d she panted. \u201cMy blood is rushing. My pussy aches.\u201d</p><p>Easy responses to confess, and probably ones that had stroked his masculine pride in the past. Now he wanted more. \u201cGood. What about your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t imagine you giving that intensity, in that way, unless it meant something to you.\u201d</p><p>A better response, but still not what he sought. \u201cYes. But what do you feel in your heart when I do this?\u201d</p><p>He bent to give her another loving, longing lick deep in her furrow, delighting when she tensed under him and softly moaned, writhing.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel like...you want me to know that you care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She danced around the words he really wanted to hear. Her insecurities and needs all glimmered in those blue eyes. She\u2019d nearly drowned him at first glance; nothing had changed, especially the fact that she was too afraid to tell him how she felt.</p><p>But he still had more ways in order to help her try.</p><p>Crawling up her body, he rested his weight on one elbow, his face level with her breasts. After a quick tug on the chain, he released one nipple, sucking it directly into his mouth, soothing it even as he drew more blood to the tip.</p><p>\u201cRaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tingle. I ache. I...need. Liam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does my touch say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you know how to play my body so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He waited until she complied. \u201cWhy would I have paid so much attention to you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI matter.\u201d She whispered the words, and he almost didn\u2019t hear. Almost as if she was afraid to voice the guess or jinx herself.</p><p>Liam grabbed her shoulders, his stare penetrating her, reaching for her soul. \u201cYou always have.\u201d</p><p>He rewarded her by removing the other clamp and treating the nipple to a thorough coaxing with his tongue. He filtered his fingers through her hair, loving the little groans and whimpers that slipped from her throat.</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He had to be closer to her.</p><p>Covering her body with his own, he sank into her mouth and simply lost himself. No woman he\u2019d ever fucked in a club, taken in a casual hook-up, shared with another, or even married had ever awakened this fever in his heart. Just Raine. He stopped trying to give her messages and simply let everything he felt pour all over her.</p><p>As he did, Liam pressed himself against her, his cock burrowing ceaselessly back and forth at her cunt, bumping her clit and avoiding the tantalizing well that coated his cock with her cream, promising nirvana if he\u2019d only plunge inside.</p><p>Raine moaned, thrusting her hips up at him.</p><p>Reaching around her, he fisted her hair and clamped her delicate skull with his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019ll hold fast to me. You\u2019ll not come until I tell you. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her voice was breathy.</p><p>As she often did when he commanded her, Raine softened, turning pliant. Submissive. Anticipation zipped through him.</p><p>\u201cGood. And you will not look away from me. Not once.\u201d He tugged again at the thick strands of her hair to let her know he meant that. He could\u2014and would\u2014keep her stare exactly where he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she vowed, her stare clinging to his.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d Her face showed tinges of apprehension, but she still sounded steady. Strong.</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d</p><p>He leaned across the bed and grabbed a condom, wishing she\u2019d already been protected with birth control as he sheathed his hungry, waiting shaft. Lifting Raine, he settled her delicate curves against him. Aligning himself against her silky body, his nerve endings ignited in a heated rush. He wanted to be tender with her, but when he parted her slick, wet heat with his ready cock, he plunged home in an endless stroke that sent him deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely inside you,\u201d he groaned. \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, her dark mane spreading across the pale sheets. She rocked beneath him. Her soft kitten moans made his inner Dom howl.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Raine did with a gasp, and a jolt of electricity rattled his spine.</p><p>\u201cI feel taken,\u201d she moaned. \u201cPossessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like feeling owned?\u201d Using the fist in her hair, he cocked her head to one side, exposing her neck. He feathered kisses up the milky column, feeling her pulse flutter under his lips.</p><p>\u201cYes. Every time you touch me, I melt. Every time we\u2019re apart, I can\u2019t wait for you again. Please, Liam...\u201d She writhed against him with a soft moan, trying to encourage him to thrust.</p><p>\u201cPatience. I enjoy your body. Touching you. Commanding you. Making you come when I will it. You intoxicate me. I love to watch you unravel.\u201d</p><p>A rosy hue crept over her fair skin, and he loved that he could still make her blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to fuck you, Raine.\u201d If he showed her how much he loved her, maybe it would take the sting out of all he needed to say.</p><p>He pressed a ravenous kiss to her throat, sucking and nipping the heated skin. He burned alive as her cunt consumed him. Her legs wrapped as tightly around his hips as the chains allowed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Raine. You slay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>It did, and that barely scratched the surface of sensations jetting through his veins. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel needed.\u201d Her body bucked. Her eyes teared up. \u201cI need that. From you.\u201d</p><p>Clutching her, he stroked her torturously slow, a deep slide into forever. Again. And again. One blurred into the next, her cries filling his ears. She pleaded and begged. Her flesh squeezed him as he plundered her pussy with each thrust. With every retreat, her slick folds tightened, trying to suck him back in.</p><p>Baring his teeth with a grunt, he drove up into her tight, velvety passage. Her little feminine sounds boiled his blood and urged him to take her harder, higher, deeper. God, he loved this woman.</p><p>He could ask himself why. He could ask himself what tomorrow would bring. But the answers to those questions came back to Raine, as did the biggest question of all: What was it going to take to finally make her understand that peace and happiness lay within her own grasp? All he could do was shower her with his love and be the catalyst.</p><p>Gripping Raine tighter, he captured her lips, sliding inside her mouth to take everything\u2014her flavor, her passion, her softness\u2014all the way to her deepest recesses. Everything about her inflamed him. He\u2019d come to crave her, need her like he needed food or water or air.</p><p>He pinched her nipples again. Yes, he needed those little cries, too. He needed her to beg. So he slowed his strokes to a torturous drag over every sensitive spot inside her cunt. \u201cTell me how you feel, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She writhed all over him. \u201cBurning, aching. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and nipped the swollen tips of her breasts bouncing in front of him. She bit into his shoulder. With her, nothing was easy, nor would it ever be. He understood that, just as he understood that her love and commitment to them was worth fighting for. He was steeled for the battle of his life, but by god, if she wanted him, she\u2019d have to fight, too. If she did...by the time this was over, she\u2019d feel him beneath her skin and wonder how she\u2019d ever done without everything he offered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me more,\u201d he snarled. \u201cGive me everything.\u201d</p><p>She cried out at his rough invasion, the sounds of her pleasure only firing him up more as he filled his palms with her swollen breasts and pistoned his hips, thrusting wildly between the wettest, sweetest folds he could imagine on a woman\u2019s pussy. Even while his heart bled.</p><p>\u201cI feel like...\u201d She panted, struggling, trying to hold the words back.</p><p>Liam stared into her eyes, so wide and pleading.</p> <p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you love me.\u201d It rushed out almost like a single word, then she drew in a shaky breath, coursing with emotion. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t deserve it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel like I love you because I do.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hips until he felt sure they\u2019d bruise and drove into her using every bit of his breath, every ounce of his strength, shuttling deep with every drop of determination. He\u2019d put his stamp on her the best way he knew how. And prayed that something he\u2019d done had reached her bloody stubborn heart.</p><p>\u201cLiam!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake me, lass. All the way inside you, to the places you don\u2019t give anyone else. Take everything I\u2019ve got to give you. Pleasure, pain, joy, sorrow. They\u2019re all mine, just like you.\u201d</p><p>Under him, she whimpered. Her body surged and rolled, swelled and arched. He slid even farther inside of her, her flesh grasping and clutching him.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried out. \u201cI\u2019m so close. Please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Raine. No matter what, I love you today, tomorrow, always. Promise me you\u2019ll not forget...\u201d</p><p>But her keening cry of impending orgasm was her only answer. He reached between them and stroked her clit to launch her ecstasy. He relished in her trembling beneath him. \u201cThat\u2019s it, love. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes and felt her release sweep through him like a shockwave as she wailed out her climax. He tried to hold his own for as long as he could, but his body would not be denied as he pulled free of her, tore the condom from his pulsating cock, and felt the surge of semen burst upward and out, covering her milky white belly and breasts. Liam marked her, roaring as he held on for dear life.</p> <p>He rubbed his seed into her porcelain skin, determined to have his scent upon her, hoping it meant to her all that it did to him.</p><p>Liam had given her everything\u2014mentally, physically, emotionally. He felt spent in every sense of the word as he sprawled on his back with Raine tangled in his arms. The fan above them lazily spun.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me at all?\u201d he asked, unable to stop himself.</p><p>Beside him, she tensed. He heard her swallow.</p><p>Rolling to his side, Liam pinned her with a stare. Her heart was in her eyes. She wanted to say yes, damn it. He\u2019d felt it in her touch. He could bloody well feel it now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her mouth hung open, but she said nothing else.</p><p>Raine sucked in harsh breaths. She paled.</p><p>\u201cBe brave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d she sobbed and tried to roll from the bed.</p><p>As he grabbed her arm to stay her, agony gutted Liam. Weariness and crushing regret dashed the satisfaction spiraling through him just moments ago. He felt hollow. Destroyed. He gripped her tightly, willing her to look at him. Her whole body trembled. He felt her yearning, damn it. But she wouldn\u2019t face him.</p><p>Maybe he wanted more than she was capable of giving. Maybe he wasn\u2019t enough for her. He swallowed. Maybe she just didn\u2019t love him enough.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The truth was, she was too afraid to tell him how she felt. Because of her father? No, she\u2019d had no trouble telling Hammer. But his old pal had shoved her love back in her face over and over, bruising her ego. Breaking her heart? Yeah, probably.</p><p>His hopes of saving her dissolved. He\u2019d been kidding himself that he could. It seemed he was years too late for that.</p><p>How ironic that he\u2019d taken up with Raine to build her confidence a bit and prod Hammer with jealousy. But Macen was having the last laugh. Liam knew he\u2019d never be the same.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he lifted a finger and tilted her chin. The collar at her throat looked so lovely in the light. His heart clutched as he brought her mouth to his for a soft kiss.</p><p>As he brushed her lips with his own, he reached behind her neck and slipped the latch on the collar. The precious metal with its dangling ruby was warm from her skin. The catch fell open, and the piece slid into his waiting hand.</p><p>She froze\u2014her kiss, her stare, her breath. Raine pulled back slowly, then looked at the collar in his palm, blinking with shock and confusion. Questions clouded her eyes. Anxiety tightened her face. He dragged in a sawing draught of air. He fucking hated hurting her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He set the collar on the nightstand. \u201cI told you we needed to talk, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She tried to jerk away. \u201cYou used me before you decided to tell me to kiss off.\u201d</p><p>He held tight, not letting her move an inch. \u201cI made love to you, hoping you\u2019d understand. But you don\u2019t.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to explain myself, and I want you to listen carefully. For this to work, I need you to communicate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is about the migraine, I swear that I wasn\u2019t keeping it from you on purpose. I just had so much else on my mind that I forgot to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were thinking of me at all, you\u2019d automatically share something like that with me. It would be second nature. You want my affection. You want my sexual domination. You don\u2019t want to do the work necessary to truly submit. Hell, to have a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Her blue eyes pleaded, frantic. \u201cI\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill hiding big chunks of your heart and soul to yourself. You\u2019re not ready to be collared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not fair is that I\u2019m your Dom in name only. I won\u2019t fight you if you don\u2019t want to give yourself freely. Only you can decide how important I am to you\u2014if at all. But I can\u2019t keep submitting to you while I try to give you what I know you need. I\u2019m not oblivious to your fears, but you either trust me and love me...or you don\u2019t. I\u2019m done trying to pry everything out of you, only to discover you\u2019ve not been bloody honest. I get half-truths and subtle lies designed to make me feel better. Is it because you think I\u2019m too stupid to understand or too weak to handle them?\u201d</p><p>Horror crossed Raine\u2019s face. \u201cNeither! I told you before; I just don\u2019t want to upset or trouble you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr have to risk my wrath, admit you\u2019ve fucked up, and truly give yourself to me. I know the game, Raine. I\u2019ve seen it played many times. And I won\u2019t play it with you anymore. I want you back...but not until you learn to communicate. Be honest with me. Trust me. And surrender your control to me. I see the real you, no matter how much you try to hide. And I still want you, still love you. I always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re punishing me for Thanksgiving day,\u201d she accused, her voice thickening with emotion.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t any sort of discipline. But I\u2019ve finally got your attention, lass. The pickles I fed you back at the lodge to coax you to open up just weren\u2019t working anymore.\u201d</p><p>That seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, and she struggled from his embrace again, this time with all her might.</p><p>Still, he held strong. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m giving you a wee break so you can decide whether you want to go through life alone or open your heart and be loved. I can\u2019t make the choice for you.\u201d Finally, he released her with a sigh.</p><p>She scrambled away and jumped from the bed, spearing him with a teary accusation. Betrayal narrowed her eyes. \u201cI knew you were going to do this eventually. I told you from the beginning that you\u2019d give up on me and leave, just like everyone else. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be good enough for you. I told you... I\u2019m so stupid for hoping you\u2019d be different.\u201d</p><p>As she made a mad dash for the door, his heart sank. He ran after her and slapped his palms against the door on either side of her so she couldn\u2019t open it. \u201cRaine, hear me well. I\u2019m not leaving you. I\u2019m giving you some space so you can figure things out. You won\u2019t have my expectations hanging over your head to cloud your thoughts. I\u2019m always here to answer questions or reassure you. And don\u2019t you dare be thinking about running away. But you have to search your own soul. If you\u2019re willing to do the work to be whole and want what we could have, come back to me. If not...\u201d His fucking heart was breaking, and he could barely choke the words out. \u201cThen this is the end.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Raine stood under the hot spray of her shower, sobbing so hard she could barely take a breath. For the last month, Liam had quietly and solidly supported her, keeping her balanced and almost happy. He\u2019d treasured her in a hundred ways. He\u2019d shown her every day that he wanted her.</p><p>Until today when he\u2019d left her.</p><p>How was she going to survive when she felt as if her chest had been torn open and everything inside yanked out with a few brutally soft words?</p><p>She reached for her favorite shampoo. But it was with Liam, in his room, in his shower. He also had her body wash, a bunch of her clothes...and half her heart. He didn\u2019t want that half anymore.</p><p>And Hammer wouldn\u2019t take the other half.</p><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, she curled her hands under her chin and bowed her head. The absence of her collar stabbed her with agony again. And remorse. Falling back against the cold tile, she let the tears flow. They mingled with the water, pelting her unrelentingly.</p><p>Liam had left her.</p><p>The thought razed through her brain again. Her knees buckled. Another sob robbed her of breath. More tears joined the cascade of water. She could barely think past the pain.</p><p>On autopilot, Raine shampooed her hair, scrubbed Liam\u2019s seed from her body, washed her face, then stepped out. The towel smelled like fabric softener, not Liam. She\u2019d become so accustomed to sharing his, smelling his musk on the damp terrycloth. It made her feel safe. Why hadn\u2019t she realized that before now?</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she been able to tell him that she loved him when she did, so very, very much? The disappointment on his face had seared itself into her memory.</p><p>Maybe it didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d made himself clear that he would welcome her back, but only if she was a different person. Raine didn\u2019t know how to be that.</p><p>She dredged up an almost superhuman effort to slather lotion on her skin, braid her hair, and apply lip gloss. Raine gave up then. She just didn\u2019t care about the rest.</p><p>Leaving the steamy bathroom, she wriggled her way into some panties, a bra, a pair of sweatpants, and a sweatshirt. Lying in one of her drawers, she fingered an old T-shirt that had been Hammer\u2019s once, long ago. She\u2019d taken it from him and slept in it for months, just to feel close to him. Shortly after turning twenty-one and realizing that he still treated her every bit like a child, she\u2019d tucked it away.</p><p>Raine knew now that his attitude had been a front...but nothing had really changed. He would never love her in return. Sure, he might want to fuck her for a night or two\u2014and yes, she could run to his room and seduce him now\u2014but she loved Hammer too much to make him the instrument of her revenge. And regardless of the hurt Liam had inflicted, she just didn\u2019t have it in her to stab him in return.</p><p>Shoving the shirt back in her drawer, Raine looked around the room she\u2019d called her own for years. She didn\u2019t belong here anymore.</p><p>So where did that leave her? More to the point, where did she belong? Liam had released her because she couldn\u2019t be what he needed. Hammer had refused her for so long, and after their torrid night of passion, he\u2019d let her go for the exact same reason.</p><p>Her dad had been right all along. She wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>Maybe if she left, Liam and Hammer would finally repair their friendship. That would make them happy someday, and then she could say she\u2019d done at least one thing right.</p><p>Of course Raine recognized that running was an old pattern of hers, one both men had chided her about. But in this case, she just didn\u2019t see any way for the healing to begin if she was constantly underfoot to provide the friction between them. Besides, if she had to look at them every day and know they\u2019d never be hers, it would eventually destroy her.</p><p>Leaving was best.</p><p>That would probably seem unfathomable to Liam. He\u2019d been nudging her to leave Shadows with him since he\u2019d collared her because it would be good for her. She hadn\u2019t agreed and had refused to go. But everything was different now.</p><p>As much as she hated to leave her home, she\u2019d do it for both men. For their friendship, which had deteriorated drastically since they\u2019d torn apart the kitchen on Thanksgiving. She didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened, but the tension was tangible and thick between them now. Ugly. The blame for that rested squarely on her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pushing aside dread of the unknown she\u2019d face once she left, Raine grabbed a suitcase from her closet. She had a little money in the bank. She\u2019d find a new place and a new job. After all, she had a college degree and some accounting skills. She was good with people. She\u2019d been an office manager...of sorts. Somehow, someway, she\u2019d figure it out.</p><p>Blotting her face with a tissue, Raine sniffled back tears. They were useless. Liam and Hammer couldn\u2019t change what they needed, and she couldn\u2019t change who she was. It had been destined to end this way, she supposed.</p><p>Desolation hollowed her as she tossed most of her belongings into the suitcase. She packed some of her favorite pictures: Hammer dressed as the devil, opposite her angel, last Halloween. She and Liam at their collaring ceremony. One she\u2019d taken of the two men clinking beer mugs the night Liam had first arrived from New York. All happy times. All smiles. So unlike now.</p><p>Raine sighed and zipped her suitcase, scanning her room. Sad that she\u2019d packed up most of her life in fifteen minutes. All she had to do was load her car and drive off.</p> <p>Wait, it wasn\u2019t her car. Hammer had bought it for her. The title was in his name. And she\u2019d accepted the gift because it made her feel special to him. Stupid. The smarter move would have been to stand on her own two feet. She sure as hell refused to steal from him now.</p><p>She fished her car keys from her purse, along with the keys to Shadows, and left them on her dresser. He\u2019d find them at some point.</p><p>Dismissing the thought, she dug out her phone, Googled a quick number, and made the saddest phone call of her life. The voice on the other end said she had ten minutes left, but why wait? Why take a chance that Liam or Hammer would come looking for her? It was probably cowardly to just disappear. But so much easier. She\u2019d make sure they knew she was all right and make them promise to let her go.</p><p>She backed out of the room, taking one last sweeping look around. Not that it mattered; this place was permanently imprinted in her memories. On her heart. Just like the men who lived here.</p><p>No one walked the hall as she slipped out of her room. No one confronted her as she made her way past Liam\u2019s door, past Hammer\u2019s. She shoved her way into the alley, peering out at the overcast day. Raine couldn\u2019t believe this was the last time she\u2019d be at Shadows. Everything had happened so fast. The moment felt so surreal. But she wasn\u2019t going to wake up, rub her eyes, and realize this had all been a dream.</p> <p>Standing in the alley, the wind tugged at her clothes and made her nose cold. It was almost December. Her wet hair filled her with a chill. She probably should have packed a coat, but the mild discomfort was nothing compared to the torment dismembering her heart.</p><p>Right on schedule, her taxi arrived. She turned off her phone and shoved it into her purse, approaching the vehicle. This was it. She swiped fresh tears from her face.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d the gruff cabbie asked.</p><p>Good question. Someplace familiar\u2014for now. She\u2019d figure out where to head from there.</p><p>Raine rattled off the name of a drugstore a few blocks from where she\u2019d grown up. It was in the center of town. Once there, she could begin to settle everything else. The town was relatively quiet, growing so she could find a job and easy to navigate if it took her a while to buy another car. She wouldn\u2019t feel safe there\u2014she only truly did under Hammer\u2019s roof\u2014but she\u2019d closed that chapter of her life, so moving on...</p><p>The taxi driver put his foot on the gas, and the car lurched forward. The scarred dumpster Hammer had once found her hiding behind and the familiar building where she\u2019d learned about love from the two amazing men who had forever changed her life rolled out of sight.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, she\u2019d done nothing but stare out the window. She almost felt...numb. It was kind of nice. Raine didn\u2019t expect the reprieve to last because the pain lurked just under the surface. But she\u2019d take the daze for now. The minute she found some privacy, it was bound to get ugly.</p><p>The cab stopped in the little strip shopping center. She thought about asking him to wait, but he got a call for another fare. And honestly, she didn\u2019t know where to tell him to take her. She paid him, grabbed her suitcase, then climbed out.</p><p>It started to rain.</p><p>Damn it, if that didn\u2019t just add to the day. Sighing, Raine dashed into the shelter of the store. She pretended to browse the cosmetics and self-care products. She walked past greeting cards, toys, snacks\u2014and came to something she could really use.</p><p>She grabbed the first one on the shelf, paid a goth girl for it, and peered out, hoping for a break in the storm, which probably wouldn\u2019t last. But all she had to do was find a place to hang her head for the night. Then the skies could pour down buckets for all she fucking cared.</p><p>Except no one was going to rent her a room at ten thirty in the morning.</p><p>Crap, she couldn\u2019t even plan a departure without fucking it up.</p><p>At the end of the road, the sign of a low-budget chain of motels caught her attention. It wasn\u2019t fancy, but it was clean and probably pimp-free. Those were her only requirements now.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, she juggled her purchase under her arm and, fingers aching, transferred her suitcase to her other hand as she strolled through the automatic double doors. Securing a room for the night would be no problem. Their computers were down currently, and none of the rooms would be clean for a few hours. The desk clerk agreed to store her suitcase for her, handed her a claim ticket, then told her she could check in officially as soon as the touchy machines all came back online.</p><p>Now what? She could hang out in the lobby, but she\u2019d have nothing to do except to think of all she\u2019d lost. Since she was no longer focused on the details of getting from Point A to Point B, the gouging sadness was begging to dig at her again, emptying her of any desire to put one foot in front of the other. It would get better, she knew. In time. A few months, if she was lucky. Maybe a few years.</p><p>Maybe never.</p><p>Raine shoved the thought aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the nearest restaurant?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known once upon a time, but she hadn\u2019t lived here in years.</p><p>The desk clerk referred her to a pancake house a few blocks away, closer to the freeway. Not that it mattered, really. She wasn\u2019t hungry, but pretending to eat would kill time.</p><p>As she started for the door, the hotel\u2019s little shuttle pulled up.</p><p>\u201cThe bus will take you anywhere within a two-mile radius for free,\u201d the clerk offered helpfully, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Raine didn\u2019t glance back, just walked out.</p><p>The old bus driver smiled brightly as she stepped inside. His jovial grin was contagious, and she did her best to smile back. He had kind eyes and looked on the brink of asking her what was wrong, but she was sure he\u2019d never been in a BDSM love triangle, so she amped up her plastic expression and commented on the weather.</p><p>After handing her a business card with a number to call when she wanted him to retrieve her, the man dropped her off in front of the diner that was way too cheerful for her mood. The thought of eating alone depressed her more.</p><p>Shouldering her purse, she wandered up the road instead, crossing a busy intersection. What the hell was she doing? She had no idea where she was going\u2014not just today, but tomorrow. Next week. Next month. For the rest of her life.</p><p>Raine rubbed at her forehead. She had to get off the pity pot. Give herself today and grieve, then figure her shit out. All this moping just wasn\u2019t going to solve anything.</p><p>Vaguely, she wondered if Liam or Hammer had even realized she was gone yet. If they had, would they be searching? Probably. Liam might even feel guilty. Hammer might be ticked off. Maybe she should set them at ease before she did anything else. But if she called there...what if one of them answered?</p><p>Suddenly, she looked up and saw the new hospital in town. And she knew exactly what to do.</p><p>Hammer stepped from the shower, hearing the senseless droning of the morning talk show host interviewing the latest reality \u201ccelebrity\u201d in the background. Exhaustion weighed on him. He yawned and stretched. Was his fatigue the result of another fitful night? The incessant replay of Raine\u2019s cries of pleasure earlier this morning? Or the constant spooling in his head of the advice Beck had given him eight days ago that he still hadn\u2019t taken?</p><p>While punching his pillow and tossing restlessly last night, he\u2019d come to the conclusion that he needed to apologize to Liam. The speech he\u2019d prepared in his head and practiced in the shower felt more stilted than he\u2019d like. But he\u2019d say it. Once that was behind him, he could move onto the second step necessary to take control of his life again. How would Raine react when he confessed that he loved her and always had?</p><p>Hammer mussed his hair and threw on some clothes, determined that today he would sit Raine down and utter the three words he\u2019d carried in his heart for so long.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be as nervous as a teenage boy asking his first girl out on a date, but his stomach was in knots. Once he\u2019d told her how he felt, he hoped they could move forward together\u2014just the two of them.</p><p>The possibility exhilarated him.</p><p>Dressed and ready to vanquish his demons, he strode to the room beside his and knocked on Liam\u2019s door. The apology repeated through Hammer\u2019s brain as he waited, then knocked again. No one answered.</p><p>Frowning, he made his way to the kitchen, wondering if his precious girl was baking. But it, too, was empty. The only sign of life was a freshly brewed pot of coffee that smelled more like tar than anything Raine would make. Still, he needed it.</p><p>Hammer poured himself a mug and took a sip as he left the kitchen, grimacing at the warm sludge sliding down his throat.</p><p>When he reached the dungeon, he skimmed a glance over the open space. He didn\u2019t see Liam or Raine. Had they gone to the gym? Out for breakfast? Or had they just ignored his knock, too wrapped up in their cocoon of bliss to give a fuck about him?</p><p>Fighting impatience, Hammer climbed the stairs to the bar. To his surprise, Liam sat on a tall stool, stooped over and nursing a mug of the terrible coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Hammer said stiffly.</p><p>Liam barely glanced his way, just nodded and sipped more of the brew, hissing as it hit his tongue. \u201cGod, that\u2019s shit.\u201d</p><p>Hammer stared down into his own cup. \u201cIt is. Who made it?\u201d</p><p>With a grunt, Liam shoved his away. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>It fucking sucked. Hammer abandoned his mug on the bar, too. Then he drew in a deep breath. \u201cI need to say something to you.\u201d</p><p>Liam glanced to the stool beside him, wordlessly inviting him to sit. Hammer slid onto the seat.</p><p>This speech had been ten times easier when he\u2019d been dishing it out to his own reflection. But the fact that he hated apologies and this one felt fucking awkward didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Liam shrugged, stared at the steam rising from his cup, his expression heavy and guarded. Hammer couldn\u2019t miss the deep furrow between his brows. Jesus, the guy looked desolate.</p><p>Another wave of guilt poured over Hammer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for a lot of things I\u2019ve said and done. You\u2019ve always been a like a brother to me. Wallowing in my guilt about Juliet, then assigning it to you while withholding the truth was despicable. But not nearly as unfair as dumping everything on your shoulders years later. I apologize. You deserved better.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Liam scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you. And I\u2019m more sorry than I can say for the hell you went through. I don\u2019t pretend to understand what Juliet did or why you didn\u2019t share your pain with me. Maybe you thought I was too young and stupid to get it.\u201d Before Hammer could refute that, Liam went on. \u201cFuck if I know. Doesn\u2019t matter now, does it?\u201d</p><p>Liam stared straight ahead into the mirror, looking remote, resigned. Hammer bit back a sigh. Had his secretive bullshit irrevocably severed their friendship? Great. Wait until Liam realized he not only intended to work his way into Raine\u2019s bed again, but claim her once and for all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to that, Liam. I lost a wife and a child in one day, and it eventually cost me my best friend. I might have been wrong to wait so long to vomit out the truth\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam snorted. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I was wrong, but I came clean. Everything I said Thanksgiving night was honest.\u201d Hammer stared into the mirror, trying to read Liam\u2019s reaction. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what you thought of the revelations about Juliet. You never said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it mattered to you. Since she died, you shut down and pissed off. So I moved on. Am I supposed to be sorry for that?\u201d Liam finally turned to him with a scowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point now? All this retrospective crap doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d Liam made to rise from the stool.</p><p>\u201cWait! I\u2019m not done, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Liam settled back onto the barstool. \u201cHurry the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Hammer lost his temper. \u201cYou got a tampon to change?\u201d</p><p>Liam stood. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m done listening.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists. \u201cDamn it, this is not how my apology was supposed to go. Sorry. Just let me finish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>Hammer scrubbed a hand through his hair. Christ. Clearly, mending their fractured friendship would require more than words\u2014if it was even possible. The brittle olive branch he\u2019d been trying to extend Liam wasn\u2019t reaching far. What he planned with Raine would probably break the damn twig in half.</p><p>But Hammer couldn\u2019t continue to hurt her under the guise of protecting her. He\u2019d caused her far more anguish by hiding his love. She was a strong woman. After weighing Beck\u2019s advice, he realized that. If he took her training slowly, gave her a lot of praise and compromised, she could handle his needs. He would assure her that he didn\u2019t expect her to be his slave. Hammer vowed to teach, hold, and love her so he could complete her, just as she would him. But he had to let her decide for herself...even if she chose Liam instead.</p><p>That very real fear made his stomach twist. For years, his selfishness had prevented Raine from growing. What if she couldn\u2019t forgive him, either?</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Liam asked into his silence. \u201cNever mind. Why are we even having this conversation? The bloody horse is dead. I think we\u2019ve beaten him enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just in a fucking coma.\u201d Hammer tried to crack a smile, but it felt forced and insincere. \u201cLook, I admit that I fucked up. I made the wrong choices. We\u2019ve both paid a price. I just want you to know that I\u2019m sorry. I never did anything out of malice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Thanks.\u201d Liam nodded absently, then looked around the room.</p><p>A prickle of unease raised the hairs on the back of Hammer\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take me hours to explain, and I just don\u2019t have the time or energy now. Besides, I\u2019m not in the bloody mood to hear \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only ever really argued about one person. And if she had been here, she would have made far better coffee. \u201cWhere\u2019s Raine?\u201d</p><p>Liam wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze. Alarm bells rang in his head.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is Raine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw her, she was in my room. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019s left it by now.\u201d</p><p>His flat reply, coupled with the flash of guilt in his eyes, screamed there was more his old pal wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>\u201cLeft for where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer own room? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where your sub is?\u201d Hammer jabbed, arching a brow.</p><p>Liam closed his eyes and sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s not my sub anymore. I removed her collar this morning.\u201d</p><p>The words punched Hammer. He felt himself gape at the news, jaw hanging, eyes bulging. A feather could have knocked him off the barstool. Hell, off the planet. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. She\u2019s not ready to give what\u2019s necessary, and I\u2019m bloody tired of trying to force her submission. I\u2019m not letting her go, just giving her time to think, is all.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be true of another sub, but this one? She would take it as a crushing rejection, nothing less. In Hammer\u2019s book, if Liam had removed Raine\u2019s collar, that meant he\u2019d released her. And she was fair game.</p><p>The selfish bastard in Hammer wanted to throw a party. Finally, Raine could be his. The Dom in him feared it wouldn\u2019t be that simple. Now that Liam had crushed Raine by letting her go, she\u2019d need tenderness and love\u2014two things he wasn\u2019t good at\u2014to heal. Son of a bitch.</p><p>He damn near wrapped his hands around Liam\u2019s throat and strangled the life out of him. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? Was it your intention to shove her out the fucking door and push her off the deep end?\u201d</p> <p>Liam bristled. \u201cI was trying to teach her. Something you should have done years ago.\u201d</p><p>So much for mending fences.</p><p>His chest heaved as the last threads of control slid through Hammer\u2019s fingers. \u201cIf you\u2019d have asked me, I would have told you uncollaring her was the most counterproductive move possible. You should have tried to modify her behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I have\u2014over and over. I was at the end of my rope.\u201d</p><p>Everything coming out of Liam\u2019s mouth blew Hammer\u2019s mind. \u201cRaine lived and worked at Shadows, but she\u2019s never actually submitted before you. You know that observing and doing aren\u2019t the same thing. You should have trained her, not dumped her like yesterday\u2019s trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with more guilt,\u201d Liam growled.</p><p>Fuck that. \u201cHow much guiltier will you feel if she\u2019s packed up and left?\u201d</p><p>Hammer turned on his heel, Liam stomping close behind, and stormed down the stairs. His cries for Raine echoed through the cavernous dungeon. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Pounding on her bedroom door, Hammer screamed her name. Terrible silence followed. Breaking out in a cold sweat, he dug the key to her room from his pocket and shoved it in the lock.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you carrying a key to my sub\u2019s room?\u201d Liam challenged.</p><p>\u201cI always have, and by your own admission, she\u2019s not your sub anymore.\u201d</p><p>With a curse, Liam shoved him aside. Hammer pushed back.</p><p>As the door swung open, their gazes ricocheted around the room. The closet gaped wide. Only a row of empty hangers remained. The dresser drawers staggered open like a mocking smile of crooked teeth. Hammer dashed into the room and looked inside each. He didn\u2019t find much...except that old T-shirt of his she used to sleep in. The sight was a fucking stab in the heart.</p><p>\u201cShit! Where the hell has she gone?\u201d Hammer couldn\u2019t breathe. His heart stuttered in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Liam sounded stunned. Lost.</p><p>Rage railed through Hammer. He staggered against the dresser. When metal rattled, he looked down to find two keys on a ring. As he picked them up, he recognized both instantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis one is to her car.\u201d Hammer held up the oblong bit of black plastic, its silver saw-toothed blade sticking out.</p><p>Liam gave a visible sigh of relief. \u201cThen she can\u2019t have gone far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. This key...\u201d He struggled to keep it together. \u201cThis is to the club.\u201d</p><p>Liam braced himself against her dresser. He looked as if a wrecking ball had hit him squarely in the chest. \u201cOh god, she\u2019s really gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t mean to come back.\u201d</p><p>Hammer slashed Liam with a seething glare. \u201cAre you happy, genius? Where do you suggest we start looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no clue,\u201d Liam muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d leave before I even had the chance to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you think she\u2019d do, Liam? Sit in her room and ponder all the ways she could change to make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were important enough to her that she\u2019d want to do the work, that we\u2019d do it together. I told her not to bloody leave.\u201d Liam sounded somewhere between bewildered and pissed off.</p><p>\u201cLike she ever listens? Fuck.\u201d Fear filled Hammer\u2019s veins. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find her, but it\u2019s going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Wait.\u201d He plucked his phone from his pocket. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>He launched the app to search for her phone and quickly tapped out the password. An agonizing thirty seconds passed. The system wasn\u2019t finding her phone. Why wasn\u2019t he able to locate her, goddamn it? A moment later, the display indicated she was offline. Did he want to be notified next time she came online? You\u2019re damn right, I do. He tapped the screen to check \u201cyes,\u201d gritting his teeth. All he could do was wait.</p><p>\u201cThe brat turned off her phone. She knows I can\u2019t track her unless it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought of everything, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Liam shook his head. \u201cWhat about her bank account?\u201d</p><p>Hammer lit up with a smile. \u201cI have access to that.\u201d He pulled his phone out again, input her password, and put in a request to alert him as soon as she used her ATM or credit cards. He logged out, then turned to Liam. \u201cThere. She may not want to be found, but it shouldn\u2019t take long. She\u2019ll trip up. And we\u2019ll bring her home.\u201d</p><p>Then I\u2019ll straighten her out.</p><p>Liam nodded, but anguish tightened his face. \u201cHell, I can\u2019t just stand here and wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil one of those clues pans out, we need a starting point for our search. I\u2019ll check the cameras.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>In the operations room, Hammer dropped into the chair, sending it spinning across the hardwoods. It rolled to a stop in front of the complex security board. His fingers flew over the keys in a blur. His heart lurched. He prayed he would find what he needed.</p><p>Because he couldn\u2019t let her go. He wouldn\u2019t rest until he found her.</p><p>He began rewinding the footage captured by the camera perched above Shadow\u2019s back door. Liam peered over his shoulder.</p><p>Hammer paused the tape when a taxi appeared. He zoomed in as Raine stepped into view. Fear wrapped its icy hands around his throat and squeezed. All he could do was watch as the woman he loved opened the cab door. Dread that he\u2019d never get the chance to tell her what was in his heart seized him.</p><p>Riveted by the images on the monitor, Hammer could only see Raine\u2019s back. He studied her body language, as he\u2019d done a million times. Her subtle nuances spoke louder than words. She was decimated.</p><p>Raising a hand to her cheek, Raine brushed away her tears. She turned slightly, tossing her suitcase into the back seat. Hammer caught a glimpse of her eyes, swollen and red, along with her nose. He swore to himself this wouldn\u2019t be his last image of her.</p><p>Liam stared at the screen, barely breathing. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Zooming back out, he noted the name of the taxi company, then jotted down the cab\u2019s ID number before he snatched up the phone and began barking at the dispatcher.</p><p>Two minutes later, he was absolutely nowhere with the woman and her twang.</p><p>\u201cPut your supervisor on,\u201d Hammer barked. He didn\u2019t give a shit about company policy; he needed answers. Every second spent listening to excuses furthered the distance between him and Raine. The clerk put him on hold.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see Raine?\u201d Hammer asked Liam. \u201cWhat time was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long ago, maybe thirty minutes. I left to make coffee and give her a few minutes to get herself together,\u201d Liam ranted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she could pack up and flee that fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her like I do,\u201d Hammer growled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy as Larry to keep reminding me of that, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Liam looked ready to climb the walls\u2014or beat the hell out of him. \u201cI told her I\u2019d be here to help her\u2014always. She didn\u2019t hear a bloody word I said.\u201d</p><p>Hammer couldn\u2019t resist baiting him again. \u201cI have no idea why that\u2019s a shock.\u201d</p><p>Liam paced furiously. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t she come to you if you\u2019re so important to her?\u201d</p><p>The question brutalized Hammer, along with an avalanche of other crap. Sadness that neither of them had broken through to reach her wounded soul. Fear that Liam might be right. Anger that Raine didn\u2019t love either of them enough to stay and heal herself. Just like Juliet.</p><p>\u201cBecause you ran her off first,\u201d Hammer snarled.</p><p>\u201cI literally made coffee, then went to the bar to take a breather and gather my wits before I returned to talk to her,\u201d Liam explained. \u201cI had every intention of keeping an eye on her so that she wouldn\u2019t run. I meant to make sure she understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood what? I still don\u2019t know what the fuck you thought you were doing.\u201d</p><p>Liam waved him off. \u201cI should have tied her to the fucking bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have chewed through the restraints. Once her mind is made up...\u201d Hammer let out a shuddering sigh. If he never heard Raine\u2019s sassy remarks or saw fiery challenge light up her blue eyes again, he\u2019d lose it.</p><p>\u201cI needed her to commit to me, to us. She\u2019s so damn broken. Removing her collar was the only way I could think of to jar her enough to dig deep.\u201d</p><p>Hammer clenched his jaw, but before he could rail at Liam again, the supervisor came on the line. After wasting precious minutes listening to a guy who barely spoke English, Hammer\u2019s patience ran out.</p><p>\u201cLook, your driver picked her up at nine forty-three. Either give me the address, or I\u2019ll call the mayor,\u201d he blustered. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend, and I\u2019ll have every one of your cabs red tagged for inspection with one phone call. Now give me the fucking address, you sniveling piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam grabbed the phone. \u201cExcuse my friend. He\u2019s distraught. Do you have the address, please? This girl is in terrible danger. We\u2019re frantic.\u201d</p><p>Hammer heard the man on the other end talking. Liam scrambled for a pen and wrote down the information. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d Liam ended the call, then whirled on Hammer. \u201cWhat were you doing, threatening the only man who can help us? Keep your head screwed on straight.\u201d Then Liam shoved the paper in his direction. \u201cThe cabbie dropped her here. Where is this?\u201d</p><p>Bringing up a map of the city, Hammer nearly choked when he spied the familiar cross streets.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d he roared, jumping to his feet. His entire body trembled as he turned to face his friend. \u201cIt looks like she\u2019s gone back home.\u201d</p><p>Liam blanched. \u201cWhere she lived with her father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but close. A drugstore near her old neighborhood.\u201d Hammer\u2019s blood ran cold. He shoved the desk chair away and marched to the safe in his office, withdrawing an envelope. He turned to find Liam standing there. \u201cWe\u2019ll start searching there. On the way, you can tell me exactly what you said to Raine when you removed her collar. It might give me some clue where she\u2019d have run.\u201d He pulled his keys from his pocket, anxious to follow her trail.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t order me about like I\u2019m one of your bloody subs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out of my fucking head, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d Hammer raked a hand through his hair. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They raced to Hammer\u2019s car. When Liam slid into the seat next to him, he peeled out of Shadows\u2019 parking lot.</p> <p>As he watched the busy traffic crawling down the road, Liam buckled up. \u201cOver the past week, Raine has crawled deeper into her shell. Even on a good day, she didn\u2019t communicate, she isn\u2019t honest, and she doesn\u2019t trust. None of that is news to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hammer admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried \u2018modifying\u2019 her behavior in every way you can think of. I\u2019ve punished and rewarded. I\u2019ve coaxed. I\u2019ve praised. I\u2019ve demanded and expressed my disappointment. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>All that? Then again, Liam had never been less than thorough. Why would he have started slacking with Raine? He wouldn\u2019t. In fact, as devoted as Liam seemed, he would have tried even harder than usual to reach the girl. And if Raine was truly giving that little... Hammer wondered if he wouldn\u2019t have released her, too.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying she\u2019s more shut down than either of us realized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it.\u201d Liam leaned back against the seat, looking exhausted. \u201cI made it crystal clear that I wasn\u2019t giving up on her, that I would be there for her. She didn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll she heard is that you didn\u2019t want her,\u201d Hammer confirmed.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want her. I tried to show her how much. Just because I\u2019d released her didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d stopped caring or stopped protecting her.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell was protecting her now? Hammer\u2019s inner voice screamed that he needed to go faster. Hot and urgent, his thoughts raced as he tried to focus on the road. But terror clawed\u2014an ominous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2014back to when Liam had taken Raine from Shadows and sequestered her far away. While he\u2019d nearly lost his mind then, there\u2019d been comfort in the fact that Liam was caring for her. She\u2019d been safe. But now...</p><p>\u201cRaine is out there alone, upset, feeling unworthy and unwanted by both of us. I hope to fuck she doesn\u2019t do something impulsive, like visit her father. Bill might be an old bastard, but he\u2019s still mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she go anywhere near her father? That makes no sense.\u201d Liam rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt does and it doesn\u2019t. Raine will eventually realize that she needs to confront her past. Then it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she paid daddy a visit. But I hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ten long minutes later, Hammer pulled into the parking lot of the drugstore. The two men hurried inside and approached the young cashier. Her nametag read TONYA. The need to find Raine and hold her in his arms rode Hammer hard.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, lass,\u201d Liam whispered in a buttery soft lilt. He\u2019d used this verbal seduction on women for years. \u201cMight I have a wee minute of your time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d the young woman sighed with wide eyes and pink cheeks. She looked awestruck.</p><p>In unison, Hammer and Liam whipped out their phones, flashing the cashier different photos of Raine. Both turned to scowl at the other.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen this woman today?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Tonya stood nervously, nodding. But she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Fucking hell. Hammer reached for anything resembling patience. \u201cSo she was here?\u201d</p><p>The blonde with the heavy black eyeliner and nose stud jerked her head in his direction, apprehension flashing in her pale eyes. She nodded again.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough of her goddamn bobblehead bullshit. \u201cHow long ago? What did she buy? What direction did she go when she left? Was she with anyone, girl? Tell me now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer,\u201d Liam growled and shoved him to the side. \u201cAs you can tell, it\u2019s rather important we find this woman. Can you tell me anything about her?\u201d</p><p>Tonya twirled her finger around a chunk of pink hair streaked through her platinum tresses. After what seemed like an interminable lifetime, the young woman stammered, \u201cShe, um, b-bought a bottle of tequila. About twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Hammer looked at his watch. It was almost eleven. Raine was either planning on getting shit-faced drunk or she\u2019d bought the bottle to ply her father with so he wouldn\u2019t put up a fight when she confronted him. Or killed him. Hammer\u2019s blood ran cold. He wished to hell he knew where Raine\u2019s head was at, along with the rest of her hot little body.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to see which direction she left in, lass? Catch a glimpse of a car or taxi cab, perhaps?\u201d Liam urged, turning on his Irish charm.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know where she went. She wasn\u2019t with anyone, just carrying a suitcase and looking sad.\u201d Tonya cast her eyes toward the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more help to you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer let out a heavy sigh. Damn it, the girl standing before him screamed \u201csubmissive.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>Liam reached beneath her chin and tipped her head up, then gave her a warm smile. \u201cThank you. You\u2019ve been very helpful, indeed.\u201d</p><p>As they raced outside the drugstore, both men scoured the streets in either direction, looking for Raine\u2014a hotel, a bar, a restaurant, anything that might have snagged her attention. He saw all of the above and more.</p><p>\u201cShe could be anywhere.\u201d Liam gave voice to his concern.</p><p>Hammer pulled out his mobile again. \u201cRaine\u2019s phone is still off.\u201d He pressed a few more buttons. \u201cNo activity on her bank account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much money does she have saved?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cCan\u2019t be much. God knows, she likes her shoes and bags and frilly things well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hundred bucks,\u201d Hammer said grimly. \u201cShe\u2019s got no head for money. I took care of her expenses for the most part. I\u2019ve had a bad habit of indulging her because I knew she did without so much as a child.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s blistering glare said he hadn\u2019t known. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. Hammer didn\u2019t intend to budge. If he wanted to buy Raine something pretty, he would. \u201cDo you think she left in the taxi again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe supervisor said the driver dropped her here and left. Though I suppose she could have called for another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how? She hasn\u2019t turned on her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Tonya didn\u2019t say that Raine made any phone calls from the store. I don\u2019t see a payphone.\u201d Liam double-checked with a glance, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go. She wouldn\u2019t stay here. There\u2019s no reason. She\u2019d have a suitcase in her hand. It\u2019s probably heavy. So is the bottle of tequila. She couldn\u2019t carry them for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And she wouldn\u2019t stay on the street.\u201d Liam frowned and reached for his phone, too. \u201cIs there a bus terminal nearby? Or someplace to stash the suitcase?\u201d</p><p>Hammer shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close to suburbia out here. Our best bet is looking for her at a restaurant or motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t eat breakfast. Or much dinner last night.\u201d Clearly, that worried Liam. \u201cShe\u2019s got to be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get back in the car and drive around. We can cover more ground that way. We\u2019ll stop at all the restaurants and ask a few questions. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d</p><p>They cruised up and down the road once, then peeked into fast food joints, a mini-mart, even roamed the inside of a pancake house. Not a damn thing. Minutes slid into an hour. Where the fuck could she have gone on foot?</p><p>\u201cDoes the city bus come out this far?\u201d Liam asked, obviously wondering the same thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. We haven\u2019t seen one since we\u2019ve been here. Let\u2019s stop and think.\u201d Hammer raked a hand through his hair as he jogged back to his Audi. \u201cShe\u2019d want somewhere to set down her suitcase. I\u2019m betting she\u2019s got plans for that bottle of booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a park nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she could get arrested for drinking in public. If she\u2019s the one drinking the tequila, she\u2019s going to want to do it in private. But if it\u2019s not for her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would it be for?\u201d Liam prompted, following him.</p><p>\u201cHer father. He\u2019s a drunk from way back. If she wanted answers, bribing him with tequila would be one way to get them. Son of a bitch,\u201d Hammer snarled as he pulled the car back onto the main drag. \u201cI hate to say it, but we should pay a visit to dear old dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Hammer took off, gripping the steering wheel. \u201cI need to prepare you for what you\u2019re about to see.\u201d Raine\u2019s childhood home was the last hellhole he wanted to visit, but if she was there, she needed him... needed them both, to rescue her. \u201cOl\u2019 Bill is a crafty son of a bitch. If Raine went there, there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019s done to her. And if he\u2019s laid a finger on her again, he\u2019s a dead man. I trust you\u2019ll help me bury the fucking body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d Liam scowled.</p><p>Hammer reached into the glove box and handed Liam the manila envelope he\u2019d retrieved from his safe earlier. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Finally, Raine caught a break. It was Friday. The hospital wasn\u2019t a large one, and Beck practiced in more than one location. But she remembered a passing conversation with him about the fact that he\u2019d begun to office here on Fridays. Granted, he might be in surgery, but a roomful of patients in his waiting room gave her hope otherwise.</p><p>After Raine introduced herself and pleaded with his office manager, the woman finally agreed to tell the good doctor that she was here.</p><p>Beck came barreling in three minutes later in a long white coat and a dress shirt, looking surprisingly respectable. He didn\u2019t bother with preambles. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>The rest of the people in the waiting room stared. Even the office manager didn\u2019t disguise her curiosity. She shouldn\u2019t have barged in on him at work, Raine realized. He was diligent about keeping his professional and private lives separate.</p><p>\u201cSorry. My mistake. You\u2019re busy. Will you just...call Hammer and Liam when you get a break and tell them I\u2019m fine? I\u2019m not in danger, and they don\u2019t need to look for me. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>She turned for the door. Beck captured her arm in an unyielding grip, then he jerked her around. His face didn\u2019t change much, but his eyes... That was the glare of a disapproving Dom. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment, just let her feel his concern and displeasure.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he growled.</p><p>With a few steps, he marched over to the woman behind the counter. \u201cCancel the rest of my appointments for the day.\u201d</p><p>Raine gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Please.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cCall Dr. Martin and tell him I\u2019ve had something come up. See if he\u2019ll take my emergencies. I\u2019m off call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, Dr. Beckman,\u201d the woman said primly, then looked at Raine with unabashed interest.</p><p>Her eyes were probably still red. Her nose, too. She didn\u2019t have on a shred of makeup. Her wardrobe was only suited to a couch potato in football season. And she was holding a brown paper bag that couldn\u2019t be mistaken for anything except a bottle of booze. Horrifically embarrassed, Raine looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do about that consultation with the Mayo Clinic? It\u2019s in less than five minutes,\u201d the manager reminded. \u201cYou\u2019ve already rescheduled on them twice.\u201d</p><p>Raine could see Beck biting back a curse. Then he stormed back to her. \u201cListen to me. On the first floor of the adjoining building, there\u2019s a cafeteria. Wait there. Give me fifteen minutes. You came to me because you need something, clearly. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d His stare sharpened as he grabbed her arm again. \u201cDon\u2019t. Leave. Or you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call them now,\u201d Raine blurted. She didn\u2019t know why\u2014maybe everything was catching up to her or reality was setting in\u2014but she teared up. \u201cThey\u2019ll come, and I\u2019m not ready to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Just do as I say.\u201d</p><p>She thought about disobeying, about going back to her hotel room, downing her bottle, and...who knew what then. But she\u2019d already disrupted his day, brought her problems to his office, and prompted him to change all his plans. He\u2019d promised not to call Liam and Hammer in the next few minutes. She owed it to Beck to stay.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I haven\u2019t eaten all day anyway.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and released her. \u201cGet something in your stomach. Fifteen minutes, princess.\u201d</p><p>Raine nodded, then left his office, feeling the stares of a dozen patients on her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to find the cafeteria. They were nearly ready to shut down breakfast to begin preparing lunch. She must have looked pitiful because one of the workers sent her a glance full of sympathy and let her grab a few prepackaged foods before they locked up the counters, leaving the seating area open, with its silent but animated televisions flashing and the chairs empty.</p><p>Ignoring the beginning of a talk show, Raine reached into her wallet for cash. Damn it, she\u2019d spent it all on her bottle. She hesitated. She couldn\u2019t put everything back after the woman had bent the rules for her.</p><p>With a sigh, she handed over her credit card. Maybe the guys wouldn\u2019t be tracking her movements. For all she knew, Liam and Hammer didn\u2019t care that she was gone. Despite his pretty speech, Liam had washed his hands of her. And Hammer...who knew? She hadn\u2019t seen much of him since Thanksgiving.</p><p>The woman swiped quickly and sent Raine on her way with a receipt. Setting her purse and the bottle on the table, she plopped into the chair with a cola and a breakfast pastry\u2014and stared at them. She could have cooked something more appetizing at Shadows. Normally, she would enjoy feeding Liam something hot and wonderful. She always made extras for Hammer and left it in the oven. Strictly speaking, she wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he\u2019d starve or eat junk otherwise. If she was already in the kitchen, how could it hurt to cook a little extra for someone who needed it? Of course, Liam would have prodded her to eat the something warm and healthy, too. Now?</p><p>Raine usually loved sweet things. The Pop-Tarts just depressed her.</p><p>What was she doing here? Where was she going? She had no damn clue.</p><p>Fighting back more tears, Raine pulled her phone from her bag and gripped it. She fought the urge to turn it on, call Liam, beg him... God, what good would that do? He\u2019d just wanted to know if she loved him, and she\u2019d been too afraid to make herself vulnerable to him.</p><p>She had to pick up, move on, grow up, figure it out. And she would. Raine didn\u2019t know where to start yet, but it wouldn\u2019t be with a teary conversation that would make Liam feel guilty enough to take her back only to have the entire cycle repeat again. Until she changed, that\u2019s precisely what would happen.</p><p>Dread snaked through Liam as he stared at the envelope Hammer had put into his hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA visual of what daddy dearest is capable of.\u201d</p><p>With his guts in knots, Liam ripped into the envelope, yanked out the photographs inside, and got his first glimpse.</p><p>Oh god. Oh Raine. My poor wee lass. His chest buckled.</p><p>The photo was of Raine\u2014much younger, but it was still his Raine. Her innocent face was swollen, colored in a rainbow of unnatural hues: black, blue, purple with shades of yellow and green. Her eyes were closed and so puffy, Liam wondered if she\u2019d been able to open them. The lips he\u2019d kissed so many times were split and caked with blood.</p><p>She\u2019d been beaten savagely by a monster who\u2019d meant to destroy her.</p><p>His first thought was that he wished he\u2019d been there to protect her. He hadn\u2019t known her then, but Liam still felt as if he\u2019d failed her somehow.</p><p>His second thought was that he would kill the man.</p><p>He took seething breaths to bring his rage under control. \u201cHer father did this to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep breathing, man. It\u2019s a shock,\u201d Hammer said in a tone meant to soothe a wild beast. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>How ironic. It was the first bloody time all day his old pal seemed to find his control.</p><p>\u201cBreathe? Like hell! Answer my fucking question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, her father.\u201d</p><p>The bloody prick they were headed to see. Liam stared down at the photo. There were more pictures he hadn\u2019t seen yet. He didn\u2019t want to...but he must. If he wanted to understand Raine, this was part of who she\u2019d become. He hoped like hell she hadn\u2019t let it define her.</p><p>Hammer sent him an anxious glance. \u201cI took those the night I found her. She wouldn\u2019t let me near her, even to give her first aid. So I called Beck over, and we slipped a sedative in her Coke. Once she drifted off, Beck made sure she didn\u2019t have any injuries that needed immediate attention. The following morning, I took her to a doctor he recommended. She examined Raine. Cracked rib, a couple of stitches, lots of bruising. The rape kit came back negative. She hadn\u2019t been sexually assaulted.\u201d</p><p>Thank god for small mercies.</p><p>But from this photo alone, the fact that Bill hadn\u2019t raped her might be the only one. Liam wanted to growl at the injustice Raine had endured. He didn\u2019t care if the pictures had been taken six years ago or yesterday. The agony her father had forced on her stabbed him with pure fury.</p><p>Dragging in a sharp breath, he shuffled to the next picture. Raine\u2019s arm, black with bruises in the shape of a man\u2019s hand. God, she\u2019d been a skinny little thing. A grown man unleashing all his force on her would have overpowered her quickly. And no one had been there to stop him. How had Raine done it alone?</p><p>Another photo revealed a red, angry spot of torn scalp just above her ear, indicating she\u2019d been grabbed and yanked viciously by the hair.</p><p>His eyes smarted. She\u2019d been nothing but a scared child, enduring what that bastard had dished out. But by Christ, she\u2019d escaped. No wonder running was ingrained.</p><p>The next shot was of her neck and chest. Deep gouges and cuts raked her flesh. More mottled bruises lay beneath the straps of her tank top. Liam could see discoloration around Raine\u2019s throat. Her father had tried to strangle her? Fuck killing the man; Liam wanted to destroy him.</p><p>At the lodge, he\u2019d pried the girl open with pickles and chocolate. The memories of Raine\u2019s words that night rang in his ears. I found out that I shouldn\u2019t mess with Dad\u2019s temper... He would never win father-of-the-year awards. A fucking understatement. He said he wouldn\u2019t go to jail for disciplining his stupidest, most willful...</p><p>Jail was far too kind for Bill.</p><p>The Dom inside him wanted to hold her close and protect her. Eventually, he\u2019d turn her over his knee and give her a few loving swats of his own for so grossly understating her past. He intended to make it clear that he wouldn\u2019t tolerate her lying or blatantly withholding information anymore.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t that why he\u2019d uncollared her in the first place?</p><p>The enormity of her damage sank in.</p><p>All this time, he thought he\u2019d made progress with her at the lodge, convincing himself that he would have dismantled her walls if he\u2019d had more time. He\u2019d blamed Hammer\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for stunting his ability to reach Raine. But now he feared that all the pickles and chocolate on the planet wouldn\u2019t have been enough for her to reveal the depths of her anguish.</p><p>Raine\u2019s soul was still torn. She nurtured her pain, using it like a shield to keep anyone from getting too close. He understood that she hid in shame. Her fear of abandonment and difficulty trusting couldn\u2019t be more clear. But these photographs proved that she\u2019d rather outright lie than risk revealing her real self and letting anyone too close.</p><p>As soon as he found Raine, he intended to tell her that he grasped the hell she\u2019d survived, but he would no longer let her use it as a reason to hide from him.</p><p>His stare fell upon the final photo. Hammer had pulled the sheet aside to reveal her sleek, supple legs. The bruises and scrapes on them infuriated him enough, but the sickening dark contusions staining her inner thighs ignited his blood. He couldn\u2019t contain his wrath.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Liam\u2019s fist connected violently with the glove box.</p><p>Hammer cast a startled glance in his direction. \u201cTake another breath. It was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me!\u201d Liam roared. \u201cAnd now this? I thought you said she wasn\u2019t raped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t. When the doctor examined Raine, she confirmed that there was no trauma to her vagina. Her hymen was intact. But I think Bill sure tried.\u201d</p><p>Raine must have fought like hell.</p><p>Liam\u2019s fingers trembled, yet he was unable to look away from the photos. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you show me these sooner?\u201d</p><p>If Hammer had, he might have understood Raine better, taken a different tactic with her, been more patient. It might have made a difference.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do, Liam? Haul you into my office the night you collared her and whip these pictures out for you? She doesn\u2019t know I have them, and it wasn\u2019t my place to tell you.\u201d</p><p>No, it had been Raine\u2019s. But to Liam\u2019s mind, Hammer staying mute on the subject reeked far more of his desire to hoard the girl than to protect her privacy. He would only keep this terrible truth to himself because he believed that he alone should\u2014or could\u2014heal her. How ironic that he\u2019d never even tried.</p><p>Liam\u2019s mind wandered back to his first day at Shadows, after arriving from New York. He\u2019d known almost instantly that Hammer had far more feelings for the girl than he\u2019d been willing to admit. In fact, their first conversation about her had been eye-opening.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Raine,\u201d he\u2019d asked that first night.</p><p>Hammer had tensed. Anyone who didn\u2019t know the man well might not have noticed, but Liam had. Then, as if Hammer had forced himself to relax, he\u2019d shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a runaway I took in. She works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, now? Is that all? You watch her an awful lot, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s an employee under my roof. I take responsibility for her safety.\u201d</p><p>And he took it very seriously, too much for merely a boss. \u201cI\u2019ve heard whispers there\u2019s a standing edict that no Dom is allowed to touch her. Is there a reason?\u201d</p><p>Hammer had drawn in a deep breath and acted as if he\u2019d been gathering his thoughts. Liam rather thought at the time that the man had been fighting his temper. \u201cRaine was abused before she ran away. She\u2019s not ready for what any of the Doms here would want or expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never given it much thought, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>Liam remembered sitting back in his chair, stunned at such a whopping lie. He\u2019d bet money then that Hammer thought of the girl under him every damn day. Why had his best mate felt the need to lie to him?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she needs in order to be ready, then? Maybe you ought to help her along.\u201d</p><p>Almost immediately, Hammer had shaken his head. \u201cTime, space, security, maturity. She\u2019s vulnerable. No one touches her, including you. Any other sub under my roof is fair game, but not Raine.\u201d</p><p>While Hammer had made his rationale sound so noble, Liam had known better. The man might as well have wrapped her in barbed wire and posted a NO TRESPASSING sign around her.</p><p>It was then that Liam had realized Hammer was in love with her. Which explained why the man had never once mentioned the girl in the last six years.</p><p>As Hammer turned down another residential street, Liam dragged himself back to the present. They had to be nearing her father\u2019s house. Liam felt a fresh wave of fury that his old friend had kept so much from him for so long\u2014the truth about Juliet, his feelings for Raine, and the extent of her damage at her father\u2019s hands.</p><p>Such a bloody fucking debacle. How much time and drama could they have saved if Hammer had been willing to come clean?</p><p>Beside him, Macen let loose a heavy sigh. \u201cI\u2019d hoped she would volunteer the fact that her father had abused her. I\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Pot meet kettle.</p><p>\u201cRaine mentioned it, but...\u201d Liam held up the last picture. \u201cShe never described anything like this. Did she tell you straightaway that her father had beaten her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It took months for her to tell me bits and pieces, but I guessed. Why else would she run away from home with nothing but the clothes on her back?\u201d Hammer gritted his teeth. \u201cThe private investigator I hired located the violent prick in two days. When I went to visit him, he had fresh stitches on his cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe admitted later that she fought Bill off with a kitchen knife. She slept with it under her pillow.\u201d</p><p>Liam could feel something slide sideways in his mind as the rage and frustration congealed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill the miserable wretch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs much as I would have liked to, I had to make a deal with the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Liam stared at Hammer as if he\u2019d lost all his wits.</p><p>\u201cI visited him and introduced myself, explained that I owned Shadows. I told him that his daughter was now under my care and that, under no circumstances, would he ever see Raine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would you tell him all that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was harboring a minor in a sex club. I had to put all my cards on the table in case he traced her back to me. Then I had to figure out what he wanted to keep his mouth shut and his ass at a distance. Right away, he accused me of having sex with her and threatened to report me as a pedophile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have just killed him and been done with it,\u201d Liam hissed. \u201cOr at least called the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had, Raine could have gone to foster care. I refused to risk her being placed in a home worse than the one she\u2019d escaped. And if I\u2019d given into my violent urges, I would have gone to jail instead of being around to protect her.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t deny the logic, even if he hated the explanation. \u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill and I came to an agreement. I promised not to plaster fliers of Raine beaten black and blue all over his neighbors\u2019 doors if he kept his mouth shut, didn\u2019t report me, and never came near Raine again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been that easy to make him agree to all that. What else did it take?\u201d</p><p>Hammer tightened his grip on the wheel. \u201cTwo thousand dollars a month.\u201d</p><p>Another shock jolted Liam\u2019s system. \u201cYou paid that cocksucker for six months, until she turned eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve paid him for over six years,\u201d Hammer replied flatly.</p><p>\u201cHang on a bloody minute. That\u2019s nearly one hundred fifty thousand dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done nothing but drink it away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy the hell are you still paying him? Raine became a legal adult years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was determined to protect her, and that was the only way I could guarantee Bill would fucking leave her in peace.\u201d</p><p>Fuck all. Part of him reeled with the extent his pal had gone to protect the woman he loved\u2014even before he knew he loved her. How could Liam not admire Hammer for the care and protection he\u2019d shown Raine so unselfishly for so long? And what did that say about the man\u2019s devotion to her?</p><p>\u201cI understand you can\u2019t be watching her \u2018round the clock. But you\u2019ve got me to help protect her now. Between the two of us, we can make sure he never gets close to her again.\u201d</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t say a word, just glanced Liam\u2019s way, his expression considering. \u201cI\u2019d never want to risk her, but... maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Liam slammed a fist into the passenger door. \u201cI just hate that the bastard is still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Raine is, too. So the money I\u2019ve paid him has been worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know any of this?\u201d Liam suspected he knew the answer.</p> <p>\u201cNot a fucking thing, and it\u2019s better if she doesn\u2019t. You need to keep this secret. If not for me, then for her.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t like it and wondered if this confidence would come back to bite them both in the ass, but he saw Hammer\u2019s point. Raine\u2019s pride would sting. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Hammer pulled to a stop in front of a two-story Craftsman-style home in a well-manicured neighborhood. Liam looked out the window. Everything looked so normal, so average. Everyone with their two newish cars and two point two kids. Looking around, he\u2019d never think the people living here had anything more interesting to do than watch the lush grass grow. But Liam knew a brute dwelled within.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to meet dear old dad?\u201d Hammer asked in a tone rife with sarcasm.</p><p>No. But Liam steeled himself. \u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be. I\u2019ll try not to murder him. No promises.\u201d</p><p>Hammer gave him a grim laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him busy. You search every fucking room, closet, and cranny for her. Call out her name in case he\u2019s got her tucked away somewhere. He\u2019d probably have her gagged so listen carefully.\u201d</p><p>Gagged? Fuck, holding his temper was getting bloody hard. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And if she\u2019s being held against her will, forget holding back the urge to slaughter him.</p><p>Hammer opened the car door. \u201cThen let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d Liam emerged from the car.</p><p>Hammer knocked on the door. After a curse and a shuffle, it swung open. Liam got his first look at Raine\u2019s father.</p><p>A shock of snow-white hair stood off his scalp. His eyes were bloodshot and lifeless, but a familiar bright blue. The scar Raine had given him bisected one gaunt cheek with a thin white line.</p><p>The man was probably pushing sixty, but looked closer to eighty. A bulbous nose, cheeks full of broken capillaries, and a bloated belly showed the ravages of alcohol abuse. Some might have thought him a sweet old man, but Liam wasn\u2019t fooled for a minute.</p><p>Bill leaned against the doorframe with a nasty smile. \u201cWell, well. I\u2019m surprised to see you here, Master Pervert. Are you still fucking my daughter?\u201d Then he turned to Liam with a sneer. The old man sized up his designer suit, Italian loafers, and luxury watch. Dollar signs cha-chinged in his gleeful gaze. \u201cYou banging her, too?\u201d</p><p>That was it. Bill was dead.</p><p>Liam surged at the man with a snarl of fury, all semblance of control gone. When Hammer held him back, he fought like a wild man.</p><p>\u201cSteady...\u201d his friend warned in a low voice. \u201cLet\u2019s find out what the bastard knows first.\u201d</p><p>Hammer barged his way into the house. Liam followed, ignoring the old man\u2019s stench.</p><p>Bill stared, and Hammer glowered at the man, his face every bit as threatening as Liam had ever seen it. \u201cWhere. Is. She?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I know where to find that ungrateful little bitch?\u201d Bill sneered. \u201cDoes it look like I have her tucked up my sleeve?\u201d</p><p>Killing was too good for Bill. Liam would tear off his head with his bare hands, pour kerosene all over him, then light him on fire. When he lunged at the old man, Hammer held him back again.</p><p>\u201cDid she come here?\u201d Hammer demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t find her? That\u2019s priceless.\u201d Bill laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question now or I\u2019ll tear you limb from limb!\u201d Liam couldn\u2019t contain his rage.</p><p>\u201cIf I know something...\u201d Bill turned to Liam, eyes crafty. \u201cWhat\u2019s that scrawny piece of ass worth to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you want to live?\u201d Liam growled, unable to believe this asshole had any genetic resemblance to the woman he loved.</p><p>\u201cYou going to hit me?\u201d Raine\u2019s father challenged.</p><p>When Bill least expected it. \u201cAnswer us. Do you know where to find Raine?\u201d</p><p>Hammer cut him off with a sharp jerk of his head. Right, he was supposed to be sweeping the rooms, hoping against hope that he wouldn\u2019t find her lying in one of them, half dead.</p><p>\u201cRaine\u2019s whereabouts aren\u2019t up for sale today,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cYou get your monthly stipend and that\u2019s all. You and I are going to have a problem if she\u2019s here\u2014or if she came to see you and you didn\u2019t call. Do we have a problem so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she run away from you, too?\u201d Bill jabbed.</p><p>\u201cIs she here, yes or no?\u201d Hammer demanded. \u201cI\u2019m running out of patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybeeeee,\u201d Bill taunted.</p><p>Liam prowled past the foyer and navigated a path through the piles of old newspapers littering the hall. He recoiled. The manicured fa\u00e7ade of Raine\u2019s house was an illusion, pretty enough on the outside, but neglect and decay permeated the walls.</p><p>He searched the spare bedrooms from top to bottom but found only wrappers, junk mail, discarded boxes, and trash\u2014even in the wide open closet doors. Everything stunk to high heaven. He choked back the urge to retch.</p><p>Liam knew the bedroom that had once been Raine\u2019s. The walls were a faded pink. A crinkled old poster of Justin Timberlake hung askew off one wall. A big fuzzy \u201cR\u201d dangled from a string above an old twin bed, stripped bare. Now the room had become a ten-by-ten trash can. Somehow, it made him hurt for her all over again.</p><p>As Liam hauled into the master bedroom, he coughed, forcing down the urge to heave. Inside, discarded takeout boxes, empty gin bottles, and overflowing ashtrays lay strewn everywhere. Hell, an atomic bomb couldn\u2019t have done more damage. He called out for Raine, jerking open the closet. Smelly clothes, stiff sheets, loose change, and old porn magazines assaulted him.</p><p>The master bathroom fared no better. Liam tried to ignore the filth of old whisker shavings and cheap aftershave mingling with the black ring of grime in the tub and urine stains on the floor. The linen cabinet was filled with ratty towels and more garbage. The cloying reek of body odor pervaded the air.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in the bedrooms,\u201d he called to Hammer, coming back down the hall and dusting his hand down his pant leg, trying to rid himself of a prickly, crawling sensation. Once he knew Raine was safe, he\u2019d welcome the chance to return to Shadows and scald himself with clean shower spray and antibacterial soap.</p><p>How had Raine ever lived here? She wasn\u2019t mental about cleanliness, but she liked a tidy space and didn\u2019t mind putting in the work to make a room spick-and-span. More than likely, she\u2019d cleaned up after the repulsive old man, and he hadn\u2019t bothered after she\u2019d left.</p><p>Liam backtracked to the kitchen\u2014and stopped in the doorway. Bill had obviously exhausted his supply of dishes and flatware years before. Paper plates caked with old food cluttered every surface. Cockroaches and rodent excrement mingled with other less identifiable layers of filth. The stench nearly dropped him to his knees.</p><p>Again, he opened every door and every cabinet, calling out, but no Raine.</p><p>The garage held nothing but a late-model economy sedan that had more than a few dents, a rusted-out washer, and a tilted dryer. Liam checked the interior of all and found no signs of struggle, blood, hair\u2014or anything that led him to believe Bill had inflicted any trauma on her here.</p><p>The access to the attic was directly above Liam\u2019s head. He pulled on the cord, and the attached compact stairs unfolded. After a brief climb, he discovered the space occupied by insulation and a hot-water heater. Crawl spaces were laid out in plywood. He climbed up. The odors from the house had risen, and it smelled like a landfill. Thankfully, the area was small. His visual check took under a minute. Given the undisturbed inches of dust, Liam realized that Raine couldn\u2019t possibly have been here.</p><p>It was almost a relief. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her stepping foot in this grimy hoarder\u2019s dwelling again, at the mercy of that spawn from hell.</p><p>As he rounded the corner and made his way to the front door, he found Hammer fisting the drunkard\u2019s stained T-shirt and shoving him against the wall.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you keep her tied to the bed or something?\u201d Bill sneered. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she likes it.\u201d</p><p>Hammer growled. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked your kind up online, Master Pervert. I know all about you.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>Liam surged closer. \u201cHammer, move. I\u2019m going to hit him at least once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I want to. His sorry ass isn\u2019t worth the jail time, and we can\u2019t find her from behind bars.\u201d But his old friend looked like he thought otherwise for a moment. Then he turned back to the unkempt bastard with thunder in his eyes. \u201cLast chance. Have you seen Raine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stupid whore hasn\u2019t come back here.\u201d</p><p>Releasing Bill\u2019s shirt with a shake of his hand, Hammer stepped back, looking like he, too, was suppressing a murderous rage.</p><p>The old man leveled them a taunting sneer. \u201cThis is hilarious. She\u2019s got both your dicks in a meat grinder. She must mean a lot to you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one more disrespectful comment from you,\u201d Liam replied in a cold, deathly calm tone. \u201cHammer, here, may have some qualms with ending your life, but I sure as bloody hell don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bill glared at Liam. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s fucking a mick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI advise you against insulting my friend,\u201d Hammer said in silky warning. \u201cYou\u2019ll respect him or I\u2019ll shatter your goddamn jaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d spread her legs for anything with a dick. Well, except me. Even when I tried to be nice to her, she never showed me any love.\u201d</p><p>White-hot rage roared through Liam\u2019s veins.</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d Hammer closed in on Bill again like a raging bull. \u201cYou tried to rape your own daughter. What kind of sick fuck does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all high and mighty.\u201d Bill didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>Liam\u2019s chest heaved. Hammer wasn\u2019t faring any better. The old man was either too stupid to notice their fury...or he was baiting them. Liam didn\u2019t like it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer worthless mother was gone, and Raine is pretty. But you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Bill taunted, then looked at Macen. \u201cBet you enjoyed every minute of popping her cherry.\u201d</p><p>Hammer drew back his fist fast as lightning.</p><p>Liam gripped Hammer\u2019s bicep, holding him back. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We can\u2019t find Raine from jail.\u201d</p><p>But if they didn\u2019t leave, Bill would soon be a dead man.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Hammer spat. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting another goddamn dime from me. Do you understand? And don\u2019t you dare threaten me. You just confessed to trying to force your minor daughter to have sex with you, and I\u2019ve got a witness. I\u2019ve also got a hundred people who can testify that I never laid a hand on her when she came to live with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll deviants like you. We had a deal,\u201d Bill protested. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut me off!\u201d</p><p>Hammer stared him down with narrowed eyes. \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Macen\u2019s phone beeped and he plucked it out of his pocket, pausing, reading. \u201cI just got a bead on her. She used her credit card. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As Hammer ran for the Audi, Liam lunged in Bill\u2019s face. \u201cI promise you someday, somehow, I will hunt you down like the animal you are and repay you for everything you did to Raine.\u201d</p> <p>The door to the cafeteria opened, and Raine watched Beck march in, minus his white coat, looking grim and worried. He slid into the seat beside her and took hold of her chin, but her pathetic breakfast seemed to distract him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you chose to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a lot left.\u201d</p><p>He spied the receipt and picked it up. \u201cYou paid with a credit card?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYeah. I know what you\u2019re going to say. I doubt they\u2019re watching me.\u201d</p><p>Beck scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Liam released me this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? I can\u2019t speak for him since I don\u2019t know him as well, but I know Hammer will never let you go, princess. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s been in love with you for six years.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The man was hallucinating if that\u2019s what he thought, but Raine didn\u2019t argue. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear this story\u2014without one or both of them interrupting. I want to make sure you eat something better than processed crap. And then I want to give you some advice that you\u2019ll probably ignore, but I hope you\u2019ll put to good use anyway.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the energy to fight him when he grabbed her soda and pastry only to toss them in the trash can. She picked up her purse and bottle with a sigh.</p><p>As Beck led her out of the cafeteria, he settled a guiding hand at the small of her back and herded her to a parking garage. He hit a button on the key fob and a bright red Mercedes convertible beeped. Flashy wheels. It figured.</p><p>Beck opened her door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p> <p>Raine slid into the soft seat in silence and watched Beck back out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for causing you trouble. I shouldn\u2019t have come and bothered you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have. You know they\u2019re probably worried out of their minds.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, and the possibility made her feel a bit guilty. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted you to tell them I\u2019m all right, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a liar, princess. So let\u2019s fill your belly and get you settled. Then I\u2019ll figure out what to say to those two clowns.\u201d</p><p>As they rounded the back of the hospital and approached the circular drive at the front, a familiar black Audi screeched into the passenger pick-up zone. Hammer and Liam jumped out, running full throttle into the building. Raine\u2019s heart caught in her throat. Guilt gnawed at her composure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. They stopped fighting long enough to look for you together,\u201d Beck observed, sounding oddly happy. \u201cWant to talk to them?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Desperately. But what good would it do? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, did one of them hurt you?\u201d he scowled, his expression like a thunder cloud.</p><p>Beck meant Liam, since he knew Hammer too well to believe that Macen would ever intentionally smack her except in play. But Liam could be so heartbreakingly gentle. Neither would ever bodily harm her.</p><p>Just break her heart.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried not to cry again.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t this fucking useless sorrow go away?</p><p>\u201cGod, that face is killing me, princess.\u201d He pulled away from the hospital. \u201cIs that all you have, a purse and a bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have a suitcase, too.\u201d She told him about the motel.</p><p>He pressed tight lips together and drove down toward the place. As soon as he pulled up front, Beck held out his hand. \u201cClaim ticket?\u201d</p><p>Raine hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re not dragging me back to Shadows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But you\u2019re not staying here. I\u2019ve got someplace better and safer. And no, I won\u2019t tell Liam or Hammer until you want me to.\u201d</p><p>She gnawed on her lip. Beck might have messed with her mind here and there, but he\u2019d never lied to her. She dug into her purse and handed the little scrap of paper over. He hopped out, then emerged two minutes later with her bag in hand.</p><p>After tossing it in his trunk, he eased back into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYou know if they ever catch up to you, they\u2019re going to spank you bright red. I\u2019ll watch. And volunteer to help.\u201d</p><p>Despite the grim situation, she managed a laugh. \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you have a nice ass.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cThe answer is still no.\u201d The last thing she wanted was another romantic entanglement, even if Beck was on the sexy side. She also didn\u2019t need more hurt. Physical pain might help her process the emotional agony eventually, but she didn\u2019t need it yet. And even if he\u2019d do it, she hated to ask Beck for more.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cJust trying to lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, he pulled up in front of a new, industrial-looking building of high-rent condos. He flashed a key card at the parking garage. After the gate went up, they slid inside. Beck parked in a reserved spot, grabbed her things, and helped her into an elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do all this,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t want Hammer to kill me, I do. I don\u2019t want to worry about you, either.\u201d</p><p>On the top floor, he emerged and led her inside a corner unit. It was compact and sleek and had killer views that went all the way to the Pacific.</p><p>\u201cThe bedroom is through that door. Bath attached.\u201d He set her suitcase down. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up your space. If you live here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I crash here sometimes, especially after surgeries that run late. I\u2019ve got a house about ten miles from here, closer to Shadows. You\u2019ll have the run of the place this weekend. The housekeeper just came, so it\u2019s clean and stocked with food. Sit.\u201d He pointed to the little kitchen table.</p><p>Raine sat as he bid, watching him move around the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m a lousy cook, but I figure as many times as you\u2019ve fed me over the years, I can return the favor this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. If you\u2019re going to get busy with Jose Cuervo, you need something in your stomach to toss up later.\u201d</p><p>With a wry smile, she waited until he set some eggs, toast, and a bowl of fresh fruit in front of her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig in. And start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Raine did, confessing everything between Thanksgiving and this morning. When she finished, her food was gone, tears streaked down her face, and her nose was running.</p><p>With a curse, Beck grabbed her a tissue from the bathroom, then stomped back. \u201cWhat did you expect Liam to do, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly friends, but I can guarantee that he didn\u2019t give up on you. He wants you to think, make some decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where do you get off with this bullshit that he\u2019s dumped you for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...where my head always goes.\u201d Her mom had left. Then her brother and sister. Her father had never made any bones about his contempt for her, especially at the end. \u201cThey\u2019re the first people to really want me in their lives. I guess...I have trouble accepting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr trusting it. You\u2019re holding your breath, waiting for something bad to happen. When it doesn\u2019t, you create it, even if you don\u2019t mean to. It\u2019s all you know. And it\u2019s up to you to figure out why and how to change. All they want is your soul, princess.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and that scared the hell out of her. \u201cWhat happens if I give it to them and neither wants it anymore?\u201d</p><p>Beck leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the dark table. \u201cYou won\u2019t break. You\u2019re too strong, Raine. The more important question is, how much happiness are you throwing away because you\u2019re too afraid to give either of them a real chance?\u201d</p><p>Maybe a lifetime of it.</p><p>She looked at Beck with bleak eyes. He patted her hand, then took her plate away. As he set it in the sink, the phone attached to his belt trilled. He yanked it from the clip. \u201cAnd there are your knights in shining armor now. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Raine pulled the bottle from the brown paper bag. \u201cThink. Got a shot glass?\u201d</p><p>Beck pulled one from the cabinet and set it in front of her as he brought the phone to his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Dr. Beckman has left for the day?\u201d Hammer demanded of the office manager. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Liam glanced at his Calibre de Cartier. It wasn\u2019t even noon. \u201cYou mean he\u2019s not merely breaking for lunch?\u201d</p><p>The petite woman stood behind the counter of the empty waiting room, looking at the pair of them as if she\u2019d lost her patience. She shoved her glasses back up the bridge of her nose and straightened her shoulders. \u201cNo, he canceled the rest of his appointments about an hour ago and told me to close the office for the day. If you had an appointment, you\u2019ll receive a call to reschedule. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me...\u201d</p><p>The woman glanced pointedly at the door, jangling the keys in her hand. She made it more than clear that she wanted them gone, probably to enjoy her unexpectedly free Friday afternoon. Liam glanced at Hammer. His old friend knew Beck far better, but playing hooky at the last minute didn\u2019t sound anything like the doctor. Beck could be a dodgy prick, but he wasn\u2019t irresponsible.</p><p>Liam could see that Hammer was a bit suspicious as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Vicki, right?\u201d Macen asked.</p><p>She looked surprised that he knew her name. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Dr. Beckman, and he\u2019s spoken highly of your efficiency in the past,\u201d Hammer explained. \u201cWe need your help. We\u2019ve got an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s medical, you\u2019re better off in the ER.\u201d She scrutinized them quickly and frowned in confusion. \u201cAdjoining building, first floor, at the back. I can call and have someone take you on a stretcher or in a wheelchair, if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Liam corrected. \u201cCrisis might be a better word. We have a missing person and think that Beck may have seen her recently. Do you know if he received any unexpected visitors?\u201d</p><p>The forty-something office manager set her keys down and looked as if she was weighing how much to say.</p><p>\u201cThe woman is petite, a few inches shorter than you. Dark hair, blue eyes. She would have looked distraught,\u201d Liam volunteered.</p><p>Vicki hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \u201cShe was here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank Christ! Relief flooded through him, knowing she was safe\u2014or had been an hour ago. Beside him, Hammer looked equally relieved. Liam couldn\u2019t fathom for the life of him why she was with Beck, but he hoped like hell the sadist would have calmed her. Unless...</p><p>\u201cWas she injured?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vicki assured, her starch softening.</p><p>\u201cAnd? What happened then?\u201d Hammer demanded.</p><p>The woman shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Liam frowned. \u201cHow long was she here? Did she speak to Beck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Less than five minutes,\u201d Vicki said. \u201cDr. Beckman finished an appointment, then came out here to speak with her. I couldn\u2019t hear the discussion, but the doctor seemed somewhat agitated. He canceled all his appointments. The woman you\u2019re looking for left. The doctor took another call, then gathered his things and departed. He didn\u2019t say where he was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have her,\u201d Hammer said under his breath.</p><p>Liam agreed. He was grateful...but bloody confused. Her reasons for seeking out Beck now didn\u2019t matter. He just had to lay eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vicki. You\u2019ve been very helpful, and we\u2019ll not delay you any longer,\u201d Liam said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Turning together, he and Hammer exited the office with its faux-friendly d\u00e9cor. They headed back down the corridor and bypassed the elevator to sprint down the stairs. Hammer was already reaching for his phone, scrolling through his list of friends.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Raine go to Beck?\u201d Liam questioned. \u201cA month ago, he scared the piss out of her. He bruised her with that fucking rubber paddle. Why would she run to that bastard instead of talking to me? I know she\u2019s got a terrible habit of not saying how she feels. But hell, if not to me, why didn\u2019t she go to you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could guess...\u201d Hammer sighed and pressed the button to connect the call to Beck. \u201cShe must know I\u2019d help her, but she\u2019s distressed and thinking with her emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose she believes she\u2019s only \u2018making things worse\u2019 or whatever else runs through her head. Both of us have set her aside in one way or another. But how could she think we don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>Hammer sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s probably embarrassed about being released or she thinks I would chide her for her behavior. I don\u2019t know. Goddamn it, answer,\u201d he growled into the phone as they tore out of the building.</p><p>In the anemic sunlight, they made their way to Hammer\u2019s car and peeled away. Liam didn\u2019t know where they were going. He didn\u2019t think Hammer did either, but Raine wasn\u2019t at the hospital. The cafeteria where she\u2019d given her credit card was closed for now. When they\u2019d checked, only an employee inhabited the gift shop. Raine hadn\u2019t been injured, so why would she stay here? More to the point, Beck had gone as well.</p><p>The car\u2019s Bluetooth system kicked in, and the ringing phone carried over the sound system. Anxiety charged his veins. If voice mail picked up instead of Beck, Liam wondered if he\u2019d bloody lose it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked Hammer. \u201cWhere would Beck take her? His house? Another office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>Liam heard a click and tensed.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time you called, Hammer. I\u2019ve been waiting,\u201d Beck baited on the other end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is she, you fucking bastard? Where did you take her?\u201d Liam wanted to charge through the phone and strangle Beck.</p><p>Hammer cut him a glare as the doctor laughed.</p><p>It took everything Liam had not to pick up Hammer\u2019s phone and smash it on the dash. If he didn\u2019t need answers so badly, he might. He opened his mouth to say something, not caring much if he insulted the wanker.</p><p>Hammer slapped an arm across his chest. \u201cShut the fuck up and let me talk.\u201d</p><p>There was little love lost between he and Beck, and Hammer stood a better chance of getting answers. Breathing hard, Liam swallowed down his impatience. \u201cGet some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Beck?\u201d Hammer demanded. \u201cWhere did you take her after you left the hospital? And don\u2019t give me the bullshit that you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Beck laughed again. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell which of you has their dick in more of a twist.\u201d</p><p>Liam stared out the window and tried to block out Beck\u2019s mocking tone. His only consolation was that he felt anger pouring off Hammer, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re so amusing,\u201d Hammer grated out. \u201cWe\u2019re not feeling very jovial at the moment since we\u2019re worried out of our fucking minds because Raine is missing. So maybe you could pull your head out of your ass and help us?\u201d</p><p>With another chuckle that made Liam want to punch the arse, he sank deeper into the luxurious leather seat. He could only hope that he\u2019d have Beck by the balls someday and could repay the favor.</p><p>\u201cOh, put your panties back on. Raine is in one piece and perfectly safe. I made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Hammer growled.</p> <p>Liam wanted to add his two cents, and it only infuriated him more that every time he talked to Beck, the doctor took delight in poking at him. He\u2019d love to tell Beck exactly where he could go, but that wouldn\u2019t help them find Raine. He had to swallow it back\u2014again. He was beginning to feel like his balls were stuck in a bloody vise.</p><p>\u201cIf she wanted you to know, she would have told you herself, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d Beck heaved a sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking with the help of Jose Cuervo, and I expect I\u2019ll have to check on her in a bit to help her hang her head over the toilet. But otherwise, she just needs space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting her drink tequila in the middle of the day?\u201d Hammer demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s still a minor, scout?\u201d Beck sounded somewhere between amused and exasperated.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hold her liquor, you stupid motherfucker.\u201d Hammer looked like he might grind his teeth into dust. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side. She\u2019s usually a happy drunk, so tequila might improve her mood.\u201d</p><p>The mock chipper attitude crawled up Liam\u2019s back. That vise around his balls tightened.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beck added like he had a grand idea. \u201cIs she a horny drunk, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you touch her, you fucking wankstain!\u201d Liam railed. \u201cIf you lay a single finger on her, I swear to god I\u2019ll kill you in the bloodiest way possible and I\u2019ll enjoy every moment of it.\u201d</p><p>Hammer clutched the wheel. \u201cI\u2019ll be all too happy to help him if you don\u2019t stop yanking our chains.\u201d</p><p>Beck scoffed. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to jump off a bridge, guys. Geez, melodrama much? I\u2019m not going to touch the princess. But you two have got to get a grip and back the fuck off. You can\u2019t tell her to go away one minute, then expect to keep her under your thumbs the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to bloody talk to her,\u201d Liam insisted. \u201cShe ran away from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft her keys to the club in her bedroom,\u201d Hammer confirmed. \u201cDid she tell you that part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words. Raine is trying to decide what to do next. Neither of you can rush her decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t she think at Shadows?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Beck asked incredulously. \u201cIf this stunning display of calm and logic is any indication, I have no trouble understanding why she left. Look, she\u2019s someplace safe, and I won\u2019t betray her confidence. I gave her my word and I keep my promises. When she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll tell me, and I\u2019ll let you know. If it makes you feel any better, she\u2019s staying somewhere secure. She can\u2019t leave without me knowing. And no, I\u2019m not trying to crawl in bed with her. So back down on the jealousy, lover boy.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t have to guess who Beck was talking to. It infuriated him even more. On the other hand, he realized that the doctor had become a brick wall. There\u2019d be no going under, around, or over him for more information. The click of the call ending confirmed that, like it or not, they\u2019d have to wait until Raine decided whether or not to come back to Shadows.</p><p>Hammer glanced up as Liam stormed into the kitchen the following morning. He looked as lousy as Hammer felt.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from Beck again?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s question immediately told him that his old friend hadn\u2019t heard from Raine, either. \u201cJust a quick text about midnight to say she\u2019d finally fallen asleep. He emptied the rest of her bottle down the sink and made sure she ate before tucking her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about what\u2019s going through her head?\u201d</p><p>Exactly what Hammer had wanted to know. \u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at the empty coffee maker. He\u2019d mocked Liam\u2019s attempt at making the brew yesterday, but Hammer couldn\u2019t do much better. They already missed Raine, but this, just like prowling the dungeon sleeplessly at three a.m., shoved her gut-wrenching departure in his face again. And now that Raine had been gone over twenty-four hours, Liam looked like he was ready to crawl out of his skin. Hammer totally understood.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t that wanker tell us what she\u2019s thinking? She\u2019s talking to him, right? What\u2019s she saying to him that\u2019s so bloody secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever she wants. He won\u2019t break her confidence.\u201d</p><p>Liam raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I think that prick has always wanted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you and Beck got off on the wrong foot, but she\u2019s in good hands. The fact that she turned to him is a big fucking relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d Liam bellowed.</p><p>\u201cThat means that she doesn\u2019t want to cut all ties to Shadows. That might even mean she knows that she needs to listen to someone who won\u2019t spoon-feed her bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a damn sadist!\u201d Liam gawked. \u201cShe\u2019s not a masochist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your head back in the game.\u201d At least one of them had to remain calm, and Liam needed a rock right now. Looked like it was him. \u201cLosing control isn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re too smart. Start acting like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss off,\u201d Liam shot back, but it didn\u2019t hold any malice. He straightened up and seemed to pull himself together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Hammer nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know Beck. He\u2019s not going to beat Raine or take advantage of her. He\u2019ll do everything possible to help her clear her head and make some decisions. Beck and I talked about her recently. I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll guide her back in this direction, if it\u2019s possible. But he\u2019s right. We can\u2019t rush her. If she comes back, we want her to be sure of her choice, not looking for the way out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what bloody advice he\u2019s giving her. He could be telling her to fly off to Timbuktu, for all we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll give her the exact same advice you or I would if we knew a sub was floundering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d Liam paced the kitchen, probably seeing Raine everywhere, just like he did.</p><p>\u201cThen we have no one to blame but ourselves.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d been honest with Raine eons ago, she\u2019d still be at Shadows, safe and sound. The frustration clawing Hammer\u2019s guts would be nothing more than a bad dream. He gave her credit for walking out on her own two feet instead of taking a bunch of sedatives. At least he could be thankful for that. He\u2019d rather have her alive anywhere in the world than cold in the ground.</p><p>Guilt crossed Liam\u2019s face before he stifled it and glanced at his watch. \u201cA few days ago, Seth promised to come out for a bit. I got a text from him early this morning saying he was leaving LaGuardia and would take a taxi to Shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, here?\u201d What the fuck for? \u201cHe said he\u2019d never step on land that might crumble into the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Liam hesitated, then turned squarely to face him. \u201cI called to ask his help with Raine.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Wasn\u2019t that a kick in the nuts? In the past, Liam would have come to him, and Hammer didn\u2019t have to guess what Seth\u2019s visit said about the state of their friendship. He regretted it like hell. Then again, he\u2019d withheld the details of Juliet\u2019s suicide. Quid pro quo was a motherfucker.</p><p>The one piece of good news? Liam calling in reinforcements said that he was serious about helping Raine.</p><p>\u201cI see. As usual, you have a plan. Want to clue me in?\u201d</p><p>Liam rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cI already enacted the plan. It went out the back door when she ran off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. Uncollaring her was the plan?\u201d Hammer stifled his opinion of that colossal screw-up. \u201cGot a plan B?\u201d</p><p>Liam gritted his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>A chime sounded from Liam\u2019s pocket, and he pulled out his phone. \u201cSpeak of the devil. Seth says he\u2019s in the parking lot and will someone open the fucking door.\u201d</p><p>His friend smiled for the first time since Raine had fled, then left the room. Hammer looked again at the coffeepot, wondering if Seth could do any better than either of them. He remembered the other Dom from his club days back in New York. Smart, firm, fair, funny. If someone from the past had to come back and haunt him, Seth wasn\u2019t a bad ghost.</p><p>A few minutes later, Liam and Seth rounded the corner. The other man hadn\u2019t changed much in the last eight years. He might look a little older\u2014just like Hammer knew he did\u2014but Seth had remained a fit, good-looking SOB. He probably still had subs falling at his feet. Not a strand of gray in that neatly trimmed golden hair. He managed to get sun, despite the New York winters. His green eyes were sharp with wit, as always.</p><p>\u201cHey, man!\u201d Hammer held out his hand. \u201cGood to see you. It\u2019s been a long damn time.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his hand. \u201cToo long. How the hell are you? You\u2019re looking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then it\u2019s better than I feel. Thanks for coming.\u201d He turned to the coffeepot. \u201cYou know how to work this? Liam makes tar, and I brew motor oil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Liam protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That would be insulting tar,\u201d Hammer quipped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth shook his head. \u201cYou two and your puppy dog faces... There\u2019s a fucking donut shop around the corner. Go buy a hot cup.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s hopes dwindled. \u201cShit. You can\u2019t make decent coffee either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t step foot in the kitchen,\u201d Seth admitted. \u201cHow have you been drinking coffee all these years if you don\u2019t know how to make it and aren\u2019t buying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh... So she spoils you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you drinking coffee without making it?\u201d Hammer asked. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being a Starbucks guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eat pussy really well. It gets me coffee and anything else I want.\u201d Seth flashed a cheesy grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a far more important skill than working that thing.\u201d He pointed to the coffee maker.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fucked, then,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Raine made the coffee? Get her out here. I want to meet the girl who\u2019s got Liam\u2019s balls in a twist.\u201d</p><p>Hammer and Liam exchanged a glance, then Hammer gave his old pal an expansive gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s all you.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head and blew out a breath. \u201cLet\u2019s go around the corner and buy a hot cup or two. This may take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we might need something stronger than coffee.\u201d Hammer sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock somewhere, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Russia, maybe...\u201d Seth frowned. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Liam raised a brow. \u201cHow many blondes does it take to go around the corner and buy coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, asshole,\u201d Seth shot back. \u201cThey delegate.\u201d</p><p>After ten minutes and a bit more teasing, they\u2019d made their way to the donut shop, bought a gallon of coffee, and walked back to Shadows. Hammer poured a mug the second they hit the kitchen and drank half of it down in one swallow. He gave a moan of relief. Liam followed suit. Seth shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d Liam peered into his cup. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as good as Raine\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re both whipped by this girl and her voodoo pussy. Where is she? I want to shake her hand.\u201d When neither of them said a word, Seth frowned. \u201cSpit it out. I haven\u2019t seen faces this glum in ages. Did you just find out there\u2019s no Santa Claus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no Raine. We discovered yesterday morning that she\u2019d left.\u201d Liam stared out the window.</p><p>Seth whipped his head around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Liam and Hammer spilled all the gory details about the last twenty-four hours as Seth poured himself a cup of coffee and stared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. So the plan backfired.\u201d Seth scratched his head.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then some,\u201d Liam confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWould Beck let me talk to the girl?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>Hammer exchanged a glance with Liam, then shrugged. \u201cNo offense, but she\u2019s closed off right now. She might be talking to Beck, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. And if she\u2019s not talking to any of us, she\u2019s not going to talk to a stranger. I\u2019m going to text Beck for an update.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded, obviously liking that idea. \u201cAny news about Raine would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>When Raine woke about noon, Beck was there with some ibuprofen and a bottle of water. \u201cYou decide yet whether you want to go home or you\u2019re running away for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, too.\u201d She took the tablets and the water, then swallowed both down.</p><p>Beck grinned. \u201cJust asking. Hammer has been texting me every hour on the hour since sunup. He and Liam want to know how you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Raine clutched her head. \u201cDid I fall asleep on the couch last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You and Cuervo were all cuddled up.\u201d</p><p>Raine had a vague recollection of Beck carrying her to bed, and she was more than a little embarrassed. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you for a Rambo movie marathon sort of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anything romantic.\u201d It would only have made her sadder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do today, princess? I\u2019ve already made my rounds at the hospital, so I\u2019m free if you want to talk or head out to the beach...or get a good spanking.\u201d He leered.</p><p>Raine shot him a quelling glare. \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, when being bad is so much fun?\u201d</p><p>She took another swallow of water. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I need to stop licking my wounds and come to some decisions.\u201d</p><p>Beck pushed a strand of hair from her face. \u201cThose men want to help you be whole. There\u2019s no way they don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>Liam did for sure. He\u2019d tried so hard to reach her. The more she\u2019d fallen for him, the more afraid she\u2019d become. The more she\u2019d pulled away. All the vows she\u2019d spoken during their collaring ceremony? Raine knew she hadn\u2019t kept up her end of their bargain. She\u2019d given him no choice but to release her.</p><p>Hammer? He cared for her in his own way. She hadn\u2019t failed him as badly. Mostly because he\u2019d never set expectations or tried to take her in hand. Still, she knew in her heart that he must be disappointed.</p><p>In either case, she was going to have to grow or change or something because neither of them would accept her limitations forever. Liam had already made that clear, and Hammer was sure to follow. If she couldn\u2019t change, maybe she\u2019d be better off moving on. \u201cI don\u2019t know if love is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He leaned closer and leveled a contemplative stare her way. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this, and I might have the answer to your problem. Do you realize you could have them both?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him in stunned silence. Had he prescribed himself some wacky pills? He must have because that notion... \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cA lot of people think so, and maybe it\u2019s a little true. But I\u2019m right. Deep down, you know it. Even deeper down, you want them both, too. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>Raine felt heat rush to her cheeks. She\u2019d fantasized about that a few forbidden times when she\u2019d let herself. She\u2019d cuddled up to Liam in the middle of the night, thinking how complete it would make her feel to be sandwiched between him and Hammer. She\u2019d always dismissed it as a pipe dream.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want and what I can have aren\u2019t even on the same planet.\u201d</p><p>Beck smirked. \u201cThink positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t even handle Liam\u2019s expectations, how do you expect me to please him and Hammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll teach you. Stop fighting and pay attention. Figure your shit out. You\u2019re smart, Raine.\u201d He leveled her a serious stare. \u201cThey\u2019ve shared before. For the right woman, I think they\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>And Beck thought that was her? \u201cThey shared Hammer\u2019s wife, and in case you weren\u2019t aware, that didn\u2019t end well. Besides, they can\u2019t get along for two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a temporary pissing match. And it\u2019s not your problem. Your issue now is helping you. If you do that, all your little dreams might come true. You could heal those two by giving them what they both need most. That\u2019s you, Raine.\u201d</p><p>Raine still thought Beck was a little insane, but her head hurt too much to argue. This mythical threesome wasn\u2019t the point of their conversation. \u201cIf I go back to Shadows at all, I owe them a whole me. Their feelings are wasted if I can\u2019t give either one of them\u2014much less both\u2014everything in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So what\u2019s in your way?\u201d</p><p>What wasn\u2019t? All her emotions were a crowded tangle in her head. The fear of being abandoned or hurt had been carved into her soul. Reacting to them was a reflex. How did she stop that?</p><p>Raine had to find a way. The last twenty-four hours had proven that living without them made her utterly miserable. She wanted to go home, wanted the familiar shelter of Shadows, of their arms. Despite what he\u2019d said the last few weeks, Hammer would never commit to her. But that was okay; she could love him from afar. She\u2019d been doing it for so long, she was a pro. She loved Liam so very much. He filled her heart. They could be happy\u2014if she could hurdle her fears and move forward.</p><p>The first step was brutal honesty.</p><p>\u201cMy dad.\u201d For starters, anyway. \u201cHe had all the power in the house when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he abused it, along with you.\u201d</p><p>Raine resisted the urge to grab the covers up to her chin and protect herself. From what? Beck was only here to help her, and she had to stop hiding from everyone. It only led to self-destruction.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve avoided really thinking about it, but...I know it\u2014he\u2014is a stumbling block.\u201d</p><p>Beck sat back and stared. \u201cHave you talked to anyone professional about it lately? I know Hammer took you to see a counselor right after you came to Shadows.\u201d</p><p>She sighed impatiently. \u201cShe asked the dumbest questions. \u2018So I guess your dad\u2019s behavior made you mad?\u2019 Um, you think?\u201d</p><p>He stifled a laugh. \u201cSo she wasn\u2019t the therapist for you. She wasn\u2019t very good in the sack, either.\u201d</p><p>Raine batted Beck\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTMI, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds a lot like back talk, princess.\u201d</p><p>The warning was too obvious to miss. She dialed back on the banter. \u201cSorry. It wasn\u2019t meant that way. I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done. I know you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Beck waved her away. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen or talked to your dad since you left home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She recoiled. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>For a long time, he said nothing, and Raine sensed that he weighed his words carefully. Finally, he rose from the edge of her bed. \u201cOkay, then. Food? It\u2019s after noon, but I figure you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d She rose and batted down her self-consciousness about her skimpy tank and boy shorts. Despite his half-hearted flirting, the rapport between them wasn\u2019t sexual. Besides, Beck had seen most everyone at Shadows naked, including her. He was a doctor. She didn\u2019t have any parts different than his patients or the other females walking around the club.</p><p>He got a gleam in his eye. \u201cYou offering to cook? Bachelor food and hospital cafeteria garbage sucks.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to. Give me a few minutes, and I\u2019ll make something divine.\u201d</p><p>It was the least she could do.</p><p>After brushing her teeth and hair, Raine washed her face, then changed into a pair of yoga pants and a faded sweatshirt. Slipping on a pair of socks, she padded into the kitchen. Beck stood on the balcony, looking out toward the ocean.</p><p>For years, he\u2019d been a mystery, other than the pain he inflicted on subs at the club. When they\u2019d first met, she\u2019d lumped him in with her father mentally a bit, and it hadn\u2019t been fair. The subs asked for his pain\u2014begged for it. But this personable, compassionate side of him surprised her. Why should he be single when he could tempt just about anyone? Raine didn\u2019t understand. Even now, his profile looked pensive...unhappy. She hoped he found what he was looking for soon.</p><p>In the kitchen, she made herself at home. Beck\u2019s housekeeper had obviously found a gourmet grocery store because Raine found all sorts of goodies. She seared him some bacon-wrapped scallops, saut\u00e9ed vegetables, and whipped up a heap of garlic-parmesan mashed potatoes. He\u2019d left a bottle of sauvignon blanc chilling in the fridge. She brought two glasses and the bottle out to the balcony, along with a corkscrew. She schlepped napkins, forks, and took two full plates next, then set them on the little table.</p><p>The day was chilly, the wind blowing. The almost perpetual fog near the coast blanketed the air. Raine hadn\u2019t made any decisions about what to do or how to do it yet, but somehow a new peace outweighed the turmoil that had made her a hot mess yesterday.</p><p>Beck took a bite of his scallops. His eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he moaned loudly. She\u2019d heard him have quieter orgasms.</p><p>Raine giggled. \u201cSo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, princess. Forget Liam and Hammer. Come live with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre there seconds? And dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Beck sighed in bliss. Then they fell into a comfortable silence as he poured the wine and they ate.</p><p>Thoughts turned over in her head. And over and over. She\u2019d struggled for so long with Hammer, fought Liam\u2019s every attempt to reach her. But Beck asked such a simple question. So what\u2019s in your way? And when she\u2019d admitted that she hadn\u2019t seen her dad in over six years, he hadn\u2019t said a single word about it. But his expression had been clear. She should.</p><p>Raine\u2019s first instinct was to run. God, when had she become such a coward? More to the point, could she ever be happy if she kept ducking and dodging everyone who simply wanted to know her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should face him,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cLiam? Hammer?\u201d He shoved another bite of potatoes into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt some point,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>Why wait? Prolonging this limbo wouldn\u2019t give her any way to move forward. \u201cToday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...decisive.\u201d Beck drew in a breath, considering. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that for a minute. Do you know what you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</p><p>Raine had rehearsed so many speeches in her head, mostly after she\u2019d first gone to live at Shadows. But so many of the words crowded her head now, she wasn\u2019t sure where to start. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>Beck set his fork down. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous. I can\u2019t let you see him without going, too. I\u2019ll give you space to talk to him, but I won\u2019t be far off.\u201d</p><p>Raine considered that for a long moment. She\u2019d pondered storming her father\u2019s castle before, but always pictured going with a gun...then rethought it because, frankly, he scared her. At least a foot taller than her and a whole lot meaner, he\u2019d probably take the gun away and shoot her. Or she\u2019d see him, lose her damn temper, and shoot him on the spot. Prison didn\u2019t sound like fun. A few times she\u2019d considered that doing hard time might be worth killing the bastard, but something had always held her back.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t put you at risk.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, either you and I can go together, or I\u2019ll stick about ten feet off your sweet ass all day, and you can pretend not to notice me. Your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing choices, Beck.\u201d Inside, she turned warm. Who would have guessed that the rubber paddle-wielding sadist would turn out to have a huge heart? His kindness and protection were a surprising but blessed relief. \u201cI guess you can go with me, then. I\u2019d feel better if we had more backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we will. My friends Smith and Wesson are coming along.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll clean up the dishes. You get ready. An hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes. I\u2019m not getting dolled up for that old bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p> <p>The plan made sense and sounded so liberating when she\u2019d been tucked away in the safety of Beck\u2019s condo. Zipping down the road toward her childhood home half an hour later...not nearly as much. Raine\u2019s stomach twisted. She wrung her hands. Her palms started to sweat. Her heart thundered.</p><p>Beck put a hand on hers. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. Say what you need to say. You\u2019ll be safe. The most important thing is that you purge as much of your anger as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d She looked at him gratefully.</p><p>\u201cThen stop trying and go get him, princess.\u201d He pulled his Mercedes up to the curb at the end of the block and rolled up to the house slowly. \u201cThis it?\u201d</p><p>Her heart lurched as she nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been more terrified in her life, but not in a long, long time. Hammer had taken her in and given her the safe environment her father hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d repaid him by running away without a word. Just like she\u2019d given Liam a brick wall rather than her heart.</p><p>With another glance, Raine drew in a deep breath. She was doing the right thing.</p><p>Beck stopped the car and killed the engine, then climbed out. She opened her door and looked around. Nothing much had changed in the neighborhood. Mr. Markland\u2019s religiously trimmed shrubs stood in a meticulous, straight line. Mrs. Fullsome\u2019s garden looked full of color, despite the fact that December had begun.</p> <p>As she stepped onto the sidewalk, she turned her attention to her father\u2019s house. The red front door had faded, but it still looked imposing. Behind that solid surface lay a house of horrors. Each year\u2014hell, each day\u2014had turned exponentially more terrible. Raine stared at the house like it was a demon that would steal her soul.</p><p>She clutched her stomach. God, she needed to be unshackled from her past, but she did not want to be here. She\u2019d vowed never to lay eyes on Bill Kendall again. For six years, she\u2019d kept that promise.</p><p>Now, Raine forced herself forward, determined to take back the parts of herself he\u2019d maliciously stolen.</p><p>Beck walked with her to the edge of the property, then he grabbed her hand, squeezed...and let go. She sent him one last stare. He nodded at her. Silent encouragement.</p><p>Later, she\u2019d tell him again how grateful she was that he\u2019d come along.</p><p>Time now to face down the devil.</p><p>Sucking in a bracing breath, Raine knocked.</p><p>It seemed like forever before the door jerked open. Her knees nearly went out from under her when her father stood in the portal, glaring when he laid eyes on her.</p><p>His stark gray hair stunned her. He\u2019d been salt and peppery the night she\u2019d run away. The grooves around his mouth and chin had deepened, as if he\u2019d been wearing an angry scowl every moment since she\u2019d gone. The faint white scar of her handiwork slashed down his cheek. The sight brought back both brutal memories and deep satisfaction that she\u2019d fought Bill off and marked him for the rest of his miserable life. His blue eyes hadn\u2019t changed. They were the same eyes she saw every day when she looked in the mirror.</p><p>At the venom there now, a shiver wracked her spine.</p><p>The monster still resided inside the old man\u2019s frame. He\u2019d once terrified her. Now, Raine refused to show fear. Bill Kendall was the reason she couldn\u2019t trust. Couldn\u2019t communicate. Wouldn\u2019t truly give herself to Liam\u2014or anyone. Since leaving this hellhole, she\u2019d never wanted to heal. Lancing her wounds and leaving them to bleed made it less likely that she\u2019d ever allow anyone to hurt her again. She had let this vile asshole strip her ability to love.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, whore? And who\u2019s he?\u201d He nodded Beck\u2019s way. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re fucking him, too?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his question and thrust her chin out. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few things to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I listen? I didn\u2019t want you here then and I don\u2019t want you here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m not staying. I just came to say that I hate you and you\u2019d better not ever speak to me again. Oh, and I wanted to give you this.\u201d</p><p>Raine doubled up her fist and sent it flying into his jaw with a brutal crunch. Pain exploded through her fingers, zipping up her arm, but she didn\u2019t care. When Bill\u2019s head snapped around and he clutched the side of his face, it was worth the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou little bitch!\u201d He stormed onto the porch and seized her arm in a cruel grip. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>With a vicious yank, he dragged her toward the house. Raine dug in her heels. Bill turned and snarled, raising his fist to her. She fought the urge to cower.</p><p>Behind her, Beck dashed onto the porch. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Bill sneered.</p><p>\u201cI got this,\u201d she told Beck. She needed to face her father alone.</p><p>Thankfully, Beck let her.</p><p>Forcing the tension from her muscles, Raine waited for the old bastard to assume she\u2019d given up and curled into a sniveling ball. He fell for her ruse, swinging his beefy fist toward her with unabashed triumph. Suddenly, she countered, raising her forearm and blocking his attack. She followed that with a jab to the stomach. He roared, the sound booming with shock and hate.</p><p>Raine kneed him in the balls.</p><p>Lurching and grunting, he doubled over, clutching his crotch. She seized the opportunity and grabbed his hair, then slammed his head against the doorframe.</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>Beck laughed. \u201cYeah, you definitely got this, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thrash you for that.\u201d Bill lifted his head to look at her with a stare so furiously blue, his eyes almost glowed. Blood trickled from a gash between his brows, ran down his face, and gathered between his teeth.</p><p>He looked every inch like a demon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever touch me again. I was a girl, and you beat me within an inch of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what Master Pervert and the mick do to you before you spread your legs for them at that kink club?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. Of all the things Raine expected to spew from his lips, the fact that he knew where she\u2019d been and who she\u2019d been with felt like a kick to the stomach. Had her father tracked her down...or had Hammer and Liam come here looking for her?</p><p>Either possibility made her sick. She swallowed the nausea down. Later.</p><p>\u201cShut up! I won\u2019t let you desecrate them. They\u2019re real men, which is more than you could ever say.\u201d Raine doubled up her fist again and delivered a quick uppercut to his chin.</p><p>\u201cFilthy slut! I\u2019m going to call the cops on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, and I\u2019ll tell them everything you ever did to me, including trying to rape me as a minor. Want that to get out? Should I shout it louder for the neighbors?\u201d</p><p>The anger built and swelled inside her like a volcano. The lava in her veins bubbled over, and Raine hit him again, his nose the perfect bull\u2019s-eye. After a sickening crunch, blood spurted.</p><p>\u201cHammer made me attend self-defense classes. If you try to hurt me again, so help me, I\u2019ll kill you, you worthless piece of shit, for all the years of misery you caused me. You drove my mother away, then my brother, my sister...and finally me. You deserve every moment of your wretched solitude. Rot in it!\u201d</p><p>Raine clenched her fist again, but a firm hand at her elbow stopped her. She turned to find Beck shaking his head\u2014and his gun pointed in Bill\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your damage. He\u2019s not worth a trip to jail. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d love to stay and inflict more pain. It was exhilarating. Empowering. Emancipating. But Beck was right. She refused to imprison herself in any way because of Bill again.</p><p>The adrenaline began to bleed from her veins, leaving her slightly shaky. But she felt more together than she had in years. No, ever.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d Bill screamed. \u201cWalk away, you fucking cunt, but you haven\u2019t seen the last of me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother turning around, just raised her hand and flipped him her middle finger. The bastard didn\u2019t deserve anything more.</p><p>They arrived back at the condo. Beck let her in quietly. In fact, he hadn\u2019t spoken a word to her since they\u2019d left her father, like he\u2019d known that she needed to be alone with her thoughts, replay the afternoon a few times in her head to feel the upsurge of triumph...then the downhill slide into wondering what came next.</p><p>Instead of heading straight back to his place, Beck had driven her to the beach and let her walk, silently trailing a few feet behind and keeping an eye on her. The crashing waves had quieted her head some. Not nearly as well as Liam\u2019s spanking days before Thanksgiving, but this worked for now.</p><p>Eventually, she\u2019d sat in the sand, closed her eyes, and cried until Beck picked her up and put her in the car again.</p><p>Now she glanced at the clock on the oven. Ten minutes to six. \u201cYou hungry? I saw you had some steaks in the fridge. I can cook those up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould cooking clear your head or would you rather have pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkipping dinner isn\u2019t an option. Choose again.\u201d</p><p>Raine sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want another bottle?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cNo. Hair of the dog doesn\u2019t appeal at all to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you be a sad drunk. It sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I\u2019ll be more considerate of your delicate mood next time.\u201d Raine rolled her eyes.</p><p>Beck swatted her on the ass. \u201cSassy little thing. I\u2019ll start the barbeque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re better in the oven. I got it.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, they sat down to dinner. Afterward, Beck answered a couple of texts, then swore. \u201cI have to head to the hospital for a bit. You\u2019ll be okay here? You won\u2019t do anything stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike jump off the balcony?\u201d Raine looked at him like he was crazy.</p><p>\u201cLike run off,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>She lost her feisty mien. \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his keys, then kissed her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s progress. You\u2019ve done good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I have breakfast ready in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to see how this goes. I\u2019m probably headed to surgery. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll be back tonight, really late.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone. He was asleep on the sofa when she woke the next morning.</p><p>Raine whipped up some pancakes and set them in the oven with crisp bacon and a note. Then she slipped out to explore the building. Sure enough, the swanky place had snazzy fitness equipment. A circuit of weights and cardio helped clear her mind a bit more, and she returned to find dirty plates in the sink and the word Thanks! at the bottom of her note. Beck himself was gone.</p><p>She wandered around the little apartment, but she\u2019d already seen it all and exhausted the available movie selection. Cable shows about silly chef challenges and house hunting didn\u2019t hold her interest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Palming her phone, Raine stared at the little device, but like last time she\u2019d pondered making calls, she tucked her mobile away. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Liam if she called just to hear his voice when she didn\u2019t have any answers to give him. And it would be equally unfair to ring Hammer for his gruff familiarity. She had nothing to offer him, either.</p><p>Raine whiled away the day on the balcony, just thinking. How did she learn to open herself up to the people she loved, especially if those people were at one another\u2019s throats? How did she go back to Shadows without tearing everyone apart even more?</p><p>Beck dragged in about eight o\u2019clock. She\u2019d been about to open a can of soup, but he took it from her hand and led her out the door. \u201cMexican and margaritas. Now.\u201d</p><p>Who was she to argue with that?</p> <p>\u201cI know a great place.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He handed her the keys. \u201cYou drive. I\u2019m fucking exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Wow, the control freak was going to let her drive his ridiculously expensive convertible? She grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they sat with some salt-rimmed beverages and had ordered enchiladas.</p><p>Beck sighed. \u201cAh, chips and booze revived me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also a Dom. So here\u2019s the portion of the day where I ask you to tell me what\u2019s in your head. What are you going to do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave that a lot of thought while you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you didn\u2019t want to watch Rambo again. I know it.\u201d</p><p>Her life was upside down, and Beck still made her giggle. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s kind of true.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cSo, cough it up, princess. I love having you crash with me. I could get addicted to the food really fast. But I\u2019m back on call starting tomorrow, and you won\u2019t like me coming in and out at two a.m., and that couch made my back hurt like a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Beck deflected the importance with humor, as he often did. But he was also dead-on.</p><p>Raine dragged in a breath, trying to decide how to ask her questions. \u201cIf I go back to Shadows, what are my obligations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Liam?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNothing. He uncollared you. That makes you fresh meat, and I\u2019m pretty sure all the lions will circle now. Hammer\u2019s threat probably won\u2019t keep the beasts away for long.\u201d</p><p>She doubted anyone would want to take on a mess like her after she\u2019d put Liam through the wringer, but it wasn\u2019t important. \u201cWhat are my options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want. Are you looking for another Dom?\u201d</p><p>The bowl of chips suddenly looked really interesting. Okay, so she couldn\u2019t meet Beck\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Raine bit her lip. \u201cI think I need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do, too.\u201d</p> <p>So she\u2019d gotten that part right. The affirmation was nice, but it was the rest that stumped her. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you want?\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cLet me rephrase that. Who do you think is most equipped to help you?\u201d</p><p>If she could open up, both Liam and Hammer knew exactly how to reach her, but with so much history\u2014and so much of it bad\u2014would they? Obviously, Beck thought so, but...</p><p>Sifting through her other options, she forced herself to look at him. \u201cWould you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His answer was so swift and emphatic, it stunned her.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I like my balls where they are. Hammer would kill me. Liam would bury me. I like you, princess, but...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t be sexual. In fact, it\u2019s better if it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter. They couldn\u2019t handle seeing you give your power to me.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d likely drive a wedge between Hammer and Beck, too. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was unfair of me to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was logical. You need help; I could help you. It burns me to say no, but at the end of the day you need someone who doesn\u2019t mind losing their balls and who doesn\u2019t want to fuck you more than they want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>But who?</p><p>\u201cLook, you need to really give yourself in a way you never have. I get that you\u2019re going to have a hard time with trust. After what I saw yesterday, I totally get it. And by the way, I wanted to shoot the son of a bitch for trying to rape you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ancient history, and I need to put it in the past, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>Beck nodded. \u201cYou already know Dominance and submission isn\u2019t about sex, but exchanging power. You, as a sub, give your control over to the Dom, who takes, treasures, and molds it into something that will complete you. When you finally start giving yourself in return, you\u2019ll find the beauty. The reward will be worth the struggle. But no one can fulfill your deepest needs until you let them know you inside and out, deep down, to the tiniest recesses of your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so good at that.\u201d She winced.</p><p>\u201cThink of it this way... I wouldn\u2019t go to the tire store and buy half a tire because I wouldn\u2019t get anywhere on it. With submission, if you\u2019re not willing to give your all, then like that tire, you\u2019ll be at a standstill, princess. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p><p>Their waitress delivered the enchiladas, and they dug in. Beck bought dinner. Raine chewed on his advice. As they walked to the parking lot, the crisp wind whipped through her hair. But it was good to feel alive and finally have direction. \u201cI know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Liam sat at the bar with Seth and Hammer, barely listening to their chatter. Another pointless day of waiting and worrying weighed upon him. If he had to spend another hour twiddling his thumbs, he\u2019d go stir-crazy. Why hadn\u2019t Raine returned? Or at least contacted him? It was driving him batshit mad.</p><p>The numerous texts Hammer had exchanged with Beck hadn\u2019t shed a speck of light on her location\u2014or her thoughts. The fucking evasive wanker just kept saying that he wouldn\u2019t break her confidence. What gave him the right to keep Raine away? Liam ached. Five minutes alone with her\u2014that\u2019s all he wanted so he could figure out what rolled around in her head.</p><p>He sighed and eyed the bottle of water in front of him. Ten thirty. Night had long ago fallen. The club was closed on Sundays, and the unsettling quiet scraped him raw. Raine probably wasn\u2019t coming back tonight. The agony of being shut out of her heart and life wrenched him, and it looked like he had another day of hell coming.</p><p>Liam\u2019s only consolation was that Hammer obviously shared his pain. That didn\u2019t give him the satisfaction he\u2019d imagined. The man wore his worry in the lines of his face and the dark circles under his hazel eyes, which matched the baggage under his own. Liam drained his water. There was no hiding the fact that neither of them was getting much sleep.</p><p>He gazed up at the illuminated glass shelves behind the bar, eyed the rows of colored bottles that called to him, promising sweet oblivion. But he couldn\u2019t risk it. He needed to keep his wits in case they got a lead on her whereabouts. There was too much at stake to have his brain muddled with booze.</p><p>Still, remaining on the tall barstool and not pacing the floor like a lunatic was a bloody chore. Shadows felt haunting and empty without Raine. Every moment clawed at his composure.</p><p>Over and over, he kept reliving their last morning together. He\u2019d seen the love pouring from her eyes. He\u2019d felt it. Hell, he\u2019d nearly been able to taste it in the air. In that moment, he\u2019d believed with every fiber in his being that he had finally, unequivocally reached her.</p><p>The unadulterated bliss had vanished when Raine had been unable to tell him how she felt. She\u2019d backpedaled behind her walls and shut him out. Why had her love for him frightened her so badly? She hadn\u2019t trusted in their bond, despite his painstaking effort to build it. Surely she knew he\u2019d never let her fall, that he would be her safety net, no matter what.</p><p>Then again, maybe she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>His visit to the Kendall house rolled through his brain like a bad horror film. Her vile excuse of a father, coupled with the pictures of her frail body beaten and bruised, had gouged out a chunk of his soul. And he\u2019d only witnessed the heartbreak. She\u2019d lived it, and he could only imagine what that had done to her psyche.</p><p>If he\u2019d known then what he knew now, he\u2019d never have removed her collar. He\u2019d change everything, wrap her in his arms and reassure her that she\u2019d never have to feel lost and alone again. He\u2019d promise her that she could reveal all the secrets she hid deep inside, and no matter what, he\u2019d still be by her side, protecting, nurturing, and loving her.</p><p>Seth said something and Hammer laughed, drawing Liam\u2019s attention back to their conversation. He smiled as if he\u2019d heard the comment instead of being lost in the dream he\u2019d let slip through his fingers.</p><p>A strange creaking from the vicinity of the front door broke the hush of conversation. Hammer snapped to attention. Liam didn\u2019t recognize the sound, but Hammer tensed, braced his hand on the bar. The lines of worry on his face gave way to something like anticipation. Liam didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on, but he turned to the sound, damn near holding his breath.</p><p>\u201cAnybody home?\u201d a deep voice echoed from the entrance.</p><p>Beck.</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart stopped, then started pounding ninety to nothing against his ribcage. He shoved away from the bar, and his stool crashed to the concrete floor with a deafening boom. Hope soared. If Beck had come, maybe he\u2019d brought Raine. Right on the heels of that thought came the worry that the prick had stashed her somewhere and simply meant to rub more salt into their wounds. If so, Liam vowed he\u2019d beat the bloody crap out of the bastard.</p><p>Heart chugging, blood surging, Liam charged for the front door. Hammer dashed beside him. They rounded the corner. Beck slid past them and headed toward the sleeping rooms, holding a familiar suitcase as he and Hammer both stopped and stared toward the portal.</p><p>With raven hair pulled away from her bare, pale face, wearing a sweatshirt that nearly swallowed her whole, there Raine stood.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Her blue eyes said she was both wary and contrite. She looked spent.</p><p>For a split second, he wondered if he were dreaming, but there she was, meeting his stare with a pensive expression.</p><p>Relief gushed through Liam\u2019s bloodstream. The gods had finally granted him mercy. \u201cRaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck.\u201d Hammer barreled toward her. \u201cWhere the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell have you been, love?\u201d Liam finished Hammer\u2019s question and raced toward her, trying to beat Hammer. \u201cDo you have any idea how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Raine held up her hand, forestalling them both. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As confusion pelted him, Liam\u2019s steps stuttered. She didn\u2019t want to talk to him? His brows furrowed. Hadn\u2019t she come back to him?</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Raine swallowed tightly, casting her eyes down for a heartbeat before she raised her chin and licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hammer barked. Concern stamped itself all over his face. \u201cPrecious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to say...to both of you.\u201d Raine\u2019s voice held an edge of unease. She cast a vaguely questioning glance to Seth, who\u2019d followed them into the foyer and lingered behind. Then she dismissed him and carried on.</p><p>Liam could tell she was nervous. The suspense gripped him by the throat. \u201cSpeak up. We\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>His directive seemed to make her even more nervous. Fuck! He watched her gaze travel first to him, then to Hammer, before she sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should never have left you both the way I did. I know you\u2019ve been worried, but I...\u201d She hesitated, then cast her contrite gaze at Hammer. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much for me over the years. I owed you more than just running off without saying thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d Hammer pressed.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Let me finish.\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Hammer nodded. \u201cBut be prepared, Raine. We have some things to say as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d She gave the man a faintly wry smile.</p><p>Whatever weighed on her mind was heavy. If her every expression and gesture hadn\u2019t made that clear, her unusual lack of sarcasm and sass did.</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d She clung to him with her hypnotic eyes, making him want to crawl deep inside her. But she\u2019d walked out on him so easily, and he couldn\u2019t push the strangling hurt aside. \u201cYou tried so hard to make me understand that you loved me and wanted me to grow. What I\u2019ve done to you is beyond unfair. I\u2019m more sorry that I can tell you.\u201d She teared up. Regret twisted her face. \u201cI hope someday you\u2019ll be able to forgive me, but I don\u2019t expect you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried everything I could think of to reach you.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cBut I was out of options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The last few days, I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking. I know I have to change. I can\u2019t ever be happy if I keep pushing everyone away. I have to learn how to say what I\u2019m thinking and feeling. I have to stop twisting the truth to avoid something uncomfortable.\u201d She drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cAnd I have to learn to believe that not everyone will hurt me. I don\u2019t have any illusions. That won\u2019t be quick or easy. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s possible. But I need to try.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even as she looked at him with sorrow in her eyes, her speech blew him away. Liam didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever heard her be that honest. But her fluttering hands and downturned gaze made it clear that something more lurked in her head.</p><p>Liam turned and looked at Hammer. Frustration rolled off his old friend. He knew what Macen was feeling, as he was mired in it himself.</p><p>\u201cSo...I have a favor to ask,\u201d she went on. \u201cI know I\u2019ve done nothing to deserve your compassion, but I\u2019m asking if one of you would suggest a Domme who might be willing to help me learn.\u201d</p><p>Liam felt his jaw drop. A Domme? What the bloody hell was she thinking?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hammer growled, a look of disbelief etched on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right in front of you, Raine. And you want some woman\u2014a bloody stranger\u2014instead?\u201d Liam didn\u2019t bother masking his shock or anger. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to teach you for the past fucking month! I told you if you were willing to do the work that I\u2019d be here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am more than aware of everything you did to help me, Liam. I wish I\u2019d been able to appreciate it more. And maybe someday...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut right now, I have to fix me before I can be worthy enough to wear your collar, much less actually devote myself to you in the way you deserve.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>Hearing that Raine thought she wasn\u2019t deserving of him broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry,\u201d she begged.</p><p>Angry didn\u2019t begin to cover it. He understood her need to bury the old Raine and resurrect a new one, but her choice to shut him out was unacceptable. \u201cDamn it, Raine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet. I want to come home because Shadows is familiar. If I\u2019m going to get out of my comfort zone in every other way, I don\u2019t want to be out of my element, too. I can\u2019t afford to make learning any harder.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMaybe it would be easier to trust a female. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never tried and...I\u2019m willing to do almost anything to be whole.\u201d</p><p>Except learn to open herself up and submit to him. His jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for your help. I\u2019m pleading for mercy.\u201d</p><p>Liam held in a curse. She\u2019d barely given him a hello before she asked for someone else to guide her. Torn between pride that she\u2019d returned to do the work and the devastation to his ego, Liam didn\u2019t know whether to wrap her in his arms or take her over his knee.</p><p>Didn\u2019t Raine understand that she was the kind of woman who would only kneel happily for a man she loved? She might find some ease in learning to be more open and honest with others, but she\u2019d never find fulfillment.</p><p>\u201cA bloody female Dominant? That\u2019s not mercy. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d He cast a stupefied glance at Hammer. The man\u2019s expression conveyed the same disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNever going to fucking happen,\u201d Hammer confirmed. \u201cDid you dream up this idea because you think Liam and I won\u2019t be jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yes,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>So Raine meant to sacrifice her chance to truly surrender so he and his old friend wouldn\u2019t fight anymore. Obviously, she didn\u2019t realize that it didn\u2019t matter who else touched her. He wanted her for his own. And he knew Hammer felt the same.</p><p>Liam scrubbed a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cOne of my greatest guilts, besides leaving you both, is the wedge I\u2019ve driven between you,\u201d she went on. \u201cI won\u2019t be the cause of that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you that guilt isn\u2019t yours, girl.\u201d Hammer scolded her.</p><p>\u201cBut it is. You were friends before me.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest, passionate and tearful. \u201cI\u2019m the point of contention. If I get out of the way, you two will eventually repair your friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Beside him, Hammer shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not your fault, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting a Domme teach you shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is for me, Macen. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Her expression willed him to. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect either of you to be thrilled, but I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d at least support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I support your need to grow,\u201d Liam growled. \u201cBut excuse me for not dancing a jig at the happy news that you want to do it with a Dominant you don\u2019t even know. I need a fucking drink.\u201d</p><p>Raine watched Liam storm away from her, breaking apart inside. She hadn\u2019t expected him to accept her request for a Domme right away...but she\u2019d expected him to understand at least a bit. Hammer was the one she\u2019d imagined would blow his temper and rail.</p><p>Now, she was almost afraid to look at him. But she forced herself to. Barely leashed fury brimmed in his hazel eyes.</p><p>Obviously, he hadn\u2019t liked what she\u2019d said. But if he restrained himself from saying more, that meant that she\u2019d pushed him so damn far, he\u2019d chosen to say nothing rather than voice something incredibly ugly. Raine had rarely seen him this angry. When she had, he usually cut that person from his life.</p><p>The thought that she would lose them both forever crushed her. Her first instinct was to wonder if she should leave Shadows after all. Raine checked it. Eventually, she would be better. She would keep communicating with them. Even if Liam left, she would write or call or text\u2014whatever it took\u2014to mend fences.</p><p>And hopefully, with her out of their way, they would be friends again someday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this to hurt either of you,\u201d she murmured to Hammer.</p><p>He clenched his jaw. Veins bulged in his neck. He still didn\u2019t utter a single word.</p><p>Leaning with one shoulder against the wall, the tall stranger she\u2019d noticed earlier hovered a few feet behind Macen. He peeled away from his perch, his watchful green eyes sizing her up. \u201cDon\u2019t be a prick, Hammer.\u201d</p><p>Temper mottling his face red, Hammer shook his head. Then he cut a stare in the other man\u2019s direction, his eyes narrowed with fury. \u201cDo not let her leave.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone, his broad shoulders disappearing around the corner, carried away by his long, angry stride as he followed Liam to the bar.</p><p>A pang crushed her chest. She\u2019d never really had him, but to lose him now totally devastated her.</p><p>The stranger, who looked like a Hemsworth brother, sidled up to her and eased his hand around her elbow. \u201cHello, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze to him, trying to hold it together. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Seth, a friend of Liam\u2019s and Hammer\u2019s from New York. I haven\u2019t had the pleasure of meeting you until now, but I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. I\u2019d like to talk to you for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>About what? She\u2019d just vomited out some of the most intimate things she\u2019d ever said in her life. What more did he want?</p><p>He began to lead her away. She dug in her heels.</p><p>With a gentle but firm grip, he tugged her forward. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just hurt the two men I love more than anything. How am I supposed to feel?\u201d She sighed, shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. God knows I have a long history of screwing up, but this is the only plan I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d Despite his strong, angular face, Seth came across as surprisingly compassionate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to turn in for the night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Raine bit her lip. She doubted she would sleep much, but she also didn\u2019t think that following Liam and Hammer to the bar would do anything except make the situation worse. Maybe the best thing to do was let them chew on her idea and find the logic so they could all move on...wherever that led them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me your room. I\u2019ll make sure you get tucked in all safely.\u201d</p><p>Raine rolled her eyes. \u201cI can find my way down the hall. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking.\u201d He raised a brow.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t miss his Dom face. Of course.</p><p>For a moment, she thought about balking, but why? Tumult rolled through her, and she couldn\u2019t very well go crying to Liam or Hammer anymore. Beck... He\u2019d been nice, but he\u2019d unloaded his responsibility for her. She had to buck up and handle things on her own. Frankly, she\u2019d rather do that in the privacy of her own room in case that meant tears.</p><p>Besides, she couldn\u2019t claim to want a Dom, male or female, and be bratty about such a simple request. From the look on Seth\u2019s face, he only had the best intentions at heart.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>Turning away, Raine led him out of the entry and through the cavernous structure, down the hall, finally to her room. The door opened without a key. Everything inside looked almost exactly as she\u2019d left it except that Beck had set her suitcase by the door.</p><p>Nothing had turned out the way she\u2019d intended, but she still felt ridiculously glad that she\u2019d be putting things away in the place she called home.</p><p>Stepping aside, she let Seth follow her in.</p><p>\u201cGet ready for bed. Then we\u2019ll talk,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>Picking up her little case, she dragged it into the bathroom. She washed her face, brushed her hair and teeth, changed clothes, then padded back out.</p><p>Seth eyed her and drew in a deep breath. \u201cNo wonder. Okay...\u201d</p><p>Raine frowned at him. What was he going on about?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d</p><p>Again, it wasn\u2019t a request. Since she had no chairs in her room, she crawled into bed, scrambling between the sheets.</p><p>He sat on the edge beside her. \u201cI know you don\u2019t know me, and this probably seems awkward, but you were so honest in the foyer. I need you to continue that. I came here to help Liam straighten a few things out, but I think you might need my ear just as much. Like Beck, I won\u2019t betray your confidence. I just need to get to the bottom of this so I can understand how to help.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, she beat back mortification. \u201cThis is totally awkward. Everyone knows my damn business.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t really want to talk to Seth about all this, but he\u2019d heard her whole speech in the foyer. It wasn\u2019t like she had many secrets at this point.</p><p>Seth tsked at her. \u201cLiam likes ladies. I know he wouldn\u2019t appreciate you swearing, would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut he let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it seem that way to you just now? He threw a tantrum over losing you, which I\u2019ll totally rib him about later. He admitted that he\u2019d given you his heart. You can\u2019t think he\u2019s done with you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhen Liam uncollared me, he told me that I wasn\u2019t ready for what he had to offer. He was right. I can\u2019t keep hurting him. And I can\u2019t keep coming between him and Hammer. If you know them both, you know they used to be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. And now they can\u2019t stand one another. I can\u2019t pretend that\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault except mine.\u201d She covered her face with her hands. \u201cThe guilt has been eating me alive. I think they want me to choose...and I can\u2019t. I love them both too much. And it could ruin their friendship for good.\u201d</p><p>Seth tilted her chin up and stared at her, studying her every nuance, pinning her against her headboard with an almost dissecting gaze. \u201cIf you were whole, as you put it, and they were on good terms, would you have any qualms about letting either one into your life again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you let either of them be your Dom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew I wasn\u2019t going to hurt Liam again, yes. Hammer...\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe puts on a big show, but if he didn\u2019t want anything to do with me for six years, I don\u2019t think he truly wants me. And now that he\u2019s not speaking to me anymore, I\u2019m sure that will never be an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that, you\u2019re fooling yourself. How about both of them?\u201d</p><p>She reared back. \u201cBeck, the guy who brought me back here, suggested the same thing. I think you two are nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s possible we\u2019re the only sane ones in this mess.\u201d Seth shrugged. \u201cIf Liam and Hammer agreed it it, would you have them both?\u201d</p><p>Why was he trying to crawl in her head? \u201cIn a perfect world, of course. It\u2019ll probably happen on the twelfth of never as hell is freezing over, but I\u2019ve fantasized about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love them?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, wishing she could tell Seth that she didn\u2019t want to play Twenty Questions anymore. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiled smugly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>Raine didn\u2019t want to, but she probably needed it. If it made Seth and his questions disappear, even better. \u201cSure, but would you please make sure they don\u2019t get too drunk? Hammer will down tequila and he\u2019ll have a terrible hangover that will make him a bear tomorrow. Liam is probably drinking Scotch. He really needs a friend now. He and Beck don\u2019t get along. If Hammer turns his anger on Liam, he\u2019ll be outnumbered and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cGet some sleep. Things should look brighter in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Raine certainly hoped so because everything looked damn bleak now.</p><p>Storming into the bar, Hammer grabbed a bottle of Patr\u00f3n. He tore off the cap and slid onto an empty barstool, tipping the bottle to his mouth for a long swig. Beside him, Liam tossed back shots of Scotch. Beck sat around the corner of the L-shaped bar. The big pussy nursed a bottle of beer and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get a thanks for bringing Raine back? And she\u2019s even in one piece,\u201d Beck drawled.</p> <p>Hammer really tried not to punch him.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Liam snarled and shot back more Scotch.</p><p>\u201cWhat he said.\u201d Hammer glared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy to see her?\u201d Beck mocked.</p><p>Happy? Laying eyes on Raine again had been like Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, and a kick-ass New Year\u2019s Eve all rolled into one. He\u2019d never been so damn relieved in his life. But now that she\u2019d returned, his latent rage boiled up. She\u2019d run off without saying a fucking word. And when she\u2019d returned, had she wanted his protection or comfort? Oh, no. Instead, she\u2019d warded him off by shoving a hand in his face. While still reeling from that silent \u201cfuck you very much,\u201d she\u2019d had the balls to ask him for a Domme.</p> <p>Not on your life, precious.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>There. That didn\u2019t sound like he wanted to rip Beck\u2019s face off. Or give in to the impulse to snag Raine by the arm, haul her ungrateful ass over his lap, and paddle her backside. Sucking in a breath, Hammer cordoned off his anger. If he punished her now, that would make him the worst sort of player. No real Dominant should ever punish a sub who asked for help. Raine might not have come back for him\u2014or Liam\u2014but someday she would understand the depth of her betrayal. Then... Well, his hand itched for that day.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t show. She decided to come back all on her own and ask for help. That\u2019s a big step for her.\u201d</p><p>Tossing back another gulp of tequila, he shrugged. \u201cHuge.\u201d</p><p>The small part of him that wasn\u2019t horrifically pissed off felt proud. He\u2019d never seen Raine so resolved to grow and blossom. The rest of him? Downright furious at her version of \u201chelp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust drink your beer.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to talk to Beck. Or anyone. He had to figure out what the hell to do.</p><p>\u201cStop soaking your brain with tequila and use it for a minute. Raine has a good idea. A female Dominant could teach her the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine has lost the bloody plot! A Domme?\u201d Liam shoved his tumbler aside, opting to swig from the bottle instead.</p><p>Yeah, this was going to get down and dirty. Hammer was so there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible fucking idea, Beck.\u201d Hammer glared. \u201cUntil Raine feels the connection with a Dominant who commands her body, heart, and soul, she\u2019ll be like a race car with a compact\u2019s engine. She\u2019ll run, but not like she should.\u201d</p><p>He slammed back more booze. The tequila burned, but he welcomed it, hoping it would numb the sting of Raine\u2019s desertion.</p><p>She needed more than another woman could give her. Goddamn it, she needed him\u2014his guidance, his boundaries. His love. Fuck if he didn\u2019t want to banish everyone from Shadows and wrap Raine in his arms until he\u2019d bound her to him in every way possible. But damn it, her little speech tonight had tied his hands. Yeah, he could still tell her that he loved her. He probably should. But then he\u2019d have to stand back and let the chips fall.</p><p>The control freak in him hated that idea.</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Liam agreed, leaning onto the polished wooden surface and looking past him to stare at Beck. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to her these last few days? Brainwash her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. I never thought I\u2019d live to see the day that Raine sought out a woman.\u201d Hammer shook his head.</p><p>\u201cPull your heads out of your asses,\u201d Beck complained. \u201cShe just wants happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make her happy,\u201d Liam countered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I could bear to see her give her affection to anyone else. How did everything get so fucked up?\u201d Liam tipped his bottle back once again. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta figure out how to win her back. I need a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t been keeping score, you\u2019re batting a big fat zero with your last two grand ideas,\u201d Hammer jeered.</p><p>Liam flipped him off. \u201cAt least I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Hammer nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re the most trying man I\u2019ve ever met... Just saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa fucking ha,\u201d Liam sneered.</p><p>Beck nearly fell off his barstool laughing. \u201cYou two are hopeless, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you know about love?\u201d Hammer bristled. \u201cSomeday, somehow, Raine is going to choose one of us...then, of course, the other will have to die.\u201d</p><p>Slugging back another drink, he wondered if Raine would ever let him love her the way he should have all along.</p><p>Liam peered at him. \u201cI might be tempted to beat you ugly so that she\u2019d never want you, but I swear I\u2019d never kill you. That\u2019s just bad form.\u201d Liam frowned at Hammer. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person that I\u2019d like to unload a forty-five on, and that\u2019s her dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Here.\u201d He agreed, raising his bottle and clinking it against his old friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of you paid attention to her hands when she came in, did you?\u201d Beck piped up.</p><p>Both he and Liam turned. The burly sadist wore a grave expression.</p><p>\u201cHer hands?\u201d he asked, wondering what part of the conversation had slipped past him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She went to visit her father yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s heart nearly stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody... You\u2019re serious?\u201d Liam blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be,\u201d Hammer warned.</p><p>When Beck gave a curt nod, he felt as if he\u2019d been blown clear to the other side of the room. Anger burst in his veins. Raine had gone back to that shithole, to see that animal, without him. She could have been hurt. Or Bill Kendall could have killed her.</p><p>With cold precision, Hammer turned his head, leveling Beck with an icy glare. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to ask?\u201d Beck sent him a mocking stare.</p><p>No. Hammer had known she\u2019d eventually seek out Bill for answers, vindication...closure. But damn it, he\u2019d imagined he\u2019d be beside Raine, supporting and protecting her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fucking let her go alone, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, ass-hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us what happened before I beat the truth out of you,\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>Beck shook his head. \u201cWhatever. You\u2019re so... what is it you guys across the pond call it? Pissed. Yeah. You\u2019re so pissed drunk, you couldn\u2019t beat yourself off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Irish, not English, you bloody twit,\u201d Liam growled. \u201cAnd yes, I could, if I wanted to.\u201d He scoffed, drinking down more Scotch. \u201cBut I don\u2019t. And don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bill touch her?\u201d Hammer added. \u201cIf he did, you\u2019re taking me there right now so I can plant a bullet in his miserable head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Lone Ranger. I already covered that contingency.\u201d Beck gave him a condescending pat on the shoulder. \u201cI had my gun out and sited right between the son of a bitch\u2019s eyes every fucking second. But she didn\u2019t need me. You remember those self-defense classes you enrolled her in years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It took him a minute for the puzzle pieces to fall into place, but when they did, Hammer grinned. \u201cShe kicked his ass, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a ninja.\u201d Beck grinned.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah!\u201d Hammer cheered. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my girl, motherfucker,\u201d Liam insisted, slurring.</p><p>\u201cShe was. And she could kick your ass, too. \u2018Cause I got her lessons,\u201d he preened.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I wish I was recording this. All the fet folk we know would howl.\u201d Beck laughed.</p><p>\u201cShut up and tell us what happened when you took her to see that fucker,\u201d Hammer snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe slayed her dragon, more or less. It was good for her. You know, you two aren\u2019t the only ones who care about her.\u201d</p><p>Liam stood, wobbling, looking ready for a fight. \u201cYou better not have fucking touched her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Hammer felt his skull about to explode and reached out to throttle Beck.</p><p>The other man shoved him away. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Jesus, you idiots... Give it a rest. I\u2019m tempted to lay you both out cold, but you\u2019re both too drunk to fight.\u201d</p><p>Hammer glanced at a weaving Liam. Sadly, Beck was right. Besides, unloading all the fury roiling inside him onto the doctor wouldn\u2019t help anything. He\u2019d already seen vividly that displacing his guilt and anger led to bad things. He had to buck up and fly right.</p><p>\u201cSorry, man. Thank you for keeping her safe. Now tell me what happened. Details!\u201d Hammer slammed his bottle on the bar.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what she said to that sniveling douchebag?\u201d Liam prodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Raine let old Bill know, in no uncertain terms, that he was a steaming pile of dog shit.\u201d A smile tugged at the corners of Beck\u2019s lips. \u201cYou two would have been proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood lass,\u201d Liam whispered. \u201cBut what the devil would we have done if he\u2019d hurt her?\u201d</p><p>Something clogged Hammer\u2019s throat. Maybe it was too much anger, or the booze talking, or simply relief that Raine had come home, where she belonged. His eyes stung.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think that. But I can guarantee they\u2019d never find a single part of Bill\u2019s body.\u201d Hammer reached up and gave Liam\u2019s shoulder a reassuring squeeze. \u201cThe question we should be asking, since Raine\u2019s plan sucks, is what\u2019s the best way to help her?\u201d</p><p>When he felt a slap upside his head, Hammer turned to find Seth delivering the same smack to Liam.</p><p>\u201cGood to hear you say that, Macen,\u201d the other man announced from behind him. \u201cBecause after talking to Raine, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Hammer bristled. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her all of five fucking minutes and suddenly you can read her mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Liam turned and steadied himself on the bar, wagging his finger at Seth. \u201cIf you fucking touched her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill, Conan. As much as I wanted to introduce her to my most amazing skill...\u201d Seth licked his tongue over his teeth, slurping nosily. \u201cWe just talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn good thing because I would have cut your tongue out,\u201d Hammer vowed. \u201cYou should have asked her to teach your pansy ass how to make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusting my balls isn\u2019t going to help Raine, so zip it. Would you rather the girl stayed fucked up? Or do you want to help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know the answer,\u201d Hammer grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying for weeks now. You\u2019re not leaving me out, damn it!\u201d Liam insisted, looking up with bleary eyes at Seth.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you both agree.\u201d Seth looked between them. \u201cHow long do you think you can act like big boys and play nicely together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout five more seconds,\u201d Beck piped up with a mocking grin.</p><p>\u201cGet stuffed, you bastard,\u201d Liam barked.</p><p>Beck just shook his head as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting along fine right now.\u201d Hammer glared. \u201cSpill it before I lose my patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal...\u201d Seth began. \u201cRaine is about the most torn woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that asshole father of hers,\u201d Liam blurted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean broken, though I suspect she\u2019s that as well. I mean she\u2019s in love with you lug nuts, and your constant, hellaciously annoying bickering has torn her heart in two.\u201d Seth shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why she loves you both, but...\u201d</p><p>Liam plunked down on his barstool, grabbing the bar to balance himself and stay upright. \u201cBecause we\u2019re dashing and handsome and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood in bed, goddamn it,\u201d Hammer added.</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d Liam raised his bottle, and Hammer clinked it again.</p><p>\u201cAnd so modest,\u201d Beck drawled.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you two could sober up so we can discuss this?\u201d Seth arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cHang on. I\u2019ll be back. But don\u2019t say too much,\u201d Beck announced, then sauntered from the bar. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dunk. I mean, drunk.\u201d Liam thrust his shoulders back and raised his chin.</p><p>Hammer elbowed him and tried to decide which of the two images of Seth swimming in his vision was real. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a guess here...\u201d Seth said wryly. \u201cBut neither of you wants Raine with a Domme, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Liam pounded his fist on the bar.</p><p>\u201cThe whole idea is bullshit,\u201d Hammer agreed.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. So far, you\u2019ve both scored a hundred percent on the quiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiz?\u201d Liam blinked, then looked at Hammer, his eyes wide. \u201cShit, we didn\u2019t study, mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Seth is giving the quiz, we\u2019re good. He can\u2019t be smarter than us,\u201d Hammer said in a stage whisper.</p><p>\u201cSpare me sloppy drunks.\u201d Seth shook his head in disgust. \u201cThis will wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, this might help.\u201d Beck set down two steaming mugs of coffee.</p><p>Hammer pounced on it and took a sip, moaning long and loud. \u201cSon of a bitch! You know how to make good coffee?\u201d</p><p>Beck scowled at Hammer. \u201cYou\u2019re so helpless that you don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to like you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He and Liam sipped their steaming brews as fast as they could. When they\u2019d drained their mugs, Beck refilled them. Staring at his watch, Seth waited impatiently.</p><p>Before long, Hammer\u2019s thoughts turned right-side up. The glazed look in Liam\u2019s eyes began to dissipate.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sober enough. Get on with it,\u201d Hammer demanded.</p><p>\u201cFinally... Here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Seth said, staring first at Hammer, then Liam. \u201cLike I said, Raine is in love with you both. If her heart is torn in two, how do you expect her to heal with just one of you?\u201d</p><p>Hammer froze. Share Raine? That\u2019s what Seth was suggesting. Beck had, too. It wasn\u2019t a foreign concept. Hell, he\u2019d had a woman between himself and Liam. But the thought of sharing Raine... Hell no. The possessive caveman in him wanted to drag her off by the hair and keep her for himself.</p> <p>Then again, Seth asked a really good question, and there seemed to be only one answer. He turned to look at Liam.</p><p>\u201cWe have to work together?\u201d His old pal grimaced.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, but yes,\u201d Seth answered. \u201cI came because you asked me to help you reach the girl. I think this is the only way it will work. If you can\u2019t handle that, take your bottle and stumble on down to your room. I\u2019ll help him instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will!\u201d Fury thundered across Liam\u2019s face.</p><p>Hammer couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being shut out of her recovery either. No way would he roll over and play dead.</p><p>\u201cThen fucking agree and get along already,\u201d Seth insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s what she wants. You\u2019ll have to figure out specifics, but if you would stop thinking with your pride\u2014\u201d he glared at Hammer \u201c\u2014and your jealousy\u2014\u201d he shot Liam a pointed look \u201c\u2014you\u2019d know I\u2019m right.\u201d Seth rolled his eyes. \u201cI told you this shit a month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I talked to Raine about this, too\u201d Beck said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t hate the idea at all. So stop pissing on her like she\u2019s a damn hydrant and do what real Dominants do. Help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d Seth rose. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t, she\u2019s a pretty girl. She won\u2019t be alone for long. In fact, feel free to keep fucking this up. Once she leaves your sorry asses, I\u2019d be so happy to tap that.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>If Liam hadn\u2019t felt exactly sober ten minutes ago, he did now. Work with Hammer to heal Raine? After a month of arguing, it boggled the mind, really. Hammer had been part of the problem for so bloody long, crushing her fragile spirit with his indifference, then dragging her to his bed and fucking her within an inch of her life. Liam didn\u2019t see this working.</p><p>But nothing else he\u2019d tried had helped, either. Though he hated to admit it, no one knew her background, habits, and tendencies better than Hammer. After nearly a month with Raine as her Dom and her lover, Liam knew her better sexually, maybe even emotionally in some ways. More importantly, together they knew her inside and out. And they probably needed every bit of knowledge to reach her because he feared Seth had a point that a heart divided couldn\u2019t heal without both parts.</p><p>Beck and Seth\u2019s conversation drifted through the bar, becoming more faint as they headed out of the room. The meddling fucks had left him alone with Hammer. Seth, the last of his good friends, had thrown him to the enemy. Or it felt that way. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re right,\u201d Hammer said into the solemn silence.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. She only wants a Domme because we\u2019re too stubborn to get along.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Because Raine wanted them to be friends again, she had given up on the sort of Dom she needed. It was his duty to put her needs first.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cOur bickering has torn her apart,\u201d Liam conceded.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Hammer tapped the rim of his coffee cup. \u201cAll we\u2019ve done is put her between us in all the wrong ways and made her life difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either,\u201d Macen agreed. \u201cThe other thing to consider is, if we don\u2019t offer her a choice between us and a Domme, we\u2019re not being fair. And she might dig in her heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA choice? Who could we bloody offer to give her to? And what if Raine picks that option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance we have to take,\u201d Hammer pointed out. \u201cShe\u2019ll only do the work with us if she chooses to. Seth says that\u2019s what she wants...and I believe he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally! First smart thing you\u2019ve said all night,\u201d Beck called back, peeking around the corner with a grin.</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d he and Hammer both shouted in unison.</p><p>Liam waited until Beck disappeared again, then turned back to Hammer. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose helping her together could be any worse than what we\u2019ve already done to her separately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Hammer sighed heavily.</p><p>Juliet. Of course that tragedy would plague Macen\u2019s thoughts. It had for over eight years. \u201cI think I do. She loves us both, according to Seth, but is eaten up with guilt. If we took that off her shoulders and focused on her...\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Hammer stared into his coffee. \u201cAt least she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about us anymore.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t dispute that. Still, Hammer had been twenty kinds of asshole over the past month. He knew why now...but that didn\u2019t make this idea more palatable. His old friend could be a damn good Dom, but Hammer had never been a demonstrative partner with his wife. Sexually, yes. Where his heart was concerned? Liam couldn\u2019t remember more than a handful of occasions when the man had told Juliet that he loved her. Raine needed those words. She needed a man who would both show her and tell her how he felt. When Hammer didn\u2019t, she would likely distance herself from him.</p><p>And Liam would have her all to himself again\u2014the way it should be.</p><p>He smiled, rather liking that plan.</p><p>Of course, they had to fulfill her needs and heal her first.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t disagree.\u201d Liam nodded the other man\u2019s way. \u201cLet\u2019s say, for argument\u2019s sake, that we intended to work on helping her together.\u201d</p><p>Hammer leveled him a stare. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think are her most pressing issues? We can\u2019t overwhelm her too quickly with too much. If you had to pick a few of her worst habits to focus on, tell me what you\u2019d choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have ideas, too. But one thing I know\u2014that we\u2019ve just seen in the past few days\u2014is the way she retreats into her head. She doesn\u2019t share what she\u2019s thinking. If we\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have had to pry from her how late her period was. You would have known about her migraines. I don\u2019t think she would have ever left home if she\u2019d been able to talk through her problems with one or both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Raine not only has difficulty saying how she feels, she\u2019s not always honest. She\u2019s given me a lot of half-truths. She\u2019s quite good at telling me what she thinks I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what will keep her ass out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Liam sent him a reluctant grin. \u201cShe\u2019s good at that, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has to stop,\u201d Hammer insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt does. One of her biggest problems has been that she can\u2019t purge her hurt, share her fears, or tell me what she bloody wants. I\u2019ve been trying to drag it out of her and guess along the way. Raine is afraid I\u2019m going to tell her that she\u2019s too much trouble or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also afraid to be too vulnerable with anyone, and it didn\u2019t help that I turned her away the one time she worked up the courage to be honest about her feelings.\u201d</p><p>No, it hadn\u2019t fucking helped at all, but taking out his irritation on Hammer now, while satisfying, would be pointless.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re agreed?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cCommunication and honesty. But I think there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo question. Raine has other issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe biggest must be trust.\u201d Liam hated to say it, worried that Hammer would see it as an indication of the weakness in his relationship with her. \u201cYou may not agree.\u201d The other man probably didn\u2019t have half the problem with earning Raine\u2019s trust since she\u2019d been there for six years. But after barely a handful of weeks with her, Liam was struggling to catch up. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t hesitate. He simply nodded. \u201cI think she probably trusts me more than about anyone, but there are chunks of her past and her feelings that she still won\u2019t share. I\u2019ve asked, pressed, insisted, demanded, threatened. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>That made sense. All the way until her last moment as his submissive, Raine had never trusted that he meant to stay. To hear that she lacked trust in everyone, even Hammer, set him back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s really ready for this?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I could hear it in her voice.\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that before. Her resolve doesn\u2019t always last. The minute she gets scared...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let her falter or hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, I know. But what if she quits on us?\u201d Liam hated to voice the question, but that possibility was too real to ignore.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another chance we take. We\u2019ll have to monitor her constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He looked Hammer\u2019s way to find the man staring back at him.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re on the same page. Communication, honesty, and trust?\u201d Macen asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to pick three, yes. I think they feed into most other issues she\u2019s struggling with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>And hadn\u2019t that agreement come easily? They\u2019d never quarreled as fiercely as they had since Liam had taken Raine for his own. But now? It felt like old times...but better.</p><p>Liam stood and paced from one end of the room to the other. Why was that?</p><p>\u201cWould you sit down?\u201d Hammer complained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d He traveled the length of the bar a few more times. \u201cYou know, we never talked about what Juliet needed this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hadn\u2019t been with Juliet as long as I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been with Raine as long as you, either.\u201d</p><p>Hammer shrugged. \u201cYou were young, still in your early twenties and having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Hammer. I\u2019m only five years younger. And I wasn\u2019t immature or stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t. I guess...I didn\u2019t want to burden you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to step on your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had it all under control,\u201d Hammer admitted. \u201cI probably would have resented your suggestions at the time. Besides, I knew you didn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed her, sure. And he would never have told Juliet that truth. Her spirit had been too breakable to hear it. He\u2019d wondered now and again if she\u2019d known and that was part of the reason she\u2019d committed suicide.</p><p>\u201cI still wanted to give her something she needed,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn retrospect...\u201d Hammer sighed heavily. \u201cNeither did I. If I had, she would never have chosen the silent way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Raine isn\u2019t Juliet. Granted, she may have one or two issues, but surely, if we put our shit aside for a bit and do what we should, they\u2019re nothing too difficult to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is, can we put our shit aside?\u201d Hammer asked with brutal honesty. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done a good job of that for a while.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t disagree. If someone would have told him on his flight from New York to Los Angeles that he and his best friend would soon be at one another\u2019s throats, he would have laughed himself silly. Looking back over the past month, they\u2019d said\u2014and done\u2014things to hurt the other. He regretted the sad state their friendship had fallen into. Hammer must also or else the man would have simply ceased speaking to him altogether. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for much longer than we\u2019ve been enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve shared before.\u201d Hammer let out a tight breath. \u201cWe know some of the warning signs to watch for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. If we\u2019re at all serious about this, we have to negotiate a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely talk to Raine about our intentions, ask her for her hard limits and whatnot. But I don\u2019t want to give her too much up front. The less she knows, the less she can prepare ways to sidestep us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that. And I already know Raine\u2019s hard limits. I asked her before I collared her. But that\u2019s not what I meant. You and I need to negotiate our behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor instance?\u201d Hammer\u2019s voice turned chilly.</p><p>Liam refused to let the man\u2019s tone change his agenda. \u201cFirst off, we can\u2019t help Raine if we start fighting in the middle of a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, I think that would be the worst thing for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I also think you and I should have a word or phrase that will pause everything so we can discuss whatever\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah.\u201d Liam nodded. \u201cI still find Raine\u2019s hidden triggers now and again. We have to be mindful.\u201d</p><p>Hammer relaxed, seeming to see the train of his thoughts. \u201cYes. She\u2019s probably a damn landmine. The night I spent with her, I thought about doing so many things that I didn\u2019t because I worried I might step on some hot spot.\u201d He gave a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve known Raine for so long, but I don\u2019t know this side of her. How does she do with restraints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves them.\u201d As Hammer reared back, Liam shrugged. \u201cAfter seeing what her father did to her, I\u2019m a bit blown over too. But she hates gags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d Hammer laughed.</p><p>Liam joined in. \u201cNot much. If you let her, she\u2019ll try to tell you what she wants in a scene. Of course she sometimes talks herself out of a panic, too. You don\u2019t always know what you\u2019ll get with Raine. She\u2019s seemed leery of whips, so I haven\u2019t given that a go. I think riding crops are a big \u2018no\u2019 for her, which is fine with me. She loves a good spanking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she ever reach subspace?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSurprisingly well, given her trust issues. It wasn\u2019t easy at first, but over time, she\u2019s become more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>All this talk about Hammer partaking in her submission was making his guts churn. But if he was going to give Raine what she needed, he would have to grit his teeth and stifle his jealousy.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Macen swallowed down more coffee. \u201cHow about if either of us says it\u2019s time for a breath of fresh air, that will be our signal to pause and find another solution to the scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will work.\u201d</p><p>Hammer hesitated for a long moment. \u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s a good idea. When we were with Juliet, I sometimes took her further than you thought I should have, right?\u201d At Liam\u2019s nod, he went on. \u201cI wish like hell I\u2019d asked your opinion and listened. She and I probably would have wound up divorced, but maybe she\u2019d be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hard head, Hammer. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll listen now, either.\u201d</p><p>The man blew out a rough breath. \u201cI\u2019ve grown since then, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll do my best. Sometimes that dark side of me wants to take over. Having you to reel me in when that happens might be best. I don\u2019t want to scare Raine or damage our progress with her.\u201d</p> <p>Since his old friend often seemed to think he knew best, that was a big admission for Hammer. It shocked the hell out of Liam\u2014and made him look inward as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a bit too guilty of letting Raine have her way more than I should. I enjoy coddling her sometimes, and god knows she could use the tenderness. But she also needs firm guidance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t let you shirk that. Got it.\u201d Hammer smirked. \u201cLook at us getting along and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jinx it,\u201d Liam scolded.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>He paced the length of the room again. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long her progress will take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell won\u2019t be overnight, but I\u2019m willing to stick it out. What about you? If you had any intention of going back to New York after the winter, and she\u2019s not ready...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving L.A. without Raine. I\u2019d decided I was staying indefinitely, so I bought a house here. I\u2019d planned to give her the key wrapped in a box the morning the shit hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>Hammer stared, blinking. \u201cYou were planning to move her to this house?\u201d</p><p>Liam squared his shoulders. \u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Hammer sounded floored.</p><p>\u201cRaine needs a steady home.\u201d</p><p>Guilt flashed across Hammer\u2019s face, and he raked a hand through his hair. \u201cGoddamn it, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did the best you could at the time. Let\u2019s not get off track. Raine won\u2019t be moving on with her life at all if we can\u2019t help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Hammer agreed.</p><p>Another thought occurred to Liam, and he winced. \u201cI also think it would be best if you were discreet with your other subs. I\u2019m not suggesting you give them up, but it would help her if you hid them better than you did Marlie.\u201d</p><p>Hammer cringed at her name. \u201cActually, I already gave them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that plastic whore give you a disease I don\u2019t know about?\u201d Liam sent him a sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hammer scoffed. \u201cI haven\u2019t scened with anyone in weeks. I haven\u2019t fucked anyone since Raine. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>That took Liam totally aback. Hammer loved sex, and he\u2019d never imagined his friend would give it up, even temporarily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bloody near a month, mate\u2014a record for you. Your balls must be blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and my hand is damn tired of getting a workout. But no one else is Raine.\u201d</p><p>As much as Liam wanted to, he couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>Hammer cocked his head and sent him a questioning glance. \u201cAre we agreeing to do this? For her?\u201d</p><p>Liam hated it, but saw almost no way around it. \u201cI think it makes sense, but...\u201d He scrubbed at his face. \u201cMaking it work is going to be...complicated.\u201d</p><p>Because one topic could turn this truce back into a war.</p><p>Raine wasn\u2019t his anymore\u2014at least not technically. That meant Hammer was free to say or do anything to her, as long as she consented. Macen had already vowed to get her into bed the moment he could. Liam had few illusions. Raine loved the man. If she said \u201cno\u201d to him, it wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, figuring out who gets to fuck her will be complicated,\u201d Hammer drawled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Liam spit the word. \u201cBut hell, after her speech today, maybe she won\u2019t want either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, O\u2019Neill. If she cares about us both, she\u2019s going to want us. Maybe together...maybe apart. If she needs us, how can we refuse?\u201d</p><p>Liam bit his tongue hard enough to taste copper as he fought to dial down a sudden red rage. The memories of Raine\u2019s scent in his nose and her cries in his ears as he sank into the hot, soft depths of her body clawed need through him. But Hammer was right. If they wanted Raine to grow and be happy, they both had to do the right thing for her, even if it bloody killed them.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he managed to choke out the words.</p><p>They stared at one another for a month of Sundays before Hammer cocked a brow at him and finally broke the silence. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be clear, once we\u2019re in a session, we have to be dedicated to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguing.\u201d</p><p>Hammer nodded. \u201cNo bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo putting your pride first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doing the same with your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>Hell, Liam wanted to punch Hammer, but what was the point when he was right? \u201cFine. We present a united front to Raine. Whatever\u2019s happened prior doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference once we enter a room and begin to work with her. If we disagree, we do it calmly, rationally, and out of her earshot. Raine comes first.\u201d</p><p>Hammer nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work. We have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t want to leave her growth to someone else, yes. We come at her together. Strong. Focused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilling and able to give her what she needs\u2014no matter what that is. United in coaxing her into giving us what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Liam hoped to hold Raine again, happier and more whole\u2014and eventually all his. But after this conversation, he wasn\u2019t so sure. If Hammer helped shape her today, where did that leave their tomorrow?</p><p>Hammer held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Liam could do nothing but shake it.</p><p>As much as the man inside Hammer disliked this idea, the Dom in him saw the logic. He\u2019d utterly failed Raine for years. He couldn\u2019t put his guilt above her needs and fail her again\u2014even if sharing her with Liam would chafe him raw.</p><p>Getting his wife between him and his best friend used to make Hammer\u2019s dick as hard as steel. The power of their bodies claiming her as one and driving her to screaming orgasms and exhaustion had been the headiest rush he\u2019d ever experienced. Maybe he and Liam had too much animosity between them now for that. But any chance to fuck Raine again was a chance Hammer intended to take.</p><p>Still, one concern kept gnawing away at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Raine understands how much work is ahead of her.\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, either. I want to reach her more than I want to breathe. But neither of us can force her to grow faster than she\u2019s ready to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she hasn\u2019t thought this through and isn\u2019t serious, we\u2019ll find out real fast. But she\u2019s strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stubborn enough, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is.\u201d Hammer chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to praise her for every speck of progress. Once she tastes success, we\u2019ll have to hope it motivates her to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need more than praise,\u201d Liam said. \u201cShe\u2019ll need reassurance, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Hammer nodded. \u201cBut the one thing in our favor is that she aches to please. We\u2019ve both seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer submission can be bloody amazing. But she can shut it down so quickly, you get damn near dizzy.\u201d</p><p>Hammer grunted in understanding. Drawing out the submissive inside Raine wouldn\u2019t be simple. He was a demanding Master\u2014and he knew it. Pushing a sub to her boundaries and beyond under his hand\u2014and his body\u2014had always given him a thrilling sense of control. If Raine were truly willing to cast aside her cloak of security, the freedom and beauty she found would blow her mind.</p><p>But taking a sub that far fed something dark in him. He always wanted more and more. The need to believe that he\u2019d owned every part of Juliet and to make her prove it every way he could conceive had been their downfall. Maybe it was a blessing, after all, that he\u2019d have Liam there to balance him. His old friend hadn\u2019t loved Juliet, and he hadn\u2019t thought of her as his responsibility, so he\u2019d seen no reason to curb any of Hammer\u2019s more extreme demands. But Liam would watch over Raine and protect her with every cell in his body.</p><p>With Liam added to the equation, however, the expectations on her would double. They\u2019d have to remain vigilant, delving deep and bolstering her often, to keep Raine from crumbling beneath the strain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that Raine\u2019s lack of experience in sharing her feelings could leave her overwhelmed and frightened,\u201d Hammer said finally.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why communication is so critical. It\u2019s the first point we have to drive home with her. If she\u2019ll just share, we can erase some of her fear.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and Hammer knew that if he expected her to trust him, to communicate openly and honestly, he would need to do the same...no matter how uncomfortable it made him.</p><p>\u201cReplacing old patterns with new ones will take time.\u201d And he hated that for a million reasons, too. His own impatience. His concern that he and Liam couldn\u2019t get along indefinitely. Mostly, he hated to see her so miserable and lost. Nor could he risk losing her. Granted, she wouldn\u2019t take Juliet\u2019s way out, but she\u2019d proven that she would pick up and leave if driven to flee.</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Liam agreed. \u201cOne of the first patterns I want to break is her bloody bad habit of trying to misdirect with sex.\u201d</p><p>Hammer heard Liam\u2019s words, but he better fucking not have heard them right. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m displeased with Raine, her first instinct is to lose her clothes and rub against me. I hate to admit how often I let her distract me before I realized what she\u2019d done.\u201d He rubbed at the back of his neck with a wry grin. \u201cShe\u2019s really damn good at it, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Hammer grabbed the mostly empty bottle of tequila from the bar and zinged it across the room. The violence of the shattering glass startled Liam\u2014but it didn\u2019t do a damn thing to improve his mood.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your bloody mind?\u201d Liam stared at him like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cOr do you just like to break things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine uses sex as a distraction? I heard that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Liam frowned. \u201cCalm down. We\u2019ll deal with it and anything else she throws at us. She won\u2019t be allowed to instigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right she won\u2019t be. That behavior will fucking stop. Immediately. The first time she tries, I\u2019m going to put her over my knee and beat the hell out of her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so bent over this? It\u2019s not a major issue. We\u2019re aware and we\u2019ll deal with it. But your hot button isn\u2019t her problem.\u201d</p><p>Hammer jumped off his barstool. \u201cIt\u2019s my problem, your problem, and her damn problem, too. That kind of distraction is just one of the ways Juliet hid from me. She avoided telling me how she felt about anything by sidetracking me on her knees. I was stupid and selfish enough to let her. By god, I won\u2019t let Raine do that. Why do you think I push her so hard when I want an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be watchful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not, she\u2019ll slip through our fingers.\u201d</p><p>Juliet had taught him a valuable lesson he couldn\u2019t fail to heed. If he did, her death would mean nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo...we\u2019ll begin tomorrow morning?\u201d Hammer prodded. \u201cWe can clean out the liquor supply room and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s too comfortable here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that she returned to Shadows because she wanted to be in her element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it would be easier on her, yes.\u201d Liam sent him a weighty stare. \u201cNone of this should be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If it is, she won\u2019t learn anything. Too many familiar people and places here to hide behind. We can\u2019t have her dodging us instead of doing the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. I think we should drive her up to my lodge in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not the house you bought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plumbing work and painting going on. We want to be alone with her, not surrounded by contractors. Besides, at the lodge there\u2019ll be no taxis to shuttle her back to the city if she gets the urge to run away. And I\u2019ve got the perfect room there to suit our needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Hammer urged, seeing the benefit of keeping Raine off-balance.</p><p>\u201cThough she\u2019s been to the lodge before, the surroundings aren\u2019t nearly as familiar to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has?\u201d</p><p>Liam sent him a sheepish grin. \u201cIt\u2019s where I brought her when I took her from Shadows.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s where the son of a bitch had spirited her away after she\u2019d spent that mind-blowing night in his bed? He\u2019d wondered more than once.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quiet there?\u201d Hammer asked.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecluded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely.\u201d Liam smirked.</p><p>\u201cThen it sounds ideal. We\u2019ll talk to her early, then. If she chooses us, we\u2019ll pack her up and head out at dawn, before the traffic gets bad. I\u2019ll call a few trusted club members to see if they can watch the place for a few days. But before we do any of that, I think we should agree on exactly how we\u2019ll get her to learn these three lessons.\u201d</p><p>Liam flashed a mischievous smile. \u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The following morning, Raine woke to a warm hand cupping her shoulder and a deep voice in her ear. A familiar scent wrapped around her, instantly transporting her back to happier times and comfort. Love. Liam.</p><p>With a lazy smile, she rolled over, bleary-eyed, and faced him. Hammer stood at his side. Both men wore tense expressions.</p><p>The jolt of surprise shoved away her vestiges of sleep. Raine blinked. Why were they here and dressed before a single ray of sun had brightened her room? And why were they together, watching her?</p><p>Pulling her blankets to her chin, she pushed her hair from her face and sat up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, love,\u201d Liam assured. \u201cWe came to tell you first that we\u2019re glad you decided to come home. I know you were upset when you left.\u201d</p><p>And they didn\u2019t seem angry that she\u2019d fled. They had every right to be. Instead, they looked resigned. No, decisive. Their odd demeanor confused her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have you home, precious. Now, on your feet.\u201d She couldn\u2019t miss the command in Hammer\u2019s voice.</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t trying to tear his head off for that? Or objecting to his dominance? She stared at the pair of them, blinking.</p><p>\u201cRaine?\u201d Liam prodded. \u201cHammer asked you to do something. Acknowledge him and obey.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? She frowned, Liam\u2019s words not fully computing. But the two of them were looking at her with the same expectant expression and standing side by side. Together.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sir.\u201d Tossing the covers back slowly, she climbed from the bed. They stepped closer, crowding her against the edge of the mattress. She trembled. \u201cDid you wake me up to say that you found a Domme for me?\u201d</p><p>Neither answered. Their silence made her nervous. She looked up to find them exchanging a glance. If she didn\u2019t know better, Raine would swear they were in on some conspiracy together.</p><p>\u201cWe woke you to tell you that we discussed your request at length last night,\u201d Liam finally began. \u201cWe agree that you need to learn\u2014a great deal, in fact.\u201d</p><p>She would have loved being a fly on the wall for that conversation. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve asked for a Domme, and we\u2019re willing to grant you one.\u201d As a bittersweet relief began to slide through her, Hammer went on, his stare unwavering. \u201cBut we have another possibility for you to consider.\u201d</p><p>A silent tension gripped them both and squeezed her lungs. Whatever they had on their minds meant something to them. They wanted her to say yes. Their impatience must be the reason they\u2019d woken her up so damn early.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get into the specifics in a moment. Before we do, we have a few questions to determine if this alternate option is right for you.\u201d Hammer glanced at Liam like he waited for the other man to begin the next part of this rehearsed speech.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you\u2019ll want someone who will devote their time and knowledge to you. Yes?\u201d Liam prodded her with a watchful stare.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d make more progress that way,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019d like her to be understanding and compassionate. Like Mistress Hillary, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, she\u2019s out of town for the next two months.\u201d Hammer didn\u2019t look at all unhappy about that. \u201cBut let\u2019s not talk about any certain individual until we\u2019ve identified all your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t as easy as plucking a name out of a hat, love,\u201d Liam chided. \u201cThere should be a special bond between Dominant and submissive. If you don\u2019t click with the first choice, you\u2019ll soon be back to square one. So you should choose cautiously, agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sirs.\u201d They were right. If she gave her all to the wrong Domme, then had to start over with someone new, it would waste time and cause her frustration. At the thought of opening herself up to a stranger, a sludgy lump of vulnerability caught in her chest.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ll want someone you feel comfortable with.\u201d Hammer raised a brow at her as if daring her to contradict him. \u201cA top you can talk to, who understands you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s one reason I asked Beck, but he said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeck?\u201d Liam bit out.</p><p>Raine raised her chin and nodded. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s not a stranger and he helped me realize that I needed to come home and start fixing myself.\u201d</p><p>Hammer looked almost smug now. \u201cYou do, but the Dominant who trains you will inevitably claim a piece of your heart. Beck can\u2019t do that. And you won\u2019t learn any other way. It\u2019s how you\u2019re built.\u201d</p><p>Raine sighed. She hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but he was probably right. Who did that leave her?</p><p>She frowned as suspicions took shape. \u201cI expect a deep rapport would grow in time. Where are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is the key word.\u201d Liam\u2019s lips curled up in a self-assured smile. \u201cYou\u2019d be starting at square one with a stranger. It could take weeks, or even months, to establish the sort of trust necessary for your journey, assuming it\u2019s a good fit at all.\u201d</p><p>Suspicions dive-bombed her brain now. He and Liam had some shit up their sleeves. Neither of them ever did a damn thing without some lesson or expectation attached.</p><p>\u201cOf course, trust will be critical.\u201d Raine wedged enough space between them and her to cross her arms over her chest. She tapped her toe. \u201cEverything you\u2019re saying is common sense. So what\u2019s this other option you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Would Liam take her back? Or did Hammer mean to step in? Because this definitely had something to do with one\u2014or both\u2014of them.</p><p>Liam leaned in before delving deep into her eyes. \u201cIf you want to learn about opening yourself to someone and giving your submission, no one knows you better or wants you to grow more than me and Hammer. Give yourself over to us. We\u2019ll guide you down your path.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, Raine just stared. Had she heard that right? \u201cYou two? Together? Is that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see us laughing?\u201d Hammer stared disapprovingly with piercing eyes.</p><p>They\u2019d offered her her wildest, most impossible desire. Sadly, it would probably end in someone\u2019s murder. And it would be her fault.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking insane. It\u2019ll never work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like that language, Raine.\u201d Liam\u2019s brows slashed in disapproval.</p><p>She was completely stunned, and he wanted to worry about her cursing? \u201cThe three of us together are a time bomb. It won\u2019t take long to explode, and we\u2019ll all get hurt. I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t open myself up when I\u2019m going to spend at least half my time waiting for you two to come to blows. I\u2019d love to say yes, more than anything.\u201d That admission would probably put Liam on edge or spur Hammer\u2019s temper\u2014and they\u2019d start fighting any second. \u201cBut it\u2019s a fantasy, like world peace.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, neither one of them lost their cool. In fact, they didn\u2019t seem ruffled at all to hear that she wanted them both. Whoa.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fantasy, love. It\u2019s what we\u2019re offering you. And before you answer, listen to what we have to say.\u201d</p><p>Their whole conversation this morning had been laced with \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d Had running off been a wake-up call for them? Or had Seth bashed their heads together until they\u2019d decided to play nice?</p><p>Liam and Hammer weren\u2019t perfect, but they usually had her best interests at heart. She owed it to them to at least listen because she could only imagine what sort of compromise they\u2019d ironed out to even make her this offer together. And it was so enticing. Raine tried to ignore the rush of heat thrumming in her blood and think logically.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m glad you two are speaking again. I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve put our differences aside to help you.\u201d Hammer cupped his chin in a thoughtful gesture. Damn if she didn\u2019t want him to reach out and touch her. \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to devote our time to you. I can safely say there aren\u2019t any Dominants at the club who, combined, have more experience than us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, we want you to have the best instruction available. Mistress Hillary can\u2019t provide you half the understanding and compassion we will,\u201d Liam added gently but firmly.</p><p>Raine couldn\u2019t deny how much she\u2019d missed the affection he showered on her. Even Hammer never failed to show his caring\u2014in his own silent way.</p><p>And the thought of having them both made her entire body light up like a Fourth-of-July spectacle.</p><p>Maybe they had really thought about this outlandish scheme. They were doing their damnedest to persuade her to accept. But no matter how badly she wanted to throw caution to the wind, doubts still crowded her mind.</p><p>\u201cWe already know your secrets.\u201d A hint of a smile curled across Hammer\u2019s lips. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue that we know what makes you tick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already established a bond with us.\u201d Without missing a beat, Liam\u2019s words fell in behind Hammer\u2019s. \u201cNo one understands you better than we do. Let go of your fears and put yourself in our hands. Let us take you on the journey.\u201d</p><p>His sincerity tugged at her heart. God, she wanted to say yes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to give you what you asked for.\u201d Hammer frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed your mind, have you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re completely united on this,\u201d Liam added. \u201cWe know you\u2019re worried we\u2019ll start arguing and tossing fists, but it won\u2019t happen, love. Tell me, is there another reason you\u2019re hesitating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge decision,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI need time to think.\u201d</p><p>But about what? Aside from their quarreling, it would be heaven having the two men she loved molding her. Hell, it would be a dream come true.</p><p>Hammer reached out and pulled her close to his chest, his warm breath caressing the shell of her ear. She felt herself melt.</p><p>\u201cDo you really need time to think about being the center of our world, precious?\u201d he challenged in a low, hungry voice.</p><p>Liam pressed in behind her, and his lips skimmed a path up her neck. \u201cOpen up and let us in. We won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>A quiver of need slammed down her spine. She had no trouble envisioning what it would feel like to be at their mercy. Desire hummed. Pressed between them, the fantasy that had spun through her head for weeks paled in comparison to the decadent reality. She sucked in a ragged breath.</p><p>They were trying to put aside their differences for her. No way to think otherwise or overlook that fact. They were giving her the chance to grow. Hell, the chance of a lifetime.</p><p>Her fantasy come true.</p><p>\u201cI accept\u2014on one condition.\u201d Negotiation was part and parcel of BDSM. No way was she entering into this without them hearing her concerns.</p><p>Liam eased back from behind her before sidling next to Hammer. Shoulder to shoulder, the two most important men in her life stared down at her, waiting.</p><p>Hammer slowly released her. \u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two have to get along. The minute there\u2019s any arguing, name calling, backbiting, jealous rants, or strife of any kind, I\u2019m done. I mean it. I refuse to come between you two again.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a glance, then Liam shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Hammer sent her a sharp nod.</p><p>\u201cOur disagreements are over,\u201d Liam vowed.</p><p>She wanted it to be true. Whether they could make that stick remained to be seen, but short of calling them liars, Raine had to believe them. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re clear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal, love,\u201d Liam assured.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now you\u2019ll hear our terms.\u201d Hammer nodded. \u201cYou will not question the methods we use to help you achieve submission,\u201d Hammer warned in his deep, growling Dom voice. If the man knew what that did to her girl parts, she\u2019d be toast. \u201cThey will not always be easy, but they will be effective.\u201d</p><p>Liam picked up. \u201cYou will never doubt that we want anything but the best for you. And every time you curse, we\u2019ll add it to your list of infractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour little f-bomb has been duly noted.\u201d Hammer glared. \u201cYou will also never try to pit one of us against the other. Ever. Your training starts...\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cNow. Raise your hand if you have any questions or do not understand our terms.\u201d</p> <p>Their dual expressions of determination told her they were deadly serious. Though she couldn\u2019t help but worry their idea was doomed to fail, she was so damn touched.</p><p>\u201cNo, I understand.\u201d</p><p>This was really going to happen. God, she didn\u2019t know if she should be terrified or thrilled. More than a little of both swirled inside her.</p><p>\u201cGood. Shower now. We will pack your bag. I\u2019ll come collect any toiletries you\u2019d like to take and give you additional instructions then.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at Liam. This wasn\u2019t the Dom she knew. She\u2019d expected this sort of strict control from Hammer. But right now, Liam was all demand and no cajoling. It was sexy. Raine bowed her head for a moment, trying to wrap her thoughts around this morning\u2019s events. But there was only one answer in her heart. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest some action,\u201d Liam urged. \u201cIf you dawdle, we\u2019ll add that to your list of infractions, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guarantee you won\u2019t like it,\u201d Hammer added.</p><p>Then in unison, they turned toward the door.</p><p>That was the end of the conversation in their minds? \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>They turned back, Liam with a dark brow raised in warning, Hammer with an impatient stare.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you packing me a suitcase? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Time\u2019s a wasting, Raine. I suggest you move.\u201d</p><p>Then they walked out. With a quiet click, the door shut behind them.</p><p>Raine shut off the water, anxiety humming through her veins. Liam\u2019s badass Dom mode earlier had been arousing as hell, but she\u2019d found herself more than a bit intimidated. He\u2019d instructed her to get herself ready quickly, but for what? All the uncertainty zipping through her was making her damn near dizzy.</p><p>Shoving the shower curtain aside, she shrieked, startled to find Liam standing before her with her towel draped over his arm. His stare raked her possessively, as though he meant to devour her in one big bite. Her nipples pebbled. Heat erupted deep in her womb. Just one look from the man and she was aching. This imposing side of him only served to make her more nervous about the surprising scheme he and Hammer had cooked up.</p><p>After last night, Raine had no doubt that Liam was mad\u2014and hurt\u2014that she\u2019d run away. She adored his sweet side. His tender, nurturing compassion made her turn all gooey. But now he\u2019d reverted to the reserved control he\u2019d used with her at the lodge. It was effective and disquieting.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d His voice was thick as he opened the towel, inviting her into his arms.</p><p>A flutter of excitement scurried up her spine. Oh, she\u2019d missed his warm embrace. Fighting the need to surge into his arms, she tiptoed closer. He enveloped her against him. Closing her eyes, she inhaled his spicy, familiar scent. She loved it every bit as much as she loved him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how good it feels to hold you again.\u201d His silky Irish lilt slid over her like warm honey. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled deeper. She could feel every hard inch of his body pressed against hers as he squeezed her tight. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, he dislodged the clip in her hair and feathered his fingers to loosen the strands. All the while he stared down at her, not uttering a word. As he captured her with his gaze, the worries that had plagued her for the past few days faded into the background. But her guilt and insecurities still niggled her, seeping past the comfort of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her unguarded question slipped out before she could curb it.</p><p>\u201cWhy what, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this for me after the way I left you? When you removed my collar, I panicked. I ran. I-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think you wanted me anymore.\u201d She hadn\u2019t planned to open up and show him her vulnerabilities. Now that she had, Raine searched his eyes, desperate to know what he thought, felt. His unreadable expression left her feeling more exposed than her nudity.</p><p>At Beck\u2019s condo, she\u2019d believed that she\u2019d cried all she could, but new, hot tears threatened, proving Liam owned something deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cShh. There now, love. Of course I want you. I never stopped.\u201d He stepped back and pulled her down with him as he sat on the toilet lid. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you in the ways I know you need. This isn\u2019t about me; it\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>Raine curled up, sliding her arms around his steely shoulders as he placed a sweet kiss on her forehead. She sank into his embrace with a sigh. Being here felt so right.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you last night,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou had every right to.\u201d</p><p>Liam gently rocked her, smoothing her hair back from her face. \u201cYou surprised me with your request. Just know that I love you. I\u2019d do anything for you. Well, except watch you give your submission to a Domme.\u201d</p><p>Despite her anxiety, she laughed. So gentle, so loving...so Liam.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cStop your worrying and show me that you missed me.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden shyness, she leaned up and pressed her lips to his, feeling small and treasured in his arms. Liam moaned as he took her lips with a fierce tenderness that made her toes curl and her body dissolve with arousal. She squirmed, but he held her in place with firm fingers on her nape. With his free hand, he gripped her hip and pulled her tighter against him.</p><p>He was like a drug shooting straight into her veins, and the surge of \u201cinstant Liam\u201d made her heart thump wildly. God, how she\u2019d missed him. Missed this.</p><p>Their tongues tangled. A moan of desire bubbled and rolled up from her throat. Though the days she\u2019d spent apart from him were painful and empty, they\u2019d been healing, too. And coming back to him\u2014to the comforting fire he roused\u2014centered her.</p><p>Easing back, she saw a gratified smile sparkle all the way to Liam\u2019s eyes. Then he plucked her from his lap, tore away her towel, and swatted her bare ass.</p><p>\u201cNow get a move on. We\u2019re waiting.\u201d With a wicked grin full of promise, he turned. \u201cBring me your toiletries after you\u2019re dressed. And make sure you wear a skirt. Something short.\u201d</p><p>With that, Liam left the bathroom.</p><p>Nerves jumping, Raine dashed to her closet and dressed, then applied some tinted moisturizer and lip gloss. Pausing to look in the mirror, she noticed her lips were swollen from his kiss. All the energy buzzing inside her merged with the joy she felt at being with him again.</p><p>As she stepped back into her room, she noticed Liam sitting patiently on her bed. An empty suitcase lay open beside him. He stood and accepted the items she held out in offering. After unloading them into the bag, he led her to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish packing for you, love. Right now, it\u2019s time to eat breakfast. Hammer is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Raine\u2019s eyes widened. Liam was voluntarily sending her to Hammer? Yes, they\u2019d both agreed to be her Doms, but everything seemed surreal.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s waiting in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>That made Raine\u2019s heart stutter again. Lord, if Hammer was cooking, she hoped he was preparing dry cereal. Anything more complicated could be catastrophic. Absently, she kissed Liam, then darted out of the room, almost dreading what she\u2019d find. Hammer had proven he could set the kitchen on fire.</p><p>As she scurried down the hall, Raine felt a tingle roll through her and glanced back to see Liam watching, his seductive stare promising more than a kiss\u2014soon.</p><p>As she rounded the doorway to the kitchen, Hammer stood at the stove, cursing as he hissed and shook a splatter of hot bacon grease from his hand. Raine bit her lip, trying not to laugh.</p><p>Remembering the last time he\u2019d attempted to cook, her thoughts wandered years back, to the third morning she\u2019d awakened at Shadows. The scream of a smoke alarm had sent her racing down the hall, panicked that the entire building was going up in flames. What she\u2019d found instead was the sharply perceptive man who had taken her in. He fanned a dish towel at the shrieking alarm. Flames flickered behind the glass window of the oven as more noxious smoke rolled from its door.</p><p>With a gasp, Raine had raced around the room, turning off the oven and searching numerous cabinets until she found a box of baking soda. Yanking the door open, she dumped the powder over the flames, snuffing out the fire from the frosting-laden Danishes he\u2019d tried to broil.</p><p>Hammer, despite seeming so tall and intimidating, had given her a smile of pride. \u201cThank you, precious.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known why at the time, but her heart had soared and her stomach had flipped over completely.</p><p>Her heart nearly melted in from her chest now as she watched him attempt to cook for her again. Raine hoped that meant he was on the road to forgiving her. She sure hadn\u2019t thought he would be last night when he\u2019d refused to speak to her. Hammer cutting her cold would be like losing a limb. This morning, she still wasn\u2019t exactly sure where she stood. They weren\u2019t strictly friends. But they weren\u2019t exactly lovers, either. Like Liam, he wanted to help her. That had to mean something.</p><p>She wondered if he knew that Liam had pulled her naked into his lap minutes ago and kissed her. Or if he\u2019d care. Would Hammer kiss her, too? Do more? Or had the only way he and Liam been able to stop arguing and make her this offer was to take sex off the table?</p><p>Damn, she should have asked what boundaries they\u2019d set for themselves before she\u2019d agreed to let them guide her. But she intended to ask as soon as she had them alone again.</p><p>Easing toward the stove, she placed her hand over his and reached for the fork in his grasp, looking up into his face. For recognition. For approval. Would he push her away or welcome her?</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take over?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cIt would be safer for us all. Here.\u201d He handed her the fork with a grin.</p><p>Instantly, that set her at ease. She took over at the stove with a wistful smile. \u201cRemember the last time you tried to set the place on fire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might take that for sass, precious.\u201d</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t, and his teasing tone made that obvious. She chuckled as she nudged his shoulder to move him away from her stove. \u201cI\u2019ve got this. Grab yourself a cup of coffee and relax.\u201d</p><p>Skewing up one side of his mouth, Hammer lifted the coffeepot from the counter. \u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>He tipped the pot over, revealing that it was empty, and sent her a hopeful smile, thrusting it toward her.</p> <p>She giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re so helpless.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she stepped around him and filled the pot. She could feel his eyes watching her every move.</p><p>\u201cNot at everything,\u201d Hammer refuted in a rough drawl. \u201cBut you know that.\u201d</p><p>Raine remembered. Every moment of the night she\u2019d spent in his bed was seared in her memory.</p><p>\u201cLike barking out orders and growling?\u201d she teased to match his mood.</p> <p>Suddenly, his smile disappeared. Hammer\u2019s commanding Dom face took its place.</p><p>Uh-oh. Fun time is over.</p><p>\u201cI have one question for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Raine held her breath anxiously. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure this is what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Despite her earlier reservations, she\u2019d never been more serious about anything in her life. The past was where it belonged, behind her. The present was winding itself before her, albeit on a unexpected path. The future...who knew? But she refused to give up on tomorrow simply because it scared her.</p> <p>She lifted her chin with conviction. \u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you mean that.\u201d Hammer\u2019s stare held hers hostage for a long, silent moment.</p><p>Then his attention drifted toward the coffeepot, and he sighed.</p><p>So big and bad...until he had no coffee. She grinned. \u201cIt will be ready soon. Patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself,\u201d Hammer warned with an arch of his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, your lily white backside is going to be in our hands soon.\u201d</p><p>Their broad, strong hands. And the visual of them all over her blasted through her brain\u2014of them stripping off her clothes with those hands, binding her to their bed, dragging their lips across her skin, driving their cocks deep inside her, pounding, claiming, overwhelming... God, she hoped they\u2019d give her that chance.</p><p>The room felt hot, or maybe it was just her cheeks. Biting back a moan, she zipped her gaze down to the bacon sizzling in the pan, hoping Hammer couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. Raine ached for something that might never happen, and she had to accept that. Or did she? The question that had haunted her earlier roared back with force. They\u2019d said they would both top her...but what exactly would that entail?</p><p>Raine gathered up her courage and changed the subject. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to bury the hatchet with Liam and help me?\u201d</p><p>Hammer moved in behind her, his warm breath caressing her ear. He pressed every hard inch of his body against her back, and his cock prodded her backside. No mistaking that he wanted her. Though she tried not to shiver, his closeness made that an impossible feat. He wrapped his big hands around her hips in a commanding hold and pressed into her. Raine gasped and melted into him. Desire flashed over her skin. God, he felt so good.</p><p>She wanted more\u2014of both of them.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re worth it, precious. You\u2019ve asked for help, and no one on the goddamn planet is going to lead you down your path except us.\u201d</p><p>Twisting from his hold, she turned and met his solemn stare. \u201cBut why? I mean, I know why Liam wants to guide me. He says he\u2019s in love with me. But you...you\u2019ve already gone above and beyond taking care of me for years. I would have thought that you\u2019d be happy to cut me loose and let Liam teach me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Resolution stamped across his face an instant before Hammer slid a hand around her back and skimmed it up her spine. Then he gripped his fist in her hair and tilted her head back, his stare intent. He meant to get some message across to her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think, whatever has happened in the past, you belonged with me the minute you walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>Hammer swooped down, his lips capturing hers. Impassioned. Reverent. The kiss branded her with fire...and something almost desperate. She\u2019d never felt him so ardently gentle. Hell, she\u2019d never known he was capable of it.</p><p>Beneath her tank top, her nipples drew up hard and ached as every muscle in her body went soft. The potent claim of his mouth soon had her dropping the fork to grab his shirt in her fists with a sigh.</p><p>Hammer poured himself into this one euphoric kiss. It held all the markings of a silent confession, and Raine wondered if she were imagining this touch to be Hammer\u2019s nonverbal proclamation of love. Was that even possible? Or was he simply trying to provide caring so she\u2019d let him \u201cfix\u201d her? After he had, would he slam the door shut between them again?</p><p>Immersed in his raw emotion, Raine stopped trying to answer the questions swirling in her head and gave herself over. She lost herself in his kiss, pouring out all the longing she\u2019d barely had the opportunity to release in six years.</p><p>Hammer growled in approval. She savored each exalted second until he slowly pulled away. Still, he allowed his lips to linger on hers for another bittersweet moment.</p><p>Then she jerked away. Could she return his affection without Liam\u2019s permission? Should she have kissed Liam without consulting Hammer? What were the rules of their new partnership?</p><p>As if he could peer into her soul, as he so often had, he sent her a reassuring smile and took her hand, pressing a delicate kiss in the center of her palm.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine, precious. Finish fixing breakfast. Then we\u2019ll start fixing you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>As the sun hid just below the horizon, Liam led Raine outside toward his SUV, with her hand tucked in his. Hammer trailed close behind, his palm resting at the small of her back. The guys were so quiet. Tension hovered in the air. Now wasn\u2019t the time to ask questions\u2014but she wanted to.</p><p>Liam opened the back door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Raine frowned. Two men occupied the front seat. Were they letting someone else take her somewhere? That didn\u2019t sound like Liam and Hammer at all. She sent Liam a questioning gaze, then bent to see who sat in the car.</p><p>Beck swiveled in the driver\u2019s seat and grinned. \u201cHop in, princess. Your chariot awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going...wherever it is we\u2019re going?\u201d she blurted. \u201cAren\u2019t you on call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer, you want to teach her some manners?\u201d Beck suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d Liam swatted her ass.</p><p>She yelped, then glared at him. \u201cIt was just a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a nosy one,\u201d Hammer said archly, digging into his pocket. \u201cIf you can\u2019t mute your curiosity, I\u2019ll be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>He dangled a ball gag in her face. Raine\u2019s eyes widened. She shook her head.</p><p>Seth roared with laughter. \u201cThis is going to be so entertaining.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little huff and sent Seth a stare that let him know he wasn\u2019t helping one bit. He just laughed more.</p><p>With her butt still stinging, Raine jumped into the back, as far from Hammer\u2019s ball gag as possible. Liam stopped her from sliding past the middle when he eased into the back seat on the driver\u2019s side. Hammer entered on the passenger\u2019s side and shut the door, sandwiching her between them. She still hadn\u2019t recovered from Liam\u2019s kiss in the bathroom or Hammer\u2019s in the kitchen. Now they pressed in tightly on either side of her. As Beck eased out of the parking lot and headed for the freeway, her heart raced. Perspiration dampened the skin between her breasts.</p><p>She had no idea where they were going. But with Hammer and Liam pressing their body heat into her, she prayed the drive wouldn\u2019t be far. She sensed their gazes straying toward her, could feel their hunger. They even smelled fantastic. Damn! Raine closed her eyes and squirmed, looking for some space. There wasn\u2019t any. Her pussy clenched.</p><p>Everyone relaxed into their seats, and Beck sipped coffee from a big travel mug. Raine held in a curse. She had a hunch this wasn\u2019t going to be a short trip.</p><p>To her left, Liam planted a hand on her bare thigh, just above her knee. She tensed and blinked up at him. It wasn\u2019t an overtly sexual caress, but he still made her heart race. She shifted and tried to cross her legs.</p><p>\u201cNone of that, love.\u201d Liam stayed her, tightening his fingers on her.</p><p>\u201cYou never cross your legs around us,\u201d Hammer growled in her ear.</p><p>Their deep voices caressed her. Raine pictured her legs open and them touching her intimately, possessively. A flash of arousal burned an electric supercharge hot through her veins. Blood rushed to her nipples, swelled her folds. God, she couldn\u2019t breathe. Dizziness swamped her head.</p><p>Before she could recover, Hammer took her hand and slung her wrist over his thigh. His thumb whispered across her forearm in slow, sensual circles. No mistaking the heat rising from his crotch, maybe an inch under her palm.</p><p>And Liam didn\u2019t seem to care. What the hell was going on here? He and Hammer were actually touching her simultaneously. Yes, they\u2019d sworn to shelve the animosity between them and operate as one to help her, but Raine hadn\u2019t entirely believed it. And they surely hadn\u2019t discussed sex. Now, with her body on fire, need overtaking her and their hands on her, she felt more confused than ever.</p><p>Seth turned on the radio. The band coming through the speakers began singing about their sex being on fire. Yeah, she could relate. The man turned to her and grinned.</p><p>Asshole, she mouthed.</p><p>His smile disappeared. \u201cDid you say something, Raine?\u201d</p><p>Oops, he wasn\u2019t in the teasing mood. Traitor. She shook her head.</p><p>Beck chuckled and caught her glance in the rearview mirror. She\u2019d smack him upside the head for being an asshole too if she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d get in more trouble for it.</p><p>\u201cProblem, Seth?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Between the two men, she tensed and sent Seth a pleading glance.</p><p>\u201cIf there is, I\u2019ve got a ball gag and nipple clamps.\u201d Hammer patted his pocket. \u201cJust say the word.\u201d</p><p>Raine zipped a stare over to him. Was he trying to goad Liam\u2019s temper? Or just drive her over the edge of desire? God, she\u2019d been dropped into the Twilight Zone.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and closed her eyes. Find your damn Zen.</p><p>Yeah, that shit wasn\u2019t working. And it wasn\u2019t even seven a.m. yet.</p><p>\u201cNo problem so far,\u201d Seth finally said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a cup of Raine\u2019s coffee. I get the big deal now. I\u2019m feeling generous...at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Kings of Leon were still screaming about their sex, and she sang along in her head, hoping it would distract her. It worked until Liam sidled even closer, his thigh plastered against hers. Hammer turned to ask Liam if he had enough room...and breathed on her neck.</p><p>Raine bit back a moan. How much more sensual overload could she take? As Beck had pointed out back at his condo, BDSM wasn\u2019t about sex. But Hammer and Liam sure were making it hard for her to think about much else.</p><p>The sun began to spill into the car as Liam\u2019s hand inched up her thigh. Every cell in her body held a collective breath, along with her, just waiting...</p><p>If she slid down and tried to get Liam\u2019s hand closer to her aching clit, would he notice? Yes, and he\u2019d never give her what she wanted. At this point, she suspected Hammer would back him up, too.</p><p>She dared a peek at Liam. He stared straight ahead, but wore a smug little smile. Damn it, he knew exactly what he was doing to her.</p><p>His fingers crawled up her thigh again, this time taking her skirt with him an inch or two. A little gasp slipped past her lips as her clit began to throb, begging for his attention.</p><p>On her right, tingles screamed up her arm with every little circle Hammer drew on her wrist. She could imagine that pattern around her nipples before he drew them into his mouth, sucking, laving, nipping. She blew out a shaking breath. That visual wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>The temperature in the car rose. All she wanted to do was arch to Liam and Hammer, straddle one or the other\u2014or both\u2014and plead with them to fuck her.</p><p>As the song finally wound to its screeching conclusion, the singer screamed that he was consumed by what was about to transpire. She wished to hell something would transpire here, too. If it didn\u2019t soon, she might lose her damn mind.</p><p>\u201cSeth, can you, um...turn the heater down?\u201d she managed to choke out.</p><p>\u201cGee, I think it\u2019s really comfortable.\u201d Beck shrugged. \u201cYou hot or something, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fine, too.\u201d Seth turned to her. As his stare fell to Liam\u2019s hand on her thigh, a grin crawled across his face. \u201cBut the sun is coming up. It\u2019ll warm the car up more, so maybe we should. She\u2019s looking really flushed.\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t so turned on, she\u2019d be totally embarrassed. And Seth was enjoying her discomfort immensely. She wanted to punch him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit chilly back here,\u201d Liam drawled. \u201cBut if you\u2019re hot, you could take off your sweater, love.\u201d He tugged on the edge of her cardigan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So that she\u2019d be wearing nothing but a tank top and a very short skirt? \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Hammer squeezed her fingers. \u201cRemove the sweater.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a long-suffering sigh. They were determined to expose her for reasons unknown. Beck and Seth were getting a huge kick out of seeing her all flustered, but she didn\u2019t imagine Liam and Hammer considered this a joke. They had to be loving the ego stroke of knowing they aroused her. The bigger question was, why did being on display while the guys touched her turn her on?</p><p>Raine was loath to part with her sweater, but Hammer had given her a direct command, and she\u2019d agreed to submit. So she struggled out of the little red button-down garment and handed it to Liam. She stifled the urge to ask him if he was happy now\u2014barely.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Liam draped her sweater over his knee with a smile, then put his hand on her thigh again, higher this time.</p><p>\u201cAnd now your underwear,\u201d Hammer demanded in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped at him.</p><p>Hammer glowered back. \u201cDid you not hear what I said, Raine?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. She blinked at him. A glance around the car told her everyone waited, watched. As much as this made Raine uncomfortable, every nerve ending in her body leapt with life and need.</p><p>\u201cI heard, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a stern scowl. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait.\u201d</p><p>God, she must be crazy. Her insides jittered. Her pussy clenched. And damn if his words alone didn\u2019t make her soaking wet.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells really sweet,\u201d Seth commented, almost in passing.</p><p>\u201cYeah. My mouth is watering.\u201d Beck smacked his lips loudly. Then he shot her a leering grin from the front seat.</p><p>This was not happening.</p><p>Raine closed her eyes for a moment and forced in a calming breath. Liam\u2019s fingers slid up her knee again, playing along her inner thigh. And Hammer still stared, expectant and impatient.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling,\u201d Liam murmured, sliding his hand completely under her skirt. His fingers passed over her clit, pressing for an electric moment before they curled around the waistband and tugged. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Wow, thanks so much.</p><p>\u201cLift up,\u201d Hammer demanded, grasping the other side of the waistband.</p><p>Together, they tugged down, and off the panties came. Then even she could smell how wet she\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suddenly hungry,\u201d Seth commented.</p><p>Liam gripped her panties with a dark, satisfied smile. \u201cFind your own bloody meal.\u201d</p><p>Raine wondered if she could die from chagrin...and unfulfilled need. Quick glances at the men on either side showed hard cocks straining against their slacks. They were enjoying winding her up and exerting their control. Why did she like it so damn much, too?</p> <p>She dug her nails into her palms and pressed her lips together tightly. Otherwise, she\u2019d give into the temptation to ask them the point of this little exercise. If she did, Hammer would surely drag out the ball gag, nipple clamps, and who knew what else was in his pockets. If she had to bite her tongue off, she\u2019d shut up.</p><p>Beside her, Liam lifted her panties to his nose and inhaled deeply. As she watched, her eyes widened. Hammer\u2019s wicked laugh rumbled in her ear. Liam reached across her body and brushed her sensitive nipples, causing her to moan, as he handed her undergarment to Macen.</p><p>\u201cProblem, precious?\u201d Hammer challenged, lifting the panties to his nose, then closing his eyes as if savoring her scent.</p><p>Shit! She stared straight out the windshield. \u201cNone, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He sniffed again.</p><p>Liam glided his fingers to her inner thigh once more. \u201cYou smell divine, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely delicious,\u201d Hammer murmured into her ear, then passed the panties back to Liam.</p><p>Could a girl self-combust from sexual frustration?</p><p>Beck worked his way through the thickening rush-hour traffic, but she had no idea where they were going. At the moment, she almost didn\u2019t care. If it contained a bed big enough for these two men to put her out of her misery, she\u2019d be thrilled as hell. If not, she hoped for some privacy soon so she could take the edge off this need.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you say it would take to get there?\u201d Beck asked from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably need to stop for gas if it\u2019s more than another eighty miles.\u201d</p><p>Hammer leaned forward and clapped Beck on the shoulder. \u201cPlan to, man. With traffic, I\u2019m expecting this to take...three or four hours.\u201d He swiveled a stare back at her. \u201cBut don\u2019t rush. We\u2019re in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>At just past noon, they arrived at the lodge. Liam breathed a sigh of relief. Beck had taken Hammer at his word and hadn\u2019t rushed the drive a bit. During those five hours, he and Macen had never stopped touching Raine\u2014but they also hadn\u2019t stimulated any part of her that would grant orgasm. They\u2019d controlled her\u2014every moment, every mile\u2014and it had been heady. The sweet, salty scent of her arousal had filled the car and swirled in Liam\u2019s head, damn near making him drunk. He\u2019d barely managed to restrain himself from pulling her onto his lap, burrowing his rigid cock\u2014hell, his bloody soul\u2014into her completely, then listening to her scream for him as he came like a fucking volcano.</p><p>As much as Raine had to learn, Liam wasn\u2019t sure how long it would be before he could indulge in any of that.</p><p>Beck stopped the car, and Liam opened the door, turning to help Raine out. She emerged into the brisk afternoon looking flushed and unsteady and completely off-kilter\u2014exactly the way they wanted her. This Raine couldn\u2019t possibly be thinking about ways to dodge him or Hammer, much less scurry behind her walls.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right, love?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d But her voice shook. Her breathing wasn\u2019t quite under control.</p><p>Taking Raine by the hand, he repressed a smile and led her toward the lodge. Approaching her other side from the vehicle, Hammer claimed her free hand. The scent of her skin lingered on Liam\u2019s clothes and in the air. He wanted to hoard that sweetness for himself. But he no longer had the luxury of being her only Dom. For this \u201cfixing\u201d to work, everything had to be about Raine. And the simple but irritating truth was, she needed Hammer, too.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy to watch his old friend touch her, but Liam couldn\u2019t deny that he\u2019d loved the way she responded to them so readily. Her squirming little pants and aroused gasps had filled him with power. Liam had no doubt Hammer felt the same.</p><p>Their shared hunger for the same woman had been so familiar\u2014yet utterly different. Unlike their bond with Juliet, this felt strong, raw, insatiable. Connected. Even Beck\u2019s and Seth\u2019s occasional comments had filled him with a strange possessive pride he\u2019d never felt with any other woman.</p><p>A few feet from the car, they reached the front door. Liam opened it. Raine eased inside the foyer, gazing around the big open lounge with its blazing fireplace. \u201cI recognize this. It\u2019s your lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liam confirmed. \u201cYou were a wee bit tired and distraught the last time we arrived.\u201d</p><p>Raine cut Hammer an assessing glance before walking into the room. \u201cI like it here. It\u2019s cozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We want you comfortable,\u201d Hammer said, then addressed Liam. \u201cGorgeous place, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful,\u201d Seth added, a couple of steps back as he grabbed some luggage. He closed the back of the SUV, then fell in behind them.</p><p>\u201cAmazing views,\u201d Beck put in, juggling a couple of suitcases. \u201cBest of all, no one will hear you scream for miles, princess.\u201d</p><p>Raine gasped. \u201cBeck!\u201d</p><p>Adam, the caretaker, rushed from the back of the house to meet them. He took the bags from Seth and Beck, then turned to Liam with a smile. \u201cWelcome back. Ngaire has prepared lunch for you. I\u2019ve followed your instructions, and you\u2019ll find everything as you requested. We\u2019ll be just down the hill. Ring if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Liam thanked the older man, then nodded to his pleasing, plump wife. As soon as Adam distributed the luggage to the bedrooms, the pair disappeared out the back door, to their little cottage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved!\u201d Seth complained, prowling toward the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019s lunch?\u201d</p><p>Everyone trailed behind him. Collectively, they began pulling out plates, silverware, and napkins to set the table. Someone found a bottle of wine and a few cans of beer. Fresh baked rainbow trout came from the oven, sprinkled with delicate herbs. Potatoes and asparagus followed, along with a loaf of crusty sourdough. In less than five minutes, everyone dug in, praising Ngaire\u2019s cooking between bites. But Raine picked more than ate, still wriggling in her chair. A glance around the table told Liam that everyone else noticed, too.</p><p>When the meal concluded, the whole gang pitched in to do the dishes. Once the kitchen was clean, he and Hammer escorted Raine upstairs while Seth and Beck left to prepare the room in which her training would begin.</p><p>Liam pushed open the door to the master suite. With a hand at the small of Raine\u2019s back, he led her inside. Her suitcase sat near the picture windows overlooking the mountains.</p><p>With a glance at Hammer, who nodded back, Liam made his way into the bathroom and began to fill the sleek tub with hot water and bath oils. He found scented soaps, shampoo, razors, and shaving cream all laid out on the nearby counter beside fluffy white towels. His cock jerked just thinking about what they planned next.</p><p>Satisfied that the caretakers had tended to every detail, Liam stalked back to the bedroom. Raine stood beside Hammer, looking more than a little shaky. But she wasn\u2019t balking or quitting. He\u2019d take little victories like that and hope they added up to bigger ones soon.</p><p>Raine glanced his way, and he saw the questions rolling across her face.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, love,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you worried?\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted, shifting from one foot to the other. Whatever bounced around in her head, she was reluctant to say it\u2014a bad habit they\u2019d break her of shortly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just... I noticed only my suitcase here and I was wondering...\u201d She sighed. \u201cDo you mean to leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your room, but we\u2019ll have access to it twenty-four seven. You won\u2019t really be alone,\u201d Hammer assured.</p><p>\u201cBut neither of you will be sleeping here?\u201d</p><p>He and Hammer exchanged a glance. She hadn\u2019t asked them to stay with her outright. But it surprised them both that she\u2019d voiced her question because having them beside her was something she obviously wanted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Liam answered softly.</p><p>As her shoulders sagged and she looked down, Liam lifted her chin with a soft smile. \u201cNow don\u2019t look so crestfallen. At times, you\u2019ll be happy to see us go so you can have a bit of peace. But that will only come when we think you need to reflect or rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then, we\u2019ll be nearby and in your head, precious. We\u2019ll be surrounding you. We won\u2019t let you feel lost or abandoned,\u201d Hammer promised.</p><p>Liam caressed her cheek. \u201cAs you progress, we can discuss sleeping arrangements again. Does that answer your question?\u201d</p><p>Understanding\u2014with a hint of regret\u2014flickered in Raine\u2019s eyes as she gave a tentative nod.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be none of that.\u201d Liam released her, glowering. \u201cYou\u2019ll use your words from now on. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hammer reached up and trailed his knuckles down her cheek.</p><p>She closed her eyes, clearly finding reassurance in his touch. Watching a delicate contentment fill her face, Liam\u2019s hope brightened. Such a challenge, Raine was...then sometimes she could be so giving and soft.</p><p>Hammer dropped his hand suddenly. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>Liam heard the man\u2019s impatience. Macen was eager to start testing Raine and having her under his control. Liam shared the feeling.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. She blinked between them while they waited for her to process the demand. Finally, she pressed her lips together, resolution overtaking her expression. There was her backbone...</p><p>Her fingers trembled, but Raine peeled off her flimsy tank top. Then she reached around to unfasten her bra, thrusting her breasts toward them. It was all Liam could do to keep from gliding his tongue up the soft valley of her cleavage. She wriggled out of her short skirt next, and he watched the sway of her hips, captivated, as she exposed the dark tuft of hair striping her pussy and revealed her creamy thighs. Blood rushed to his cock.</p><p>Raine stood naked before them, beautiful and tense, looking like warm ivory velvet. Liam clenched his fists, resisting the urge to put his hands all over her.</p><p>Beside him, Hammer caressed her bare curves with his stare and sighed roughly, struggling to hold back. Liam knew it not only by the erection tenting his trousers, but the tick of his clenched jaw.</p><p>Bloody Christ, this series of tasks would challenge their control.</p><p>Finally, Hammer reined himself in and stood tall, stance wide, hands behind his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam watched Raine\u2019s gaze fall to the floor as he paced around her, stopping when his chest brushed her back, a mere breath from her skin. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re feeling, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous.\u201d She drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cUnsure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Hammer praised. \u201cAre you afraid of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her gaze bounced up to them both, reassuring. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose my courage, clam up, and disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the answer either wanted but both had inherently known. Still, for Raine, that was bloody honest. Liam met Hammer\u2019s glance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a fine job now. Just keep trying your best. We\u2019ll work through everything else,\u201d Liam promised. \u201cTake a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>Raine drew in a shaky inhalation, then let it out, looking calmer. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Hammer eased closer, standing in her personal space. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re nervous because you don\u2019t know what we expect. So we\u2019ll explain now. You will address us as \u2018Sir\u2019 when you respond. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her gaze lowered again.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d Liam kissed her bare shoulder. \u201cYou will kneel when we enter a room and remain there until we tell you otherwise. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Raine began to nod, then stopped herself. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, love,\u201d Liam murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s get you in the tub. We\u2019ll talk more then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned. \u201cI had a shower this morning.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Liam bent down and lifted Raine over his shoulder, then turned, putting her ass directly in front of Hammer. Right on cue, Macen whacked both cheeks, one after the other. She yelped.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask you if you\u2019re clean or if you wanted a bath,\u201d Hammer pointed out. \u201cWe want you in the tub. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t address me properly, Raine,\u201d Liam reminded as he strolled into the bathroom and dropped her on her feet. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. Sorry, Sir.\u201d She swallowed, and he could see the worry twisting her expression.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t let her self-doubt fester, especially this early in the process. Time to put her at ease.</p><p>Each man took one of her arms to steady her as they helped her into the tub. When the warm water enveloped her feet, she sighed. The scents of rosemary and lavender rose with the swirl of steam.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Hammer directed.</p><p>Raine lowered herself into the soft, inviting water and sat unmoving as they stripped out of their coats and shirts, then draped them over the back of the vanity chair.</p><p>\u201cLie back. Close your eyes. We\u2019ll take care of you now,\u201d Liam promised as he knelt beside the tub.</p><p>He waited until she complied and a little sigh escaped her. Some of the tension left her body.</p> <p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cNow spread your thighs and tell us what you think submission is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew wide open, and she stared at him as if he\u2019d asked her to explain quantum physics. \u201cExcuse me, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try one command at a time.\u201d On the opposite side of the tub, Hammer reached into the water and wrapped a hand around her ankle. \u201cDo you have any trouble interpreting what we meant by \u2018spread your thighs?\u2019\u201d</p><p>The heat of the water had turned her cheeks pink, but she flushed something close to red now. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t move, Hammer raised a brow. \u201cDo I need to tell you to do it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. But it\u2019s a little embarrassing. I know you\u2019ve seen it all. It\u2019s just... even though this is a common request for a Dom to make of his sub, it feels odd to flash you both.\u201d</p><p>Liam grabbed her chin and turned her toward him with a frown. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single part of your body that I\u2019m not intimately familiar with and hasn\u2019t pleased me. I\u2019ve no doubt it\u2019s the same for Hammer. You\u2019re not flashing us; you\u2019re showing us what\u2019s ours. Now do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her voice shook, but she raised one leg to the rim of the tub. Hammer guided the other up until she lay splayed wide. Raine tensed, her blue eyes begging silently for approval.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking beautiful,\u201d Hammer said roughly as he skimmed his fingers up to wrap around her inner thigh. \u201cNow answer the second part of the question.\u201d</p><p>She gasped softly, watching Hammer edge closer to her slick folds. Her gaze swung back to Liam\u2019s face, anxious and tight.</p><p>\u201cSay what\u2019s on your mind, love,\u201d Liam coaxed.</p><p>\u201cUm...Sir. He\u2019s touching me, and you\u2019re watching.\u201d Raine looked like she searched for words. \u201cThat\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I seem upset when Hammer touched you in the car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we promise you no fighting or disagreements?\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned in her eyes. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. If you think you\u2019ll learn to submit and open up without us touching you anywhere and everywhere, Raine, you\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her breathy exhalation went straight to his cock. \u201cSo...there will be sex, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat option isn\u2019t off the table, but it\u2019s up to you. Your behavior and progress will dictate our decisions.\u201d</p><p>Relief and excitement fluttered across her face, and a sense of triumph that she wanted them so much chugged through his veins. Yes, that meant sharing her with Hammer, but he welcomed the chance to touch her again. He was desperate to see how far they could send her spiraling into pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNow answer the damn question,\u201d Hammer demanded. \u201cIf we have to ask it again, you\u2019ll come out of that tub and over my knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmission...right.\u201d Raine nodded and hesitated, clearly gathering her thoughts. \u201cI know it\u2019s a power exchange. I get that I\u2019m supposed to give myself over to you and trust that you\u2019ll both praise and punish me when I need it.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve felt the need to please you both, though in different ways. Disappointing either of you hurts something inside me. Liam, last time we were here, I felt something both painful and amazing. When we talked about my childhood, remember? Blurting all that out was hard, but I knew it would damage us more if I refused to talk. I remember looking at you and hoping that you\u2019d catch me. I was so grateful when you did. And I felt like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sensing a \u2018but\u2019 here. Go on,\u201d Liam urged.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve looked around Shadows and watched the others scene. It\u2019s confusing. So many different types of Doms and subs. I\u2019ve seen brutal punishment for the tiniest infraction. And I\u2019ve seen almost no discipline for incredibly bratty behavior. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of sex\u2014tender, rough, odd, beautiful. But I have a hard time adding those things up in my head and figuring out how it\u2019s all submission. I know my wants and impulses, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re wrong.\u201d She frowned, then seemed to remember herself. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Liam exhaled. Her view was so scattered. Why hadn\u2019t he asked her that question sooner? If he had, he would have started at square one when he\u2019d collared her. Of course, he hadn\u2019t known her well then. Since then, Raine hadn\u2019t talked to him or opened up like she should. But he\u2019d assumed her understanding of the power exchange was far deeper.</p><p>\u201cI know putting that into words was difficult for you. Thank you, love.\u201d He leaned in, cupping her face in his hands, and took her mouth in a searing kiss.</p><p>Raine yielded her lips to him, opening and allowing him to sink deep inside her. She clung, wrapping her arms around his neck, so welcoming. Her sweetness intoxicated him. Liam moaned, some part of him wishing he could spend all day just worshipping her mouth. The other part of him realized they had work to do.</p><p>Easing back, he kissed her nose, then reached for the shampoo.</p><p>She blinked up at him, then slid her gaze over to Hammer. \u201cWhat I said...that wasn\u2019t wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, precious. Today, there was no right or wrong answer. You have a lot to learn, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. I\u2019m proud of your honesty.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and tangled his hand in her hair, tugging gently until his lips hovered just over hers. They shared a silent moment before Macen took her mouth, devouring and rewarding at once.</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t afford to think now about how that made him feel. If he did, his heart might break. Instead, he watched, focusing on how Raine was opening, blossoming under their attention. This bath was serving its purpose\u2014showing her how good it could be if she let it. To dwell on the love she might never give him would only be borrowing tomorrow\u2019s trouble today.</p><p>As Hammer eased back, Raine smiled softly. Then she looked Liam\u2019s way, and his heart caught when their gazes tangled. She sent him a searching smile, and he gave her the reassurance she sought. He answered in kind. Damn if she didn\u2019t glow, bask in their affection, seemingly at peace.</p><p>As she lowered her gaze, that grin brightened even more. Then she looked up at him through her dark lashes, her blue eyes sparkling.</p><p>Liam hoped like hell she was truly ready to open herself and be whole\u2014and that she\u2019d still want him afterward. \u201cTilt your head back so I can wash your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Raine complied, closing her eyes.</p><p>He plucked at the bathtub\u2019s nozzle and pulled the attached hose up from its base. The spray of water jetted from the head. He urged her to scoot down, then eased her back, supporting her neck in his palm. Slowly, deliberately, he soaked her raven mane, then squirted a dollop of floral shampoo at her crown. Liam plunged his fingers into the strands and kneaded at her scalp until she moaned in bliss. He couldn\u2019t deny how much he enjoyed having Raine put herself in his care.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hammer whisked a soapy loofah up her legs, over her belly. He lathered her shoulders, her breasts, dragging it slowly over her nipples. Her breath caught.</p><p>Liam watched, thumbing away the suds that drizzled onto her forehead. She groaned as he rinsed the shampoo, then spread conditioner through her hair. Again, he worked it through, this time massaging her neck, rubbing the tension away before he rinsed her hair clean.</p><p>Not once did she flinch or open her eyes. In that moment, she gave them total trust. Liam burned for more of it.</p><p>\u201cYou did so well, love.\u201d He kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir. That felt good,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cNow stand up, precious. It\u2019s time to shave that little landing strip you\u2019ve left unwaxed.\u201d Hammer extended his hand.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI thought it would be fun. You don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Confusion knit her brows.</p><p>\u201cBecause when I rake my tongue up your pouty cunt, I want it bare. Is that a good enough reason for you, precious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. O-okay, Sir.\u201d Raine blushed and slipped her slender fingers into Hammer\u2019s wide grasp, rising like a goddess from the water.</p><p>Her long, dark hair dripped over the swell of her backside. Drops mingled down her thighs. Swallowing tightly, Liam skimmed his palms over her pert ass and gripped her hips, steadying her.</p><p>He watched Hammer squirt a cloud of white foam onto his fingers before painting her dark pubic hair. The man\u2019s stare riveted on the sweet pussy, inches from his face. Liam had no doubt Macen wanted to slide his fingers between Raine\u2019s silky folds and stay.</p><p>Hammer\u2019s nostrils flared as he glided the razor over the cottony foam. \u201cSuch a pretty pussy, Raine. So soft and slick. It\u2019s wet from more than the water, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Liam felt her tremble. He soothed her, caressing down her thighs, brushing his fingertips across the sensitive flesh behind her knees. \u201cAnswer him, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d Raine choked out, not meeting their stares.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Don\u2019t be embarrassed. We like you aroused.\u201d Hammer dropped a kiss on her hip before he rinsed the blade in the water and shaved off another strip of foam. \u201cSpread your legs wider.\u201d</p><p>Gliding his hand up the inside of her thigh, Liam nudged her legs apart, helping her balance her foot on the rim of the tub.</p><p>Hammer soaked the swollen pout of her pussy with the nozzle. She gasped as the spray grazed her clit. A moment later, he smoothed his thumb over her now bare mound, so close to her sensitive button.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done, precious,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>But no one moved. Christ, Liam felt the heat pouring from between her legs and leaned in to brush his lips across the firm globes of her backside. The scent of her pussy filled his nostrils and made his mouth water. Fuck, she crumbled his restraint. He\u2019d last been inside her a mere three days ago, but it felt like forever.</p><p>Liam could see that Hammer wasn\u2019t faring much better. His stare still hadn\u2019t left her cunt. Beads of sweat had broken out across the man\u2019s forehead, at his temples. Raine panted, little catching breaths that told him exactly how much she desired them. Liam glanced at the nearby bath oil before staring again at Raine\u2019s ass, remembering all too well how snug and perfect she felt around his cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And if they stayed crouched here much longer, he had no doubt they\u2019d be balls deep inside her in the next two minutes. While he\u2019d love feeling Raine tight and hot around him, they couldn\u2019t let her believe their time at the lodge was about anything other than her growth. Sex, if it came, would be the bonus they all reaped for her open, honest submission\u2014nothing less.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we let Raine dry off,\u201d Liam growled between clenched teeth as he backed away.</p><p>Hammer jerked his head in Liam\u2019s direction, and he could see the man visibly fight for control before taking a step back. \u201cYeah. Time for a breath of fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll get her damn clothes.\u201d</p><p>Liam hands shook as he unfolded the towel and tried to cover Raine.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d She took it from his grasp, then bent over and wrapped it around her dripping hair\u2014leaving her body entirely bare.</p><p>Well, hell. Liam almost envied Macen the task of digging through her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, man!\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d Hammer barked back.</p><p>Raine tried to smother a giggle and failed.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something to say?\u201d Liam asked her sharply.</p><p>She pressed her lips together, suppressing her amusement. \u201cNo, Sir. I enjoyed my bath. I hope you did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d He swatted her ass. \u201cOut of the tub you go.\u201d Drawing in a deep breath, he took her hand and cupped her elbow to help her step free. The second she padded onto the fluffy bath mat, he released her. \u201cHammer, where are you with those clothes?\u201d</p><p>The man stormed into the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m right\u2014\u201d Macen let out a deep breath, devouring the sight of her from head to toe. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s where this was headed, all right. Liam reached over to the counter and snagged another terrycloth sheet, thrusting it at Raine. \u201cDry yourself off. We\u2019re going to step out for a moment. You\u2019re free to do your hair and makeup. Leave the bathroom door open. There\u2019ll be no touching yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d A smile flirted at her lips as she grabbed the towel and shook it loose.</p><p>Hauling in a shuddering breath, he turned away and grabbed Hammer by the arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>His old friend didn\u2019t argue. He dropped a handful of black lace on the vanity, then raced him out of the room. Hammer beat him into the bedroom by a fraction, but Liam spotted the door to the balcony first, rattling it and cursing at the lock until it fell open.</p><p>With a groan of relief, he stepped outside. Macen followed. Instantly, the winter chill blasted them in a mighty gust as they looked across the sweeping vistas of the pine-dotted mountains. It was wintry enough to snow, and right now that felt damn good.</p><p>\u201cThis is better than a cold shower,\u201d Hammer said.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I won\u2019t miss my shirt for an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will take that long for the blood to leave my cock,\u201d he grumbled.</p> <p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be easy. She laughed at us, mate. Giggled like a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll add that to her growing list of infractions.\u201d</p><p>Liam slanted Hammer a dubious stare. \u201cAnd which of us is going to spank her without losing control?\u201d</p><p>Hammer grimaced. \u201cBeck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat dodgy prick isn\u2019t touching her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019ll be more collected after dinner.\u201d</p><p>Liam rested his arms on the railing beside his friend, bowing his head. \u201cWe have to be.\u201d</p><p>Hammer snared his gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s responding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t deny that.\u201d And wasn\u2019t that a double-edged sword?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she learns to open up, then it\u2019s best for her.\u201d Liam shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to say.\u201d</p><p>Macen clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cI know this is hard on you, but I respect what you\u2019re doing for Raine.\u201d</p><p>A couple of ugly replies came to mind, almost like a knee jerk. Liam shoved them down. Petty had no place here now. If he was being honest, as hard as it was to watch Hammer touch Raine, he also felt deep comfort in having his friend back.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Let\u2019s find a cup of coffee. Once she\u2019s dressed, we\u2019ll send Seth up to make sure she doesn\u2019t let her fingers put out her fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest idea you\u2019ve had all day. Because this bath...\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bloody hard exercise in restraint.\u201d Liam grinned. \u201cShut your whining mug and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Under the vanity lights in the master bath, Raine guided the little brush through her lashes, applying her mascara in a daze. To say that today had been mind-blowing was like saying the North Pole was cold. Liam and Hammer had both topped her\u2014and touched her\u2014at the same time. No one was bloody or bruised, screaming, shouting, or throwing punches. The next World War hadn\u2019t commenced. In fact, they\u2019d seemed to enjoy taking care of her together.</p><p>Liam and Hammer had once been friends, but she\u2019d mostly seen them mix as well as oil and water until today. Sure, they\u2019d behaved civilly enough before Liam collared her, but Hammer\u2019s aloofness had even extended to his best friend, and she\u2019d witnessed Liam\u2019s frustration and hurt. Today everything had been different, and Raine couldn\u2019t put her finger on why. Yes, they\u2019d agreed to put aside their differences to help her, but their rapport now didn\u2019t feel like a forced compromise. It felt more like a kinship, like they\u2019d fallen into a comfortable brotherhood.</p><p>Absently putting the wand back in the tube of mascara, she wound it closed and glanced at her appearance. She\u2019d pass muster for dinner. Dark curls framed her flushed cheeks and trailed to her breasts. Red gloss sheened her slightly swollen lips.</p><p>In the mirror, she looked the same, but everything inside felt raw, confused, yearning. Different. The need they\u2019d incited breathed just under her skin, lying in wait to hurtle her into aching desire again with their next touch. It was a miracle she hadn\u2019t begged them for relief.</p><p>What would it be like to spend every day between them, wrapped in their care, the center of their lives? It sounded ludicrous\u2014mostly because it was\u2014but it was her fantasy. No way she could deny how perfectly happy and whole everything they\u2019d done today made her feel. She\u2019d better enjoy it because it probably wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cRaine, time for dinner!\u201d Seth shouted up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBe right there,\u201d she called back, shoving her makeup in its case and turning off her curling iron.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t really hungry, but when the watchful Dom had left her a few minutes ago to check on the meal, Raine figured she wouldn\u2019t have long to sort out her thoughts alone. Nice to know that something about this day had been predictable.</p><p>Raine dashed out of the bedroom, her bare feet padding down the stairs. The scent of something delicious wafted in the air, and the little growl of her stomach surprised her. Then again, she hadn\u2019t eaten much the entire day\u2014too bewildered to consume the big breakfast she\u2019d cooked and too confused to do more than nibble at lunch. The anxiety and arousal simmering inside her would probably kill her appetite for dinner as well. But if she spent the evening surrounded by Hammer and Liam, wrapped in their affection, she really didn\u2019t care.</p><p>From the kitchen, she heard Beck\u2019s boisterous laughter and sighed. So dinner wasn\u2019t going to be a quiet evening for three. She had no idea what was on the agenda, but since Hammer and Liam had \u201crequested\u201d she wear this sheer black baby-doll, Raine had her suspicions. Great, more sexual teasing. How the hell was she going to survive even another minute of feeling like an orgasmic time bomb?</p><p>Tugging at the lace tickling the tops of her thighs, she shoved back her self-consciousness. Why hadn\u2019t they given her some damn flannel pajamas?</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Raine rounded the corner into the kitchen and stopped. The four Doms stood, their chairs scraping the hardwood floor. She felt every eye on her, eating up her exposed flesh, and forced herself to stand with her head up and shoulders squared\u2014and ignore that fluttery feeling inside her.</p><p>Raine raised her chin. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Liam arched a brow at her.</p><p>\u201cSirs,\u201d she added hastily. She\u2019d behaved casually for so long, she had trouble remembering her protocol.</p><p>Liam smiled at her before extending his hand and leading her toward the empty chair between him and Hammer. \u201cYou look lovely, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrumptious,\u201d Macen whispered in her ear as she sat. \u201cI know what\u2019s for dessert.\u201d</p><p>As the other men resumed their seats, heat rushed up her face. She sent him a delicate scowl. \u201cHammer...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>The men had set the table and laid out the meal the caretaker\u2019s wife had prepared. Everything looked fine, but Raine still frowned. \u201cI would have been happy to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe enjoy when you do,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cBut we need you focused, not disappearing into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides...\u201d Liam glided his hand up her thigh, his fingers inching breathlessly close to her silky thong. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to save your strength.\u201d</p><p>Raine\u2019s breath caught. She zipped a questioning glance his way. He leveled her a smoldering stare. She shifted in her chair, wondering how she was going to make it through this meal.</p><p>\u201cSo, princess, did you enjoy your bath?\u201d Beck asked with a wicked grin. He was being a jackass.</p><p>She answered with sticky sweetness. \u201cIt was nice, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust nice?\u201d Hammer baited as he set a crusty dinner roll on her plate.</p><p>She resisted the urge to throw it at him. \u201cFine. Lovely. Enjoyable.\u201d</p><p>Trailing the pads of his fingers down her arm, Liam grinned as goose bumps peppered her flesh. \u201cI\u2019d call it amazing. An experience worth repeating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery soon.\u201d Hammer smirked as he loaded her plate with chicken and rice casserole.</p><p>The men ate with gusto, chugging back a beer. Raine scooted her food across her plate with her fork and sipped at her wine, the appetite she\u2019d had minutes ago now an afterthought. What would the next few days bring? And how would she get through them? Would there be an orgasm in her future?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had this place, Liam,\u201d Seth said into the silence. \u201cDo you come up here much? Ski in the winter, hit the lake in the summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just inherited it last year, but I hope to visit more often.\u201d</p><p>Raine only half listened until Liam grazed his fingers over the silk covering her pussy. An electric arc danced through her body. A vicious ache followed. She grasped the table.</p><p>Damn, she\u2019d been on edge all day. She struggled for a breath. A moan clogged her throat, and she barely managed to swallow it down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating, precious.\u201d Hammer smiled her way, mischief in his eyes. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d Under his watchful gaze, she speared a chunk of chicken and forced herself to chew.</p><p>Liam caressed down her thigh, then scooted back from the table. Without warning, he hoisted her onto his lap. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I believe that, Hammer. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Raine swallowed tightly, feeling wired and flustered. They were going to dissect her thoughts, and all she could focus on was their touches and hot stares undressing her, with Liam\u2019s heat enveloping her and his steely erection prodding her thigh.</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s help her.\u201d Macen glided his fingertips up her calf.</p><p>She tried not to whimper.</p><p>After tearing apart a steaming roll heaped with melted butter, Liam lifted a piece and coaxed her to open for him. When she did, he slid the morsel into her mouth, his fingers lingering on her lips, urging her to lick them clean. His dark stare held hers captive, and Raine drowned. He anchored her in his steely arms, both giving her tenderness and oozing sex. She clung in return, sucking on the slightly rough pads of his fingers, tasting the salt on his skin.</p><p>Hammer moved her plate next to Liam\u2019s and slid closer, occupying her chair. As his body heat assailed her, he reached into his salad bowl and plucked up a thick slice of cucumber, slathered in dressing.</p><p>\u201cOpen for me, precious,\u201d Hammer commanded.</p><p>As she leaned in, lips parted, a drop of the creamy sauce splattered on the swell of her breast, trickling down the pale flesh. His eyes flared with heat as he eased the vegetable onto her tongue. Then he bent and licked the dressing from her skin, his lips brushing down the curve of her chest until he nipped her turgid crest through the lace and sucked hard.</p><p>Liam swallowed her moan by fusing his lips over hers and dominating her mouth, tangling his fingers in her hair.</p><p>Raine\u2019s body burned. Her heart roared in her ears...but she could still hear Beck groan from the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Seth muttered.</p><p>Hammer turned his attention to her other nipple, leaving the first hard bud aching and clinging to the fabric. She arched to him, then wrapped her hand around Liam\u2019s nape, drawing him closer and losing herself in his kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He jerked away, then elbowed Macen in the shoulder. \u201cShe needs to eat.\u201d</p><p>Food was the last thing on her mind.</p><p>With a jerky nod, Hammer pulled her into his lap. His erection prodded her backside, every bit as hard and demanding as Liam\u2019s. Meshed against his broad chest, Macen pressed close, his feverish heat surrounding her. She still shivered.</p><p>Raine blinked up into his hazel eyes. His breathing was rough. He looked at her as if she was the treasure he\u2019d never expected to find.</p><p>Liam cupped her chin and tilted her gaze to him. \u201cTake a nibble, love.\u201d</p><p>As he held a chunk of pineapple between his fingers, Raine opened, biting the plump fruit between her teeth. The juice seeped past her lips, dribbling onto her chin as Liam bent forward, sliding his tongue along the sweet path before he claimed her lips in another demanding kiss.</p><p>Hammer cupped her hip, his fingers skating over the curve of her ass. She could feel his stare burning into her as he watched. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Give yourself to us. Feel me. Open for him. Let us take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered as Liam eased away. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>God, they couldn\u2019t leave her like this. But apparently they planned to because they spent the rest of the meal passing her back and forth. In between bites of chicken, salad, bread, and fruit, they caressed her, whispered to her, aroused the hell out of her. She gulped down her wine and her mind raced, circling on one thought: how perfect this felt.</p><p>When the men\u2019s plates were empty, and she\u2019d eaten enough to stop her stomach from rumbling, Liam stood and lifted her, then set her on his vacant chair.</p><p>Beside him, Hammer rose to his feet. \u201cStay with Seth and Beck. In a few minutes, they\u2019ll give you instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d What else could she say? She suspected they meant to start the work they\u2019d brought her here to do. Raine wanted and needed to finish it. But she\u2019d be lying if she didn\u2019t admit the whole idea made her nervous as hell. Still, she refused to disappoint them or continue existing as an emotional cripple.</p><p>As she watched them go, Raine bit her lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing so far, princess?\u201d Beck leaned in and rested his elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d She heard the unsteadiness of her voice.</p><p>Seth shook his head, then sent Beck a look of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start again, Raine,\u201d Beck growled in his badass Dom voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on behind those pretty blue eyes? You\u2019re here to open up. Let\u2019s have it.\u201d</p><p>Beck and Seth both sent her intent stares, and she couldn\u2019t help feeling like a bug under a microscope. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where to begin. I have all these feelings and questions...and crazy notions. And they\u2019re driving me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose two haven\u2019t exactly given you a lot of peace today so you could think things through.\u201d Beck grinned. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Raine said wryly, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you expect it to feel?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Everything happened so fast this morning. When I agreed to their bargain, I didn\u2019t have time to picture much. But this is like a dream. I keep expecting to wake up and find myself miserable and alone again. Because when I\u2019m with them, everything is right in my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should feel that way.\u201d Seth smiled. \u201cTell us your questions.\u201d</p> <p>A million of them circled in her head. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know why they\u2019re doing this. They\u2019ve told me what they think I want to hear, but... Liam says he loves me, and I guess he wants me back someday, but Hammer treated me like his sister for six years, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean except the night he fucked you endlessly?\u201d Beck cut in.</p><p>Raine crossed her arms over her chest and sighed at him. \u201cExcept that one. But you\u2019ve seen him do it. You know what I mean. How many other women did he take to bed while I stood there in plain sight? He acted like I was invisible until Liam took an interest in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, princess. You were a lot of things to Hammer, but never invisible. That man loves you.\u201d</p><p>She reared back and scowled. \u201cNo, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoves you,\u201d Beck insisted.</p><p>Equal parts joy and terror sparked through her at the sadist\u2019s emphatic comeback. Still, that familiar self-doubt managed to worm its way back in.</p><p>\u201cHe cares, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCares?\u201d Beck snarled. \u201cDo you think Hammer is the sort of man who goes all out for every waif who crosses his path? Do you think he shelters every lost girl by providing doctors and help, money, time, and support? He gave you almost everything you ever needed, princess.\u201d He laughed gruffly. \u201cShit, when Liam brought you here the first time, you should have seen Hammer curl up in bed with your clothes and inhale your scent, like that would bring you back. When you ran from Shadows a few days ago, he sounded prepared to burn down the world to find you. And you think he merely cares? Grow up, Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam loves you, too,\u201d Seth said quietly. \u201cIf you\u2019re having trouble believing it, stop. I\u2019ve known O\u2019Neill a long time. It took me less than two minutes of seeing the man with you to know that you\u2019re everything to him.\u201d</p><p>Their words hit her squarely in the chest. Maybe they were right. Liam and Hammer wouldn\u2019t talk out their strife and drop everything to help her if they didn\u2019t more than care.</p><p>Raine released a shaky breath and closed her eyes. Tears threatened. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they would love me. I\u2019ve made their lives really difficult. Hammer practically had to finish raising me, and Liam has tried so hard... I\u2019ve fought. I\u2019ve hidden. I\u2019ve lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop beating yourself up.\u201d Seth took her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing now. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not too little, too late. Up until today, I was convinced that I\u2019d destroyed their friendship. But seeing them together like this...\u201d Raine groped for the right words. \u201cThat\u2019s what their bond should be.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d Beck added. \u201cAll that bickering bugged the shit out of me, especially since I think, deep down, they want the same fucking thing. You should have seen the kitchen after Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. What the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d Seth raised a brow at her.</p><p>Raine dropped her gaze. \u201cSorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that was them beginning to work it out.\u201d Beck shrugged. \u201cThrowing dishes is for pussies, and if Hammer hadn\u2019t been so wrenched, I would have told him that. But their friendship wasn\u2019t right even before you came along, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer told me not to take all the responsibility on my shoulders, but he never explained. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe him,\u201d Beck filled in.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut what I saw today... It stunned me. Before now, I would have said it was impossible for them to share a woman again. But their actions together are so seamless. One picks up where the other leaves off. They\u2019re so in tune, it\u2019s like they can read each other\u2019s minds. They operate as if they\u2019re two halves of a whole. Like...they were born to be together in this way. The guilt that I\u2019ve somehow kept them at one another\u2019s throats for so long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop there,\u201d Seth demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s both their doing and their problem. Focus on you for a minute. How does being with both of them make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCentered for the first time in my life. Secure. Protected. Happy.\u201d She shook her head, still looking for the right words to express herself. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. Every look, touch, and whisper has me completely off-balance. But being with them is so perfect. I don\u2019t ever want to give it up. Juliet must have felt like the luckiest woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She had issues.\u201d Seth paused. Something bitter passed over his face. \u201cHell, she was an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like her?\u201d That surprised Raine. Hammer had loved Juliet enough to grieve for years\u2014in his way. Liam...she wasn\u2019t sure exactly how he\u2019d felt about the woman.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Seth didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a spine. Not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I have too much spine,\u201d Raine grumbled and shot a guilty look Beck\u2019s way.</p><p>The doctor just laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a good thing, princess. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need it with these two,\u201d Seth drawled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your end game here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I want out of this?\u201d At their nods, she sighed. \u201cI started down this path just to grow, to learn how to be open with someone and not try to protect myself all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being pretty damn honest now,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t go back to being miserable. And no offense, but I can talk to you because my heart isn\u2019t on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d Beck shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m guessing they left you here as my sounding boards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Beck nodded. \u201cIf you need help, we\u2019re here. And we\u2019ll be happy to whack Hammer and Liam upside the head if they need it. But we\u2019ll also talk you through anything you\u2019re unsure of or hesitant to address with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for the help, guys. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your goal is simply to not be miserable?\u201d Beck prodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything else out of your time with Liam and Hammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday, no. Today...I\u2019m afraid what I want is a little more pie in the sky. I know you said it was possible, Beck, but I\u2019m still thinking I should go buy a bridge from someone on a street corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not farfetched. Say it, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want them. Always,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cI still think it sounds crazy. But today, they seemed happy. I\u2019m happy. Part of me insists that it can work. But they tried with Juliet and it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApples and oranges. You\u2019re different than Juliet. They\u2019re not the same men, either. Liam and Hammer are stronger and more in sync now.\u201d</p><p>Raine digested that information. \u201cThey weren\u2019t like this with Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not this...intimate. Hammer is more gentle. Liam is more possessive.\u201d Seth searched for words. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it\u2019s definitely not the same.\u201d</p><p>She believed Seth, but struggled to pin her finger on why Liam\u2019s friend would be right. They must have cared deeply for Juliet. She frowned.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s running through your head, princess,\u201d Beck cut in.</p><p>\u201cSo...how did everything end badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t communicate.\u201d A mixture of sadness and contempt crossed his face.</p><p>Beck snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, you know I suck at it.\u201d She tossed her hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job now. And you can do it with them,\u201d Seth assured. \u201cYou\u2019ve got what they need. Juliet was simply the wrong woman for them to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m the right one?\u201d Raine held her breath. \u201cI\u2019m not any better than her at communicating, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since she committed suicide without giving either of them a damn clue that she was even unhappy, much less contemplating ending her life, I\u2019m going to disagree.\u201d</p><p>Raine backed away in horror, clapping her hand over her gaping mouth. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Seth winced. \u201cShit. I thought you knew. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Which of them had found Juliet\u2019s body? Where had she done it? Where had Hammer and Liam been when she\u2019d taken her last breath? What had they done afterward? The shock and the pain they must have felt\u2014and lived with all these years... Raine\u2019s heart splintered for them. Both would have shouldered so much guilt. But it explained why Hammer had kept his distance for so long. And why Liam had been so determined to fix her.</p><p>She blinked at Seth, shocked. \u201cI knew she was dead. I wondered if it was something tragic, like a car accident or an illness. The possiblility that her death had been self-inflicted crossed my mind, but... Oh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s safe to say she didn\u2019t communicate at all.\u201d Seth clenched his jaw, then let his gaze wander out the kitchen window as if he was wrangling his own regrets.</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>\u201cCan you picture yourself doing that to them?\u201d Beck asked.</p><p>\u201cNever. Ever!\u201d she vowed. \u201cI want to be with them without tearing their friendship apart. More than anything, I want to be the right woman for them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerfect. Now tell me why you\u2019ve come here,\u201d Seth barked.</p><p>\u201cTo be whole. To be worthy.\u201d That meant she had to learn how not to be like Juliet. She must figure out how to communicate.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>\u201cYes. Everything Hammer and Liam are doing now is to teach you what you need to know. Communication is a part of that, princess,\u201d Beck pointed out.</p><p>\u201cA very important part.\u201d Seth agreed.</p><p>\u201cAmen, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, Raine. What Hammer and Liam are doing for you is difficult. You\u2019re the first woman they\u2019ve attempted to share in any way in the decade since Juliet died. Hell, I think you\u2019re the only reason they\u2019re really talking now. So when your demons come to haunt you, and you fear they can\u2019t possibly love you...\u201d Seth growled. \u201cYou better remind yourself that their love is what\u2019s motivating them to see this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Beck chimed in. \u201cTheir animosity isn\u2019t just because of you. They shared a woman who killed herself. But they\u2019ve put everything aside to help you. If that\u2019s not love, what the hell is?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>With her head a tangle, Raine allowed Beck and Seth to usher her upstairs. No idea why they were leading her this way. But unlike the informal chat in the kitchen minutes ago, the Dominant hum rolling off them didn\u2019t exactly invite conversation.</p><p>Making their way down the long hall, Beck softly squeezed her elbow as he stopped in front of a closed door.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my room,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Seth sent her an amused glance. \u201cWe know.\u201d</p><p>Okay... They had to be bringing her here to begin the work now. Raine glanced at the portal. What awaited her on the other side wasn\u2019t just important. It could change her life. She dragged in a deep breath.</p><p>Liam and Hammer had persuaded her to accept them as her Doms, and she understood now what that had cost them. Whether they meant to or not, they would teach her their expectations and wishes. She would learn\u2014and maybe figure out how to be the right woman for them. If she succeeded, maybe she could have her castle-in-the-sky fantasy. And if not...she\u2019d still be in a better place.</p><p>Seth opened the door, and with a jerk of his head, he silently instructed her to enter. As she did, a handful of candles illuminated the mostly empty room. Frowning, she squinted to adjust to the scant light.</p><p>There was no trace of luxurious furnishings, like inside the master suite, not even a lamp or chair, just two stark items: a mattress covered in a simple white sheet and a dark wooden St. Andrew\u2019s Cross in the corner shaped in a giant X with several eye bolts attached to the sides at both top and bottom. Absently, she noticed a carved wooden box that nearly blended in with the carpet next to the cross. It looked benign enough, but knowing the two Doms she dealt with, it could contain almost anything.</p><p>The significance of her austere surroundings didn\u2019t escape her. They didn\u2019t want her distracted by anything. They could please or punish her at will. And they probably wanted her to rely on them for everything\u2014food, comfort, companionship.</p><p>This room put her on notice. They meant business.</p><p>Turning slowly, she pinned Beck with a questioning gaze. Raine didn\u2019t want to second-guess herself, but...could she really do this?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving you what you asked for, princess,\u201d Beck pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s yours for the taking. So are they, if you do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat if I fuck this up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d Seth scowled.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sir.\u201d She had to watch her tongue. \u201cBut you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Beck pulled her closer and cupped her shoulders. \u201cPrincess, you can do this. You know what you want. You know the stakes. You have the strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here after...if you need us,\u201d Seth promised.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Raine nodded resolutely, trying to ignore the way her stomach flipped. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Wait here. Don\u2019t leave this room,\u201d Beck commanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door, leaving her very much alone. The temperature was as cold as the d\u00e9cor. The air blowing from the ceiling fan overhead caused the shadows cast by the candles to dance on the walls. She turned in a slow circle, studying the room. She saw no closet, no bathroom, no window, just a strangling quiet that poked at her anxiety.</p><p>Raine paced. The urge to run and hide swamped her. The insecurity pumping through her veins was uncomfortable but deeply familiar. And she was growing weary of being off-kilter, but she knew that wasn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Above all, she had to stop fearing that she would never be what they wanted and start learning how she could be everything they needed.</p><p>As she nibbled on a ragged nail, the snick of the doorknob stopped her in her tracks. Spinning toward the sound, she held her breath. Her heart stuttered.</p><p>Hammer and Liam prowled into the room.</p><p>Let the games begin...</p><p>They eased the door closed in a whisper and stepped toward her, inches away. Almost in unison, they clasped their hands behind their backs and widened their stances as they squared their broad shoulders. Identical solemn expressions filled their stern faces. An absolute sense of their command rolled through the room, sliding over her body. Her breath caught. She shivered.</p><p>Her Doms\u2014at least for now\u2014were united.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2014\u201d Their lips tightened in displeasure, and she stopped in mid-sentence. Right... On your knees.</p><p>Raine swallowed tightly, then lowered herself to the carpet. Resting her backside on her heels, she drank in one last glimpse of the men she loved, then cast her gaze to the floor. Cool air swirled around Raine\u2019s shoulders as the tips of four Italian loafers came into view. She waited, her entire body tense. Vulnerability and yearning washed over her. What did they see? What did they think? Why didn\u2019t they say or do something? Despite all the worry and uncertainty, a joy she\u2019d only ever experienced once, here at the lodge with Liam, resurfaced. The sense of rightness that seemed so familiar with them settled over her.</p><p>\u201cSuch a lovely sight,\u201d Liam praised, trailing his fingers through her hair. \u201cThank you for remembering our instructions. You make us proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty, precious.\u201d Hammer cupped her shoulder.</p><p>She drew in a relieved breath and smiled to herself. \u201cThank you, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>Then Raine bit her lip. Was she supposed to speak? They\u2019d never told her that she couldn\u2019t, thank goodness. She wanted no part of Hammer\u2019s ball gag.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to your first task.\u201d She heard the challenge in Hammer\u2019s tone. \u201cLie on the mattress for us.\u201d</p><p>Task? Her mind whirled with possibilities as she rose and padded to the bed, sliding onto her back and looking up at them. What would they expect her to do?</p><p>With a curious stare, she watched Liam ease down onto the mattress on her left, Hammer on her right. Both men watched her intently.</p><p>\u201cDo you like your new room, precious?\u201d Hammer asked.</p><p>He was joking, right? But since there wasn\u2019t a hint of playful in his tone, she knew better.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... um, different from the bedroom you put me in after lunch, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a comparison,\u201d Hammer pointed out. \u201cI asked if you liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Raine saw the subtle shift of their expressions and hastily added, \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned closer. \u201cTell us why, love.\u201d</p><p>She stared between them. Now that they loomed closer, their dominance pressed in, thick and overpowering. Raine could almost taste it. Her pussy fluttered. She sucked in an uneven breath.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s almost nothing here, Sir,\u201d she replied, shivering. \u201cIt\u2019s bare.\u201d And freezing.</p><p>\u201cThat it is.\u201d Liam caressed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you moving me in here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hammer shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really a bedroom.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cI converted and expanded a closet into a playroom for the two of us since we were last here. I intended to surprise you for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>Right on cue, guilt pelted her. And she\u2019d screwed it all up by not communicating about dinner or asking his plans or... Raine winced. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the point now.\u201d Liam propped an arm over his bent knee. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved most of the equipment out of the room for this exercise.\u201d</p><p>Which explained why it was bare. \u201cI understand, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t yet, but you will,\u201d Hammer vowed. \u201cSo it\u2019s bare. Is that the only reason you don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chilly in here, too, Sir.\u201d</p><p>It was December, after all. And unless she missed her guess, it would probably snow overnight. The room itself felt subarctic. Liam and Hammer wore suit coats, long-sleeved shirts, trousers, and shoes. They had her dancing around in a transparent nightie and a thong, damn it.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re cold?\u201d Hammer\u2019s tone both patronized and confused her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame.\u201d Liam added with an arch of his brow.</p><p>That\u2019s all they have to say? Raine frowned, looking from one to the other. They stared back expectantly. What the hell were they waiting for?</p><p>Hammer gave her a superior smile, then a sudden gust of even colder air blasted her from above. Somehow, the ceiling fan began to spin faster. What in the world...? She glared at Macen. How had he done that?</p><p>Raine wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cCan we turn the fan down, Sir? Or off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d From his pocket, Hammer withdrew a remote and pointed it at the fan. It clicked off, then the blades wound down slowly until they stilled. Liam rose and made his way to the thermostat on the wall near the door. The moment he adjusted it, Raine felt warm air begin to seep from the vents. \u201cBetter, precious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting there, Sir. Thank you.\u201d Butthead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d A roguish grin curled Hammer\u2019s lips. Liam wore the same expression.</p><p>They were setting some sort of trap, waiting for her to open her mouth and put her foot in it. This cat-and-mouse game confused the hell out of her, but Raine was determined to figure it out and beat them.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you need me to do for this task, Sirs?\u201d she asked, wishing they\u2019d let her sit up. Looking at them hovered above her only made her feel at a disadvantage. Then again, that was by design, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that, love,\u201d Liam assured. \u201cSo you\u2019re comfortable now?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, they knew the heater would take a few minutes to warm the room. Their little smirks told her that. Why didn\u2019t they offer her a blanket to help warm her? Was she supposed to learn something from discomfort? She was more likely to focus if she wasn\u2019t shivering, and this was too important to mess up.</p><p>\u201cActually, could I have a blanket and some socks, please?\u201d</p><p>Proud smiles stretched across their faces at once.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Hammer praised. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>As Macen left the room, Liam edged closer. \u201cAll you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>But if they knew she was cold, why didn\u2019t they just give her a way to fix it? Unless... Hell, they wanted her to say it. They wanted her to communicate.</p><p>And she could just guess what they\u2019d \u201cwork\u201d on for the rest of the evening.</p><p>Oh, shit. She was doomed.</p><p>Raine turned on her side, curling into the fetal position, and faced Liam. No. Somehow, she had to get over this hurdle. In order for them to take another step with her, they must believe she could give them more than Juliet. They had to trust they weren\u2019t headed for tragedy again. She had to open her head or give up the desire to be with them both.</p><p>What\u2019s it going to be? she asked herself.</p><p>No contest.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to communicate, don\u2019t you?\u201d she whispered, looking up at him.</p><p>Liam sent her a wry glance. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting that for weeks now, Raine. But I think I\u2019ve made that plain.\u201d</p><p>He had. She just hadn\u2019t wanted to understand the importance of spilling her guts. But knowing about Juliet now... Lack of communication could tear them apart, and Raine knew she was the only one who could prevent it.</p><p>\u201cI know, Sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, Hammer returned with a soft cotton blanket draped over his arm and a pair of fuzzy black socks in his hand. He bent and drew the blanket over her before kneeling at the foot of the bed. Liam joined him, and together they slid the warm socks over her icy feet.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you need?\u201d Hammer asked, his warm hand lingering on the back of her calf for several long seconds.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Liam trailed his wide palm along her thigh. She warmed at first, then melted a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he turned to Hammer. \u201cShe\u2019s figured it out, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hammer looked incredibly pleased. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t take long. Are you warmer now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t yet? From the anticipation on their faces, she guessed not. Her tummy knotted. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand up, love,\u201d Liam instructed.</p><p>Raine did, biting her lip as she watched them walk toward the tall wooden cross.</p><p>\u201cStrip and come to us, precious,\u201d Hammer ordered. \u201cYou can leave the socks on if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Questions swirled through her brain. They\u2019d centered this task around communication, so she would have to talk. That probably meant she would have to give them some painful truths before they rewarded her with their touch.</p> <p>Shoving down her tinges of disquiet, Raine dropped the blanket and pulled at the silky ribbon tying the baby-doll together just under her breasts. The sheer fabric parted. She shrugged it off her shoulders, letting it caress her arms before it pooled on the floor. Cool air brushed her nipples. A quiver of anticipation sailed up her spine. Her thong turned damp, and she peeled it off, tossing it aside. She\u2019d warmed enough to ditch the socks. Not an inch of her remained hidden. Raw and hungry, Liam\u2019s and Hammer\u2019s hot stares scraped over her flesh.</p><p>The sense of her utter nudity filled her, making her aware of every breath, every heartbeat, every step as she crossed the room.</p><p>Neither said a word as Liam clutched her shoulders and pressed her back against the cool, glossy cross. It towered over her. The wooden slabs intersected beneath her shoulder blades.</p><p>She trembled as Hammer bent to the box on the floor and pulled four fleece-lined cuffs free. He tossed two of them to Liam. In silence, they bound her wrists and ankles, surrounding them in softness. Then they worked in tandem, attaching long, slender carbiner clips to her cuffs before aligning her with the cross and securing her to the lowest eyebolts. She had to stretch her legs a bit wide to reach.</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a wee thing.\u201d</p><p>Raine frowned up at him. \u201cHey, I\u2019m over five feet tall, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Hammer trailed his fingers down the sensitive flesh under her arm. \u201cBy a whole quarter of an inch.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cHalf inch\u2014and it\u2019s an important half inch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is.\u201d Liam brushed a kiss over her lips. \u201cI hope to have the chance to feel every inch of you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Hammer nipped at her ear.</p><p>Her breath caught. If she\u2019d been wearing panties, they would have melted. Though they\u2019d just affixed her to the cross, Raine wondered how much more sensual torture she could endure before she screamed. She\u2019d almost rather talk.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re strung up nice and pretty, we\u2019re going to ask you some questions,\u201d Liam instructed. \u201cYou\u2019ll answer every damn one of them, too.\u201d</p><p>That made her nervous; Hammer was usually the more demanding of the two.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you a choice. We can do this the easy way...\u201d He looked in Liam\u2019s direction.</p> <p>With a grin, Liam bent to her breast and licked one nipple with a teasing flick, then sucked the bud deep into his mouth. She felt the jolt all the way to her clit and gasped in a startled breath.</p><p>\u201cOr we can do this the hard way.\u201d Hammer gave her a tight smile and bent to the wooden box again, withdrawing a TENS unit.</p><p>Her eyes went wide. She\u2019d seen a sub jolt and twist and scream attached to the electrical device. She\u2019d also seen them moan and beg and come. Everything depended on where the electrodes were attached and how intense the Dom made the impulses. Raine didn\u2019t have many illusions; Hammer didn\u2019t know her body exactly, but he knew what to do with the unit itself. It wouldn\u2019t take him long to figure out how to get the reaction he wanted.</p><p>Macen left the room for a brief second and returned with a folding chair, which he opened directly beside her. But he didn\u2019t sit, just set the device on the padded seat, within easy reach. He attached one pad to her bare pubic bone, then another right on top of her clit. As he turned the thing on, she tensed, but still couldn\u2019t precisely brace for the tingling jolt that crept across her skin and up her nerve endings. Logically, stimulation there should give her pleasure. This felt like a whole bunch of ants crawling where they didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Raine tossed her head back and clenched her fists. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, love. We haven\u2019t even started and your mouth has turned foul. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d Liam slapped her thigh. \u201cHammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d He turned the device down to something bearable. Just as she took a deep breath, he turned it back up, a smidge higher than before. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sir,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cIt slipped out. Please turn it down.\u201d</p><p>They stared at her, watching her writhe for a long moment before Hammer slowly reached for the unit and turned it off. \u201cYou\u2019re aware of your two choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Because we can do this all night long.\u201d His superior smile looked every bit smug. \u201cYour safe word?\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to Liam. He knew it, but clearly he meant to make her say it aloud. \u201cParis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d Hammer\u2019s fingers hovered over the dials on the TENS unit, as if he just waited for the opportunity to light her up again.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a favorite teacher in school?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Raine frowned. She\u2019d run away. When she\u2019d returned, she\u2019d given them a pronouncement she thought was life altering: She wanted to learn to open herself to them. And this is what they wanted to know? \u201cUm...yeah. Third grade. Mrs. Denton.\u201d</p><p>Hammer rewarded her with a caress of her breast, a thumb across her nipple, and a hot kiss just below her ear. \u201cAre you comfortable having Beck and Seth here with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she managed to answer, despite the distraction. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Liam caressed his way up her thigh, then glided his fingertips along the cheek of her ass.</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Focusing with their hands caressing her bare skin was more than a little challenging. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any expectations. They just listen and offer advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a fine job, Raine.\u201d Liam bent to her nipple and took one in his mouth.</p><p>As he sucked hard, Hammer toyed with the other. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaramel Caribou.\u201d</p><p>Liam frowned, backing away to stare at her. \u201cWhat the devil is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother necessity to have on hand for that time of the month,\u201d Hammer teased. \u201cAfter the migraine, she turns into a sugar fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not?\u201d Hammer reached for the TENS unit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe so,\u201d Raine rushed to say. \u201cYes, I like ice cream then, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Hammer chuckled and his hand drifted away from the device. \u201cTell him what\u2019s in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s toffee ice cream with caramel cups and ribbons. There\u2019s a chocolate flavor, too.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, precious.\u201d He looked at Liam. \u201cAnother favorite of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather have ice cream now or...\u201d Liam brushed his fingertip up the insides of her thigh, caressing into her folds before easing two fingers inside her. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>Raine swallowed back a gasp. \u201cDefinitely this.\u201d</p><p>Hammer chuckled. \u201cRight answer.\u201d</p><p>She basked in pleasure, then Hammer added to it, pressing himself against her chest and looking straight into her eyes before he took her mouth, demanding everything clear down to her soul.</p><p>When Liam rubbed at a sensitive spot inside her, Hammer swallowed her moan.</p><p>Liam eased his fingers deeper. \u201cAre you wet for us, love?\u201d</p><p>With a last peck, Hammer lifted from the kiss and braced his elbow on the cross above her, still watching her intently. \u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>Raine wanted to point out that Liam had his fingers up her pussy, so he\u2019d be the first to know. Just a guess, but a flippant response would only halt the bliss they\u2019d been heaping on her, and Hammer would turn the TENS unit on again. She hated feeling like ants crawled in her cooch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI have been since you first put me in the car. I\u2019ve wanted you two all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely answer,\u201d Liam crooned. \u201cEven more than we asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good, precious.\u201d Hammer bent to scrape his teeth over her nipple. A flash of pain mellowed quickly and coalesced into a pleasurable hum.</p><p>Liam circled against the sensitive spot high and deep inside her. \u201cWe\u2019re talking. It\u2019s not terribly painful now, is it?\u201d</p><p>Answering\u2014hell, speaking at all\u2014was becoming difficult. Desire gnawed at her, stealing breath, robbing thought. Raine wanted nothing more than to melt against them, beg, do anything to keep these sensations coming.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. It\u2019s heaven.\u201d</p><p>The smirk rolling across Hammer\u2019s face was her only warning that her task was about to become much harder. \u201cWhy did you give your virginity to Zak?\u201d</p><p>Raine jolted. Liam withdrew, and they both stepped back. There it was, the blindside. This was the same damn game Liam had played with her last time she\u2019d come to the lodge, but instead of punishing her with pickles, they\u2019d devised something more physical and sinister.</p><p>Blurting the answer to this question opened up that vulnerable place inside of her that always made her want to shrink back and hide, but she had zero doubt that if she didn\u2019t at least try to get it out, they would not only turn that little dial and make her suffer, but she\u2019d fail them.</p><p>\u201cTo get your attention,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Hammer neither rewarded nor punished\u2014yet. \u201cYou had it. I saw you every day. We talked about school, work, your friends, the club. I answered questions, ate meals with you, took you shopping. You had most of my attention.\u201d</p><p>Looking back over those years, Raine realized Hammer was right. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. You spent every day with me, yes.\u201d She bit her lip. Now, it was going to get painful. \u201cYou spent every night with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were barely eighteen, Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was eighteen, a legal adult. I was tired of you treating me like a child. I thought having sex would prove to you that I wasn\u2019t a kid. I didn\u2019t think you wanted my virginity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have killed for it.\u201d</p><p>The gravity in his tone quieted her. She\u2019d done something she deeply regretted, and it had hurt him. What if she\u2019d learned to communicate years ago? \u201cIf I had told you that I wanted to give it to you then...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never made me that offer, so we\u2019ll never know what I would have done. Did Zak make you feel special and treasured that night?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he knew the answer to this question. Regret poured hot through her. The shame she\u2019d felt that night scalded its way inside her veins again, black, ugly, devastating. \u201cYou know he treated me like trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was a player. And an asshole. I banned him from Shadows after I beat the fuck out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you tried to manipulate Hammer into giving you what you wanted instead of communicating?\u201d Liam questioned. \u201cSex was the last thing your fragile heart needed at the time, but you took matters into your own hands and had a terrible experience. Do I have that right?\u201d</p><p>Humiliation scraped at her as fat tears burned her cheeks. \u201cYes. But I didn\u2019t know what to do. Growing up, anything I made the mistake of admitting I wanted was immediately taken away, destroyed, or killed. If I didn\u2019t want any more broken CDs or dead puppies, I had to keep my mouth shut. In my head, if I told Hammer how I felt, he\u2019d only spurn me. Or worse, kick me out and never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>Both men stood staring at her for a long, silent moment, as if absorbing her words. Then they moved in quickly, surrounding her, their hands and lips soothing her freshly opened wounds. Hammer kissed away her tears, his broad fingers stroking her hair, offering comfort. Liam enveloped her and tilted his head to capture her lips and swallow her sobs. When he lifted away, he gripped her so tenderly, as if trying to keep her from shattering in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI would never have cast you aside, sweet girl,\u201d Hammer breathed as he caught her gaze in his. \u201cYou\u2019re the most precious gift life has ever given me. I may not have shown it, but I\u2019ve treasured every single day you\u2019ve been with me.\u201d</p><p>She saw love in his eyes. It was there, just like Beck had sworn. At that moment, it didn\u2019t matter if Hammer could say the words or not, she saw it, felt it, drank it in, and filled herself with every ounce of it.</p><p>How many years had she convinced herself that he didn\u2019t care? How many ways had she tried to coerce his affection because she simply hadn\u2019t asked? So much wasted time, energy, and heartache. It was too late to change the past. All she could do was move forward, knowing she had his love now. And that if she wanted to keep this connection growing, they had to talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam\u2019s soft lips peppered her cheeks, her nose, her mouth. Looking into his gentle brown eyes, Raine saw compassion and devotion reflected back at her. He had never stopped believing in her, never stopped trying to open her up, never stopped steeping her in his love.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how it was possible, but Raine was falling even more for these men.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing beautifully,\u201d Liam murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re safe. Keep being brave. We\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and nodded as he reached up and wiped her tears with his broad thumb.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you,\u201d Hammer added. \u201cWe know this isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard for us at times, too. But until we open all the wounds and purge what\u2019s inside, we can\u2019t begin to help you heal them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Raine nodded as she slumped against the cross. She had to dig through the past if she was going to embrace her future. Now that she knew she could draw strength from their unwavering tenderness and understanding, she could go on.</p><p>Liam traced his fingertips over her lips. Gazing into her eyes, Raine could see something heavy weighed on his mind. Remembering all the ways she\u2019d dodged his questions in the past, whatever he was about to ask, she owed him nothing but honesty now.</p><p>\u201cWhen I brought you here the first time, we talked about your father. Or rather, I asked and you gave me an abbreviated version of events that basically told me almost nothing. If you\u2019d given me the whole truth, I would have understood you better. I could have helped you more. But you tied my hands with your silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to give up my control or let down my walls, Sir. I\u2019m trying to learn now. Saying I\u2019m sorry isn\u2019t enough, but that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Raine. Why did you hide the truth? I was listening. You had to know I wouldn\u2019t punish you for being honest.\u201d Confusion furrowed his brow. \u201cIf I\u2019d known the truth, we might not be here having this bloody inquisition. Tell me why you kept it in.\u201d</p><p>His words drowned her in guilt. She seemed to be a never-ending pool of it today, as they pointed out all the ways she\u2019d screwed up and she had to take responsibility. But she couldn\u2019t let the shame she\u2019d dragged around like an anvil for years take her under for good.</p><p>She could give Liam excuses\u2014she had plenty\u2014things like she hadn\u2019t known him that well at the time or she hadn\u2019t realized that he\u2019d been so serious about helping her. But they were lame and pointless and would only get in the way.</p><p>Instead, Raine fought for a ragged breath and returned his stare as regret poured from her. \u201cI was afraid to be that vulnerable to you. My father took my power from me. Anything he knew I liked or wanted, he made sure I never got. Then he would crawl into my head and tell me all the ways I wasn\u2019t good enough for those things. He manipulated me and he crushed me.\u201d Tears fell, and she had to force herself to whisper, \u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough to stop him.\u201d</p><p>God, she was so afraid to hear either of them agree with that.</p><p>\u201cStop. I need a minute. I can\u2019t...\u201d She turned her head away. \u201cYou know my most hurtful secret and...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay with us, precious. Are you worried you\u2019re still not strong enough?\u201d Hammer asked, nearly pressing his face to hers. \u201cOr did beating the shit out of him change that?\u201d</p><p>Raine choked back a sob. She even hated the tears running silently down her face. More weakness. But if they were going to spend this much energy helping her, she owed them the ugly truth.</p><p>\u201cIn the moment, I felt so strong. I\u2019d let what he said roll off my back. I\u2019d vanquished him and made him bleed for a change. Then...\u201d She sagged on the cross as a sob took her. \u201cBeck drove me to the beach, and I realized his insults were coiled up in my brain. I thought I\u2019d taken the head off the snake, but I could still hear him hiss. I worry I\u2019ll never be strong enough to block him out.\u201d</p><p>No one moved for a long moment, then Liam and Hammer rushed to unfasten her cuffs from the cross, as if they couldn\u2019t get her down fast enough. Macen peeled away the pads of the TENS unit. Was this it? Had her ugliest truth finally broken their will?</p><p>She risked a peek at Liam. Heartbreak was all over his face as he gathered her in his arms and carried her gently to the bed. Hammer followed close behind, sorrow etched into his expression. Almost as one, they melted to the mattress on their knees.</p><p>Liam settled her on her back. His fingers shook as he cupped her face and kissed every tear away. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you, love. I\u2019m so sorry for all that monster put you through, but he can\u2019t hurt you now\u2014or ever again. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, you\u2019re too strong to let him. He may have taught you to expect the worst in others, but we will always be here. I\u2019ll always protect you. And if I get the chance, I\u2019ll fucking slice the bastard. I\u2019ll make him bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. He\u2019s dangerous. I don\u2019t want him near either of you. Somehow, he knows where I\u2019ve been all these years. He told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he knows where to find you.\u201d Hammer stretched out behind her, stroking her with such uncharacteristic tenderness. \u201cIf he ever comes near you again, he\u2019s a dead man. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat it is, my brave, beautiful lass.\u201d Liam brought her head to his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. Just let it out and know that I love you. I\u2019m amazed by the way you\u2019ve carried on so well for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d She sobbed.</p><p>\u201cGive yourself a bit of credit. You\u2019ve been through more than most, Raine,\u201d Liam whispered. \u201cI saw what you endured. The brutality of it blindsided me. Getting flattened by a truck would have been easier, I think. I can only imagine how you felt. I truly wish I\u2019d known sooner so I could have helped you.\u201d</p><p>On the one hand, Raine completely saw Liam\u2019s point. Maybe if she\u2019d told him everything earlier, she could have started healing and saved them all so much pain. But the more important he\u2019d become to her, the more frightened she\u2019d been to be vulnerable with him. On the other hand, how could he know the extent of her father\u2019s cruelty?</p><p>She froze. \u201cWhat do you mean, you saw it?\u201d</p><p>Hammer exhaled heavily, then eased back. Something\u2014guilt, maybe, or regret\u2014flashed across his strong face. \u201cThere\u2019s something I should tell you. You wouldn\u2019t allow me to call the police after I\u2019d found you. But I needed ammunition against Bill in case he came back for you.\u201d</p><p>Raine\u2019s heart drummed in her chest. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you. All those bruises, the gash in your lip... Hell, I didn\u2019t know whether or not he\u2019d broken your damn eye socket.\u201d As he spoke, he turned both angry and ashen. \u201cI called Beck into your room after you fell asleep. He checked you over to make sure nothing was broken before we could get you to the hospital that next morning. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do, but while we were there, I took pictures of everything that prick had done to you.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI showed them to Liam when you went missing.\u201d</p><p>Raine felt as if he\u2019d yanked the floor out from under her. She fought and struggled, elbowing wildly until she sat up and scurried back, staring at Hammer in horror. \u201cYou took pictures? And kept them for all these years?\u201d She swung her gaze to Liam. \u201cYou saw them?\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is!\u201d She jumped to her feet and glared at Hammer. \u201cYou betrayed my trust and didn\u2019t tell me for six fucking years?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and grabbed her wrist, tumbling her back down flat on her back between them. \u201cWatch your goddamn mouth. I took them to protect you, so I\u2019d have something to show the police if they ever came knocking. They\u2019ve been sitting in my safe all this time, and I only showed Liam because one of us needed to reach you. If it wasn\u2019t me, then he needed to know what demons you were fighting. Blame me and hate me all you want. It doesn\u2019t change what I did. I\u2019d make the same choice again.\u201d</p><p>Something between sincerity and determination filled his face. Raine closed her eyes. Logically, she saw his point, but that didn\u2019t make her ache less. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to see me like that. I wanted you to forget. I didn\u2019t ever want Liam to know.\u201d She tried to curl up into a ball and hide her face. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I wandered the streets for two days before you found me. The second anyone saw me, I ran. By the time you discovered me, I was in so much pain. I meant to leave the next day, but...\u201d Together, he and Liam held her down, not letting her hide. Feeling like that scared girl again, stripped and defeated, she stopped struggling. \u201cCan I be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, precious. I will never forget, and whether you wanted Liam to know or not, he deserves all your truths. The good. The bad. The ugly. Didn\u2019t he already make that point with you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had. Raine couldn\u2019t do more than nod.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to make him love you less, but until you start believing that, you will always want to curl up, close off, and hide. We\u2019re not going to allow that anymore.\u201d Hammer\u2019s voice was calm but stern.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You\u2019ll not be squirming away from my questions ever again,\u201d Liam vowed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not giving up on you. If you\u2019re still thinking that, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, the truth is out and see?\u201d Hammer said. \u201cWe\u2019re still here. We think you\u2019re fierce, a survivor. We\u2019re fucking not walking away. Neither are you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d walked into this task knowing she had to learn to tell them everything. She couldn\u2019t do that if she hid. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m sorry. Stay...\u201d</p><p>Liam rubbed a soothing palm on the small of her back. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t think you grasp yet how much you mean to us. Whatever happens when this is over, don\u2019t think for one minute that you\u2019re not treasured by us both. I never expected to fall for you, Raine. I just wanted to help you along, but you surprised me and stole my heart. Now...\u201d He paused. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could ever say or do to change that.\u201d</p><p>They were forcing her to be cuttingly honest, but they were also giving her their truths. It was costing them to admit their secrets and feelings. They\u2019d both been so reassuring and giving\u2014and far more understanding that she\u2019d ever expected. \u201cI needed to hear that. Will you both kiss me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Hammer stared into Raine\u2019s pleading blue eyes. She looked more fragile than he\u2019d seen her in years, but the courage she\u2019d shown in embracing their task and divulging her worst fears revealed such strength. And commitment. Tonight, she\u2019d come so much further than he\u2019d expected. And she\u2019d blown him away.</p><p>As she lay before him with her soul exposed, his heart swelled. She radiated a need for reassurance, and Hammer ached to give it to her. She deserved a reward. But goddamn it, if his cock didn\u2019t throb in demand, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve earned a kiss and so much more, precious. But not here. Back in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely, love,\u201d Liam crooned. \u201cKissing you will be our pleasure.\u201d</p><p>The way she smiled up at them pumped Hammer full of more power than he could ever recall and stuffed his lungs until he felt ready to burst. Being a part of her progress\u2014watching her blossom\u2014gave him such a profound sense of accomplishment.</p><p>He and Liam shared a glance, then he scooped her up in his arms. Liam opened the door, then dashed back to blow out the candles before trailing them down the long hall, into the master suite.</p><p>Wall sconces on either side of the bed glowed. Ambient light spilled over the golden silk duvet. Liam surged ahead and shoved the mountain of pillows from the bed with a wide sweep of his arm. He\u2019d have to remember to thank his old friend later. No time now.</p><p>Hammer eased Raine onto the bed and covered her with his body. He pinned her to the mattress with a knee between her thighs, cupped her nape, and slanted his lips over hers, taking complete possession. Under him, she arched and whimpered, throwing her arms around his neck, open and welcoming as she swallowed in all his hunger and gave it back tenfold.</p><p>Lost in the sweet sea of her mouth, Hammer barely noticed the sounds of clothing rustling in the background\u2014until Liam appeared at his side, pressing kisses across Raine\u2019s shoulder and down her arm. He was bare from the waist up.</p><p>After one more stroke inside her mouth, Hammer pulled away. Raine wasn\u2019t exclusively his, and he couldn\u2019t hoard her. Besides, he wanted the opportunity to press his naked skin to hers as well.</p><p>Rolling to his feet, Hammer toed off his loafers, watching Liam pull Raine beneath him. The man pressed his forehead to hers. They shared a breath, a silent, suspended moment. Hammer had seen the two of them together before, but now a new intimacy flourished. He could almost see how bare she\u2019d laid her soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m desperate to touch you, love,\u201d Liam murmured as he smoothed the dark hair from her face.</p><p>Raine clung to him, gripping his shoulders, then gliding over the tops until she thrust a hand in his hair. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Liam took her chin in his hand and tilted her to his descending lips. Their kiss was somehow raw and tender at once. Hammer couldn\u2019t ignore the devotion flowing between them. He\u2019d been completely against the two of them at first...and now he couldn\u2019t deny that Raine had grown immensely because Liam had nudged and demanded that she emerge from her shell. Hell, he\u2019d all but walked through fire for her. And she\u2019d finally responded, giving them both the chance to see the stunning submissive just under her skin. But Raine had also been good for Liam. He\u2019d never seen the man so centered, committed...in love.</p><p>Tearing off his coat and shirt, Hammer littered the carpet with the garments, then stalked back to the bed, drinking in the sight of Liam and Raine tangled together. Maybe it should bother him, but he knew she hadn\u2019t given him any less of herself. She\u2019d climbed an emotional mountain for them tonight. As much as he hated to admit it, Hammer wasn\u2019t sure he could have managed this much progress with her this quickly if he\u2019d been working alone. He knew Liam couldn\u2019t; it was why he\u2019d uncollared her. If they both truly held a part of her heart, then nothing short of working together to make her whole would do.</p><p>Raine gripped Liam\u2019s neck as he began to ease away. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he promised, propping himself on his elbow beside her. \u201cWe\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>Hammer crowded along the other side of her body, pressing his lips to hers again. He closed his eyes, and she put her small palm to his chest. He groaned. So sweet. And when he looked into her eyes again, she smiled with her soul. Damn it, the girl had always touched his heart, but now he could feel her holding it, squeezing it, feeding it.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d Liam said thickly before he took her mouth again and cupped her breast, flicking the hard pink nipple with his thumb.</p><p>Something between a groan and a gasp fell from her lips. Her body trembled. So delicate, so eager... Hammer covered her neck in kisses, then dragged his lips down, laving his way over the full swells.</p><p>\u201cYou are, precious,\u201d he whispered into her skin.</p><p>Her eyes slid shut, and the look of utter bliss on her face went straight to his cock. She arched, and her nipple brushed his lips. Fuck, he wanted to suck her in and take her deep, hear her moan, feel her scratch at him for more. With a shuddering breath, he barely managed to refrain.</p><p>A glance up showed Liam watching, poised, tensed. He dragged his thumb over her other nipple again. Another of Raine\u2019s little feminine cries slipped free.</p><p>Hammer hung onto sanity by the barest of threads. \u201cIf you want more than a kiss, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse what we taught you today,\u201d Liam seconded.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. Her gaze pinged between them both. \u201cI need more. My nipples ache. I ache...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Liam whispered right over the bud. \u201cI might need to hear you beg for it.\u201d</p><p>Hammer licked a path just around her nipple, not yet giving Raine what she wanted. \u201cPlead sweetly, precious. Tell us what you want\u2014in explicit detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease put your mouths on my nipples. Suck them,\u201d she panted. \u201cI\u2019m dying...\u201d</p><p>He and Liam exchanged a glance. His friend grinned, then down they went, their heads descending to her breasts together. The most delicious sense of conspiracy filled him. And as they drew her hard tips into their mouths, Raine gasped in desperation, curling a clinging hand around each of their napes. An abiding sexual thrill plowed through him. Jesus, she was going to burn them alive.</p><p>Her nipple hardened even more against his tongue. Under them, she moved restlessly, her hips lifting, her legs spreading. God, what he wouldn\u2019t give to lower himself down there and lick her juicy cunt before he fucked her senseless. He could smell her. Surely Liam could, too. But somehow, they were going to have to hold themselves at bay. This was her reward, not a chance for he and his pal to get off. Besides, as naked as they\u2019d stripped her psyche today, they couldn\u2019t push her too far. Despite Raine\u2019s strength, her spirit would be breakable tonight. They couldn\u2019t risk her when they still had so much work to do. The sex would happen another day\u2014at least he hoped and prayed so. Because the idea of sinking his cock deep inside her again in any way absolutely lit him on fire.</p><p>Right now, he just didn\u2019t know how much further he could push his control.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried out. \u201cYou\u2019re both sucking and it\u2019s...oh, it\u2019s jolting straight to my clit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Liam tormented her with a rough whisper. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you need more?\u201d Hammer added, stroking a hand down her belly, his fingertips playing where he\u2019d shaved off her landing strip just hours ago. The heat rising from her cunt left him no doubt how needy she was.</p><p>When she shifted and tried to tempt him to touch her slick folds, he delivered a little slap to her pussy. \u201cAre you supposed to manipulate or communicate, Raine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommunicate. Sorry, Sir,\u201d she gasped. \u201cPlease touch me.\u201d</p><p>Hammer dragged his palm back over her stomach. \u201cI am, precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d Liam added, pinching and twisting her nipples. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch my pussy, Sirs. Both of you. Please,\u201d she choked out. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>Across her body, he exchanged another glance with Liam. But they were on the same page; he saw it in the man\u2019s midnight eyes. Neither of them could deny her now.</p><p>Scooping his hand between her legs, Hammer petted her drenched pussy, then worked a pair of fingers into her tight opening. Goddamn it, she was so swollen. Instantly, she clenched down on his digits, and he could just imagine how fucking good it would feel to bury his cock there.</p><p>Dragging in a breath and praying for restraint, he filled her, rooting around for her most sensitive spot. He found it in seconds, thrilled to feel her sink her little nails into his arm as she gave them a long, dazzling groan.</p><p>Liam cupped the pad of her pussy and began rubbing a slow, torturous circle. As soon as he did, she looked up at him with an imploring stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, love?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on edge all day,\u201d she squeaked out.</p><p>\u201cAs have we.\u201d Liam pressed and kneaded the flesh just above her clit. \u201cTouching you is a beautiful hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn for us,\u201d Hammer demanded. \u201cAche, need, writhe, and whimper so we can soak it in.\u201d</p><p>Raine did. She flushed and cried out, tensing, body bowing, hips wriggling. Around his fingers she swelled and clenched, squeezing even tighter. The flutters of her cunt rippled along the digits. He sent a warning glance at Liam, but his friend was already pulling back.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, please...\u201d She breathed so hard, her words were broken.</p><p>\u201cAsk us for it,\u201d Hammer growled.</p><p>\u201cPlease... Let me come, Sirs.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. Tears of need leaked from the corners. Her breathing was shallow. Her whole body yearned.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything so fucking gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Come for us.\u201d Liam\u2019s smoky whisper warmed her breast before he took her nipple deep between his lips again.</p><p>\u201cLook at us, precious.\u201d Hammer plunged his fingers deeper. \u201cAnd scream.\u201d</p><p>In seconds, her eyes flashed wide. Every muscle in her body sat poised on the edge. As Liam rubbed at her clit once more and Hammer grazed his fingertips across the smooth bundle of nerves, Raine opened her mouth and let loose a high, belting mewl of satisfaction. It filled the room, jerked at his cock, and provided the most amazing soundtrack to the epic bucking of her body as orgasm gripped her, endless and incredible. Her blue eyes glowed with desperate love.</p><p>Raine\u2019s ecstasy jolted a shaft of heady satisfaction through him. They had done this for her. He felt every inch like her Dom. A glance at Liam told Hammer that his old friend felt exactly the same.</p><p>A long minute later, the bliss released its hold on her. Raine sagged back to the bed, eyes closed, panting, shaking, and spent. Moments later, tears began to fall. Then sobs wracked her, dredging up emotions he suspected she\u2019d long buried and wrenching them from deep inside.</p><p>He and Liam closed around her, each trapping one of her thighs under their own, wrapping an arm around her middle. Liam pressed soothing kisses to her lips gently as she wept.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, love. You\u2019ve given us everything we\u2019ve asked for and more. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Hammer breathed, wrestling his urge to claim her. \u201cI\u2019ve never received that much raw honesty. It\u2019s a gift I will never forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget it, either. Thank you both.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>He cradled her cheek and pressed his lips to her temple, her nose, her lips, then circled back again. Liam whispered to her, taking turns at her mouth as she clutched them like they were her lifelines.</p><p>Slowly, her crying quieted. Peace began to settle into her. With the sweetest touches, she stroked their faces, shoulders, arms, sending them tremulous smiles. God, he wasn\u2019t even going to come close to fucking her now, and yet he would count this as one of the most meaningful nights of his life. Raine just moved him. She always had. Even if she went back to Liam after she healed, she always would.</p><p>The thought was a machete to the heart. Never feeling her again...it just wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our pleasure to take care of you,\u201d Hammer assured Raine. Then before he could give into the urge to yank his zipper down and seat himself deep inside her, he rolled away and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring you some water. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>As he shrugged on his shirt, Liam stood as well and bent to recover his clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll run you a fresh bath. Do you need anything else, love?\u201d</p><p>Raine rose to her hands and knees and scrambled off the edge of the bed. Hammer watched with a frown as she dashed toward them, staring up with the most earnest plea. Submissive need oozed from her pores. She glowed with it. Trembled with it.</p><p>Then she sank to her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t need water or a bath. I don\u2019t need anything except to give back to you, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. The pulse at her neck fluttered. Hammer couldn\u2019t stop himself from tangling his fingers in her hair.</p><p>Beside him, Liam cupped her chin. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo give you pleasure.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI want to touch you...make you come. Please, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>Hammer looked Liam\u2019s way. He\u2019d yearned to see her willingness to submit, but he\u2019d been afraid to hope that she would need to yield herself so totally. For a long moment, he couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t speak. Liam looked as bowled over as he did.</p><p>\u201cSay something?\u201d she begged.</p><p>Liam bent and caressed her cheek. \u201cOh, love...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I need to be needed.\u201d Tears shimmered in her eyes. \u201cI have to give you the pleasure you gave me. You don\u2019t have to say a word or even touch me. Just let me...\u201d</p><p>Raine reached up. Through the material of his trousers, she fitted her hand over Liam\u2019s cock, curling her fingers around his length. He almost stumbled as he tossed his head back and groaned. Then she did the same to Hammer, stroking his length through his pants. Blood rushed to his dick like a flash flood.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a breath of fresh air, mate?\u201d Liam managed to grate out as Raine\u2019s delicate hand clutched at him.</p><p>\u201cMe? No.\u201d Hammer shook his head and arched into her other palm. \u201cFuck no. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAir is the last thing I\u2019m thinking of.\u201d Liam pressed his hands over hers and made her grip him tighter.</p><p>The relief on her face was excruciating\u2014and sexy as hell.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can please us, precious.\u201d Hammer\u2019s voice turned rough. \u201cOpen that sinful little mouth and take every fucking inch we have to offer.\u201d</p><p>He peeled her hand away from his cock. Liam did the same, then they extended a hand to help her from the floor. Raine\u2019s slender fingers curled around his, sending a jolt of demand through his veins. Together, he and Liam sat her on the edge of the bed. He could almost feel the anxious hum rolling off her.</p><p>In unison, they unzipped and released their swollen erections. Liam fisted his thick shaft as he stepped between her legs, kneeing her thighs wide before cupping her chin. With a rapt stare, Hammer nearly groaned as Raine looked up, begging Liam in a silent, blue-eyed plea.</p><p>\u201cOh, love...\u201d He slipped his swollen cock between her waiting lips.</p><p>They moaned together. Hammer could almost feel the silken fire of her mouth as she suckled the head of Liam\u2019s cock, then worked down and laved the shaft in a slow push to the base. She filled her mouth, hollowed her cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hammer stroked himself and bit back a growl of demand. Fuck, even watching her tongue dart around Liam\u2019s cock before she sucked him deep again made Hammer grit his teeth. His blood pumped with fire. She made little noises and gripped Liam\u2019s thighs, looking lost in pleasure as she worshipped his stiff length. Christ, three weeks of desire churned in his heavy balls, and he needed to be inside her in some way, stake whatever claim he could.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head as a low moan rumbled from his chest and he shoved his fingers in her hair, tugging lightly until she whimpered and swallowed him whole again.</p><p>Son of a bitch, if that wasn\u2019t one of the hottest things he ever witnessed, not because he\u2019d never seen a woman give another man a blow job. Because Raine ached to give. Liam needed to take. Love bound them together, brought them closer. They both looked so damn fulfilled.</p><p>Hammer couldn\u2019t resist reaching out and gliding his knuckles along the delicate hollows of her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s it, precious. Suck him down deep. So pretty. Fuck, I can\u2019t wait to feel your mouth.\u201d Needing to be closer, he wrapped a hand around her nape, choking back a rumble as he watched her take Liam even deeper. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Worship his cock, Raine. Take everything he gives you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping, fucker.\u201d Liam grimaced as he thrust fast and deep for a blissful, teeth-gritting second. Sweat lined his brow as he panted and pulled away. \u201cI need a minute.\u201d</p><p>Hammer wanted to laugh, but the need bubbling inside him screamed for the feel of her tongue trailing over his sensitive crest, cradling his cock. As Liam gasped for breath, Hammer took hold of her mane and turned her head to him.</p><p>Gazing down at the woman who haunted his dreams, he drank in her hard, dusky nipples. Her creamy flesh glowed with a pink, aroused hue. Wet and swollen, her lips all but begged to be fucked. It took every ounce of strength not to pound at her like an animal. He wanted what Liam had just felt. The desire, yes. But the connection, the completion. He fucking needed those.</p><p>As Hammer gazed down at Raine, her big blue eyes spoke the silent words he\u2019d forever longed to hear: I give you my soul, Sir. I\u2019m yours.</p><p>I\u2019m yours, too, precious, he vowed.</p><p>Clenching his jaw, Hammer rattled in a breath, then drew his leaking crest over her lips. \u201cPart those pretty lips and show me how you yearn to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Raine glided her tongue over her bottom lip, swiping at his offering. A groan ripped from his chest. She was killing him, and she hadn\u2019t even begun.</p><p>His stare never wavered as he wrapped a fist around his aching cock. At the rush of breath spilling from her lips over the sensitive head, he jerked, then pressed into her willing mouth. Hammer\u2019s heart clutched as she closed around him. As she licked her way down his throbbing length, a moan escaped him. It turned to an agonized roar as she danced back up to drag her tongue across the sensitive rim and glide over his swollen veins.</p><p>\u201cYou look stunning, love,\u201d Liam praised. Crouching in front of her, he nudged her legs even wider. \u201cShow us your cunt, Raine. We can smell your hot spice, but we want to see your swollen slickness.\u201d He ran a finger through her folds. \u201cYes, you like Hammer\u2019s cock gliding down your throat, don\u2019t you? I can tell. He likes it, too.\u201d</p><p>She writhed and whimpered, splaying herself even wider as she rolled her hips in need. Hammer drank her in, their gazes still locked, wishing to fuck this could go on forever.</p><p>\u201cSeeing your lips stretched around me, feeling you take me all the way down...\u201d</p><p>Raine did it then, swallowing on him. He grunted a curse, trying to keep himself together.</p><p>Clawing for control, Hammer found his rhythm. Her soft throat constricted around his crest again, and he rocked, fucking his way into her mouth, loving the feel of her nails in his hips and her teeth grazing over the head of his cock before she paused, made him wait, and started all over again.</p><p>Jesus, she was dismantling him without a word.</p><p>Liam skimmed his palms up her torso, then plucked and pinched Raine\u2019s nipples. Her mewls vibrated up Hammer\u2019s shaft, all the way to his aching balls. Sweat dripped from his forehead. The familiar prickle of release slammed down his spine. With a curse, he jerked away from Raine\u2019s seeking lips and tried to calm the tremors wracking his body.</p><p>Without hesitation, Liam stood and thrust between her lips once more as she took him deep, again and again, until he looked staggered and on the edge. With a curse, he withdrew once more, and Hammer resumed.</p><p>Seamlessly, each took up where the other left off. For long minutes, they each filled her mouth, riding the edge of control and prolonging their pleasure.</p><p>Hammer\u2019s skin felt too tight. He struggled for breath as he watched Liam command her once again, recognizing the moment ecstasy peaked and he began to spiral out of control.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Don\u2019t stop,\u201d Liam roared, locking stares with her. \u201cOhhhhffffuck, Raine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink him down,\u201d Hammer urged her.</p><p>\u201cHarder! Suck harder,\u201d Liam gasped. \u201cTake it all.\u201d</p><p>Hammer watched him buck furiously. He grunted and growled while Raine\u2019s slender throat worked to swallow every drop. Her feminine little moans went straight to his cock. And as Liam pulled out, she kissed the man\u2019s hip, then stared up at him, her eyes begging for reassurance.</p><p>Their give and take hadn\u2019t just aroused Hammer; it moved him. Hanging by a thread, he barely resisted the urge to shove his friend aside, grab her by the hair, and launch deep.</p><p>\u201cThank you, love.\u201d Liam struggled to recover his breathing as he dropped to the bed, sliding in behind her. \u201cThat was perfect. Give Hammer the relief he needs now. Open for him, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up as Hammer finally positioned himself between her legs. A coy smile turned her lips up as she cupped his sac in her palm and gave a gentle tug. \u201cDid you want something, Macen?\u201d</p><p>His restraint snapped. He plunged his fingers through her tresses and shoved into her mouth, to the back of her throat. Her silky heat surrounded him as she hollowed her cheeks and sucked hard, the ride fast, furious. Hammer burned with the shocking jolt of pleasure. He refused to look away from her for even a second. She was his for now, and he intended to burn this one glorious moment into his brain.</p><p>As he fucked her lips with hard, demanding strokes, his breathing grew labored. His body tensed as tingles sizzled under his skin. Every nerve ending blazed. Absorbed in the rightness of Raine and the silky heat of her mouth, his need to mark her drove him. He breathed like bellows, gritting for air between clenched teeth as orgasm brewed at the base of his spine.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Liam breathed against her ear. \u201cWatch him. See what you\u2019re doing to him. Open wider. Let him fuck your mouth like he\u2019s ached to for years, love. Show him how much you need him, too.\u201d</p><p>Raine whimpered. Her gaze beseeched him. That was all it took.</p><p>A thunderous growl ripped from Hammer\u2019s chest as he exploded. Spasms gripped his shaft, cradled by her fiery tongue, as he jettisoned down her throat. His ears buzzed. His limbs numbed. He watched in awe as Raine gulped and swallowed, her gaze still clinging to him.</p><p>When the room stopped spinning, Hammer eased from her mouth and collapsed onto the bed. Raine curled up between them, exhaling a sigh of contentment. With a shaky hand, Hammer smoothed a palm down her arm. She wore a little smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, precious, that was...\u201d A smile tugged one corner of his mouth. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sirs.\u201d She beamed and blushed all at once. \u201cI enjoyed that.\u201d</p><p>Liam eased her to her side, wrapping an arm around her and cuddling her back against him. Her eyes drifted shut as Liam glided his hands over her body, bathing her in gentle affection. Raine purred like a sated kitten as they nestled her between them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you, Raine,\u201d Hammer murmured in her ear before he brushed his lips over hers. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>With a little moan, she smiled up at him. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo generous,\u201d Liam crooned. \u201cAnd so fucking sexy.\u201d</p><p>She peeked over her shoulder at him. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you both, that\u2019s exactly how you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep now, darling girl. You\u2019ve more than earned it.\u201d Hammer cupped her head and ran his fingers through her hair.</p><p>Liam traced indiscriminate patterns over her stomach with his fingertips. \u201cIs bre\u00e1 liom t\u00fa, siubhail. I love you, sweetheart. Now dream of us. We\u2019ll be here when you awaken.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s heart was in his throat. Liam made it seem so easy, almost natural, to tell Raine how he felt about her. Soon, Macen vowed, he would have a chance to say those same three words to her. He just prayed it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Liam whispered. Tenderly, he stroked her delicate face.</p><p>He loved watching Raine sleep because she gave herself over completely. It was the only time she let go of all her fears and trusted him enough to protect her. It was the only time she really let go.</p><p>At least before today.</p><p>What she\u2019d given of herself to him and to Hammer earlier had gone above and beyond his every expectation. He ached with love.</p><p>\u201cPrecious?\u201d Macen called in a low voice.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move a muscle, drugged by the blissful respite.</p><p>Christ, Liam wanted to stay in bed with her and hold her tight, breathing in her heady scent all damn night. But he knew they needed to debrief, prepare for tomorrow, and find a fucking drink.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t wake now. We\u2019re good to go. And we won\u2019t be far if she needs us.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, he rolled to the side of the bed, stood on legs still shaking, and zipped his trousers. He heard Hammer do the same before they walked to the door. At the doorway, they both peered back at her. Raine\u2019s dark mane spilled over the white pillow. She looked so small and vulnerable, all but swallowed up in the big bed.</p><p>With a faint smile, Liam ambled down the stairs, his body still humming with the sensations of her soft mouth engulfing him. After spending all day with a cock that could have pounded nails through concrete, they\u2019d watched as she\u2019d climaxed so beautifully under their hands. Under their control. It had taken every ounce of restraint not to fuck her mouth like a wild man and shoot his seed down her throat in two seconds flat. It had helped knowing Hammer suffered in equal measure.</p><p>Neither said a word as they made their way to the great room. At the liquor cabinet, he passed Hammer a bottle of tequila as Liam accepted the Scotch offered in return. They knew one another so well, and Liam took comfort in that.</p><p>After pouring their drinks, they settled into matching armchairs before a roaring fire, each taking a few silent moments to reflect. He stared at the flames, then shifted his attention to the wall of windows along the front of the lodge. Gazing out into the wide vista, he saw the cotton-like hue muting the moon and shrouding the snowcapped mountains. No doubt, snow was on the way.</p><p>Hammer raised his glass, a satisfied smile spreading across his face. \u201cTo a hell of a job well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo good beginnings. Dea-shl\u00e1inte.\u201d Liam raised his glass. He couldn\u2019t help but grin, too, before they both tossed back a healthy swallow. After a fiery gulp of the alcohol, he sat back in his chair, content for the moment. \u201cWe did it. We reached Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd managed to set aside our jealousy for a whole day,\u201d Hammer drawled.</p><p>Liam nodded. And didn\u2019t that shock the fuck out of him? Though he couldn\u2019t lie to himself; the first few miles in the car had been excruciating. As Raine had cued into them, listening, obeying, becoming aroused... Somehow, he hadn\u2019t thought as much of his jealousy then.</p><p>\u201cWe did. I think, in part, because she\u2019s an amazing woman. And we\u2019re giving her exactly what she\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt about it. But I also think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve done this before, even though Raine responded so differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan Juliet?\u201d Liam finished. \u201cYes, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but a part of me feels guilty. The connection with Raine feels ten times deeper and more powerful than it did with my own wife.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise Liam. Now that Hammer wasn\u2019t trying to hide it, even Raine should be able to see the love Macen had for her.</p><p>\u201cSomething about all this feels... Shit, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Hammer scrubbed a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cFamiliar but not. So it wasn\u2019t just me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hammer looked at him long and hard before he spoke again. \u201cWhat just happened upstairs was... It blew my mind. Do you think that\u2019s what it was supposed to feel like before?\u201d</p><p>Liam swirled the liquor in his glass before taking a sip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever felt that sort of bonding or connection with another person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompared to Raine, I see now that Juliet only went through the motions. I guess she thought it was what we wanted. No. What I wanted. No wonder her heart wasn\u2019t in it. God, I was so fucking full of myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet it go, Macen. It\u2019s ancient history. I don\u2019t know what was going on in her head and neither do you. But now, we\u2019ve got to put all our focus on Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, man. In my wildest dreams, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d respond to us like she just did. Raine did more than peek around her walls; she tore them down before our eyes.\u201d A look of wonder spread over Hammer\u2019s face before a smirk curled his lips. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t throw a right hook all damn day. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head with a faint smile. \u201cI could say the same to you. You\u2019re not going to try and convince me that you didn\u2019t want to take a swing too?\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to give her any reason to stop what we were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Liam raised his glass again. \u201cTo self-restraint.\u201d</p><p>Hammer chuckled and lifted his tumbler.</p><p>\u201cI guess we know that she\u2019s serious now about opening herself.\u201d Liam stared at the fire licking over the logs, recalling how Raine pushed ahead and persevered to meet their every demand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I thought we\u2019d spend at least the first few days trying to pry most everything out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust because she\u2019s done well so far, we can\u2019t give her any wiggle room,\u201d Hammer warned. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to make sure she leaves her defenses down for the rest of the tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Otherwise it will be too easy for her to slip back into old habits. But it\u2019s a hell of a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gives me hope, man. Definitely gives me hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m sorry about the photos. I didn\u2019t mean to walk right into that one.\u201d Liam grimaced.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. She needed the truth sooner or later. But fuck, I hated hurting her that way. Betraying her wasn\u2019t at all what I\u2019d intended. I should have told her about them long before now.\u201d</p><p>Liam sent Hammer a speculative look. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told her that you\u2019re in love with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d Hammer barked.</p><p>If they were mending fences, Liam was tired of tiptoeing around his friend. The time had come to lay everything out in the open.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, mate. You should have told her. She\u2019s never held back how she feels about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything that happened today tells me that you\u2019re right. I should have confessed my feelings a long time ago. I just let all the other fears and bullshit get in the way. Fuck me.\u201d Hammer shook his head. \u201cNow that I\u2019m ready to say it, it\u2019s not the right time or place. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll distract her from what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here. Besides, her telling me that she loves me is only a recent thing. I may have suspected but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to hear her say those words to me.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s mouth hung open in shock. \u201cShe never has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because she hasn\u2019t said the words doesn\u2019t mean... Christ. You\u2019re joking, right? Can\u2019t you see the way she looks at you? You have to know she loves you.\u201d</p> <p>He hoped. Wanted. Pined, even. But he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Liam stood and walked to the windows. \u201cShe feels something for me, but I still need to bloody hear it.\u201d</p><p>He felt Hammer stroll up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can see it\u2019s tearing you up. But trust me, she\u2019ll tell you. Be patient. She\u2019ll sort things out and say the words you want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I shared your confidence. I sure as hell don\u2019t want her learning how to share her heart by your example,\u201d Liam poked.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, asshole.\u201d Hammer laughed, then sobered quickly. \u201cI did the best I could at the time with both you and Raine. The hiding and evasions snowballed somehow. The truth hurt too much. Before I knew it, the avalanche of hurt and confusion buried me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shut me out again, Macen. I would have been there for you. I still am, you bloody wanker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, man. Thank you.\u201d Hammer gripped him in a brotherly hug and smacked him on the back.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we done measuring our cocks now?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cBecause mine is still bigger than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your fucking dreams.\u201d Hammer chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSee, I told you they were idiots,\u201d Seth grumbled as he and Beck strolled into the room. \u201cThey\u2019re even talking about whipping them out and comparing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, there\u2019s nothing wrong with their size or mojo. I think everyone who lives on the mountain overheard Raine\u2019s screams.\u201d Beck smirked.</p><p>Liam and Hammer exchanged a smug look of pride.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me to my next question.\u201d Seth groaned and adjusted the swell beneath the zipper of his jeans. \u201cAre there any available women at this godforsaken altitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bugger off. There\u2019s a bottle of lotion under the sink in your bathroom. Have a grand time with your fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust jack off quietly,\u201d Hammer instructed.</p><p>\u201cAnd clean up afterward. I don\u2019t want Ngaire having to mop up behind you.\u201d Liam laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou two made a Raine sandwich, I take it?\u201d Beck asked with a leering grin.</p><p>\u201cYou perverts.\u201d Hammer scoffed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fuck her. We rewarded her for a job well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s any of your bloody business,\u201d Liam growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, technically it is. You brought us up this mountain to help, so...yeah, we need to know if you gave her a good reward or a mind-blowing one. By the sound of her screams, I\u2019d say she definitely got her mind blown.\u201d Seth grinned. \u201cWish I could have seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up and get a drink,\u201d Hammer grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a hell of a breakthrough you need to hear about.\u201d</p><p>As the four men settled in near the fireplace, he and Macen told the others about the inroads they\u2019d made with Raine. Liam was still in awe at how she\u2019d burst open and shared her soul with them both. They\u2019d worked as a team, like they had in the past\u2014but better, more naturally. It reassured him that he and Hammer were on the same page. Same page, nothing. It felt as if they\u2019d started writing a new chapter in their friendship. After the chasm that had so recently divided them, mending the fracture felt damn good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to play devil\u2019s advocate here,\u201d Beck began. \u201cBut are you sure you two didn\u2019t have her so revved up, she responded that completely just to get off?\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m well versed in the ways she maneuvers from the truth. There wasn\u2019t even a whisper of that today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too cocky yet,\u201d Seth warned. \u201cShe\u2019s still got a hell of a lot of work ahead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Hammer growled as if taking offense to the other man\u2019s words. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d Seth raised his hand, staving off Macen\u2019s glare. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is tomorrow might not be as easy as today. I\u2019m just trying to prepare you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never said it would be easy,\u201d Liam agreed. \u201cBut then I was mostly thinking for her, not us. Seems like she\u2019s not the only one learning a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Beck leaned in to study first Hammer, then Liam.</p><p>\u201cHer home life.\u201d Hammer slammed back a gulp as if steeling himself to continue. \u201cBill did a number on her emotionally and physically, far worse than we\u2019d known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sick, fucking prick killed off anything she coveted. Her dreams, goddamn puppies she wanted for pets... The son of a bitch needs to die a slow, painful death. And I\u2019d love to be the one to do it, too.\u201d Liam felt his anger boil again.</p><p>\u201cGet in line, man. I\u2019m right there with you.\u201d Hammer nodded with a tight set of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cSounds like she\u2019s going to need the first part of tomorrow\u2019s task even more.\u201d The look on Beck\u2019s face revealed the depth of his concern.</p><p>Liam had harbored contempt for Beck almost from day one. He\u2019d noticed the friendship between the brash, tattooed Dom and Hammer when he\u2019d first arrived. It had crawled under his skin that another was privy to his best mate on more than a surface level. Even though the resentment made him feel like a girl, it scorched him. But after the day they\u2019d spent working with Raine, Beck had grown on him. And Liam himself had a new understanding; he and Hammer still shared a bond deeper than brothers. Far deeper than Beck or any other could imagine.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like she\u2019s needed what you both have to offer for a long time.\u201d Seth tossed back a shot of bourbon with a hiss. \u201cI\u2019m glad you two didn\u2019t make us drag out the two-by-fours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a last resort.\u201d Beck chuckled. \u201cThey\u2019d just try to shove them up our asses.\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffed. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>The sling of insults continued a few minutes longer before they all buckled down and got back to business. They discussed strategy and collectively agreed to a plan of action.</p><p>One by one, the other men left for their beds while Liam sat before the dying embers. Pondering all he\u2019d once had with Raine, praying he could have it again...but better than before. He could see a future with the girl so very clearly, and he ached down to his marrow for it.</p><p>Placing his empty tumbler on the side table, he thought about Hammer. He didn\u2019t want to focus on how deeply they both loved Raine. But it was a fact he couldn\u2019t deny. Facing the reality that the dream of ever having her for himself again might be nothing more than fantasy chilled him. He hated the way his jealousy made him feel, but he owed himself the same honesty and openness he and Hammer demanded of Raine.</p><p>It seemed much longer than a few short weeks ago that his life had been uncomplicated and predictable. The struggles he now faced were nothing compared to her ultimate happiness. Come what may, it satisfied something inside him to see her blossom beneath their hands. Their voices. Their will. She became something more with them both, someone more... He had no words for it yet, just an inkling of something not quite free of the shadows. But when it revealed itself, when they could see all of her soul, it would be the most priceless gift he\u2019d ever received.</p><p>Climbing the stairs, he reached her room. With a soft snick of the handle, he peeked inside. She lay just as they\u2019d left her, buried deep beneath the covers, only her nose and dark hair peeking free.</p><p>The need to go to her damn near overwhelmed him. It surprised him, too. But it shouldn\u2019t have. Raine had always had that effect on him, from the very first time he\u2019d seen her. He\u2019d been so torn, never sure whether to beat her ass black and blue, fuck her senseless, or hold her against him and feel their hearts beat together\u2014none of which she\u2019d minded too much. And always to protect her, to keep her safe from whatever frightened her that he couldn\u2019t see. But he knew what she feared now, and something inside him raged for the injustices she\u2019d endured. He couldn\u2019t have helped her as a child, but he could love the woman now. Liam hoped it would be enough.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Coaxing voices drew Raine from the inky depths of sleep. The heat of two solid bodies surrounded her. Crisp soap and a familiar mix of male spices filled her senses. A little smile played at her lips before she even opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTime to wake up, love.\u201d</p><p>Liam. She\u2019d grown to love the sound of his voice first thing in the morning. When she\u2019d worn his collar and slept in his bed, she had often drifted off anticipating what his first words would be the following morning\u2014and how much they\u2019d make her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping the day away, precious, at least not alone.\u201d</p><p>Hammer. The rare times he\u2019d awakened her in the past had usually been about Shadows, but business sounded like the last thing on his mind now.</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw them each leaning over her, already showered, dressed, and immaculate. Definitely sexy. She sighed happily. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Contentment warmed her. Happy, safe, and sheltered, Raine felt sleep tug at her again. She snuggled deeper under the blankets and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t. Up with you, wench!\u201d Liam pulled back the covers. The cold air blasted her skin and pebbled her nipples as he rolled her to her side to swat her bare butt.</p><p>It startled far more than hurt. At her yelp, Hammer chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t move, I\u2019ll take that as a sign you\u2019d like to be spanked again,\u201d Macen murmured in her ear.</p><p>Raine giggled. \u201cAnd what if I would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemanding little brat.\u201d Hammer shook his head with mock concern.</p><p>\u201cA pretty one, though. But we\u2019ll have to do something about that saucy mouth, however.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes glittered with mischief as he raked her with a hungry gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a bad girl,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Their touch would be a great way to wake up, and if orgasm came with it, even better.</p><p>Raine couldn\u2019t miss their hot stares riveted on her. With a sultry smile, she stretched, arching her back\u2014and thrusting her naked breasts up to them. Her legs fell open, and both men\u2019s stares zipped immediately down to her pussy. An exhilarating sense of power filled her. She might kneel and call them Sir, but she could definitely get their attention.</p><p>A big smile broke across her face.</p><p>\u201cLook at her, all full of herself,\u201d Liam chided, but his voice sounded rougher than usual.</p><p>Hammer\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cI see that. Do we need to start the morning by reminding you who\u2019s on top?\u201d</p><p>Pretty please? \u201cWhatever you think is best, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a stunning piece of manipulation.\u201d Hammer watched her, his gaze almost impressed. \u201cI can see I\u2019m going to have to up my game and stay on my toes.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at them, resting her hands on her stomach just beneath her breasts, plumping them up. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m merely offering myself in whatever way pleases you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you flashing me those pretty nipples and showing me your cunt is all about my pleasure, I\u2019m sure. It has nothing to do with yours.\u201d He sent her a skeptical smile that told her the jig was up, but she didn\u2019t care. After the difficult task yesterday and their emotional exchange last night, the banter felt good.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Liam added, tongue firmly in cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an agenda that doesn\u2019t allow for a morning romp. So get up, love. Into the bathroom with you. We\u2019ll give you a few minutes to see to your business, then it\u2019s on with the day.\u201d</p><p>Raine pouted and glided her hand down the front of Liam\u2019s dress shirt. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t serve you in any other way?\u201d</p><p>She reached deliciously closer to his buckle when he grabbed her wrist and lifted her hand away. \u201cYou can start by not topping from the bottom and doing as you\u2019re asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d Hammer ordered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at his deep command, then scurried from the bed with a come-hither glance back, grinning when she heard them groan as she shut the door.</p><p>Raine hurried to relieve and tidy herself up. When she returned, both men waited on the edge of the bed, their watchful stares sweeping her from head to toe. A thrilling sense of anticipation gripped her. They wanted her submissive and eager. Despite her teasing earlier, she felt alive and beyond ready to give them exactly what they sought.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Raine crossed the carpet, then bowed her head and knelt before them, naked and ready.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous, love,\u201d Liam praised in a whispered rumble.</p><p>\u201cStunning as always,\u201d Hammer added in silky approval. \u201cRaise your gaze to us, precious.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and took in the two men who owned her heart. Their polished exteriors hid hungry, commanding Doms. They focused on nothing but her. Everything about their demeanor said they couldn\u2019t wait to get their hands on her again.</p><p>Memories of the previous evening flashed through her mind, so vivid she could almost feel their hands on her pussy, stroking her to ecstasy. She could almost taste them on her tongue, both giving her their power and pleasure with guttural male groans.</p><p>It could happen again.</p><p>As soon as the thought whispered through her head, her pulse quickened and heat slid up her spine. Anticipation made her heart skitter. Need throbbed and tingled beneath her clit. Only one emotion fueled all that: love. So much love it was hard to contain.</p> <p>Liam patted the mattress, silently demanding that she sit on the bed between them. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>They eyed her every move as she rose. Before she even settled herself, they positioned her with her back against the headboard, arms at her sides, legs slightly spread.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now we can look at all of you.\u201d And Hammer\u2019s hot stare said he appreciated everything he saw. \u201cTell us how you slept last night.\u201d</p><p>She sighed happily. \u201cVery well, Sir. I crashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind if we tucked her in like that every night.\u201d Something wicked flashed through Liam\u2019s eyes as he stroked her thigh gently.</p><p>\u201cHer sweet mouth could become addicting, but it would be worth every moment.\u201d Hammer growled, cupping a breast in his hand and lightly thumbing her nipple. \u201cI take it you enjoyed yourself, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Sir,\u201d Raine gasped out. She had no idea how long they were willing to work together and fulfill both her and her fantasy, but she intended to take advantage of every moment.</p><p>\u201cLook. Her cheeks are already flushed,\u201d Hammer pointed out, tormenting her nipple with his thumb again.</p><p>She struggled to focus on their words. Liam\u2019s fingertips skated against the sensitive skin of her inner thigh, dancing so close to her aching pussy. She shuddered in a breath and closed her eyes.</p><p>But she could still feel Liam\u2019s stare. \u201cFeeling bashful, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAroused,\u201d she admitted. \u201cEverything has happened so quickly, the sensations are magnified. It all feels wonderful but surreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hammer asked.</p><p>Despite their provocative touches, they were digging into her psyche. It didn\u2019t put her on edge as it would have only days ago. They\u2019d coaxed her to peel back her barriers and examine how her behavior had affected her relationships and her happiness. They\u2019d dredged up some of her most painful hurts. Revealing her vulnerability and giving them the power to wound her had been so damn hard. But they\u2019d taken her apart and put her back together with such care. Her psyche might still be a little scratched and bruised, but Raine felt the healing under her skin.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t hear you, Raine. Stop filtering,\u201d Hammer interrupted her internal musings, sounding displeased. \u201cAll that stuff running through your head\u2014the things you don\u2019t want us to hear\u2014we need you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to put it into words that will make sense. I\u2019ve barely had time to analyze it myself.\u201d The urge to express the changes she felt was almost suffocating, but blurting it out probably wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cThen take your time.\u201d Liam tucked her hair behind her ear before smoothing a hand over her knee. \u201cThere\u2019s no judgment here. No right or wrong answers, love.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, falling back on the familiar comfort of sarcasm while she gathered the rest of her thoughts. \u201cCan I just say that I\u2019m shocked neither one of you ended up with a broken nose?\u201d</p><p>Hammer arched a brow, leaving her no question they meant to have a serious conversation.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou two were the biggest shock, though. I really did expect an argument or a fight. I\u2019m so relieved and impressed that you gave me something much better instead. God, it was perfect, all of it. So were you. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Liam\u2019s words were stiff and didn\u2019t invite further commentary.</p><p>Raine realized they didn\u2019t want her to examine their behavior, just her own.</p><p>\u201cI learned some things about myself yesterday.\u201d She hesitated for a moment before continuing. \u201cAt the end, I really felt like I\u2019d achieved something I thought impossible.\u201d</p><p>Their twin smiles of encouragement were a balm. Now she was giving them what they wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Liam coaxed.</p><p>\u201cI stepped out from behind my walls and the world didn\u2019t end. No one attacked me or tried to take advantage of my vulnerability. I told you exactly how I felt and I was still safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be with us,\u201d Liam pledged.</p><p>\u201cYou shared so much of the gorgeous woman inside with us.\u201d Hammer caressed her arm and settled her shaky composure. \u201cBeyond our wildest dreams, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Liam took her hand. \u201cHow did opening up to us make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpowered. Terrified, too, but in a good way because I felt better knowing I could just be me. Letting go of some of those insecurities made me feel stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both proud of you, Raine.\u201d Liam tucked his hand in hers, strumming his thumb along the inside of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Hammer cupped her cheek, and she couldn\u2019t miss the approval in his eyes.</p><p>A sense of triumph filled her. \u201cI needed to hear that. Thank you, Sirs. It\u2019s nice not feeling like an eternal screw-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never have been, precious. That was in your mind, not ours,\u201d Hammer pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it might be time to let that pretty little head of yours start listening to your heart?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s soft question hit Raine in between the eyes. She smiled his way gratefully. \u201cI think so. I\u2019m definitely going to try harder now. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve shown me there\u2019s light at the end of a dark, awful tunnel. And I want that. It\u2019s been lonely and scary in here these last six years. You two give me hope that I am finally on the right path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou definitely are.\u201d Hammer smiled at her before brushing his lips over her cheek.</p><p>Liam moved in for a kiss, too. \u201cYes, love. You did so beautifully yesterday. Today, we\u2019ll be asking you to give us more.\u201d</p><p>Even yesterday, that would have scared her. Their reinforcement just now steadied the ground beneath her feet. While it felt foreign, a confidence she\u2019d never known surged inside her.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your next task?\u201d Hammer queried.</p><p>\u201cI think so. I\u2019m just a little anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnxious? As in scared or excited, love?\u201d Liam probed her with a curious stare.</p><p>\u201cSome of both. But I\u2019m eager to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to hear,\u201d Hammer praised.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cBut before we carry on, tell us how it feels to have us both beside you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnalyze your feelings out loud. Talk it through with us. You\u2019re as safe as you were last night,\u201d Hammer promised.</p><p>\u201cWhen you touch me and tell me I\u2019m doing a good job, I feel...relieved. I feel complete. You make me want to do you both proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to that feeling while we take you through the day. Lean on us, Raine. We\u2019re right beside you all the way,\u201d Hammer insisted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave you half done,\u201d Liam promised. \u201cYou\u2019ve learned that your growth is worth the bits of pain now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cBut there\u2019s always that little voice in the back of my head... I\u2019m terrified of failing you two.\u201d</p><p>Liam cradled her face in his hands. \u201cThe only way you can fail is if you give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep trying. As long as you keep reaching for us, we\u2019ll be there to hold you.\u201d Hammer rose and headed for her suitcase, plucking up a little red silk robe. He turned with a mischievous smile. \u201cTime for breakfast, precious.\u201d</p><p>That was it? They were done picking through her soul? Funny, it hadn\u2019t hurt a bit. But Raine knew they\u2019d only been assessing her mood and progress. No doubt they still had plenty of difficult hurdles for her to overcome. Butterflies in her stomach dipped and fluttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved!\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI imagine so. You didn\u2019t eat much yesterday.\u201d Hammer helped her to her feet and slid the robe up her arms, settling it over shoulders.</p><p>Neither Hammer nor Liam said another word for several long moments, just stared at her as if they expected something Raine didn\u2019t understand. As the uncomfortable silence dragged on, she swung her gaze between them. Liam\u2019s expression all but screamed: Didn\u2019t we just have a lesson about communication?</p><p>With a cocked head and a raised brow, he leveled her with a slightly menacing stare. \u201cI assure you, love, Ngaire has a cupboard full of pickles.\u201d</p><p>Raine winced. \u201cUgh, no pickles. You know I hate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I do.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice was cool and told her he expected more of an answer.</p><p>With a frown, she stared at the man. What the hell did he want her to say?</p><p>\u201cThere might be some of that trout leftover from yesterday\u2019s lunch,\u201d Hammer suggested.</p><p>\u201cFor breakfast? Gross!\u201d Then she understood the game. Not just communication, but complete communication. \u201cI\u2019d really like two eggs over easy with salt and pepper, please. With that, I want one piece of lightly buttered toast, a banana, and a glass of orange juice\u2014without pulp, if you have it\u2014Sirs.\u201d</p><p>Hammer chuckled as Liam flashed a broad grin.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Hammer cupped her chin and held her in a passionate gaze before he bent and pressed a hungry kiss to her lips.</p><p>Raine longed for him to devour her whole. She shoved away the tinge of disappointment when he released her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll earn exactly what you want,\u201d Hammer responded as if he could read her mind. \u201cNow hop into the shower and get cleaned up. We\u2019ll meet you in the kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam stood and pulled her into his arms, laying a lingering kiss on her lips. \u201cWhen you come down, be wearing this, love. This\u2014and nothing else. Do we make ourselves clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Liam\u2019s commanding mien filled her, and Raine felt the jolt of it all the way to her toes as she bowed her head. Warmth and excitement melded with her love for him. \u201cI won\u2019t be long. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood lass.\u201d Liam lifted her chin to him and kissed her one last time. \u201cDon\u2019t make us wait.\u201d</p><p>Watching them walk away, she felt almost giddy to get on with the rest of the day. Her soul overflowed with serenity. As she made her way into the spacious bathroom, Raine was determined to hold tight to the tranquility that filled her.</p><p>Raine fidgeted with the belt of the silk robe Liam and Hammer had instructed her to wear. As she descended the stairs, the panoramic view from the windows in the great room revealed a fresh layer of white powder blanketing the ground. The spindles of bare trees rose up to the blue sky. Everything looked hushed, peaceful.</p><p>From the kitchen, she heard male voices and laughter, along with the clatter of dishes. The aroma of fresh coffee and bacon filled the house. Her mouth watered and her tummy growled in response.</p><p>She smiled as she entered the room and spied the four men seated around the massive wooden table, looking impossibly handsome and thoroughly male. Catching sight of her, they rose in unison. She paused, startled by their intent stares. Testosterone saturated the room. Her nipples pebbled hard and tight against the silk. A flush warmed Raine\u2019s breasts and rose up her neck to heat her cheeks as she glanced from face to face. She saw nothing but welcome in each. Raine marveled that such busy, sought-after men cared enough to give her their time and energy.</p><p>Despite the fluttery, female sensation, Raine felt safe and lovely as they suffused her with unswerving attention.</p><p>Dropping her gaze to her toes, she greeted them softly. \u201cGood morning, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, princess. How you feeling?\u201d Beck asked as he plucked up his dirty plate and took it to the sink, along with his utensils.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you. Just famished,\u201d she replied as Beck rinsed the plate.</p><p>\u201cCome. Sit beside us, precious.\u201d Shifting forward, Hammer wrapped his hand around her elbow and eased her into the chair between him and Liam.</p><p>The rest of the men took their seats and resumed eating.</p><p>Settling back, Raine couldn\u2019t forget dinner the night before. Were they planning to spend another day touching and tormenting her? It would be worth it if they ended the night with sizzling pleasure again.</p><p>Beside her, Liam wrapped a hand around her thigh and sent her a seductive smile that made her tingle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rustle you up some breakfast.\u201d Beck smiled before filling a plate near the stove. He\u2019d looked out for her for years, long before she\u2019d realized he wasn\u2019t just a sadist, but a friend. He\u2019d been a godsend when she\u2019d sought him out at the hospital. His easy care now filled her with gratitude.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Seated across the table, Seth sipped his coffee. \u201cYou look well rested, Raine. How confident would you say you feel about completing your task today, on a scale of one to ten?\u201d</p><p>Darting a quick look between Hammer and Liam, she tried to decipher their expressions, get some read on their plans. Nothing. \u201cThey haven\u2019t given me a clue what to expect, so I\u2019ll say a six for now.\u201d</p><p>Beck chuckled as he set her breakfast, exactly as she had requested, on the table in front of her. \u201cAnd not knowing is eating you up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Raine really wanted to stick her tongue out at him, but managed to refrain. Instead, she ignored his question and focused on her food. \u201cEverything looks great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>That only made Beck laugh more.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, precious. Eat,\u201d Hammer encouraged. \u201cLiam and I need to head upstairs and get your room set up. It will only take a few minutes. Beck and Seth will keep you company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Raine?\u201d Liam leveled her with a formidable stare. \u201cRemember, they\u2019re here for you, too. We expect you to follow their instructions and give your obedience. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. A dozen questions sat on the tip of her tongue, but she silenced them. They\u2019d asked for her trust, among other things. Yesterday, they\u2019d more than earned it. \u201cYes, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Hammer brushed a finger across her cheek. Her heart skipped a beat. \u201cEnjoy your breakfast. We\u2019ll see you shortly.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, watching as they rose and took their plates to the sink before leaving the room. Nearby, Beck stood facing her, ankles and arms crossed as he leaned against the counter, watching her eat. Normally she\u2019d hate that, but he was on her side. Besides, nothing fazed her too much this morning.</p><p>She moaned in appreciation at the first bite, then quickly devoured everything on her plate. Afterward, Raine relaxed back and sipped her orange juice, wondering what Hammer and Liam were preparing for her and if Beck and Seth had more questions this morning.</p><p>They didn\u2019t make her wait long.</p><p>\u201cFull, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuffed. It was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then let\u2019s get started.\u201d Seth smiled tightly. \u201cStand in the center of the room and remove your robe. Fold it neatly on the floor and kneel.</p><p>Then she\u2019d be naked. And the looks on their faces told her they knew it. \u201cI, um... Hammer and Liam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, princess? Is nudity a hard limit for you?\u201d Beck challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. I just...\u201d Respect their instructions and give your obedience. Liam\u2019s edict echoed in her head.</p><p>Neither man so much as parted their lips to explain their intent. They merely waited for her to comply.</p><p>Slowly, she rose and moved to the center of the room. Obviously, this exercise was meant to shove her off-balance. Again. She took a deep breath and focused. Hammer and Liam had devised this task, and Raine understood their intentions. Open up for the men you love. They\u2019ve asked you to peel away the layers and allow yourself to be vulnerable.</p><p>After she unknotted the belt, she slipped the robe off her shoulders. Swallowing a lump of nerves, she eased it off. Nudity may not have been a hard limit for her, but without Hammer and Liam\u2014her lifelines\u2014she found it more than a little uncomfortable. But she pressed on.</p><p>Carefully folding the robe, she placed it on the floor, then gracefully sank to her knees. Palms resting upward on her spread thighs, she straightened her spine and thrust out her chest before bowing her head respectfully.</p><p>Beck lingered at the counter. She felt his assessing gaze. She heard the scrape of Seth\u2019s chair again before he approached, the tips of his shoes visible as he stood in front of her.</p><p>Bending low, he cupped her chin and lifted her face to meet his gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t shy away, Raine. You\u2019re a beautiful woman and you have nothing to fear from us. Think of me and Beck as your mentors, arbiters in case of dispute, and your chief cooks and bottle washers.\u201d</p><p>Beck pulled away from the counter and handed Seth a piece of paper, which he promptly passed over to Raine.</p><p>\u201cRead everything on the page aloud to us, princess,\u201d Beck drawled, sidling up to the other man. \u201cOne by one.\u201d</p><p>Raine stared at the handwriting, recognizing Hammer\u2019s familiar scrawl. She scanned the page, blinking.</p><p>\u201cAffirmations? Really?\u201d She spit out the questions, recoiling as if they\u2019d placed a sour pickle on her tongue. \u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>Beck just grinned. \u201cGet busy.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled something just shy of a scoff. They expected her to say this aloud? She shuddered at the thought. Focused on the paper fluttering in her hands, she ignored the meaning behind them.</p><p>\u201cI will open myself up and share, not only my needs, but my emotions.\u201d The phrase spilling from her lips sounded monotone, the sentiment hollow.</p><p>\u201cContinue. A little more enthusiasm would be nice,\u201d Beck chided.</p><p>\u201cI will be totally honest at all times without fear of embarrassment or reprisal. Nor will I hold back for fear of hurting someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d Raine sighed and stared up at the two men eyeing her with critical gazes. \u201cI get the value of communicating. You two made that really clear. So did they. But I\u2019m not used to sharing every little thought that pops into my head.\u201d She gave them an exasperated frown. \u201cI\u2019m really supposed to say, \u2018Oh, I think I\u2019ll wear a pink thong today? No wait, Sirs, can I wear the blue pair instead?\u2019 Or, \u2018When I brush my teeth, is it okay if I start with my molars first and work my way forward?\u2019 And, \u2018Should I eat the ice cream or the bran muffin?\u2019 I mean, seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what the affirmation means,\u201d Seth barked, his brows creased in anger. \u201cNo wonder they always want to spank your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat they\u2019re asking is impossible. If I just blurt everything out, they\u2019ll be hurt or pissed off all the time. I don\u2019t mean to, but... Why is being sensitive to others suddenly bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are grown men who can deal with their feelings, Raine,\u201d Seth scolded. \u201cThat\u2019s not your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally honest,\u201d Beck stressed. \u201cIf you\u2019re truthful about your thoughts and emotions as you experience them and express them in the non-brattiest way possible, you shouldn\u2019t have any problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? I\u2019m not trying to be bratty, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make this black and white for you.\u201d Seth scowled at her. \u201cYou could have saved yourself a hell of a lot of pain if you\u2019d simply leveled with Liam. Instead of avoiding him, you should have said, \u2018Sir, my period is late. I\u2019m scared. Talk to me. Hold me. What happens with us if I end up pregnant with Hammer\u2019s baby?\u2019\u201d</p><p>His words gouged her deep. Guilt that she\u2019d hidden nearly everything from Liam all but crushed her beneath its weight. Even more debilitating was the realization that she hadn\u2019t trusted that he would stick by her side, despite the fact that he\u2019d asked her to repeatedly.</p><p>A sob caught in her chest as she launched to her feet and spun away. How many times had he told her he loved her? How many ways had he tried to prove it? God, she\u2019d been such a fool. Raine had spent so much time convincing herself that her slightest misstep would send Liam running for the door. She should have shared her fears and worries, but instead, she\u2019d cut him off and severed the very artery that could have given their relationship life.</p><p>Seth\u2019s warm hands cupped her shoulders as he moved in behind her. She felt his warm breath against her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Raine. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t miss the depth of remorse in Seth\u2019s whisper. \u201cI was trying to explain the difference between the mundane and the important. If there\u2019s something you feel you need to hide, that\u2019s a red flag, and you need to say those words aloud. Sharing your feelings is the only way to maintain a healthy rapport with your Doms. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Raine swiped the tears away and sniffed before she gave a shaky nod. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Seth praised as he turned her back to face him. \u201cLet\u2019s continue.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward Beck as she eased herself down to the robe again. Raine could see the sympathy in his eyes, but his expression was resolute. She needed to find the same determination and see these affirmations through.</p><p>Looking down at the list, she inhaled a steely breath. \u201cNo one has control over any aspect of my life unless I choose to give them my gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat comes to mind when you say those words, princess?\u201d Beck urged.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d She tried to give a nonchalant shrug. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took back your power from that animal in no uncertain terms. I\u2019m glad I got to see that.\u201d Pride glowed from Beck\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that affirmation mean to you in terms of Hammer and Liam?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>Raine paused, sorting through her thoughts. \u201cThat I have the choice whether or not I give myself over to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Seth praised. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that right now, and they thrive on your power. It\u2019s what fulfills them. But how does it make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCentered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s getting it.\u201d Beck sounded pleased.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart. Last one.\u201d Seth nodded to the paper in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI deserve...\u201d Raine stumbled over the words, rereading them again. She felt Seth\u2019s assessing stare. The longer she stalled, the stronger she felt his impatience.</p><p>\u201cKeep going. Tell us what you deserve.\u201d Seth\u2019s tone was soft but teemed with Dominant command.</p><p>She swallowed the lump of reservation in her throat. \u201cI deserve happiness.\u201d The next words were harder to get out. \u201cAnd love.\u201d</p><p>Did she? Maybe the better question was, why didn\u2019t she? She wasn\u2019t a bad person. She\u2019d never intentionally hurt people. Why shouldn\u2019t she have some happiness? Some love? So many cracks marred her soul. She\u2019d spent her life striving to feel worthy. But the past was behind her, and if she kept her courage intact along this journey, maybe Hammer and Liam would work their magic, and she\u2019d finally smooth away every jagged hurt and be whole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Beck reassured. \u201cI know you doubt that from time to time, but deep down, you know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Seth crouched down in front of her again. \u201cRaine, look at me.\u201d</p><p>He waited silently until she mustered the courage to raise her head and show him her uncertainty, her insecurities.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know this is hard, but we\u2019re proud you got the words out. Next time, convince us that you\u2019re not just reciting these words, but that you believe them.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded as much fun as being waterboarded, but she knew they only meant to help. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re asking. Now, tell us why you\u2019re having trouble accepting that statement as fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father convinced me I wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d She shrugged self-consciously. \u201cIf you hear it enough, you believe it. Liam told me that it was time for my head to start listening to my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Liam is a very wise man. And he loves you very much. You should listen to him.\u201d Seth smiled gently.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready for you upstairs, princess.\u201d Beck extended his hand to her. \u201cSlip your robe back on and they\u2019ll meet you on the landing.\u201d</p> <p>Raine let Beck help her to her feet. \u201cThank you, Sirs, for helping me sort everything out.\u201d</p><p>Seth watched as she wrapped the sash around her waist, then he took over, tying it into a loose knot. \u201cThink long and hard about your affirmations while you do your task today. They\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Seth placed a sweet kiss on her forehead before he shooed her out of the kitchen.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, Hammer tapped his foot impatiently, watching Raine ascend. The little red robe swished around her thighs, cinched her waist, caressed her hard nipples. He squeezed the length of silk rope in his hand. Beside him, anticipation rolled off Liam.</p><p>Today wouldn\u2019t be easy, but if it went well, it would be satisfying as fuck.</p><p>As she drew closer, her gaze bounced between them, her expression looking a little shaken\u2014definitely more nervous than she had before breakfast\u2014but determined.</p> <p>Liam took her elbow and led her between them, down the hall, to the playroom. Once inside, Hammer shut the door, watching Raine. She stared at the padded table they\u2019d outfitted in the middle of the room, again lit only by the array of candles, and drew in an audible breath.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, love?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>She seemed to gather herself, then shook her head. \u201cNo, Sir. I\u2019m a bit uneasy. I\u2019m not sure what to expect or what to do. But I guess you\u2019ll tell me, right? Should I be on my knees or on that?\u201d</p><p>When she pointed to the bondage bed, Hammer stepped in front of her and looped a finger under her belt. \u201cWe appreciate such a complete answer. But I want you to focus on me for a moment. Keep what you learned yesterday in mind. Communication will be critical. Today\u2019s task is about honesty.\u201d</p><p>Raine blanched. \u201cI know it\u2019s important, but sometimes the truth hurts people. I try to avoid upsetting anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between saying something gently and lying. No one wants to be lied to, Raine,\u201d Hammer pointed out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have an affirmation about that earlier this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you wrote them, you know I did, Sir. Seth pointed out that I can\u2019t be responsible for how others feel, but I just don\u2019t know how to look someone in the eye and upset them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze softened. \u201cSeth is right. Your responsibility is to communicate the truth, not to worry about how it affects us.\u201d</p> <p>He let that sink in and waited until acceptance flitted across her face. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Liam took her hand. \u201cTalk to us throughout this exercise and do what we tell you. All will be well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d Hammer brushed a soft kiss over her lips, then slipped the knot around her waist free.</p><p>Liam moved behind her and took the robe from her slender shoulders. He hung it from the doorknob, then together, they led her to the side of the raised table.</p><p>\u201cClimb up, precious.\u201d</p><p>Casting a quick glance between the two of them again, she braced her palms on the padded surface. With his hands gripping her hips, Liam helped her up. Hammer waited on the other side, wrapping his arms around her torso to steady her.</p><p>Once they laid her supine, he and Liam both bound her wrists with cuffs built into the sides of the table. \u201cThese restraints aren\u2019t to hold you down, but to hold you open for us. We\u2019re going to ask you questions. Each time you answer honestly, we\u2019ll place a new fastening around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be binding you to the table, love,\u201d Liam added. \u201cWe\u2019ll be binding you to us.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flipped over to Liam. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all our hearts,\u201d Hammer promised.</p><p>Liam smoothed the hair from her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieving is really hard for me, but I\u2019m trying, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer he wanted to hear, but Hammer understood and accepted it\u2014for now.</p><p>He finished tying off the first restraint. Under his hands, Raine trembled, but resolution filled her face.</p><p>\u201cWe see that and we\u2019re proud. Today will be more difficult, Raine,\u201d Hammer warned. \u201cYesterday showed the value of good communication. Honesty is a big part of that. I haven\u2019t always been honest with you, and I\u2019m changing that. You have to do the same.\u201d Her silence made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He refused to make the same mistake twice. \u201cRaine?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a suspended moment, apprehension flashing in her eyes, but there was no point in moving on unless she committed to the rules and the process. \u201cYes, Sir. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave a visible sigh of relief. \u201cWe have faith in you, Raine. Now put your faith in us.\u201d</p><p>They had to get on with the task. Hammer knew giving her time to worry would only let her doubts sneak in.</p><p>\u201cI trust you more than I trust myself,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Hammer rocked back on his heels. His heart jumped to his throat. He and Liam exchanged a glance. He saw his own shock reflected back in his friend\u2019s dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cFollow your instincts. We\u2019ll help you through,\u201d Liam vowed, then pressed a lingering kiss against her mouth.</p><p>As soon as Liam pulled back, Hammer kissed her, too, a slow brush of lips. He nudged them apart, tasted her for a sweet moment, then pulled away.</p><p>She looked at them with her heart in her eyes.</p><p>It was time to begin.</p><p>Liam leaned over the table again, hovering directly over Raine\u2019s face. \u201cTell me, when you were collared to me, did you continue to cook and clean for Hammer after I told you not to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get in trouble for my answers?\u201d She bit her lip.</p><p>Vixen. Hammer didn\u2019t know whether to shake his head or laugh.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re bratty or dishonest,\u201d he quipped.</p><p>With a chuckle, Liam caressed her arm. \u201cIf you\u2019re honest, you\u2019ll earn nothing but praise. Answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid shut and she winced. \u201cThen, yes. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Liam prodded.</p><p>She cracked an eye and looked Hammer\u2019s way. She\u2019d never once told him that his dinner was in the oven or that she\u2019d changed his sheets. Just like he\u2019d never openly thanked her. Instead, he\u2019d had the oil changed in her car and left squares of her favorite chocolates where only she would find them. It had been their secret.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blind,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Raine took her time answering. A fist of anticipation gripped Hammer\u2019s stomach and squeezed hard as she collected her thoughts and focused on Liam again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d taken care of him for so long, I didn\u2019t know how not to. And, no offense...\u201d She glanced at Hammer before redirecting back to Liam. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty helpless in the kitchen. As long as I was cooking for us, it didn\u2019t make sense to not make a little extra and leave it warm for him. The thought of him going hungry or eating takeout all the time bothered me. Ditto with the cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being honest.\u201d Liam grabbed a length of rope and attached her to the table again, this time binding her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cDid that make you mad?\u201d she asked, apprehension evident in her voice. \u201cBecause I never wanted to upset you. It wasn\u2019t meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat upsets me is that you did things for Hammer behind my back.\u201d Liam tightened the binding. \u201cYou didn\u2019t trust me enough to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Raine nodded like she understood completely. \u201cSomewhere during our last trip here, I become so attached to you that I was afraid to say anything that might drive you away. Me caring for Hammer wasn\u2019t indicative of any disrespect or disloyalty to you. I just didn\u2019t know how to say it.\u201d</p><p>Liam peered down at her, his face tightening as if he repressed a hundred different thoughts. As if he wanted to wrap her up in his arms and never let go. \u201cYou just did, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you for not letting me starve,\u201d Hammer added, fastening his own rope around her opposite arm. \u201cFocus on the silk, precious. Each is a line of trust between us. Feel it on your skin, in your blood, deep down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she murmured as he tightened the knot.</p><p>Hammer couldn\u2019t miss the arousal in her voice, and fuck, it turned him on.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first start thinking of Liam as something more than my friend?\u201d</p><p>Raine\u2019s eyes went wide. She pressed her lips together, then cut her gaze over to Liam. Hammer didn\u2019t have to guess that she wasn\u2019t keen on this question.</p><p>He tugged on the rope across her biceps. \u201cTrust.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she blew out a breath. \u201cWhen you first introduced us, I, um...thought he was very attractive. He asked a lot of probing questions during our first few conversations. He asked me about you. Then he asked me about me. I didn\u2019t say much in either case. But I knew he was watching me a lot. I couldn\u2019t figure out why exactly.\u201d She let out a breath, then grasped for her fortitude. \u201cThe morning I broke the cup at your doorstep, the morning Marlie stepped from your room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a mistake,\u201d Hammer cut her off.</p><p>That made Raine smile. \u201cShe was a \u2018see you next Tuesday.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Liam frowned, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cA cunt,\u201d Hammer supplied. \u201cC. U. Next... You get it.\u201d</p><p>Liam burst out laughing. \u201cThat she was. Very clever, love.\u201d</p><p>The new lightness in the room seemed to give her some confidence. \u201cAnyway, Liam came to see me in the kitchen that morning and offered to train me. At first, I thought he just felt sorry for me. Then he kissed me. Then I knew he wanted me.\u201d</p><p>Hammer flashed Liam a shocked glare, then with a grimace, he forced himself back on track. Water under the bridge. Ancient history. Not important right now\u2014even if he wanted to give his old pal a piece of his mind.</p><p>As she watched him, uncertainty passed over her face. \u201cDid I say something I shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, precious. You did well.\u201d He wound another length of rope through the fastening in the table, then draped it over her shoulders.</p><p>Liam took the end and joined it on his side, pinning her down more. \u201cVery honest, just as we asked for.\u201d</p><p>Raine looked visibly relieved. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Liam soothed. \u201cTell me why you think I uncollared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I know you weren\u2019t happy that I didn\u2019t tell you about the migraine,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNot happy at all.\u201d Liam raised a brow. \u201cBut do you really think that\u2019s why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she defended. \u201cI knew it didn\u2019t help, but...I guess I did a lot of things. I didn\u2019t always tell you what was in my head.\u201d Her gaze skittered away. \u201cMy only defense is that I\u2019d never really had more than a one-sided relationship. I didn\u2019t know how to believe you when you said you\u2019d be there or that you cared.\u201d</p><p>Hammer winced. Her words stung. Honesty was brutal, but he couldn\u2019t hide from the truth. He\u2019d kept her at arm\u2019s length for years. From the moment she\u2019d begun to blossom under his roof, he\u2019d been scared fucking shitless at how much he cared. He\u2019d wanted to protect her more than he had any other woman. At first, he\u2019d told himself it was because she\u2019d been so damn young and vulnerable. Then Hammer thought his feelings had grown because he was determined to save her, since he hadn\u2019t saved Juliet. Finally, he realized that he\u2019d simply fallen for Raine.</p><p>Funny how he hadn\u2019t figured out that he loved her or that she alone could heal him until Liam had stolen her away.</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not actively avoid conversations you\u2019d find uncomfortable?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She sent him a sad, penitent stare. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to shut you out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam leaned over the table, his face turning foreboding. \u201cYou refused to tell me about your argument with Hammer just before Thanksgiving. You gave me some cockamamie story that it was about the menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did talk about it,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what we argued about.\u201d Hammer scowled.</p><p>She sighed in defeat. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>Liam grabbed her chin and redirected her. \u201cSo do I. And instead of being honest, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to be close to you. And you didn\u2019t want my affection.\u201d The hurt in her voice was unmistakable. Her lower lip trembled.</p><p>Hammer caught Liam\u2019s gaze. His friend looked as confused as he felt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Liam corrected. \u201cYou tried to end the conversation with sex. Frankly, that\u2019s how you ended a lot of arguments.\u201d</p><p>Fingers wrapped around the edge of the table, Hammer fought for his temper. Juliet had used that tactic on him so often. He\u2019d fallen for it just about every fucking time, and look where that had led. He took in air between his teeth, resisting the urge to rail. But there was no goddamn way he would allow Raine to open her body to avoid doing the same with her heart.</p> <p>Raine blinked. \u201cYou were angry, and I knew it, Liam. I wanted to soothe you. I needed your reassurance. Your touch is one way I could feel your caring.\u201d</p><p>Really? That\u2019s what she thought? Hammer released his grip on the table. He\u2019d seen Juliet use her body to end conversations. But he\u2019d never seen Raine use her wiles in that way. Sure, she\u2019d tried to seduce him once, but he\u2019d been dead asleep. She hadn\u2019t wrapped her lips around his cock to stop a fight. When he\u2019d all but fucked her in the bar, she hadn\u2019t tried to stop the argument. In fact, she\u2019d done her best to walk away. Maybe Liam had assumed that she\u2019d meant to distract him and he\u2019d mistaken her intent?</p><p>Maybe. But Hammer intended to make himself very clear either way. \u201cListen to me, Raine. You will never, ever use your body to sway either of us from asking you questions, prying you open, or digging in your head. If you need reassurance, you will ask for it, not lose your clothes and rub up against us. Is that crystal fucking clear? This is not up for negotiation.\u201d</p><p>Raine stared, blinked, clearly confused. \u201cOkay. I didn\u2019t mean to distract Liam that day, just...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can argue with you, and I know that no matter how angry you are, since it\u2019s your club, you\u2019re not going to leave. Besides, you like a good argument. Liam isn\u2019t the same. He seemed genuinely upset, and I hated that.\u201d</p><p>Hammer growled. \u201cYou think I enjoy arguing with you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him as if the truth were obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s your foreplay, and since we rarely did anything else... I mean, if you hadn\u2019t liked it, you wouldn\u2019t have picked so many fights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Hammer all but lunged at her. \u201cPicking a fight and pissing you off was the only way you\u2019d stop protecting yourself and give me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe I picked fights because it was the only way I could get you to pay attention to me.\u201d She pursed her mouth and sent him a little frown. \u201cI still think you liked arguing with me. It was difficult not to notice you were always hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my constant state around you, fight or no.\u201d</p><p>Liam cleared his throat. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t mean to distract with sex. All right. But the truth is, you tried everything else to avoid telling me why you argued with Hammer.\u201d</p><p>Then she cast those blue eyes back to Liam. \u201cIf I told you about the argument, I would\u2019ve had to tell you how late my period was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought that if I knew I\u2019d leave you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after I said I wouldn\u2019t run out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she argued, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAm I standing here now?\u201d he challenged. \u201cHave I gone anywhere?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uncollared you, love, not because I wanted to leave you, but because you were never truly with me.\u201d</p><p>Raine fought against her bonds, straining to get off the table. Her legs flailed and she lurched up from the surface as much as her ropes allowed.</p><p>Hammer thrust a fist in her hair and tugged, jerking her face to his. \u201cStop. When you fight the ropes, Raine, you\u2019re fighting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t avoid our questions,\u201d Hammer growled. \u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong answer, just the truth.\u201d</p><p>She cut a glance to Liam, looking both accusing and hurt. \u201cI told you. I tried. You expected more than I knew how to give. You scared me to death.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing another length of rope, Hammer attached it to the table and tossed it over her hips, then thrust the other end at Liam. He took it grimly and tied it off at her other hip with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cHow did I do that?\u201d Liam demanded incredulously, finishing the knot. \u201cBecause I loved you and I wanted you to love me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her entire body shook as she cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I could be so afraid of something I wanted so badly. The fear paralyzed me.\u201d She dragged in a jagged breath. \u201cEvery time I\u2019d let go a little, I\u2019d be so proud of myself. Then you always seemed angry that it wasn\u2019t more. I felt so out of my element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut down,\u201d Hammer supplied.</p><p>Raine nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou never said any of this,\u201d Liam pointed out softly. \u201cHow was I supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I give you what I didn\u2019t know how to give? Love seems so easy for you. The words just pour out. Me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhat I knew was that if I wanted something too much, it would be taken and destroyed. You were so good. I wanted more. I didn\u2019t dare tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you destroyed it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as sobs wracked her again. \u201cSee, I fuck everything up.\u201d</p><p>Liam caressed her cheek. \u201cShh. No. Falling in love with you was so easy. From day one, I wanted to protect and guide you. I wanted to reach you. You made me laugh. You made me mad. You twisted me up in knots. But you made me feel alive. My vanity was believing my love was enough for us both. I never meant to make you feel unworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been honest. The last thing I ever wanted to do was hurt you.\u201d Her lashes fluttered open and her gaze clung to Liam. Everything about her face was a plea for acceptance. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The air left Hammer\u2019s lungs in a rush. It didn\u2019t surprise him that Raine was in love with his best friend. Deep down, Hammer had known it, but hearing Raine\u2019s sweet words wrapped in such earnest need... Fuck, he wanted to scream, rage, tear the room apart. But he couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak. Liam had waited for weeks, hoping she\u2019d declare her feelings. Now that she had, Hammer just clenched his jaw, grateful the others were so engrossed in each other they didn\u2019t notice he was quietly coming undone.</p><p>\u201cOh, god.\u201d He cradled Raine\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve waited to hear that. Thank you for being brave. And here\u2019s my heart, bound to yours.\u201d Liam grabbed a stretch of rope and fitted it under her breasts before he handed it to Macen to complete.</p><p>Hammer stared at it mutely, seeing the overwhelming love in his friend\u2019s eyes. With numb fingers, he took the silken length and wrapped it around the bolt on his side of the table as Liam bent to Raine and covered her mouth with his, delving deep, mastering her lips. Telling her without a single word that he loved her, too.</p><p>As Liam lifted away from Raine\u2019s kiss, Hammer couldn\u2019t do a damn thing except paste on a stoic expression.</p><p>Immediately, she looked his way, soft concern on her face. Yeah, she didn\u2019t want to hurt him. Too late.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in love with him?\u201d Hammer whispered.</p><p>Raine paused. He could see her thoughts turning, watch her scan memories.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cWhen Liam fed me pickles. It was the most tender yet terrible way imaginable to tell me that what I said mattered.\u201d She turned to Liam. \u201cThat night at dinner when you wanted to know about my childhood and finally persuaded me to tell you, do you remember? It was then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I made dessert out of you after that, love.\u201d Liam grinned.</p><p>Raine blushed prettily, and they shared a memory Hammer knew he\u2019d never precisely understand. It fed every insecurity he possessed. But he forced himself to swallow it down, along with his wounded pride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, precious. He\u2019s waited a long time to hear how you feel.\u201d Hammer murmured to her.</p><p>How the hell could he be happy for his friend and so enraged at the same time?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the way I feel about you, Macen. Nothing ever would.\u201d She glanced up at the ceiling and drew in a deep breath. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I really didn\u2019t know how to say, that I love you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew. I\u2019ve known for a while. That\u2019s hugely honest. You\u2019re doing great,\u201d Hammer choked out.</p><p>He grabbed some rope and handed Liam another piece. Together, they bent her knees, then secured the silk around her ankles and tied the lengths off to the table. Hammer checked her circulation along his side.</p><p>Liam did the same on the other with a shake of his head. \u201cYou might have told me, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, you stubborn fuck. You weren\u2019t listening.\u201d Hammer turned serious again and pinned her with a stare. \u201cOne more thing stumps me, Raine. I understand why you felt you couldn\u2019t talk to Liam after he uncollared you. Why didn\u2019t you come to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd say what? I couldn\u2019t ask you to fix my boo-boo, Macen. I worried that if I went to see you that we\u2019d...\u201d She closed her eyes, looking tense and uncomfortable. \u201cFall into bed, and that I wouldn\u2019t have the strength to say no. Then you both would have thought I\u2019d chased you down for revenge sex. It\u2019s even an ugly thought, and I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI half expected you to,\u201d Liam admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I meant enough to you that you didn\u2019t like the thought of seducing him just to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to hurt you,\u201d she swore, then sent a pleading stare Hammer\u2019s way. \u201cOr you. The last thing you wanted to hear was me crying about Liam. Besides, I thought that without me there, you two might fix your friendship. I didn\u2019t want to be in the way anymore.\u201d</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t like it...but he understood her point.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He didn\u2019t say another word until she did. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s happening in your life, Raine, if you need anything, I always want you to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t fix it, Sir. No one could.\u201d She sent a remorseful stare Liam\u2019s way. \u201cIt was my doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019m capable of, precious. So don\u2019t imagine that I couldn\u2019t have helped. You didn\u2019t give me a fucking chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t give me one, either. You just left, even after I told you not to run away,\u201d Liam pointed out. \u201cDid you not believe we\u2019d worry about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might,\u201d she confessed softly.</p><p>\u201cMight?\u201d Hammer barked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I went to Beck. I told him to let you two know that I was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought Beck should be your messenger boy instead of calling us yourself?\u201d Liam glared her way. \u201cDid you honestly think we wouldn\u2019t be frantic to find you? Bloody hell, we were out of our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She grimaced, and Hammer could see the worry on her face again. \u201cI saw you. I was in Beck\u2019s car, and you two were running into the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s jaw ticked and he fought like hell not to lose his mind. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t make him stop? Turn around and flag us down?\u201d</p><p>Liam shot him a fierce scowl, and Hammer figured he must not have done a great job at hiding his anger.</p><p>\u201cI needed more time to sort things out. I wasn\u2019t ready to talk to either of you. But I picked up my phone at least a hundred times to call. I missed your voices.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t put any of us through that again,\u201d Liam demanded. \u201cTell us that you\u2019ll stand and fight and face your problems when things get tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d Hammer leaned into her face, teeth clenched.</p><p>Liam bent to her ear. \u201cWe want to hear it, Raine. Promise us you\u2019ll never run again.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, seeming to wrestle with her thoughts. Fear gripped her expression, then she gathered herself, dug up courage, and nodded. The play of emotions entranced him. His triumph spiked.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t run again. I promise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hammer felt the tension drain from his body. He sighed with relief. Liam pressed a kiss to her forehead, then nuzzled her cheek. Hammer kissed her shoulder, her neck, her lips for a soft moment. \u201cThank you, precious. We needed to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d Liam agreed and sent a stare his way, reaching for Raine\u2019s ropes. He wanted her free.</p><p>Fuck, yes. As much as he enjoyed her bound, Hammer wanted to hold her more. Clearly, Liam did, too. Raine had given them so much today. Her honesty\u2014even when it hurt. Her promise\u2014even when it cost her. Christ, she was stunning.</p><p>Together, he and Liam worked the knots, starting at the rope across her shoulders. The first binding slithered free and fell to the carpet with a soft thud. A soft pink pattern with the rope\u2019s imprint embossed her skin. For the first time, he saw Raine wearing the marks of his dominance. Not the bruises he\u2019d given her when he\u2019d fucked her mindlessly that drunken night, but the stamps of his possession dancing over her flesh when he\u2019d worked with Liam to control her. Holy shit, the sight made his cock throb.</p><p>\u201cHammer?\u201d Liam prodded him, already untying the binding across her hips.</p><p>With a nod, he rushed to catch up, unknotting the silk around her upper arms, under her breasts, then releasing the cuffs holding her wrists before finishing at her hips and ankles.</p><p>Raine sat up, reaching for them as quickly as they lunged for her. She pressed herself against Liam\u2019s chest and buried her face in his neck even as she reached her free hand to him, and Hammer used it to draw himself closer, meshing his back to hers. So small, so fragile. So brave.</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>\u201cYou did so good today,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYour promise to stay and work things out means the world.\u201d He pulled back enough to search her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to it, love.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cAfter seeing how quickly you tracked me down, I believe you. But I\u2019m here now. I\u2019m staying. I feel like...we\u2019ve all walked through fire. I don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. But today, it felt really wonderful to just say what I thought and for you to be okay with it. Everything I said today was honest.\u201d She stared deep, conveying the truth of her words. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Liam kissed her softly. \u201cOh, Raine. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>After a soft press of lips, she turned his way, and Hammer\u2019s heart stopped at the love in her eyes. No coyness. No anger. No hiding. It was just...there.</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t even try to stop himself from grabbing her and covering her lips with a frantic kiss. And he didn\u2019t hold back an ounce of his burning love. Now wasn\u2019t the time to tell her, but he damn well intended to before they left this mountain.</p><p>At the moment, he settled for wrapping his arms around her. Liam did the same. No one said anything for a long moment. The silence conveyed everything they\u2019d accomplished\u2014and didn\u2019t speak a word about what came next, as if the hush of now was sacred.</p><p>\u201cDid I pass the test?\u201d She grinned at them.</p><p>Liam\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cYou did. Let our arms hold you to us every bit as securely as our ropes. We\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>And Hammer didn\u2019t intend to let go. He wanted to inhale her, meld her against him. He wanted to own her. He\u2019d almost had the chance. If his timing had been different, if she\u2019d been fertile that night... Not that he wanted to force her into becoming his, but would she have fought it that hard? Or would she have been happy? Honestly, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>And he was desperate to.</p><p>Hammer gripped her face and brought her gaze to his, searching her eyes. \u201cRaine, you were crying on Thanksgiving day. Because you were relieved you weren\u2019t pregnant? Or disappointed because you wanted to be?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Liam felt her body stiffen against him as his gut churned. What would Raine say? He could pretend it didn\u2019t matter, that it was all history now and best left there if he\u2014they\u2014intended to move forward. But Hammer wasn\u2019t going to rest until he got answers.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Liam suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s settle you in your bed where it\u2019s warm and comfortable, then finish the conversation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hammer shook his head. \u201cLiam, I\u2019ve waited. A few days ago, I thought I\u2019d never see her again. This is the time for honesty. Let her answer first.\u201d</p> <p>Then Hammer turned back to Raine, pinning her with a stare that demanded the unvarnished truth.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She sighed, bringing her hands up to cling to Hammer\u2019s wrists as he held her face. \u201cOh, what does it matter now, Macen? I wasn\u2019t pregnant, just late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well it matters. I need your honesty. I need an answer,\u201d he demanded, even as she tried to break his hold and hide. \u201cDon\u2019t hide from me. It\u2019s another form of running away.\u201d</p><p>Liam gritted his teeth, but Raine couldn\u2019t be allowed to retreat\u2014even if he didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. \u201cAnswer him, Raine.\u201d</p><p>Wrapped around her side, he felt her trembling, heard her hitch in a sobbing breath. Liam opened his mouth to calm her and defuse the tension.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to hear, Macen? That I was devastated not to be pregnant? That I wanted to be the mother of your child? That something inside me had entertained the impractical hope that maybe I would carry the life you\u2019d created inside me and have a part of you always?\u201d Slow tears slid down her cheeks.</p><p>Hammer gripped her tighter. They locked stares. His eyes looked as glassy, as haunted, as hers.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, I want the truth,\u201d Macen insisted.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she wailed, her back straightening. \u201cOf course I was disappointed. I love you. I\u2019ve wanted you for so long that I don\u2019t remember what it feels like not to want you.\u201d</p><p>Each word hacked at Liam\u2019s heart like a knife, slicing him to pieces. Fuck. You wanted honesty. You got it. Enjoy that bitter pill.</p><p>Raine swiped at her tears and bowed her head, dropping her voice to a whisper Liam had to lean in to hear. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t pregnant, so it\u2019s all moot now. It would have been an impossible situation, anyway. Not carrying your child in my womb meant I could have a life with Liam, and...\u201d She drew in a shaking breath. \u201cAnd in the end, I was happier about that. Oh god, I\u2019m sorry, Macen.\u201d</p><p>Her face crumbled as she reached blindly for Hammer. He gathered her close and held her, rocking her gently.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned, I know. But I wanted that child with you so damn bad.\u201d Hammer confirmed Liam\u2019s greatest fear. \u201cChrist, I kept picturing a daughter as beautiful as her mother.\u201d</p><p>Raine laughed through her tears, clinging to Macen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hoped for a boy, just like his father.\u201d</p><p>The earth\u2019s axis shifted beneath Liam. She\u2019d wanted Hammer\u2019s baby. But she\u2019d wanted him more? Raine\u2019s sorrow, along with the heartfelt confessions she and Hammer shared, told Liam that she wasn\u2019t at peace. But damn it, he wasn\u2019t, either.</p><p>There was no sense in trying to convince himself that his world hadn\u2019t just blown up in his face, that his dreams of sharing a life with this woman, just the two of them, lay dying around him. A vise gripped his heart. He couldn\u2019t bloody breathe as he swallowed the urge to roar out that any life growing in Raine\u2019s womb would be his\u2014and his alone.</p><p>But instead of erupting with the injustice of it all, he had to put on an act worthy of a goddamn Oscar and watch sobs shake Raine. He had to see Macen cradle her as they shared grief. And he couldn\u2019t say a damn thing or he\u2019d risk destroying her.</p><p>As they clung to one another, Liam felt fucking invisible. And that broke his heart more than anything.</p><p>He reached beneath Raine, lifting her gently so he could move back and stand apart.</p><p>She whirled on the table, bracing herself on the padded surface, and turned devastated eyes to him. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please... This is the biggest reason I never wanted to talk about how late my period was or whether I was pregnant. No matter what I said, someone would be hurt. You\u2019ve done so much for me, sacrificed your feelings so I could break through my barriers. Whatever you believe, I do love you. And I knew the minute I opened my mouth, I could do more damage to you than we might ever recover from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just giving you some room, is all.\u201d He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice his shaking fingers. He couldn\u2019t even look at Hammer. \u201cOf course you were disappointed. Why wouldn\u2019t you be? I know you want children someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d Liam forced himself to keep his voice even and calm. \u201cHammer is going to carry you to bed, love. Rest up for a bit. It\u2019s been a big morning, and you were so brave. I\u2019m proud of you, Raine.\u201d</p><p>How bittersweet was it that she\u2019d finally given him exactly the answer he\u2019d sought two long weeks ago. And just as she\u2019d feared, it had annihilated him.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. Go on with Hammer. He needs time with you. I think you need it, too. If you\u2019re up for it, we\u2019ll take a walk outside after lunch, maybe throw a snowball or two. But for now, get some rest. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Raine gave him a sad, watery nod, then turned back to Hammer. The other man scooped her up in his arms and waited while Liam opened the door to the playroom. He followed them to her bedroom. Inside, Liam inched back the covers and watched in helpless fury as Hammer lay beside her and drew her into his arms again.</p><p>Liam bent to kiss her before leaving, but her tears and Hammer\u2019s tender endearments began again. This time they were too much for his crumbling composure. Silently, he retreated and went in search of solitude to ease his torment.</p><p>As the day wore on, Liam fought the acid brewing in his gut. With a controlled smile firmly in place, he\u2019d managed to scrape through lunch. Even Raine and Hammer had been subdued, so sitting back and letting Beck and Seth try to lighten the mood had been easy. Hammer hadn\u2019t fucked Raine, so he could be grateful for that one small mercy. If Macen had, Liam would have heard it as he paced in his room next to hers.</p><p>After lunch, he\u2019d survived the hike with Hammer and Raine in the newly fallen snow, giving them stilted smiles and monosyllables. Liam had hoped breathing in the frosty air would cool his simmering anger or that taking in winter\u2019s beauty might ice his pain. But Hammer\u2019s presence only added fuel to the slow burn inside him. He\u2019d held her hand, knowing that his \u201cpal\u201d held the other. It added some nasty kindling to his blaze.</p><p>Dinner had been a complete misery. Raine looked positively stunning in something tiny, white, and lacy. Liam hadn\u2019t chosen it, so he could only presume Hammer had. Of course, he\u2019d absolutely loved being cut off at the balls about Raine\u2019s attire. He snorted. Macen hadn\u2019t noticed his mood or cared. To Raine\u2019s credit, she\u2019d sat in his lap through part of the meal and tried to soothe him with kisses. He\u2019d accepted her affection, taking her sweet mouth time and again, and trying to smother his ire.</p><p>Since tucking Raine into bed an hour ago, the temperature of Liam\u2019s fury had risen. Now seated on the great room\u2019s sofa, begrudgingly engaged in another debriefing session, he struggled to keep the conflagration under control. But the fuse burned shorter and hotter with every minute he had to endure Hammer\u2019s presence.</p><p>Tossing back a second shot of Scotch, he sighed, focusing on Beck and Seth. He appreciated all they\u2019d done to help Raine. They\u2019d devoted their time and understanding, with a collective goal to aid the girl in finding some peace. He and Hammer were supposed to be her ultimate choice of Dominants. At the moment, Liam felt more like a bloody fool.</p><p>When his glance settled on Hammer, who detailed Raine\u2019s achievements for the day, Liam felt the anger that had been roasting all day\u2014hell, for the last month\u2014blaze into an inferno and spread like a flash fire through him. Undeniably proud that she\u2019d exceeded their fiercest expectations once again, he should have been high-fiving Macen. But the fear that Raine would never be just his again wrapped a fist around his balls and squeezed tight. If he wanted to have her in his life, in his arms, or in his bed again, would he have to share her with Hammer? That worry axed him like a vicious blade, cutting him where he sat.</p><p>He clenched his fists as Hammer divulged Raine\u2019s confession to the final question of the day\u2014the powder keg his old pal had set ablaze, finally igniting Liam\u2019s fury.</p><p>\u201cThat had to be damn hard to hear, man,\u201d Seth sympathized. Concern lined his face.</p><p>All eyes turned expectantly toward Liam. The best he could do was nod and try not to spear Hammer with an accusing glare.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. You\u2019ve been itching to say something about it all day. So get it off your chest and out in the open,\u201d Hammer barked before emptying his glass of tequila in one gulp.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is there to say, Macen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou tell me. You\u2019re the one sitting by the fire, pouting like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Hammer\u2019s condescending remark, coupled with the patronizing brow, set Liam\u2019s temper razing through the room. All the grievances he\u2019d been swallowing since he\u2019d first taken Raine for his own sat like bile in his throat, waiting to spew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bitch here, Hammer. But I\u2019ve got to hand it to you. You almost succeeded,\u201d he spat before raising his glass in a mock salute. \u201cAces to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucceeded at what?\u201d Hammer growled as he turned in his seat. Face-to-face, Liam could see confusion and anger narrowing Macen\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAt totally fucking up Raine\u2019s life,\u201d Liam jeered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that you stunted her emotional growth for years by locking her away in your ivory tower. You had to top it off by trying to impregnate her, you selfish prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hammer roared as he launched to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened and you damn well know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Everybody take a deep breath,\u201d Seth instructed as he situated himself between them, trying in vain to keep them apart.</p><p>Slamming his glass on the table, Liam surged out of his chair. Eager to go toe-to-toe with the man he used to call his best friend, he set his shoulders and clenched his fists. \u201cAre you enjoying making Raine your substitute for Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Hammer screeched. \u201cYou need to get your goddamn jealousy under control, Liam, and think about what you\u2019re saying. If Raine had been pregnant with your child, she would have wanted it, too. You\u2019re too smart to be this stupid, asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime out,\u201d Seth bellowed, slashing an angry scowl first at Liam, then at Hammer.</p><p>\u201cJealousy? Look in a bloody mirror. The minute I showed the least bit of interest in Raine, you suddenly turned on me like a rabid dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, here we go. You\u2019re not really going to start whining about that again, are you?\u201d Hammer snarled. \u201cDamn it, I know what she said up there cut you deep. But you\u2019re out of line, man. Way the fuck out of line. Deal with the shit Gwyneth put you through before you destroy yourself and any chance of happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start psychoanalyzing me, you bastard, especially when you\u2019ve done such a bloody fine job on yourself. You don\u2019t know a damn thing about what I went through with Gwyneth. You were too busy banging subs a dime a dozen, so shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Hammer scowled. \u201cI know you can\u2019t stand that the fucking bitch cheated on you, but you\u2019re not the first guy to find out his wife was unfaithful. Stop being a damn martyr because you\u2019re about to screw up the best thing that\u2019s ever happened in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A fake friendship with a man who\u2019s kept me in the dark about everyone and everything that ever mattered? Thanks, but no thanks, Hammer. You\u2019ve shown me your true colors and they\u2019re uglier than fuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about me, asswipe. I meant Raine. She loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re suddenly concerned about salvaging my relationship with Raine? This from the man who bragged just days ago that he\u2019d get her back in bed. Isn\u2019t that just your way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s your way, Liam? Ripping the collar from her throat and shoving her out the fucking door? You\u2019re goddamn lucky we found her because I would have killed you if she\u2019d left me for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft you, is it? She\u2019s mine!\u201d Liam growled.</p><p>\u201cNot now, dumbass.\u201d Hammer smirked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you two,\u201d Seth barked.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Liam snarled at Seth before glancing over the man\u2019s shoulder to pin his anger on Hammer once again. \u201cYou know, I tried hard to forgive you from keeping secrets from me. I even managed to feel sorry for you. After Thanksgiving, I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d gotten over your shit so we could finally put our differences to rest. But no. You buried the only worthwhile pieces of yourself with Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Beck roared, sidling next to Seth. \u201cSit the fuck down, you two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cButt out.\u201d Hammer scowled at the other two Doms before he turned back to Liam. \u201cYou leave Juliet out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I? You can\u2019t let it go. Instead of dealing with your guilt, you\u2019ve hurt me. You\u2019ve hurt Raine. And you don\u2019t give a bloody fuck.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t miss the flash of pain in Hammer\u2019s eyes. Good! The bastard needed to feel how much it hurt to have his heart ripped from his damn chest\u2014exactly the way Liam had.</p><p>\u201cThis is about your sorry ass. Don\u2019t pin this on me. I thought you\u2019d be a man about helping Raine grow. But obviously you\u2019d rather shit in your diaper than pull your head out of your ass.\u201d Hammer leveled him a glare of contempt.</p><p>\u201cTake off your rose-colored glasses, Macen. Did you honestly think the three of us were going to set up house and live happily ever after just because you had a boner to do it ten years ago? Hate to burst your bubble, mate. But when we leave here, Raine will be mine again,\u201d he blustered, knowing he had no way to make that hope a reality.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Hammer fumed.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake. Shut. Up,\u201d Beck howled as he glanced toward the stairs.</p><p>Liam turned.</p><p>There stood Raine. Dressed in jeans and a dark sweater, she clutched her suitcase as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Hammer groaned in regret.</p><p>Swiping a careless hand across her cheeks, Raine burned them both with a stare steeped in pain. She took Liam\u2019s knees out from under him. His heart clutched, and a wave of dread tingled through his limbs.</p><p>As he and Hammer both started toward her, Raine pinned them with a scathing glare, shaking her head and halting them in their tracks. Liam longed to scoop her into his arms, hold her tight, and tell her he was sorry for breaking his vow.</p><p>As she descended the stairs, she gave off a near-palpable blast of arctic air that rattled his bones. He could almost feel her reconstructing her walls, building them tight and impenetrable. His guts seized. All the progress they\u2019d made was now destroyed because he and Hammer hadn\u2019t kept a lid on their shit.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to do this with you both under one condition,\u201d she spit out through clenched teeth. \u201cJust one!\u201d</p><p>The agony in her voice slammed Liam with guilt.</p><p>Hammer tried to take another step closer. \u201cRaine, listen. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d she snapped as she seared him with a fierce scowl. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare come near me.\u201d</p><p>For once, Hammer was stunned silent.</p><p>\u201cI let you both bring me here so I could try and fix myself, to finally have a fucking happy life. And I\u2019d almost been convinced that my dreams would come true. But Liam just admitted that you two can\u2019t share me. How na\u00efve I was to think you could.\u201d Raine\u2019s voice cracked on a gut-wrenching sob. \u201cEven knowing that it didn\u2019t work with Juliet, I fooled myself into believing it would be different with me\u2014that we were different. I bought into the fantasy.\u201d She looked at Beck. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to grow up earlier? You couldn\u2019t have been more right.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. No. No. \u201cIt can work, love, if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me, either,\u201d Raine choked. \u201cI appreciate all the ways you both helped me. But I thought that today\u2019s task about honesty would run both ways. I see now it was a stunt. While I was ripping my heart open, you two were beating your chests over which of you got to slide into my panties again. Whatever. I thought you two were everything I ever wanted. But I finally understand that you\u2019re both so fucking broken, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever be what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Hammer growled.</p><p>Raine\u2019s words utterly demolished Liam. Her truth about the baby earlier today hadn\u2019t cut his soul as wide open as her words now. Even walking in on Gwyneth\u2019s adulterous m\u00e9nage hadn\u2019t charred him this completely. He had to make this up to Raine. But first, he had to force her to hear his apology and pray she accepted it.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, Raine,\u201d Seth interjected as he moved alongside Liam.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no point. I can do a lot of things, Seth. But I can\u2019t continue to love two men who don\u2019t love me enough to keep one promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, precious,\u201d Hammer implored, his voice broken.</p><p>Liam turned to stare at the man. Macen looked pasty and shaken. He\u2019d never seen Hammer so afraid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, Macen.\u201d She wagged a finger at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the first thing about fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine...\u201d Liam started, not sure what to say\u2014what he could say\u2014to make her listen.</p><p>She shook her head, looking right through him and Hammer as if they weren\u2019t there, and held back a sob as she turned to Beck.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, love. I\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d The inevitable loss threatened to crush Liam.</p><p>\u201cGet me off this fucking mountain,\u201d she choked. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hammer barked, leveling a frantic gaze at the tattooed Dom.</p><p>\u201cRaine,\u201d Beck soothed as he wedged between Hammer and Liam before closing in next to her. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d He\u2019d never seen more resolution on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t run away again,\u201d Hammer reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to me about broken promises?\u201d she challenged. \u201cYour turn to choke on disappointment. Can we go, Beck?\u201d</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, the tattooed Dom grimaced in apology to both Liam and Hammer before wrapping an arm around her waist. \u201cCome on, princess.\u201d</p><p>Helpless and wrought with contrition, Liam watched as Beck led her toward the door. Hammer took a step forward, then stopped.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Macen scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. Precious...\u201d</p><p>Liam strode toward her. \u201cStop, love. Let\u2019s talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and didn\u2019t turn back.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Hammer screamed at the top of his lungs. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I love you!\u201d</p><p>She froze, dead in her tracks.</p><p>The entire room stood still.</p><p>Slowly, Raine turned, focused solely on Macen as her chin trembled. A mournful sob escaped her lips. Beck seemed to support her dissolving frame.</p><p>Liam gaped at Hammer in stunned silence. And what he saw made his eyes burn. Macen\u2019s face was etched in pain while he watched helplessly as the woman they both loved stood ready to walk out the door. She\u2019d wrenched Hammer\u2019s heart open. A trail of tears wet his harsh cheeks.</p><p>Raine\u2019s face twisted as her brows drew together. \u201cGoddamn you, Macen. You wait until I\u2019m ready to leave to tell me? Or are you just saying anything to make me stay?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I wish this had turned out differently.\u201d</p><p>Raine stormed out, slamming the door with a thunderous boom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can for you, dumb fucks, but I\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d Beck sighed in disgust before he opened the door and followed Raine out into the night.</p><p>Hammer closed his eyes and palmed the tears from his cheeks. The second Raine walked out, she\u2019d shredded his heart. For years, he\u2019d wanted to declare his love. He\u2019d never imagined that she\u2019d believe his admission had been a disingenuous ploy and reject him. He might not have been the best at showing her how he felt, but he knew what love meant because of her. For Raine, he\u2019d always cared and been concerned in a way he hadn\u2019t for anyone else.</p><p>But you haven\u2019t always put her needs first.</p><p>\u201cFuuccckkk!\u201d Liam roared. \u201cShe\u2019s gone again. Bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, you two. Let\u2019s talk,\u201d Seth ordered with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve said more than enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d Liam mocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s talking going to solve?\u201d Hammer sounded at the end of his rope. \u201cIn case you missed it, she left us.\u201d</p><p>Seth just shook his head. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to stand there like whipped puppies and take it? Beck will reason with her, but if you want her back, we need to iron this out.\u201d</p><p>Liam scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are friends, remember?\u201d Seth arched a brow. \u201cFriends fight, like you just did. Now it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>Hammer narrowed his eyes. \u201cAre you fucking blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you two are. Raine needs time to cool down. Then Beck will bring her back, and you clowns need to be ready when she gets here. You have an hour, maybe two, to lick your wounds and practice groveling. With your egos, neither one of you have a minute to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s enough time to patch everything up,\u201d Liam muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not sure a decade would be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hammer saw the accusation in Liam\u2019s eyes, and it pissed him off all over again. \u201cProbably not. If you\u2019d just get over your jealousy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blaming me for Raine leaving? I was fine until you started baiting me. If you\u2019d kept your bloody mouth shut, we wouldn\u2019t be in this fucking mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got some big fucking balls. In case you didn\u2019t notice, we both had to hear some goddamn hard truths today. Imagine my surprise to discover that you were sucking face with Raine when I told you to keep your hands off her. But then we both know the real reason you hooked up with her in the first place, don\u2019t we?\u201d Hammer could feel his blood pressure rising.</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t giving her what she needed,\u201d Liam tossed back.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you wanted to yank my chain.\u201d Hammer shoved a finger in his face.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I was trying to help someone I cared about, you bloody wanker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so you could see if I\u2019d get jealous. And if not, well, why not just get in her pants? After that, do you think I enjoyed hearing her tell you that she loved you? That was a Hallmark moment I could have lived without.\u201d</p><p>Liam rolled his eyes. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had a bloody party listening to her tell you she loves you for the last month! All that time, I\u2019ve had to hear your insufferable whining about how I stole her from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I finally get the courage to tell her I love her, do I get sweet kisses and cuddles? No, she thinks I\u2019m fucking lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you expect? You wait until she\u2019s running out the goddamn door. Face it, Macen. You\u2019re an idiot. Why didn\u2019t you tell her in the bedroom this morning when you had her alone? That\u2019s when she needed to hear it. And she might have let you fuck her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I was an idiot. Silly me for trying to honor our pact. So much for our strong, coordinated effort. Remember, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be yours or mine? Or did you have a secret agenda in mind all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost the plot, mate.\u201d Liam shook his head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you two.\u201d Seth sighed as he opened the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get this out of the way before we go any further. You have five minutes outside to beat the fuck out of each other. Get it out of your system. When you come back, your heads up north better be ready to take charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Liam stomped toward the door, shucking his jacket, tie, and shirt before tossing them onto the chair. \u201cAre you coming, old man? Or are you afraid?\u201d</p><p>With a glare Liam\u2019s way, Hammer stood and tore off everything he wore above the waist, unceremoniously dumping them onto the same chair, then he barreled toward the door. He stopped as he passed by Seth. \u201cYou\u2019re buying me a new pair of Louis Vuitton loafers, asshole.\u201d</p> <p>The other man just laughed as he slipped on his coat.</p><p>Stepping off the porch, Hammer sunk to his shins in the thick snow. He suddenly realized he should have told Seth that he\u2019d need to replace his Armani trousers, too.</p><p>Liam hopped in the snow, his breath making clouds in the frigid air, fists pumping like a boxer\u2019s. Hammer wanted to laugh, but the rancor glowing in O\u2019Neill\u2019s eyes told him this wouldn\u2019t be a polite spar.</p><p>Before Hammer could get his footing in the slick, fine powder, Liam bounced in close and caught Macen\u2019s jaw with a right hook. His head snapped back. A low growl tore from his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, asswipe,\u201d Hammer bellowed.</p><p>Crouching low, he slammed a shoulder into Liam\u2019s midsection. A grunt exploded from Liam\u2019s throat, filling Hammer with satisfaction and sending the two men tumbling to the frigid snow.</p><p>Liam hissed as the frozen precipitation hit his bare back. Hammer snarled and straddled O\u2019Neill\u2019s chest, then hauled back a fist.</p><p>From the stoop, Seth stood wrapped in a woolen coat, rocking back on his heels and shaking his head.</p> <p>Hammer ignored him and watched as Liam struggled to sit up. He launched his fist straight at Liam\u2019s nose, making contact with a satisfying crunch. Blood sprayed in a perfect arc, landing on the Irishman\u2019s chest and chin.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to give up yet?\u201d Hammer baited.</p><p>\u201cConcede to you, you fucking bastard?\u201d the other man scoffed. \u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>They panted heavily, and Liam struggled to push Macen off, then gave up with a curse. Instead, the man wiped at his nose, then reared back and punched him in the stomach. The air left Hammer\u2019s lungs in a rush, and he felt faintly nauseous\u2014and not for anything would he admit it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, O\u2019Neill? Trying to tickle me?\u201d Hammer taunted before connecting another shot to Liam\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell off me. Christ, I can\u2019t breathe with your weight on my gut,\u201d Liam grunted as he twisted his body and heaved upright, unseating Hammer and tossing him onto his back. Rising to his knees, Liam hovered over him and plowed his fist into Macen\u2019s nose. Pain exploded in his skull.</p><p>Hammer managed to grit his teeth and hold it together, even as blood ran into his mouth. \u201cStop hitting me with your purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fight like a fucking girl. Planning to scratch me next?\u201d Liam goaded before driving his fist into Hammer\u2019s gut.</p><p>Macen groaned but managed to give Liam a mighty shove and send him tumbling.</p><p>Sprawled out in the snow side by side, the two men panted as they stared up into the twinkling night sky. The freezing temperature cooled his temper. Hammer realized he didn\u2019t want to kill Liam, simply vent the years of pent-up fury once and for all. His nose hurt. His stomach felt sore. He spit out a mouthful of blood. His only consolation was that he didn\u2019t think Liam had fared any better.</p><p>\u201cHad enough of me kicking your ass, gramps?\u201d Liam quipped.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Hammer turned to scowl at his friend.</p><p>Blood still seeped from his nose, but Liam grinned at him like a loon. In that moment, he prayed his friend only wanted to blow off steam, too. They\u2019d taken their argument\u2014hell, themselves\u2014far too seriously.</p><p>This was what they should have done after Juliet\u2019s suicide. Yell. Fight. Get fucking drunk. And cry. Macen had done all that alone and resented Liam for it. He knew now that his old friend would have happily joined him, if he\u2019d only asked.</p><p>\u201cI can go again. Just give me a minute. I need to catch my breath,\u201d Hammer groaned.</p><p>A hint of smugness resounded in Liam\u2019s low laughter until he palmed his jaw and cursed.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up, ladies. Let\u2019s go back inside. We can sit by the fire, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya,\u201d Seth called from the front porch.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d Hammer muttered.</p><p>\u201cI think we should beat his ass next,\u201d Liam murmured conspiratorially.</p><p>Both men cracked a knowing grin. As if they\u2019d read one another\u2019s minds, they raised their right arms and flipped Seth off, laughing. It felt good.</p><p>Liam stumbled to his feet and held out his hand to Hammer. \u201cCome on, you old fart. Let me help you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling old? If our mommy over there on the porch\u2014\u201d Hammer thumbed in Seth\u2019s direction \u201c\u2014had given us five more minutes, I\u2019d have kicked your ass.\u201d</p><p>Liam dropped his hand. \u201cYeah? Who\u2019s on their feet first?\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr should I just let you drag your own half-dead carcass up alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t say I was turning down your help.\u201d As Liam held out his hand again, Hammer laughed and latched on, rising to his feet.</p><p>Seth waited for them on the porch with a sour expression. \u201cYou two look like you fell face first into a meat grinder. When Raine comes back, she won\u2019t like looking at either of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll turn off the lights. She doesn\u2019t need to see us, anyway. Just feel.\u201d Hammer smirked.</p><p>\u201cOr Beck and I could just take her off your hands,\u201d Seth teased.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna die?\u201d Hammer asked.</p><p>Liam suggested something anatomically impossible as they marched inside, grabbed their dry clothes, then hurried to the fireplace.</p><p>The heat felt good on Hammer\u2019s stinging skin. Using his shirt to wipe away the blood that dripped from his nose, he eyed Liam. Would they be able to salvage their friendship and love Raine together? He wasn\u2019t sure, but Raine blurting out her fantasy\u2014her hope\u2014had sharpened his. He wanted her. But he wanted her with Liam, with the best friend who\u2019d tried to stand by him through thick and thin. Hammer might not always agree with Liam\u2019s choices, but he knew the man never had less than good intentions. It was a place to start.</p><p>Seth joined them a minute later, tossing towels at both of them before he refilled their glasses with liquor.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first, we need to discuss whether you can continue guiding Raine together or if you need to call it quits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d Hammer growled.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Seth swiveled a gaze in O\u2019Neill\u2019s direction. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Pain tore across Liam\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m giving serious thought to chucking the whole fucking nightmare. It\u2019s like a train wreck that keeps rolling over the same broken rails. Every damn time I think we\u2019re getting on track, something causes it to derail again. I\u2019m bloody tired of it.\u201d</p><p>The desolation in Liam\u2019s voice felt like a kick in the gut. Hammer wiped more blood from his nose on his shirt, silently staring as the drops expanded on the silk in a starburst of crimson. \u201cLook, if it\u2019s about the conversation today...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just her pregnancy scare.\u201d Liam glanced up. His expression was unreadable, which worried Hammer even more. \u201cThat was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I honestly didn\u2019t think you cared whether she\u2019d be pregnant or not. I know now, what with Juliet and all, that it\u2019s a touchy subject for you. But you never wanted children in all the years I\u2019ve known you. So I\u2019d decided to adopt the kid and raise it as my own, if it came to that. I had a whole fucking fairy tale all laid out in my head. What a joke!\u201d</p><p>Liam sank wearily into the chair next to Macen and mopped the blood from his face with his towel. Hammer hurt just seeing his pain.</p><p>\u201cThink of me what you fucking like, but I want you to take her and be happy,\u201d Liam murmured, defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to New York. I won\u2019t stand in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that! You\u2019ll crush her,\u201d Hammer insisted. \u201cRemember? She loves you. There\u2019s no way you can tell me that you haven\u2019t seen how much she\u2019s grown because of what we\u2019ve done these past two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Liam admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d Hammer shook his head. \u201cRaine needs us both. She loves us both. I think what\u2019s got you so fucked up inside is the reality that nothing you or I can do will change that. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cI had it in my head\u2014in my heart\u2014that she was going to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both did, but there\u2019s something you need to think about. If you walk away, I\u2019m left with a woman who can only give me half her heart. The other half belongs to you. I couldn\u2019t spend my life knowing I\u2019d never be able to make her whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to leave you with half a woman, Macen. But I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen open your eyes. Raine is the one we\u2019ve always needed,\u201d Hammer insisted. \u201cWe not only have the chance to fix her, but us. You know it as well as I do. Goddamn it, surely you can feel it somewhere in there, just like I can.\u201d Liam still didn\u2019t say anything, and Hammer wanted to shake him. \u201cCould you imagine never touching her again? Ever?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s face twisted up as he tried to hold back. \u201cNo. I love her too much to leave her half empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, Liam drew in a deep breath. \u201cIt could be worse, I suppose. I\u2019ll have to be grateful that she didn\u2019t fall in love with a complete asshole like Beck.\u201d</p><p>Hammer couldn\u2019t help but grin as he sighed in relief. Even Liam cracked a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that earlier today, I didn\u2019t just pull that question out of my ass. It had been rolling around in my head for days. I had to know if she would have been happy if she\u2019d been pregnant.\u201d Hammer scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too afraid I wouldn\u2019t like the answer,\u201d Liam confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019d gotten her pregnant? Would you have asked then?\u201d</p><p>Liam reared back. \u201cOf course. I\u2019d want to know if she would be all right...\u201d He sighed, giving Hammer a little grin. \u201cYou sly bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, I had to know, not for an ego stroke. For her. And she gave us the honesty we asked for. She\u2019s blown me away with how far she\u2019s come.\u201d Hammer couldn\u2019t conceal his pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat she has. But today came with a price I hadn\u2019t expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t shy away from hearing the truth, no matter how it stung. We just weren\u2019t fully prepared for the fallout,\u201d Hammer mused. \u201cI seriously thought about taking Raine aside and asking her feelings about being pregnant. But in my head, you and I were in this together. No matter what she felt, it affected us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why you wanted me there. Honestly, I do\u201d Liam nodded. \u201cBut it caught me off guard and stabbed deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my intent, man. Hell, the two weeks I was counting the days of her cycle, I didn\u2019t know if I was scared or happy with the possibility of being a father. It wasn\u2019t until Thanksgiving, when fate decided for me, that I realized I wanted a family. And if anyone was going to be the mother of my children, I wanted it to be Raine.\u201d</p><p>Liam gaped at him as if he were an alien. \u201cBloody hell, I never thought I\u2019d hear the words family and father out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Hammer shrugged and grinned sheepishly. \u201cYeah, well...the first time I have to change a dirty diaper, I\u2019ll probably be singing a completely different tune. But hopefully you\u2019ll be there to help me out.\u201d Hammer held Liam\u2019s gaze.</p><p>He wanted his friend back on board. Even if the train had a bad track record, Macen knew he\u2019d never be able to make the journey with Raine half as meaningful without Liam.</p><p>\u201cI vote we leave the dirty nappies to the wee one\u2019s mum.\u201d Liam grinned.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah,\u201d Hammer breathed out, then stood. \u201cShe needs us, man. Together. Through thick and thin. And I have a sneaking suspicion that we\u2019re going to need each other even more. The girl\u2019s a fucking handful.\u201d Hammer sobered quickly. \u201cI just hope we can get her back.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a long minute as Hammer wondered if he\u2019d ever be able to prove to Raine that his words of love were sincere. He\u2019d simply have to wait until Beck cooled her down and brought her back to find out. For now, one bridge was on the mend, and it relieved the hell out of him.</p><p>Macen stood and wrapped Liam in a brotherly hug, grateful to have another chance at a new beginning with his old friend. Liam slapped him on the back in return.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to convince Raine that we\u2019re her best options.\u201d Liam chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd grovel,\u201d Seth piped up. \u201cYou two will be kissing ass till the next millennium.\u201d</p><p>Hammer laughed. \u201cGod, I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Seth applauded like the sarcastic ass he was, then bowed. Straightening, he dusted off his palms. \u201cMy work here is done. Now let\u2019s have another drink.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Raine let Beck guide her into the sleepy little bar, decorated in early log cabin Americana. A startling collection of game heads were mounted to the walls. Their dead, glassy eyes stared back at her.</p><p>The place wasn\u2019t crowded on a Tuesday night. In the corner, a jukebox played a happy country-western ditty that scraped her raw. A few people at nearby tables laughed and chugged back beer. They looked happy.</p><p>The hollow feeling in her stomach and the ache deep in her chest served as painful reminders that her life had fallen apart.</p><p>Beck seated her in a corner, then grabbed the chair across from her and dragged it around the table until he sat right beside her. He took her shaking hand and pulled her closer. Without a qualm, she laid her head on his beefy shoulder and let out more tears. He smoothed a palm over her crown and murmured soft assurances.</p><p>God, she was so tired of crying. Of being upset and disappointed, confused and...torn between two lovers.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked at Beck. A month ago, he was the last person she would have called her friend. Tonight, she thanked goodness he was in her life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she confessed.</p> <p>\u201cStart by talking to me. They\u2019ve taught you how to communicate and be honest. Those lessons aren\u2019t less meaningful because of what happened tonight.\u201d</p><p>Raine dragged in a breath as she sorted through her thoughts. Finally, she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak it down. Tell me exactly what about their argument upset you most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t supposed to fight. That was my only condition for agreeing to their proposition. It makes me wonder how much squabbling they\u2019ve been doing behind my back.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Beck considered her words. \u201cPrincess, you\u2019re talking about two strong-willed alpha Doms. And they\u2019re human beings. They\u2019re going to fight. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that just because you coerced a promise out of them to get along, they could do it twenty-four seven.\u201d</p><p>She sat back to consider his words. A waitress in a short denim skirt and an eye for Beck came over to take their drink orders. He asked for coffee. Fuck that.</p><p>\u201cBring me tequila shots. Let\u2019s start with five of those and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have a glass of white wine,\u201d Beck cut in.</p><p>Raine glared at him. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back and face them. Don\u2019t you want to do it sober?\u201d He glowered, trying to guilt her into sobriety.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cThey broke their promise.\u201d</p><p>Beck ignored her and addressed the waitress. \u201cCoffee and white wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChardonnay or Moscato?\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, she peered at the waitress. \u201cNo Pinot Grigio or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d The waitress worked hard not to roll her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a beer bar. We get vacationers who want to get drunk for cheap and locals who don\u2019t care how highbrow their buzz is. That\u2019s all we got.\u201d</p><p>Point taken. Raine sighed. \u201cChardonnay, please.\u201d</p><p>The woman shot Beck a look of both sympathy and interest before she turned away. He dismissed the waitress immediately and shifted in his chair. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna fight. Liam and Hammer are damn good, but they\u2019re not perfect. You\u2019re expecting them to be.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, seeing his point even when she didn\u2019t want to. The sight of them tearing into one another, the ugly things they\u2019d said...</p><p>\u201cFocus here.\u201d He pointed between his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to me, remember? You\u2019re not in a world all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she conceded. \u201cSo they\u2019re people who aren\u2019t going to get along all the time. Why can\u2019t they argue about football or the best car or who takes out the trash? That\u2019s normal guy stuff. They could rib each other, then toss back a few and laugh. But they always fight about me.\u201d She thumped her hands against her chest. \u201cI\u2019m always squarely in the middle. I feel like I need to referee more than submit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey fight about what\u2019s important to them.\u201d Beck chuckled. \u201cBut feel free to blow a whistle on them and call time out. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d get her ass spanked for sure.</p><p>Raine shot him a quelling glance. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the answers. If they\u2019d fought tonight about football or cars or whatever, if they\u2019d gotten every bit as riled up about that as they did about you, what would you have told them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo calm down. To take a step back.\u201d She bobbed her head as she sifted through the possibilities. \u201cTo be reasonable. To communicate and compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. This isn\u2019t any different. They lost their tempers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve simmered down and are drowning in a whole pile of \u2018oh, shit\u2019 right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve damaged their friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve damaged it,\u201d Beck corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re too busy worrying about how they feel to think about what you need. I\u2019ve listened to them debrief after the last two sessions. You\u2019ve made amazing progress. That isn\u2019t because Liam was there. It isn\u2019t because Hammer topped you, either. It\u2019s because they did it together. You love them. And they love you. You can\u2019t really have expected this to just\u2014\u201d he snapped his fingers \u201c\u2014work overnight.\u201d</p><p>But she had, in a way. Not that she\u2019d come to the lodge expecting happily ever after, but she\u2019d wanted it. Beck and Seth had both encouraged the idea. And after the beautiful lesson on communication and the stunning intimacy that followed, she\u2019d awakened this morning full of optimism. In the back of her head, she\u2019d already been clasping their hands, putting on a white dress, and enrolling in childbirth classes. They\u2019d just been trying to help her grow.</p><p>The waitress set down Raine\u2019s wine. A dribble sloshed over the rim because she was too busy making time with Beck to care. She settled his coffee in front of him with a smile. \u201cSugar? Cream?\u201d</p><p>The woman made the two words last about ten syllables each, and Raine lost her patience. \u201cThanks. If you didn\u2019t notice, he\u2019s trying to straighten out my life. He\u2019s single, but he doesn\u2019t live around here. And unless you like welts with your spanking, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\u201d</p><p>The mousy brunette recoiled and looked at Beck as if he\u2019d turned into Satan. \u201cLet me know if I can get you more coffee or wine.\u201d</p><p>Then she scurried off. Beck turned to Raine. A smile played at his mouth. \u201cI should beat your ass for that, but it was damn funny.\u201d</p><p>Raine winced. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not mad. Sometimes I lose my temper. Sorry if you were interested in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot her,\u201d Beck assured. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to you.\u201d</p><p>She knew damn well he\u2019d given her a reprieve. \u201cAfter fighting for a month, maybe I was unrealistic to think they wouldn\u2019t ever have a dispute about me again. I guess I just didn\u2019t want to feel torn anymore. I want them to get along. I want them to be adults, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever repeat this, I\u2019ll deny I said it. But men can be large children. They fight and draw lines in the sand and need time outs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were trying to hurt one another,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSometimes guys do that. It\u2019s the verbal equivalent of whipping it out to see whose is bigger.\u201d</p><p>Raine shook her head. \u201cBut they were using me to hurt each other. It really pisses me off that they push me to break through all my barriers to communicate and to be honest with them when they\u2019re not doing the same with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s valid,\u201d Beck agreed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve realized it by now. But I think today was their first step toward being truly honest with one another. It got ugly because they got everything out in the open. They needed it, in my opinion. I know you didn\u2019t want to hear all that, but I think it\u2019s good you did.\u201d</p><p>As much as she hated it, Beck was probably right. \u201cHammer didn\u2019t try to get me pregnant. He just didn\u2019t try not to. He was drunk, and everything happened fast. But I don\u2019t think it was intentional. Liam is wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell him.\u201d</p><p>Gnawing her lip, Raine nodded, filtering back through the verbal war she\u2019d heard. \u201cDo you know everything that happened between Liam and his ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s always kept me at a distance. I don\u2019t think he liked my friendship with Hammer much. It\u2019s been better the last few days, but we\u2019ll see what happens. If you want to know more about Gwyneth, ask him, not me. I\u2019m not the one who can tell you.\u201d</p><p>Beck was just full of good points tonight, damn him. Raine sipped her wine and watched him grimace at his coffee.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Hammer thinks of me as a substitute for Juliet?\u201d</p><p>Without a second of hesitation, Beck shook his head. \u201cNo. I think whatever he once felt for her died not long after she swallowed those pills. He finally saw her as she was\u2014and it wasn\u2019t the woman he\u2019d convinced himself he loved, in my opinion. You...\u201d He pointed at her. \u201cYou are what he\u2019s needed. That\u2019s why he\u2019s in love with you. Ditto for O\u2019Neill. I don\u2019t know his troubles, but I know he\u2019s got them. Just like I know you\u2019re a balm for them.\u201d</p><p>He made all the disaster in her life sound so simple to fix\u2014love. And she\u2019d kill to know what secret Hammer kept that Liam had to forgive him for...but even if Beck knew, he wouldn\u2019t spill.</p><p>Raine choked back another sip of her vino. \u201cI think what hurt me most was the moment I realized that Liam never had any intention of this threesome lasting beyond our time at the lodge. And I know we didn\u2019t talk about that or agree to it on a permanent basis, but...I love them both. What did he think was going to happen? I could kneel for them and be complete for a few days, then give it up? Being here has made me realize this is what I need. You tried to tell me that back at your condo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was a little insane, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a touch.\u201d She rimmed her wineglass with her finger and smiled at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut now you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she agreed, taking another sip.</p><p>\u201cSo the issue isn\u2019t really the words they exchanged tonight. The more important thing is what happens next. What do you think you should do? Be smart here...\u201d</p><p>Raine stepped back from the situation as much as her emotions would allow. If she were giving a friend advice in this situation, what would she say? \u201cSit them down and be completely honest about the fact that I love them, that I hate it when they fight, and that I want them always. But that sounds unrealistic, too. If they can\u2019t get along today, there\u2019s no tomorrow. And with that argument tonight, I can\u2019t imagine them trying to climb in the same bed with me together\u2014ever.\u201d</p> <p>Beck shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s an important thought in there. Keep digging. You want another wine?\u201d</p><p>She looked down to see that she\u2019d drained the glass and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve had better wine from a convenience store. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. I\u2019ve had better coffee from a hospital cafeteria, and that\u2019s saying something. Ready to go?\u201d</p><p>When Beck made to stand, she grabbed his hand. \u201cOne more question.\u201d</p><p>He settled in his seat again. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they have more tasks planned for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he admitted grimly. \u201cIt revolved around trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wanted me to give them my trust?\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted a show of it, yes.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way Beck tensed put her on alert. \u201cOkay, cough it up. What were they going to do?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, looked at his coffee, lifted it, and set it aside with a scowl. Then he drew in a deep breath. \u201cTomorrow afternoon, they intended to take you into the playroom and put you entirely in Seth\u2019s hands. No options off the table. They wanted to see if you trusted them enough to extend your trust to someone you didn\u2019t know well because they asked you to.\u201d</p> <p>That startled Raine. \u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>Beck shrugged. \u201cThey wanted to see if you would put your faith in them enough to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you really feel, princess.\u201d Chuckling, Beck leaned closer. \u201cI have no doubt they never would have let him lay a finger on you. They just wanted to see what you\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m familiar with the tactic. I\u2019ve seen other Doms use it at Shadows. Liam and Hammer are crazy if they thought I wouldn\u2019t see through that. If they can barely stand each other touching me, they\u2019re not going to let Seth do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, you\u2019re going to keep them on their toes. I\u2019m going to enjoy this ringside seat.\u201d</p><p>She swatted his shoulder. \u201cSeriously!\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cJust out of curiosity, is the idea so stupid because it\u2019s transparent?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides that...\u201d She waved his words away. \u201cTrust, like communication and honesty, should run both ways. Or in our case, all three ways. None of it works unless everyone is doing their best. Gosh, listen to me. I learned something!\u201d</p><p>Beck nodded. \u201cYes. So you have to tell them what you need and trust that they\u2019ll communicate honestly in return. It isn\u2019t more complicated than that. Well, except the part where you have to trust them to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Individually, she really did. She hadn\u2019t always been good at showing it. She\u2019d never had to submit to Hammer. And she hadn\u2019t really let go with Liam like she should. In the end, though, they had done so much to make her whole. She trusted that they wanted what was best for her. But could they do that together?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I think I have an idea.\u201d She hopped up from her seat, eager to return to the lodge.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He threw down a twenty and turned to wink at the waitress who was pretending not to spy on them. \u201cLet\u2019s blow this taco stand so you can go wrangle those men.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they walked through the door of the lodge into the cheerful great room with its blazing fire. Seth stood near the hearth and turned when Raine entered. But she barely noticed him.</p><p>Dressed in jeans and freshly showered, Liam and Hammer stood, both tense. Then they stepped toward her, and she got a good look at their faces.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat happened to\u2014\u201d The truth hit her between the eyes, and Raine threw her hands up in exasperation. \u201cYou two fought? What the hell? And don\u2019t talk to me about language right now, Liam. I have every right to be ridiculous if you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>They both had the good grace to look sheepish.</p><p>Liam rubbed at a mottled, red-purple spot on his jaw. Both their noses looked swollen. Hammer had a bit of a goose egg on his chin.</p><p>Behind her, Beck chuckled. \u201cGod, you two are funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Beck.\u201d Hammer scowled.</p><p>\u201cI deliver her back to you twice and that\u2019s the thanks I get.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe need to talk about the concept of appreciation, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s her suitcase?\u201d Liam snapped.</p><p>\u201cStill in the SUV.\u201d Raine made her way across the room and sat in one of the overstuffed chairs adjacent to the sofa.</p><p>Beck followed and patted her on the shoulder before he took his place beside Seth. \u201cHand them their balls, princess.\u201d</p><p>She turned to stare at her friend over her shoulder. \u201cCan you behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, precious,\u201d Hammer began. \u201cWe never meant to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she corrected. \u201cYou never meant for me to hear. If you expect me to be honest, you should be as well.\u201d</p><p>He and Liam exchanged a glance before he nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She leaned forward, bracing her elbows on her knees. \u201cTell me, are you two done fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Hammer promised.</p><p>She nodded, then turned to stare at Liam. He was too quiet, and that worried her.</p><p>Her tender Irishman hesitated, then nodded. \u201cWe talked through a lot of things tonight. We\u2019re back on the same page, love.\u201d</p><p>Raine sincerely hoped that was true. \u201cIn order for me to stay, I need to put that to the test. I understand the final task you had planned for me was about trust. No offense, Seth, but I\u2019m not bottoming for you. I\u2019m definitely not sleeping with you, either. I love them, but right now trust is a little thin, and I don\u2019t think I could respond in a way that would please anyone.\u201d</p><p>Seth looked impressed. \u201cThat\u2019s honest. Fair enough. By the way, they weren\u2019t going to let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Beck put in.</p><p>She sent him an impatient glare.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the doctor murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re doing good. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Raine gave him an absent nod, then addressed Liam and Hammer again. \u201cI came here wanting you both in my life. After two days here, I realize that\u2019s what I need. I also know I can\u2019t stop you from fighting, and making you promise to get along was never going to work. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask that you not hit one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Hammer admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw the first punch. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Liam added.</p><p>They both looked so contrite with their proverbial tails tucked between their legs. It wouldn\u2019t last long. They\u2019d soon be big bad alpha Doms again. But at the moment, it was nice to see that distressing her had unsettled them deeply.</p><p>\u201cSo, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: We should all work on our trust. I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes looked sharp, his body taut.</p><p>Hammer lounged against the back of the sofa, but he was no less attentive. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us to work, you two have to trust one another, believe that you\u2019ll do the right thing, and have my best interest at heart, right?\u201d</p><p>They both nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have to trust that you\u2019ll take care of me and give me the experience I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always,\u201d Liam answered.</p><p>\u201cBut now we have a new component. You need to trust me not only to submit myself totally, but to love you equally. You have to believe that I will come to you openly and never choose one over the other. And I assure you, I won\u2019t, not ever again. Do I have any of that wrong, Sirs?\u201d</p><p>They looked at one another in a seeming silent moment of communication.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Hammer nodded at her. \u201cGo on. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>Now the conversation got more difficult. If this didn\u2019t work, she could never try to love just one of them while cutting the other out. She\u2019d have to walk away from them both. Raine understood the huge gamble she was undertaking...but didn\u2019t see another way. If this plan didn\u2019t work, they would never last.</p><p>\u201cBefore I get into that, I need your promise that communication and honesty also run not just from me to you, but from you to me. If I have questions, you\u2019ll give me answers.\u201d</p><p>Another hesitation. Another glance. Then Liam nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, I\u2019ll want answers about some of the things I overheard tonight. If you\u2019re not prepared to give me those answers, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019re not ready for this level of trust and Beck will take me down the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Hammer challenged.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBecause we\u2019d have nothing. You both made it very clear how important communication, honesty, and trust are. It\u2019s so clear that I get it now. We have nothing real without them. I won\u2019t settle for less.\u201d</p><p>Hammer scrubbed a hand down his face. Liam shifted in his seat. Neither looked very comfortable with her request. Beck and Seth didn\u2019t move a muscle. The sense of anticipation turned thick in the air.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Hammer said finally. \u201cI\u2019ll answer your questions in the best way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, too.\u201d Liam nodded her way.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m trusting you to keep your end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why later, love?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cWhy not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to do it after our show of trust. If we get through that, the answers will mean more. If not...then none of it will matter. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to feel comfortable,\u201d Hammer promised.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cWe want you happy.\u201d</p><p>They were willing to give back to her, and that fact alone made Raine\u2019s heart soften. She wanted to fling herself in their arms, but now she had to say the most difficult words of all.</p><p>She stood, pacing around her chair. To her right, Liam and Hammer both edged toward the front of the sofa. Tension gripped the room.</p><p>\u201cGo on, love,\u201d Liam prompted.</p><p>There was no easy way to say this. They would either agree or not, and stalling wouldn\u2019t change that.</p><p>Raine sucked in a bracing breath. \u201cI need you both. I want to give myself completely to you with a fully open heart. I know what I\u2019m asking won\u2019t be easy for either of you, and you can say no. But I\u2019d love the fantasy just this once. If you want that, too, come find me. I want you to make love to me. Together.\u201d</p><p>After Raine mounted the stairs and disappeared into the master suite, the door shut. Seth grabbed her suitcase and ran it upstairs. A moment later, he heard the water running through the pipes to her bathtub.</p><p>Liam let out a breath he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding and turned to look at Hammer. \u201cWell, mate. I think her balls are bigger than ours put together. I\u2019m not sure either of us would ever have been able to handle her on our own.\u201d</p><p>Hammer laughed. \u201cAmazing woman, isn\u2019t she? Others pale in comparison. I\u2019ve got to admit, Raine is the only one I\u2019d ever let hand me my balls on a platter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are so pussy-whipped, it\u2019s fucking hysterical.\u201d Beck snickered.</p><p>Seth jogged down the stairs with a sly grin at Liam. \u201cI remember asking if she\u2019d put a spell on you with her voodoo pussy. At least you didn\u2019t lie about the fact that she has.\u201d</p><p>That made Beck laugh even harder. Hammer joined in, too. Liam tried to keep a straight face, but he couldn\u2019t hold back a smile.</p><p>He elbowed Macen. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Hammer admitted, glancing up the stairs toward the master suite. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for her to put another spell on me.\u201d</p><p>Beck rolled his eyes. \u201cThis is like hearing about my little sister getting down and dirty. Come on, Seth. Let\u2019s raid the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>As the other two Doms left, noisily emptying the contents of the refrigerator, he and Hammer stared into the fire. Neither man spoke for a few minutes, each sipping their drinks, wrapped in their own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIf she thinks it\u2019s only for one night,\u201d Liam groused, \u201cshe\u2019s out of her pretty little head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the only question left is whether or not we\u2019re in this together,\u201d Hammer murmured. \u201cYou need to be clear on whether you\u2019re staying or going now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hammer was right. Liam nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause neither of us will ever be satisfied with just half of her. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll settle for just one night. I can\u2019t imagine you being happy with that, either. If we go up those stairs, we show her it\u2019s not a one-time shot, that we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\u201d He pointed up toward Raine. \u201cWe make her feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. She needs to know we mean it.\u201d</p><p>A grin crawled up Hammer\u2019s face. \u201cExactly. Because she just topped us, and we can\u2019t let that fly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Liam rose for another swallow of Scotch, then headed toward the stairs. Something about the uncertainty on Hammer\u2019s face stopped him. In his friend\u2019s shoes, he\u2019d want to know that his partner was committed. \u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t really serious about throwing in the towel earlier. It was frustration talking. And I\u2019ve worried that my jealousy was just hurting us all. I can\u2019t promise it won\u2019t come back. You might have to give me a kick or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned. \u201cIndeed. But I know Raine needs us.\u201d He took a sip of his drink. \u201cAnd frankly, we need her. I\u2019m in all the way.\u201d</p><p>Hammer let out a breath of relief. \u201cThank god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re discussing more than a night, what about later? What will you do about other subs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m with Raine, there are no other subs. What about you? You always had a little black book back in New York,\u201d Hammer reminded with an arch of a brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going back. I bought a house here, remember? I\u2019m planning to stay here for her.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cFor all of us.\u201d</p><p>Hammer nodded. \u201cWhat about you and me? Are we good? Anything else we need to sort out? \u2018Cause we can take another trip outside if we need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no! It\u2019s cold as fuck out there, and I\u2019m just starting to feel my fingers again. Besides I don\u2019t think I\u2019d win any points with Raine if I made you any uglier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her face?\u201d Hammer looked stunned. \u201cChrist, I thought she was going to take a stick to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she would have if she didn\u2019t worry we\u2019d use it on her ass next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a valid concern.\u201d He grinned slyly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Liam nodded. As silence prevailed, he glanced up the stairs, itching to hold Raine again, to finally see her whole. But they couldn\u2019t sweep this question under the rug. \u201cI think we\u2019ve sorted all our shit through. I\u2019ve spewed everything\u2014probably more than I should have\u2014but I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we both said our fair share. But it\u2019s nice to know that we\u2019ve come out of it still friends. In some ways, I think we have her to thank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor making us see that we\u2019d been idiots? I reckon.\u201d</p><p>Hammer gave a slow smile. \u201cThe only thing left to do is figure out how we\u2019re going to give her a night so fucking fabulous that she\u2019ll want another.\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned back. \u201cAnd another. And another...\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Raine put the last of the scented lotion on her body, then wrapped a clean towel around her as she fought back her nerves. Would they come tonight? Tomorrow? Ever? Would they still want her? Would they be able to share her even once? She didn\u2019t have any illusions; she was asking them for a lot. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for either of them to set their feelings aside to give her this fantasy.</p> <p>Taking in a steadying breath, she pushed out of the bathroom to rummage through the suitcase Seth had brought up to her. She spotted Hammer shirtless and lounging on the bed, surrounded by easily a dozen candles. She stopped short, her heart stuttering with excitement. Then she scanned the room.</p><p>No Liam.</p><p>Her heart broke apart instantly. He\u2019d tried for weeks to make her grow and blossom. He\u2019d helped her so much here at the lodge. Had all the day\u2019s confessions been too much for him? He especially had wanted her all to himself. She put her hand to her neck, still missing the lovely weight of his collar there. The thought of never feeling the mark of his possession again shredded her.</p><p>\u201cHello, precious.\u201d Hammer\u2019s deep voice seduced her, a smoky murmur that stirred her memories of the pleasure they\u2019d shared. Each and every day, that night haunted her. She\u2019d never escaped the sharp pang of need to feel him again.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Tonight, she didn\u2019t know what else to say. All the confidence she\u2019d built up in the bar with Beck, that had given her such strength when she\u2019d delivered her proposition...it had evaporated. She should be happy that she was both a better submissive and a better human being. But if she\u2019d finally pushed Liam away for good, how was she supposed to find peace with half of her heart missing?</p><p>The door kicked open a minute later, and her gaze zipped up. Beck and Seth carried in a big cheval mirror. An antique with a distressed black frame, its straight lines blended with the gentle curves of its legs into something truly stunning.</p><p>Raine clutched the towel over her breasts and watched the guys cart it in until they\u2019d positioned it to face the bed, a few feet from the edge.</p><p>With a satisfied nod, Seth released it and straightened, then headed her way. He smiled as he cupped her arm. \u201cBe happy.\u201d</p><p>God knew she wanted to be, but not without Liam. He\u2019d become as essential to her as sunshine or food. As air. She pressed a fist to the aching hollow of her stomach.</p><p>Beck strolled over an instant later. \u201cTry to keep it to a dull roar, huh?\u201d</p><p>Before she could chastise him, he kissed her forehead, then clapped Seth on the back. Out the door they went, leaving her alone with Macen.</p><p>\u201cLose the towel, precious,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Before they\u2019d come to the lodge, Raine would have believed she could just stand naked in front of one of them and not realize how much she needed the other. But they\u2019d opened her eyes. She had no way to unsee the truth.</p><p>How could she set him down gently? Just explain that she refused to give him half of herself, she supposed.</p><p>Raine clasped the towel tighter to her chest. \u201cMacen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Hammer give you an order?\u201d</p><p>She turned to the familiar lilt. Hope surged. Liam strolled in, shirtless and carrying a small black bag. Like Hammer, the lean muscles of his shoulders and pectorals bulged and rippled with every move and sent her pulse skidding. He kicked the door behind him and sent her a wolfish smile. A quick glance back to Hammer revealed heat and expectation glowing in his eyes. The testosterone in the room swelled. Her breathing went shallow. Need settled right behind her clit.</p><p>They\u2019d both come.</p><p>Raine dropped her towel. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, she fell to her knees and sat back on her heels, head bowed, thighs parted. To her left, she heard the rustle of the bed covers and assumed Hammer pulled them free. To her right, Liam strolled closer until his bare feet filled her vision. He dropped the little black bag on the carpet beside him.</p><p>\u201cPretty. Rise, love.\u201d His voice was soft but whiplike in the hush. He held his hand out to her.</p><p>Placing her trembling fingers in his, she lunged to her feet and looked up at him, searching his dark eyes. They glittered with desire, too. With love, just like Hammer\u2019s.</p><p>For this moment at least, her world was complete.</p><p>Hammer approached on her right and lightly gripped her elbow. \u201cCome to the mirror. Let us see you.\u201d</p><p>They guided her in front of the tall glass and positioned her to face it, totally bare. Her cheeks looked flushed already. Her nipples pebbled under their stares. Her pussy looked slick and pouting. God, they aroused her before they really even put a hand on her.</p><p>Raine glanced at them both. That worried female part of her wondered if they\u2019d like what they saw on display. They\u2019d both seen everything she offered them now, but did either of them feel differently knowing they wouldn\u2019t be taking her alone? It was probably a silly question. She had to believe they were here because they wanted to be, but nerves still wrenched her.</p><p>Hammer caressed his way up her arms. \u201cYou know, every time I see you, I want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t funny exactly, but she laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s given you a giggle?\u201d Liam demanded, looking very stern. \u201cHe\u2019s told you that he wants you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to wipe the smile off her face. \u201cI was standing here feeling insecure, and he put that to rest with one sentence in his usual eloquent way. It struck me as funny.\u201d She sent a soft gaze to Hammer. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be. Talk about a red ass...\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI second that.\u201d Liam smoothed a hand down her backside.</p><p>\u201cSeems like you always want to spank me,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut like Hammer, I always want to fuck you, as well.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the most romantic thing either of them had ever said to her, but it still made her feel beautiful and feminine. Wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you both came, Sirs. I worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour honesty is gorgeous, precious.\u201d Hammer pressed a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cThere was no way we weren\u2019t going to come for you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI\u2019m still grateful you did. How can I serve you?\u201d</p><p>More than likely, she should be bowing her head or something to show respect, but she really just wanted to look into their eyes and reveal to them both how earnest she felt. How much she loved them.</p><p>Judging from their sensual male smiles, they understood completely.</p><p>\u201cYou can start by putting your hands at your sides. Close your eyes. Spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s soft commands might as well have touched her where she needed it most. They ratcheted up her desire until it twisted her chest. But she did exactly as he\u2019d bid, clasping her thighs lightly as she opened them and slid her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he whispered in her ear, then nipped at her lobe with his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take every inch of you in every way we can.\u201d</p><p>Raine swallowed hard. Her knees nearly went out from under her.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll damn well know you\u2019re ours,\u201d Hammer growled in her other ear.</p><p>\u201cYour job, love, is to give everything to us. No holding back. No reservations. No thinking about anything but what you need. Is that clear?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Even her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cYour safe word stands. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew, but he always verified with her. He always worried about her care.</p><p>\u201cParis, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, precious.\u201d Hammer skimmed a hand down her right hip. \u201cAre you wet?\u201d</p><p>Excitement stole her breath. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it. Show me,\u201d he barked.</p><p>She frowned, puzzling it out in her head. How? Finally, she lifted her hand from her thigh and dipped her fingers between her swollen folds, shocked to feel that she wasn\u2019t just wet but drenched. She gasped when she skimmed her clit, wishing that one of them would\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Hammer grabbed her wrist and lifted her hand from her pussy and led it toward him.</p><p>A moment later, she felt the wet heat of his mouth surround her digits. His tongue cradled them, swirling and licking as he moaned. The air left her lungs in a rush. It didn\u2019t make any sense, but the ache behind her clit became a throb.</p><p>\u201cDo you like knowing he\u2019s tasting you?\u201d Liam asked in a low, seductive murmur.</p><p>Raine wanted to turn to him and beg him to kiss her, lay her back and touch her, get deep inside her\u2014something to alleviate the ache. Her nails dug into her thigh and she bit her lip to hold in her begging. A dizzy fever swam in her head.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, Macen withdrew her fingers from his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. It\u2019s a shame, man. I wanted to taste that pretty cunt, but I guess she doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>\u201cI like it. I want it. Please...\u201d No missing the pleading note in her voice, and she didn\u2019t care. Let them know she wanted them more than anything. It was nothing but the truth.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d A note of steel rang in Hammer\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he praised. But she still felt the loss of his body heat as he stepped away.</p><p>From her left, Liam\u2019s fingers skimmed the long line of her spine, then dipped down to skate over the cleft of her ass. A moment later, his touch disappeared, too.</p><p>Absolute silence and still blanketed the room. Anxiety gripped Raine\u2019s stomach. She wanted to ask what was wrong or open her eyes and see if they\u2019d gone. Trust, she reminded herself. They wouldn\u2019t come this far to leave her. She wouldn\u2019t disobey because of her insecurities. They would give her the experience she craved if she let them.</p><p>After a calming breath, she centered herself and let the tension go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased, love,\u201d Liam said, sounding somewhere behind her, closer to the ground. She didn\u2019t have time to do more than frown in question before he raked his palms up her thighs. \u201cOpen your eyes and watch us.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered up, and Raine looked into the mirror. She sucked in a stunned breath.</p><p>Hammer crouched in front of her, his mouth so close to her pussy. The heat of his breath, the strong inhalation as he drew in her scent, the urgent thumbs he used to part her folds all made her gasp.</p><p>He settled his mouth over her clit and sucked deep at the same time Liam parted the cheeks of her ass and rimmed her rosette with slick, insistent fingers.</p><p>Raine mewled as desire rolled through her in a fresh wave, igniting nerve endings and silencing her fears. Nothing but the gaping, jagged ache of need remained, stealing her thoughts and overtaking her every cell, every vein, every heartbeat.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn\u2019t, but Raine reached out both to steady herself and to touch Hammer, rifling her fingers through his hair with a moan. He suckled her clit again, then laved it, toying with her, alternating the pressure and happily driving her out of her mind.</p><p>Behind her, Liam nipped at her cheek, his teeth gently digging, before he sank a finger inside her, shoving past the entrance, through the tight ring, right into the depths of her. Another followed, filling her with a snug tension that had her hitching in a breath. Then he kissed his way up her hip. His lips skated up her back as he stood, his body brushing hers and surrounding her with heat. Then he nipped across her shoulder blade, his mouth settling just below her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you liking this, love?\u201d The sexy murmur all but dared her to say otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d He thrust his fingers a bit deeper, parting them slowly and preparing her. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me,\u201d she gasped. \u201cBoth of you. Please, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the pretty way you beg.\u201d</p><p>Hammer chose that moment to nip at her clit, then soothe it with the tip of his tongue. An electric shock of tingles burst under her skin. She tightened her fingers in his hair. Blood surged and pleasure swelled. She\u2019d fantasized about this for longer than she even wanted to admit to herself. But the reality made her imaginings pale. Every sensation was so crisp and loud. Her heartbeat drummed. Her legs felt like noodles. Raine wanted to serve and please them after they\u2019d done so much for her, but they enslaved her with these sensations. She couldn\u2019t seem to do more than whimper.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s enough, Hammer,\u201d Liam said. \u201cShe wants us to fuck her. Apparently, she doesn\u2019t want to come on your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she contradicted. \u201cPlease, Sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck you then, either?\u201d He tsked at her. \u201cBloody demanding wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease may I come on your tongue, Hammer? Then will you both fuck me?\u201d Saying the words sounded odd, a little embarrassing, but that barely pierced the haze of her need. And Raine had no illusions that they not only wanted her to say exactly what she desired, but they expected it.</p><p>She refused to disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cListen to that, mate. You don\u2019t have to guess what she wants now, do you?\u201d</p><p>Hammer didn\u2019t respond verbally, just groaned as he set his mouth over the top of her cunt, anchoring his tongue in her opening and sucking. His groan vibrated through her entire body.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s his way of telling you to come,\u201d Liam whispered, his tone silky. \u201cDo it now\u2014and anytime tonight you have the urge. We want your pleasure, every last bit of it. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she managed to get out in one rushed breath before his fingers probed against sensitive nerves and Hammer\u2019s mouth startled her with another rush of ecstasy.</p><p>The sensations stacked, one on top of the other, until she was sweltering, dizzy, losing her balance and her mind. And she didn\u2019t care. The surge and rush of need slammed her. One more pull of Macen\u2019s lips, one more second...</p> <p>\u201cWe want to hear you scream, love, loud and often,\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to be a problem.</p><p>Reality shifted, slipped, as the supernova of sensation exploded, bursting over her senses, taking her strength and balance with it. She wailed out, a high-pitched keening that bounced off the walls and filled her ears, echoing in the room around them. Her womb pulsed. Her fists clenched in Hammer\u2019s hair. With one hand Liam propped her up. With the other, his fingers filled her ass, wringing a staggering pleasure from her.</p><p>She ran out of air before the pulses stopped. With Hammer at the helm, the bliss seemed to last forever as they worked together to take every bit of her surrender and make it theirs.</p><p>Finally, panting, weak, stunned, she fell back into Liam\u2019s arms. Hammer stood and smiled down into her face, licking his lips like a very proud man.</p><p>A wave of love rolled through her as she looked into his hazel eyes. They\u2019d darkened to something closer to emerald, and she knew from their one night together that meant he needed her, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bad, Macen,\u201d she teased weakly.</p><p>Hammer shrugged and pulled her into his embrace. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You made that sound like I was pretty damn good.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened.</p><p>Liam disappeared into the bathroom to wash his hands, then returned to lift her in his arms. He laid her on the bed and covered her body with his own. As he swooped down to capture her mouth, she opened to him completely, rising up to crush their chests together, to take his tongue. For long moments, he\u2019d played cool and collected, but she felt the urgency of his need now. He intended to put a stamp on her by making her crave him and scream for him, too.</p><p>Then he shimmied down her body, falling on her nipples that beaded and throbbed for his attention. He took one peak against his tongue and sucked hard, nipping and biting. A new wave of sensation formed almost immediately. She arched, trying to offer him more.</p><p>Hammer leaned over her. \u201cGive him those pink nipples, Raine. Tell him you want them sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I want them sucked, Sir,\u201d she managed to get out.</p><p>Above her, Liam growled.</p><p>Macen\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get fucked, precious. It\u2019s been exactly thirty days since I\u2019ve felt you grip my cock. Since then, I\u2019ve craved the chance to be inside you once more. I\u2019m going to stretch you and tunnel my way inside that sweltering ass again. And you\u2019re going to let me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, god. His every word set her ablaze. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Liam pounced on her other nipple, making it every bit as tender and swollen as the first. He pinched the one he\u2019d just worked, and every sensation jolted straight down to her clit. Her blood boiled as if she hadn\u2019t had an orgasm three minutes ago. As if she hadn\u2019t had one in the last five years.</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m filling every bit of that ass,\u201d Hammer went on, \u201cLiam is going to stuff your pretty cunt with every inch he\u2019s got. You\u2019re going to be a good girl and take all we give you. You\u2019re going to plead for us, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hear every whimper and wail, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, Sir,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to come for us.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked up at her, his dark eyes blazing. \u201cMinx.\u201d</p><p>He gave her no time to even pretend to protest before he lavished more attention on her nipples. Biting, sucking, twisting, Liam was relentless, keeping at her until the little peaks crested hard, a little sore, but very well loved.</p><p>Until he\u2019d used them so thoroughly, she felt herself crashing toward another climax.</p><p>As she panted and felt the flush creep up her body, Liam eased away and climbed off the mattress.</p><p>The moment he did, Hammer pulled her to her feet, facing the side of the bed. He hovered behind her. Liam positioned the mirror so that she could see herself...and they would be able to watch themselves penetrate her in whatever way they chose. She trembled.</p><p>When Liam had the mirror arranged, he bent to retrieve two items from his little black bag. One at a time, he threw them to Hammer. The first was something white and oblong. The second looked flat and square. Lube and a condom. She heard the fall of his zipper.</p><p>She turned to look at Hammer over her shoulder, searching for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cYou and I have done this part before, precious. I\u2019ll start first. We know double penetration will be new for you. We\u2019ll go easy. Just relax.\u201d He caressed her shoulder, his lips skating up her neck.</p><p>No way would he hurt her. She nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Liam took up position on the bed in front of her, balancing on his knees, looming just slightly above her. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Raine couldn\u2019t have looked anywhere else if she tried.</p><p>\u201cGood. Lean into me. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, she heard a delicate rip and knew exactly what Hammer was doing, what he had planned. Her insides danced with excitement, but she scanned Liam\u2019s expression. How did he feel? Was he prepared for this? She wasn\u2019t asking for more than a night; she couldn\u2019t force them to have a relationship, after all.</p><p>His dark stare reflected back her passion, the need and yearning that had her reaching for him and leaning in, just as he\u2019d asked.</p><p>As she drew closer, he took her mouth, sweeping inside with a slow, sweet seduction that made her toes curl into the carpet.</p><p>Hammer chose that moment to slide his slickened fingers over her opening and add to the lubricant Liam had prepared her with earlier. Just his touch there thrilled her, but knowing he meant to sink deep into her and that Liam would steady her, kiss her, while Macen did...</p><p>A breathless wave swept over her as Hammer withdrew his fingers. He didn\u2019t wait an instant before he parted her cheeks and set the head of his cock against her opening. \u201cYou know what to do. Arch and push out. Take me, precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered, looking into Liam\u2019s eyes.</p><p>But he still looked steady, strong. She did everything Hammer asked as she stared up into Liam\u2019s gaze, hoping he could see the pleasure she experienced and how grateful she was to him for making this possible.</p><p>As Hammer popped past her tight ring, he eased his way in, a slow, molasses glide all the way inside her, so deep, she swore she could feel him in every corner of her body. Once he\u2019d plunged in completely, she arched and tossed her head back, reveling in the raw ecstasy of the moment.</p><p>Hammer grabbed her hair in his fist and nearly withdrew. \u201cKiss him to show us both how much you\u2019re enjoying this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she eeked out, then reached up for Liam.</p><p>He met her halfway, his lips searching, parted, seizing her and making her feel so treasured.</p><p>Behind her, Hammer thrust his cock deep again. Liam\u2019s tongue filled her mouth. The sensation of being owned rushed through her bloodstream, unlike anything else she\u2019d ever experienced. Between them, wrapped in their passion, she felt small, female, possessed...and shockingly submissive. Just like the night she\u2019d taken them both into her mouth and pleased them, she wanted to give them everything she could, whatever would thrill them. She felt desperate to show them how much she yearned to give of herself.</p><p>Then Liam caressed his way down her waist, her hip, trailing his fingers into her aching pussy, adding fuel to the fire. As he found her clit and rubbed in gentle, insistent circles, Raine grabbed onto his shoulders and looked at him helplessly. Her pleasure was in their hands. His stare told her she had nothing to worry about.</p><p>Hammer thrust deep again, harder, rougher than before. She wanted it, craved it.</p><p>He tugged on her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re tightening on me, precious. Are you going to come?\u201d</p><p>As incredible as it seemed, after the shattering orgasm they\u2019d already given her, she would have thought it impossible. Instead, Raine knew it was inevitable. The pressure gathered. The blood collected. The need grew until she mewled into Liam\u2019s kiss, all but begging for just a bit more pressure and a lot more relief.</p><p>As if they had some silent communication, they suddenly ramped up as one. Hammer shoved his way in, one hard shuttling thrust after the other, electrifying every sensitive nerve gripping his cock, while Liam circled and pinched her clit. They controlled her. They knew precisely what she needed. They had the power to give...or take away.</p><p>After another seductive swirl of his tongue around hers, Liam pulled free and settled his lips against her ear. \u201cI can feel your clit hard on my fingers. You want to come, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d She could barely find a breath.</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d Hammer growled, and Raine could hear his will to hold back.</p><p>\u201cSuck it up, mate. We can\u2019t fail her.\u201d Liam rubbed the pad of his thumb directly over her sensitive little bud, and she saw stars. \u201cNow, love.\u201d</p><p>Before he even got the words out, Raine twisted and screamed, arched and grabbed onto Liam for dear life as another cataclysm roared through her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hammer grunted, clutching her hip in a death grip, tugging on her hair as he fought for restraint. With a blistering stare, Liam watched her and groaned. The soundtrack merely added fuel to her fire. Everything inside her body beamed with ecstasy.</p><p>Slowly, the shattering stopped. She caught her breath. Hammer gentled his hold. Liam pulled away with a curse, tumbling to the floor and fumbling in that little black bag. Moments later, he ripped his jeans off and kicked them away, then sheathed himself. He clambered back onto the bed, teeth bared. He dipped under her and grabbed her hips, urging her onto the mattress to straddle him.</p><p>Raine climbed slowly, careful not to dislodge Hammer or disrupt his tight grip. Together, they positioned her over Liam\u2019s swollen, angry cock. She fell forward on her hands and knees. Hammer pushed her down with his next stroke, driving Liam straight inside her, one agonizing inch at a time until he filled her completely.</p><p>The dual invasion stretched her. She felt stuffed, impossibly penetrated. At the same time, it changed every perspective she\u2019d held about pleasure. This was...beyond.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Just from his voice, the effort to ask that question clearly cost Liam.</p><p>\u201cFine, Sir.\u201d She stared down into his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to disguise her pleading. She needed what only they could give her too badly.</p><p>\u201cLook at us,\u201d Hammer commanded behind her, still sounding like he fought for control.</p><p>Raine turned her head to peer into the mirror Liam had positioned. She\u2019d almost shied away from it earlier. Without Liam, the picture hadn\u2019t been complete. But now... The image seared itself into her head and blew her away\u2014her between them, looking so much fairer, smaller. Them surrounding her, muscled, male, and determined. Possession stamped their faces. Determination tightened their bodies as they pushed their way into her, alternating strokes, setting up a rhythm that kept the tingles skittering under her skin, the need pooling in her pussy, and the lava flowing in her veins. Love poured out in every direction as they gripped her, filled her, gave their all to her.</p><p>This didn\u2019t feel like the one night she\u2019d asked for. It felt like forever.</p><p>Another orgasm threatened to overtake her, and she looked at Liam, torn between panic and supplication.</p><p>As he ground up into her, sweat dripping from his temples with effort, he fused his stare with hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you hold out on us.\u201d</p><p>Frantically, she shook her head, then cried out when the force and cadence of their thrusts notched up again. She wasn\u2019t going to last. Neither were they. And she wanted to weep. This couldn\u2019t end, not when she knew in her heart they could have so many more tomorrows together.</p><p>In seconds, the ecstasy would send her hurtling into the heavens. But she wanted to make one thing clear first.</p><p>\u201cI love you both. Always.\u201d</p><p>Liam gripped her waist and forced her down onto his surging cock. \u201cI love you, too. I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, precious!\u201d Hammer bellowed. \u201cI said it. I meant it. I love you. It\u2019s the fucking truth.\u201d</p><p>The insistence of their words, the pounding of their bodies, the way they all breathed and swayed together\u2014it felt like total devotion, like nothing less than love.</p><p>Her entire body gathered, pooling and swirling. The power of this climax buzzed in her head. Raine glanced in the mirror one last time. They moved as one, the ebb and flow of breaths and limbs, of thrusts and gasps and heartbeats all converged.</p><p>Deep inside her, she felt them swell, heard their cries of passion as orgasm gripped them. They held her tighter and shouted her name, hearts pounding against her as they seemingly poured everything from their souls into her.</p><p>The explosion hurtled her, a cataclysm that broke and remade her, remolding her into not just a woman, but their woman. As they fell into a heap together on the bed and the men murmured and caressed her, Raine knew that, no matter what, she\u2019d feel like theirs for the rest of her life.</p><p>Raine curled around Liam, her soft exhalations whispering on his neck. Her sighs and cries of ecstasy still played in his head. With them, she\u2019d been giving, open, honest\u2014revealing the dazzling submissive and woman he\u2019d always imagined. Raine had drowned in the bliss of their tandem assault, bravely rising again and again for more, taking them both deeper into her body, her heart, with such splendor it had left him stunned and breathless.</p><p>The night had been beyond his wildest fantasies. No comparison with what he, Hammer, and Juliet had shared once long ago. That had been a sex act. This? Adoration and worship. Love should feel every bit this connected and necessary. The reality blew his mind, and he drew her closer, sliding a gaze over to Hammer softly snoring beside her, a coveting hand on her belly.</p><p>The room hung heavy with their combined pheromones until every lungful of air stirred the replay in his head again. Closing his eyes, he let it flicker through from beginning to end again, every moment, every sigh, scream and shudder of bliss indelibly carved forever in his memory. She\u2019d loved every second of it, bursting into life and love in a way she\u2019d never done with him alone.</p> <p>Part of him grieved for what would never be again. Now that ecstasy wasn\u2019t ripping through him, so many of his insecurities came crashing back. Did Raine need Hammer because he alone wasn\u2019t enough for her? Would having Hammer back in the picture mean that she eventually wouldn\u2019t need him? Liam couldn\u2019t forget the way his friend had pounded into her soft body so roughly at times. Liam had nearly stopped him once or twice. But Raine\u2019s moans hadn\u2019t been of distress. Far from it. As much as he hated to, Liam wondered where that left him in her heart.</p><p>The buzz of his phone in the pocket of his jeans had him easing away from Raine. He searched the floor for his pants. Who the devil would be calling him now? Everyone who mattered to him was under this roof.</p><p>Seeing the light spilling from the pocket, he slid it free as he walked with it into the bathroom and closed the door quietly, answering quickly before the sound woke the other two.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you Liam? The people at this Shadows club won\u2019t tell your wife where to find you.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>\u201cEx-wife.\u201d She was in Los Angeles? At Shadows? \u201cWhat do you want, Gwyneth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, of course. I need to see you. Now.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
