They were both competitive by nature and always trying to one up the other but it never caused hard feelings.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the third game in a row. I think you\u2019re cheating somehow,\u201d Joseph said while he eyed his brother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a sore loser,\u201d George replied, then stood and headed to the bar to poor each of them a drink. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have a sprite on the rocks. Damn Doc said nothing harder than carbonation for me until my blood pressure comes down,\u201d Joseph mumbled. George poured Joseph a sprite and himself a nice glass of aged whiskey. He received a glare when he sat down, sipping it in front of Joseph.</p><p>\u201cQuit glaring, I\u2019m not the one with the medical problems,\u201d George said with a laugh. Joseph shrugged his shoulders and sat back. It was late and Katherine would be expecting him soon.</p><p>\u201cMake any headway with Bree, yet?\u201d Joseph asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s been going on with her lately. She\u2019s restless. If only she\u2019d settle down,\u201d George trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYou know Chad\u2019s back home.\u201d Joseph let his sentence sink in.</p> <p>\u201cMmm, definite possibilities there, that boy can\u2019t be easily intimidated,\u201d George replied as the wheels in his head started turning. Bree could barely look at a man before her brothers scared him away. Now, Chad wasn\u2019t only strong, but had been friends with Mark and his brothers since they were kids. He wasn\u2019t easily pushed around and George had a feeling he could put up with a lot without breaking.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time we have a family dinner, a nice welcome home party for Chad,\u201d George said, his eyes lighting up. He was afraid Bree was pulling so far away from him he\u2019d never get her back. He\u2019d also received some worrisome letters, lately. Most of the time his security staff assured him hate mail was harmless, but one particular type of letter had come in repeatedly. They feared it was from the same person... and the man wasn\u2019t backing down.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll have dinner on Friday,\u201d Joseph agreed. The two men made plans long into the night, their spirits rejuvenated with another matchmaking mission on the horizon.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to have you back, Chad. Are you home permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, It\u2019s time for me to retire from the military and settle down,\u201d Chad answered Joseph. They were sitting in Joseph\u2019s inviting den, catching up. Chad had been out of the country more than in it over the last twenty years. He\u2019d joined the military right out of high school with his missions being top secret, he wasn\u2019t often able to talk to his friends for months on end.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to have you home,\u201d Mark said. He\u2019d missed his friend. He knew Chad was dealing with a lot of demons, but hopefully being around friends would help.</p><p>Chad and Mark had a lot of similar features, both tall with dark hair and blazing blue eyes. When they\u2019d been younger, they had used those similarities when on the prowl for women. Chad was virtually a third brother to Mark.</p><p>Chad had originally joined the army right out of high school, but after five years and several successful missions, he was recruited by the Special Operations Group to be a SEAL. He\u2019d only been twenty-three at the time and excited to be called up. After a couple years, he\u2019d become secretive.</p><p>Then about ten years ago, he\u2019d closed up completely. They knew he was involved in top secret missions and they knew his life was always on the line, but they couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it. All they could do was offer their support when he came home. They were grateful he\u2019d decided to retire.</p><p>Mark spent six years in the reserves. He\u2019d thought about making a career out of the military, but he\u2019d changed his mind. He had too much love for the land and his personal freedom. He knew you either gave your all, or nothing. Those men depended on each other to stay alive.</p><p>As he watched his friend, he almost wished he would\u2019ve gone with him. Maybe then Chad wouldn\u2019t have so many demons to fight.</p><p>Whatever his last mission had been, it hadn\u2019t been pleasant. Maybe someday he\u2019d open up about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Chad replied before taking another sip from his bottle.</p> <p>\u201cTime for what, Chad?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to tell you. I purchased that ranch, south of your place. Everything closed a month ago but I wanted to wait until I saw you to say anything,\u201d Chad answered, his face breaking out in a smile for the first time that evening.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s great! I was thinking about obtaining that piece of land but they told me someone already had it. They wouldn\u2019t say who, though,\u201d Mark exclaimed. He\u2019d been upset when he found out the land was purchased without being placed on the market. He\u2019d asked the previous owners to give him first choice, but the cranky old man who owned it said Mark had enough land and didn\u2019t need any more. Mark hadn\u2019t fought him on the matter but he\u2019d hoped to one day own it and expand his ranch further. He no longer cared, though because he\u2019d much rather have Chad as a neighbor than add acreage he really didn\u2019t need.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Jed? He was friends with one of the kids of the old man. He told me the guy wanted to move to warmer weather so I jumped on it. I need something physical to keep me busy. D.C. offered me a desk job, but there\u2019s just no way,\u201d Chad said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d Lucas jumped in the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll be out with you guys instead of locked in the office all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming out of retirement so don\u2019t plan on staying out there too much,\u201d Joseph said with a glare directed at his oldest son.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d Lucas answered with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cNow that you have the land, when are you going to fill it up with kids?\u201d Joseph asked, making all the men groan.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with marriage and kids. Half of you in this room are already taken, so quit the groaning,\u201d George jumped in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as easily lassoed as these guys, so back off,\u201d Chad said with a chuckle, though he eyed Joseph for an extra second to make sure he knew Chad didn\u2019t want him playing matchmaker. He had a sneaking suspicion the old man had something to do with the marriages of his kids and nephews. George and Joseph were twin brothers and had got the idea into their heads that life wasn\u2019t complete without a whole herd of grandchildren climbing all over him.</p><p>Chad wasn\u2019t one of their kids, but being best friends with Mark made him a prime target. He could practically feel the arrow aimed straight towards his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, boy, but a good woman to warm your bed at night isn\u2019t the worst thing,\u201d Joseph said.</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of women to warm my bed. I don\u2019t need to put a ring on any of them,\u201d Chad answered back. Joseph shook his head and went back to talking to his brother. The boys all laughed, happy with their small victory. Chad could hold his own any day of the week.</p><p>While everyone was occupied, Chad stepped out on the balcony, needing a few moments alone. He\u2019d been bluffing Joseph. He certainly wasn\u2019t a monk, but he barely had time for himself, let alone finding myriads of women. He just wasn\u2019t interested in tying himself down in a relationship. There were too many complications.</p><p>He looked out over the large back yard and sighed. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been able to relax and smell the flowers. He wasn\u2019t sure if retirement was a good or bad thing. At least with his own land, he could work night and day if he desired. He wouldn\u2019t have to answer to another person, and more importantly, he wouldn\u2019t be responsible for other people\u2019s lives.</p><p>\u201cTime for dinner,\u201d Katherine called. Chad took a calming breath, then stepped through the door. He kissed Katherine on the cheek as he passed by. She was like a mother to him. He didn\u2019t know how his life would\u2019ve turned out if it hadn\u2019t been for Joseph and Katherine. They were the kind of parents every kid dreamed of having. He\u2019d bend over backwards for them \u2013 all they had to do was ask.</p><p>She was sick of it. While she loved each one of her brothers, she was tired of their overbearing, overprotective, he-man tactics. She had to get away for a while, take time for herself and prove she wasn\u2019t some delicate flower needing twenty-four hour supervision.</p><p>Brianne Lynn Anderson, or as everyone called her, Bree, was the youngest of four children. Her siblings were all strong, stubborn, alpha males who treated her like she was still ten years old, even though she was twenty-eight and a college graduate.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t managed to keep a boyfriend for longer than a few weeks because once they met her brothers they went scampering for the hills. She was so disgusted with the cowards for running that she wasn\u2019t even upset when they left. Still, she\u2019d like to actually find out what it was like to be treated like a woman. She was probably the oldest living virgin in the United States. Her brothers would like for her to die an old maid.</p><p>She jumped in her car and quickly hit the gas pedal. Her father had summoned her to Joseph\u2019s mansion for a welcome home party for some friend of Mark\u2019s, but she figured it was the perfect time to escape from her overprotective family. She jumped on the freeway and started driving south - the farther she pulled away, the bigger her smile became. Freedom flashed over and over in her mind. Even though it was overcast and cold she flipped open her sunroof and stuck her hand in the open air. She laughed with pure joy at what she was doing.</p><p>Maybe by the time she returned, her family would realize she wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore and they could let her live her own life. She loved them \u2013 but she could only take so much pampering.</p><p>Chad sat on the couch holding a glass of deep amber whiskey, smiling as he enjoyed the warmth from both the liquor and the flames in front of him.</p><p>The Macallan sixty-year-old Single Malt Whiskey was like butter on his tongue. He laughed at the idea that anyone would spend sixty thousand dollars on a single bottle of alcohol, even one that tasted as good as what he was sipping. Chad was incredibly wealthy by anyone\u2019s standards, but sixty thousand...</p><p>Over the past twenty years, Chad hadn\u2019t had to spend anything of what he made. Every dime he received went right into investments. Luckily, those gambles had paid off well, leaving him with millions. He\u2019d paid cash for his ranch and it hadn\u2019t even made a dent in his account. He\u2019d been so frugal his entire life, changing his ways wouldn\u2019t be easy. As his commander had said many times, he needed to live a little, whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>The Anderson\u2019s made him seem like a pauper, though. He figured when the US government needed to be bailed out in a crisis situation, Joseph Anderson was who they called. He may be exaggerating a bit, but still, the family was America\u2019s Royalty.</p><p>Chad didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d been summoned back to Joseph\u2019s place. He\u2019d just been there the previous week for dinner and he needed to get his ranch settled. However, when Mark called and asked for a favor, he would always drop everything and be there for him \u2013 just like he knew the same was true of Mark. If Chad needed him, he\u2019d be there \u2013 and with back-up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Chad looked around the room, the Anderson men began entering. Mark had left him sitting on the couch while he hunted down his father. He was being tight lipped and Chad\u2019s suspicions rose when he saw Mark\u2019s cousins\u2019 step into the room. They eyed him warily and he didn\u2019t back down. He stared them straight in the eye, wondering why he felt like he was in enemy territory all of a sudden.</p><p>He\u2019d brought back a lot of battle wounds from his years of service, not just mentally, but physically, too. He unconsciously rubbed his rib where a bullet had struck. One more inch to the left and he\u2019d have been dead. All that remained was a minor scar but it was something he looked at often to remind himself to be careful who he trusted. That bullet had come from someone who was supposed to be on the same side as him.</p><p>\u201cSorry to keep you waiting so long, Chad,\u201d Joseph said as he entered the room followed by Mark. If Chad had been nodding off, Joseph\u2019s booming voice would\u2019ve certainly woken him. The man had a way of making people stand at attention better than Chad\u2019s old commander.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a problem. I\u2019ve been enjoying your whiskey,\u201d Chad responded as he swallowed down the last of the amber liquid.</p> <p>\u201cYou have excellent taste, my boy. George got me that bottle for my last birthday. It\u2019s almost out so I\u2019ll have to hunt down some more. It\u2019s hard to find truly exceptional products these days,\u201d Joseph answered, not even blinking at the five-thousand dollars\u2019 worth of whiskey Chad had drank without tasting.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the big emergency?\u201d Chad asked. He didn\u2019t want to be rude but he had a lot to take care of and didn\u2019t want to stand around discussing liquor.</p><p>\u201cI like a man who gets straight to the point,\u201d Joseph replied, not answering Chad\u2019s question. Chad looked again at Mark\u2019s cousins and felt like he was being assessed \u2013 and they found him wanting.</p><p>\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t want to tell me why you wanted me here, then do you want to explain why your nephew, Max, looks like he wants to tear my head off?\u201d Chad said. He smirked at Max, who looked like he was thinking about stepping over and slugging Chad. After a second, Chad raised his brows at him in a bring-it-on gesture, then smiled as he watched Austin grab his brother\u2019s arm when it looked like he was about to step forward.</p><p>Chad hadn\u2019t been around Mark\u2019s cousins much; just saw them a few times when he was in town, but not enough to really feel he knew any of them. They\u2019d never before been hostile, though and he couldn\u2019t understand why they felt a need to act macho all of a sudden.</p> <p>\u201cSorry about my boys, Chad. We have a situation and my brother and I have come up with a solution that the boys aren\u2019t too thrilled about. They can\u2019t beat down their sister so they want to take their frustrations out on you,\u201d George said as he stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do with this?\u201d Chad asked, wanting to know what was going on. He was sick of them sidestepping the issue.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to say this but to just come out with it, Bree\u2019s gone missing,\u201d George said. Chad instantly tensed \u2013 his full military training coming to the front. This was something he could handle.</p><p>\u201cHave you put in a missing person\u2019s report, hired an investigator? Have there been any threats made against her?\u201d Chad fired off questions.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nothing like that. She was feeling a bit overwhelmed by her brothers and cousins. We found where she is. She\u2019s not all that great at hiding, and we were able to trace her credit cards. She\u2019s staying in a small town in Oregon. I went there to try to find out what was going on and she refused to come home. She said she was being smothered and she\u2019s determined to make it on her own. Apparently, she\u2019s refusing to come back until everyone backs off,\u201d George said a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cThen, I don\u2019t understand what the problem is,\u201d Chad said with confusion. She wasn\u2019t really missing after-all. Why were they acting as if it was an emergency?</p> <p>\u201cBree\u2019s been very sheltered her entire life. She\u2019s never known about the danger involved, coming from a family like ours. She\u2019s determined to make it on her own, but she\u2019s a target, being my only daughter. I\u2019ve received threatening letters before regarding all my children, but lately there\u2019s been several targeted at Bree. I have surveillance on her at the moment, but I need someone I can trust. Mark regards you as the best man he knows,\u201d George trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to babysit?\u201d Chad asked with horror. They were asking a bit much of him if they wanted him to keep an eye on a spoiled heiress.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s asking a lot,\u201d Joseph piped in and Chad turned to look at the man who had kept him out of the legal system. If it weren\u2019t for Joseph stepping in and taking responsibility for him when he\u2019d been an angry teenager, he never would\u2019ve shaped up. He wouldn\u2019t have joined the military and he certainly wouldn\u2019t have the same life he did. How could he refuse him anything?</p><p>\u201cWe hate to ask you to do this but if any of the family goes down there we know she\u2019s going to try to slip away again. She wants to have independence, which I can understand, but she needs to be watched over. This last letter that came in, scares the crap out of us,\u201d Mark jumped in.</p><p>Chad reached for the note Mark was holding. The words sent a shudder down his spine. Some person was infatuated with her and Chad knew how that could turn out. If she refused the man and he had no hope of winning her over, he very well could take her life.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she won\u2019t run if I\u2019m in the picture?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe thought about that, too. She won\u2019t like having you there but she doesn\u2019t deem you a threat against her independence. Since I moved the family back east for so many years, she hasn\u2019t been around you. I know she won\u2019t like the idea of you babysitting her, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll take off again just because you\u2019re there,\u201d George offered.</p><p>\u201cCrap, you\u2019re asking a lot. If anything were to happen to her on my watch, I\u2019d never forgive myself,\u201d Chad said as he ran a hand through his hair and started pacing the room. He felt like he was damned if he did and damned if he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let anything happen,\u201d Mark said with full confidence. Chad looked at his long time best friend and a look passed between them. Mark was right \u2013 Chad would take a bullet before he ever let anything happen to a person he was protecting. His hand rubbed his ribs once more, unconsciously. Never again would he lose a person under his watch \u2013 he couldn\u2019t survive it, not after his sister.</p><p>\u201cGive me the details,\u201d he commanded, putting himself in full control. He was in ops mode and he wouldn\u2019t let the Anderson family down. Joseph and George breathed sighs of relief, while Bree\u2019s brothers stiffened their shoulders. They weren\u2019t happy with the arrangements.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid, Dad. I say we drag her back here and lock her in the flipping basement. If she wants to act like a spoiled brat, then treat her like one,\u201d Max growled as he started pacing.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is an adult and can go where she wants. Do you want to drive her further away? This is the best thing we can do for her. If you want to be the one to shatter her world and make her afraid to even leave her apartment, then be my guest,\u201d George said while he stood to his full six and a half foot height. He may be getting older but he was still an intimidating man. Max backed down, not from fear, but respect.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad, I\u2019m just frustrated. We\u2019ve had some rocky years since losing mom, and I thought it was finally getting put behind us. I\u2019m worried about her,\u201d Max apologized.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all worried,\u201d George said while placing a hand on Max\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Redington, if you lay a hand on my sister in any way, I\u2019m going to knock your teeth out,\u201d Trenton said with a smile of anticipation. Chad outright laughed at him. No wonder she\u2019d ran \u2013 they really did act as if she was a teenager, instead of a twenty-eight year old woman.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, Anderson, if she doesn\u2019t do it first, we\u2019ll have a go,\u201d Chad said. Trenton sized him up for a moment, before his shoulders relaxed and he realized what an ass he\u2019d made of himself. Finally he laughed and the rest of the tension fled the room.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll get along just fine,\u201d Trenton said as he stuck out his hand. Chad felt like he\u2019d passed some kind of test he didn\u2019t know he was taking until it was over. He shook the man\u2019s hand, then they all sat down and gave Chad the details on where Bree was and what to expect once he got there.</p><p>He knew she was going to be a handful but he was suddenly anticipating his babysitting duty. She wasn\u2019t hard on the eyes and he was curious about the fire he knew was just below her uptight surface. He may actually find the next few months enjoyable.</p><p>As if Trenton could read Chad\u2019s thoughts, his eyes narrowed for a moment. The two men stared at each other before Lucas said something and broke the moment.</p><p>Chad had always liked a challenge and it seemed two were being placed before him. First he had to somehow tame the princess, and secondly, her brothers didn\u2019t want him near her. He fought back the smile wanting to stretch across his face. He didn\u2019t need to make the situation any more tense right then.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Bree felt like someone was watching her. She looked around and didn\u2019t see anyone, but she could feel the little hairs on her neck rising. Something wasn\u2019t right \u2013 it felt like someone was out there \u2013 staring a hole into her. It was dark and she was uncomfortable walking to her car alone. Normally, she never thought twice about it. She was in a small town, virtually no crime to speak of, and she knew she had nothing to worry about.</p><p>But still...</p><p>She picked up her steps, moving faster toward the parking lot. Reaching into her purse, she frantically searched for her keys. She\u2019d feel better once she was locked inside her car. The only reason she was paranoid was the frustrating phone conversation she\u2019d had with her father earlier in the evening.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to demand she return home immediately, saying her safety was in jeopardy. She knew it was purely her family overreacting, once again. She was sick of the babying. She was a grown woman and would prove to them she could make it on her own. They\u2019d get a hoot out of the fact she was shaking as she approached her vehicle.</p><p>Bree turned her head again and looked around, then laughed inwardly at her own paranoia. No one was there \u2013 the boogeyman wasn\u2019t after her. She looked down and searched through her over-sized purse \u2013 muttering under her breath that first thing in the morning she\u2019d finally purchase a clip so she could attach her keys to the handle. She always took an hour to find the dang things.</p><p>After several frustrating minutes, she realized her car keys weren\u2019t in her bag. She must\u2019ve left them on her desk, grabbing her office keys instead. She\u2019d done that too often to keep letting it happen. She sighed and turned to walk back inside. Her employment was mindless work, but it gave her a paycheck and she didn\u2019t have to spend from her trust fund. She was determined to live on her own dollar \u2013 not her family money. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Though she knew she was being ridiculous, her hand closed around her purse. She knew it wasn\u2019t a weapon, but it held enough items that if she hit someone over the head with it, she\u2019d probably stun them long enough to get away. She was irritated at how paranoid she was acting. Her father\u2019s call must\u2019ve spooked her more than she realized.</p><p>She slowly made her way back to the office, trying to act as normal as possible. She wished at least a few other people were out so she wasn\u2019t totally alone. Though her heart raced, she held her head high and stepped around the back of the building, to the employee entrance. She looked around at the two-story structure, seeming to spot shadows shifting in every corner. She pulled out her phone and pushed a button on the side so the screen lit up. It made her feel better to have a trace of light. She needed to talk to the manager about fixing the exterior lighting. It wasn\u2019t safe for employees to be going in and out of the alley at night in pitch black.</p><p>Just as she was about to turn the corner a cat screeched, then rushed past her legs, its hair brushing against her bare calves. She must have jumped five feet in the air. The sound could\u2019ve been bottled and used in a horror flick.</p><p>She realized the humor in the situation and immediately started laughing out loud uncontrollably. She had to stop being so paranoid. She finally pulled herself together and turned around the back of the building - and slammed into something solid.</p> <p>Trying to get her breath back and move at the same time, she realized it wasn\u2019t a wall she\u2019d collided against. Arms were tightening around her in a death grip and her vision blurred as all the air left her body. She was momentarily paralyzed with fear. She knew she needed to scream, kick, bite, do anything other than stand there. People were still inside the office building. If she could get their attention she\u2019d stand half a chance.</p><p>Bree finally managed to drag in a lungful of air and opened her mouth wide to let out a scream. As if he knew what she was doing, his hand clamped quickly over her mouth, further escalating her panic. She couldn\u2019t die in an alleyway behind a crappy office. She pushed against his hand and bit down, pleased when she managed to get her teeth around some of the flesh of his palm.</p><p>\u201cCrap! Stop that. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you,\u201d the man growled. His voice wasn\u2019t reassuring. She also wasn\u2019t a stupid teenage girl who believed her assailant only wanted to talk.</p><p>She continued twisting her body, but it was like struggling against the bars of a roller coaster car. He wasn\u2019t budging an inch. The more she struggled, the stronger his hold became. Managing to lift up her foot, she slammed her three-inch heel down on top of his. He let out a yelp and released his grasp.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take time to turn, but started running for the street. She only made it a few steps when his hands grasped her arm and she was pulled up tight against him again. This time he lifted her clean off the ground. She continued to struggle, knowing she only needed one good shot at his body. If she could get away a second time, she was ditching the shoes and running for all her life was worth.</p> <p>\u201cIf you calm down I\u2019ll let you go,\u201d he commanded. Yeah, right. She wasn\u2019t buying that either.</p><p>She managed to swing her elbow backward and connected with his rock-hard abs. She immediately whimpered as pain shot through her arm. She may as well have slammed her elbow into a brick wall.</p><p>\u201cDamn, your dad could\u2019ve told me you were hell on wheels,\u201d he muttered as he took a few steps toward the wall, then flipped her body around so she was facing him. His words took some of the wind from her sails. What did he have to do with her father? She\u2019d heard about kidnappers saying a family member was sick to get you to go with them \u2013 that had to be what it was.</p><p>As he stepped into the street, the light shined down on them and she got her first look at her attacker. Bree\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. She knew the man was built like a truck, since she\u2019d been pressed against him for several minutes now, but his face was stunning.</p><p>She forgot to fight him as his glacial blue eyes looked down into her own. Even in the darkness of the night she could see they were unusual in color, almost purple verses blue. Maybe he was wearing colored contacts as a disguise or the dim light was messing with her head. But, he couldn\u2019t hide his chiseled features. He looked like he was cut from granite, with his strong jaw, high cheekbones and perfect nose, which was flaring at the moment. He had a small scar running from the corner of his eye to his ear that only added to his appeal. His hair was cut military short, making her wonder if he was some kind of mercenary.</p><p>Bree realized she was ogling him, and how ridiculous that was. She pulled herself together and put on her haughtiest expression. Growing up with three older brothers had taught her how to at least project confidence, even if she didn\u2019t really feel it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019ve heard all the tricks attackers use. There is no way you\u2019re getting me into your car. I don\u2019t care if you say you know the freaking Pope. If you let me go right now, I won\u2019t press charges,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>She saw red when his lips twitched as if she was amusing him. He thought she was funny. She was ready to scratch his eyes out - and anyone would stand witness that she wasn\u2019t normally prone to violence, but he had her held against her will and then had the nerve to mock her.</p><p>\u201cI somehow don\u2019t believe you on that count but since I\u2019m not attacking you, I have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t some crazy stalker, then who are you?\u201d She demanded to know, proud her voice wasn\u2019t shaking. She knew she\u2019d break down if she made it out alive, but she was standing strong, at least for the moment. She didn\u2019t know if her knees would give out once he released his grip but she hoped the adrenaline kept her upright until she was safe.</p><p>\u201cIf I release you, will you try to run again or are you going to listen?\u201d He asked with another smirk. She was so ticked off she found herself curious of what he wanted. Who was so arrogant as to try and abduct someone and then have the nerve to want to chat?</p><p>Obviously this man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear you out, but as you can see, my phone is in my hand and I activated the emergency button on it. The sheriff is on his way here, now,\u201d she bluffed. He looked at her hand, then up to her eyes. She had a feeling he knew she was lying but he didn\u2019t call her on it, giving her the illusion of regaining some control in the odd situation.</p><p>Chad smiled at Bree. He found he was enjoying himself immensely with Mark\u2019s cousin. He knew she was going to be spitting mad when she found out he was sent to babysit her \u2013 even madder than she already was, thinking he was a crazy sex stalker.</p> <p>\u201cChad Redington,\u201d he finally said and she looked at him with a blank look. He said his name as if she should instantly know who he was. Maybe he had escaped from a mental hospital. She took a step back and he immediately narrowed his eyes. She pulled in a ragged breath. She was trying to be careful, not wanting to cause him to strike.</p><p>Then her eyes widened as she concentrated on his name. She had heard it before. She searched her memory trying to remember why the name sounded familiar. She looked him over again in his dark jeans, skintight T-shirt and worn cowboy boots. All he needed was a hat, spurs and a horse and he\u2019d be riding off the pages of a Louis Lamoure book. Her mind must be playing tricks on her because, though the name sounded familiar, she didn\u2019t know him. She decided it was time to leave.</p><p>Bree quickly turned as she got ready to bolt, but once again his arms snaked around her and suddenly she was pinned against the wall, his body pressed tightly against hers. She felt every inch of his solid thighs, washboard abs and arms of steel touching her. She forgot how to breathe.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m not here to steal your virtue. Your father sent me,\u201d he said, his breath sweeping over her face, his lips only inches from her own.</p><p>Bree had been afraid and upset before his words, but her head about exploded when he said he was sent by her father. If he was lying, he needed to get more creative. If he was speaking the truth, her family members were dead \u2013 every single one of them. She in no way needed, nor wanted, a babysitter.</p><p>Chad\u2019s eyes lowered their gaze to her mouth. She felt him push a little closer and she knew he\u2019d finally realized they were pressed together against a brick wall in a secluded alley. She was suddenly aware her breasts were tightly pressed against his chest, making her heart rate accelerate. She became even angrier to actually feel anything other than fear and loathing toward the man holding her captive.</p><p>He loosened his grip and moved his body back, just out of reach, but his hands stayed planted on the wall on either side of her head \u2013 caging her in. His close proximity wasn\u2019t helping her brain to function properly.</p><p>\u201cWhy would my dad send you to stalk me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. I\u2019m here to protect you. He told me you\u2019re aware of the threats against you,\u201d Chad said. He was done playing. She was affecting him in ways he hadn\u2019t expected, and certainly didn\u2019t want. He was there for a job and nothing further.</p><p>\u201cI will tell you the same thing I told my father. We\u2019ve all received threats our entire lives. It goes with the territory of being from a family like mine. I won\u2019t validate this pathetic man or woman\u2019s addiction by living my life in fear. I don\u2019t need, nor want a bodyguard. You can go back to my father and tell him, No thank you,\u201d she spat, then looked pointedly at his restraining arms. He was about to get bit again and this time she\u2019d sink her teeth in even deeper.</p><p>\u201cYour dad told me you\u2019d say that. He also told me to tell you, he was the one in charge, and come hell or high water I wasn\u2019t to leave your side, so take it or leave it, but I\u2019m here to stay,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>How could he infuriate her and turn her body on at the same time? She wanted to take a bite out of him, but she wasn\u2019t so sure it was to cause pain, anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just give the local sheriff a call and tell him someone\u2019s stalking me,\u201d she said with confidence, while smirking at him. She knew her rights. He couldn\u2019t stalk her without consequences.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and give Captain Musket a call. We go way back, as a matter of fact, we served on the same team for several years,\u201d he answered. Bree\u2019s eyes flashed with fury at his words. Men! And they all stuck together.</p><p>\u201cCan you please let loose of the arm cage so I can get my keys and go home? I\u2019m tired, cranky and very much done with this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you,\u201d he said while taking a step back. She swept past him and went inside to grab her keys. She sat down and called her father. Just because he said her dad had sent him, didn\u2019t necessarily mean he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d her father\u2019s voice came over the line. He was answering his own phone, which meant he knew the call was coming in.</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously hire a babysitter for me?\u201d Bree didn\u2019t take time to say hello. She knew she didn\u2019t need to say who was calling. If her father had indeed hired Chad, he\u2019d know exactly what she was talking about. If he hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have the entire National Guard at her office in less than five minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo good to hear from you twice in one day,\u201d George answered. By him ignoring her question, she had her answer. She was silent as she fought the urge to scream into the mouthpiece of the phone. She knew she couldn\u2019t get any more words past her throat so for the first time in her life she hung up on her dad.</p><p>He deserved to know how incredibly ticked off she was.</p><p>Chad was indeed sent by her father. She knew she could plead, threaten and shout but it wouldn\u2019t do her any good. Her father wouldn\u2019t pull him from his task. In her father\u2019s opinion, if she insisted on being on her own, then she would have to deal with a shadow. After taking several minutes to wash her flushed cheeks, she decided she was ditching her unwanted escort.</p><p>She crept to the front of the building and snuck out the main doors. Hopefully she could shake him and drive off before he realized she was gone. She was sure he knew where she lived, but if she could beat him home, get inside and lock the door, she\u2019d come up with a better plan the next day.</p> <p>There was no way she could handle the very appealing Chad Redington hanging around her, day in and day out, without eventually ripping his shirt off with her teeth, button by button.</p><p>Bree reached her car with no sign of Chad, and quickly jumped in and tore out of the parking lot. She was feeling pretty smug and incredibly proud of herself until she noticed the headlights of a car trailing close behind her. There was no way he could\u2019ve caught up so quickly. Hopefully it was just another motorist but she had a feeling it was him. When the car followed her down the driveway to her incredibly small rental, she knew she was busted. He most likely would start lecturing the second they emerged from their cars.</p><p>She pulled in front of her house and flew from the driver\u2019s seat. Her hands were shaking as she jumped up the steps and tried to get the key in the lock. She was planning on slamming the door before he had a chance to follow her.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think you could ditch me that easily? I\u2019m trained in hunting people down,\u201d Chad said, startling her. She turned from her stubborn doorknob and there he was, leaning against her porch rail as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. She hadn\u2019t even heard his car door slam, nor the normally squeaky steps as he came up behind her. She needed to become a lot more aware if there really was a stalker out there.</p><p>\u201cI told you back at the office, no one wants to harm me. No one is out to get me. My father and brothers have always been too over-protective. They\u2019re all just mad because I snuck off right underneath their arrogant noses. I have to prove at some point that I\u2019m perfectly able to take care of myself. Go away, you're trespassing,\u201d Bree snapped as she finally got her key in the stubborn lock.</p> <p>\u201cSo, those threatening letters meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, it comes with the territory. If I went into hiding every time I received a pathetic letter, then I\u2019d never get to leave the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father said it\u2019s been escalating. If he\u2019s concerned enough to hire me, then you have something to worry about.\u201d Bree gave up. There was no use arguing.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to frighten you but your father had surveillance done near the place you work and there\u2019s been suspicious activity going on. I don\u2019t have all the details but it seems there\u2019s been a car parked near your office, with someone taking pictures,\u201d he said, hoping to finally get through to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it has nothing to do with me,\u201d she said, though a chill went down her spine.</p><p>\u201cYou are ridiculously stubborn. Do you care so little about your own life?\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired and need a cup of coffee. You can leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he replied, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, enjoy your time on my porch then, because you\u2019re not invited inside,\u201d she snapped as she pushed open the door.</p><p>Bree looked up and her heart stopped beating for a moment. Her entire body tensed and she felt dizzy.</p><p>Someone had been in her house \u2013 and her belongings were strung all over the place. The message on the wall was what had her close to fainting, though.</p><p>You\u2019re mine.</p><p>It was written in what looked like blood.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Chad saw her tense and he immediately straightened from his relaxed position. He grabbed his gun, lifted her out of his way, and stepped inside her front door. Bree could do nothing but stare as he walked inside. What if the person was still there? She started to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he commanded. She glared at him, but knew he would hold firm so she crossed her arms and waited as he searched her home \u2013 his entire body in stealth mode. She held her breath, sick she couldn\u2019t do more than stand there frozen. When her lungs felt like they were about to burst, she finally let the air out and sucked in fresh oxygen.</p><p>As Chad stepped through each room, he was on full alert. He was in his element \u2013 the hunter, searching for prey. He hated leaving her alone on the front porch, but didn\u2019t see an alternative until he cleared the house. He quietly made his way through the small dwelling, checking every square inch. Finally, he relaxed when he was satisfied the house was clear.</p><p>As Chad looked around her homey place, he started to think she may not be who he originally thought she was. He knew she had a trust fund in the seven figure range, but her home was quaint. Instead of flashy pieces of art or over-priced furniture, he saw second hand pieces, lovingly restored, and homemade Afghans hanging from the back of the couch. Her father told him she was refusing to touch her trust, but Chad hadn\u2019t believed she\u2019d be able to hold out. No way could she go from being a spoiled princess to an everyday working girl. He didn\u2019t see it happening... but the evidence was right in front of him.</p><p>He made his way back to the porch, uncomfortable with how long she\u2019d been out there alone. The crime scene was fresh, which meant the people who\u2019d done it could be hiding nearby, waiting for a chance to get their hands on her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not in the house,\u201d Chad said as he joined her on the small front porch. \u201cNow, do you understand the need for a bodyguard? They aren\u2019t playing around, Bree. What if you\u2019d come home when they were still here? This night could\u2019ve ended far worse than you can imagine,\u201d he said. She said nothing as she stepped across the threshold. Her once cozy cottage style home was destroyed.</p><p>The stress of the situation finally set in and Bree\u2019s body began trembling as she looked at the words splashed across her entrance hall. Why would anyone be out to terrorize her? She couldn\u2019t comprehend it \u2013 she hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve it. There wasn\u2019t a trail of broken hearts in her wake. She couldn\u2019t think of a single person who\u2019d want to terrorize or harm her.</p><p>Bree felt violated as she looked at her belongings scattered across the floor. They\u2019d destroyed pictures, antique furniture, and treated her possessions as nothing more than garbage. A tear slid down her cheek as she picked up an Afghan her mother had made. It was ripped apart beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone do this?\u201d She choked, finding it difficult to get the words past her closed throat. Irreplaceable items were gone forever. She rubbed her face against the quilt her mom had spent endless hours creating \u2013 it too destroyed. As if ripping it to shreds hadn\u2019t been enough for them, they\u2019d even spilled a foul smelling liquid on it. She let it drop from her fingers and flutter to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no explanation for it. Some people get off on terrorizing others. Whoever did this isn\u2019t finished. They want you scared, but they\u2019re also warning you. If you look at statistics, you\u2019ll see a pattern. A lot of crime could\u2019ve been prevented if the victims had only paid attention to the warning signs. I think you should go home, but if you insist on staying, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Chad said, taking pity on her and wrapping his arm around her shoulders. She knew she should pull away but she needed comforting and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to struggle against him.</p><p>\u201cIf I run home, they win. I won\u2019t give them that victory, along with the satisfaction they received causing this damage,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Chad sighed as he pulled her closer. She was stubborn, far more than her brothers, which he didn\u2019t think was possible. He would feel a whole lot better if she\u2019d realize the danger she was in and go home \u2013 but he knew it wasn\u2019t happening, at least not yet. She wasn\u2019t scared enough.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to insist on hanging around then make yourself useful and help me clean this.\u201d Bree stepped away from him and grabbed a garbage sack. Chad didn\u2019t say anything further, just quietly stood by her side and helped her clean. Within a couple hours the house was back to normal \u2013 all damaged items either tucked out of sight or thrown away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a hard day, I\u2019m going to bed,\u201d Bree stated and walked from the room. She knew she wouldn\u2019t get him to leave and she didn\u2019t have the energy to fight any more so she left the evening\u2019s frustrations behind her as she walked to her bedroom.</p><p>Chad watched Bree make her way down the hallway. She was standing strong but he could see the weight of the world on her shoulders. She was strong, but eventually even the strongest person needed to let someone else carry the burden for a while.</p><p>A few minutes after her door shut, he heard her shower running and his body tightened with need. What was wrong with him? She was his assignment \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. He shouldn\u2019t feel sympathy, anger, and certainly not desire. It was time to get out of the house for a little while. He\u2019d do a perimeter check around the property.</p><p>Even with her out of sight, his thoughts refused to turn from her. Bree was stunning, but obviously didn\u2019t try highlighting her assets, instead hiding beneath layers of clothes. He knew what was beneath her clothes, though, since she\u2019d been pressed tightly against him. He groaned as his pants grew tighter. He\u2019d never had such trouble distancing himself, but then again, he\u2019d never had such a beautiful assignment.</p><p>Hopefully, she\u2019d come to her senses and just go home. Then, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the consequences of sleeping with his best friend\u2019s cousin. Damn, all of her brothers would stand in line to kick his ass if they knew he was so much as thinking about touching Bree.</p><p>He grinned, thinking a good fight would do his libido some good. He needed something to get his mind off of her naked, wet and lathered up body standing beneath a stream of hot water.</p><p>Pull it together, you\u2019re not a horny sixteen year old, Chad berated himself. Then he jogged into the surrounding woods next to her house. She would have to live in the middle of nowhere. Why not make it easier for the crazy person after her!</p><p>He completed the search of her property and knew it was time to return to her house. There was no one around and luckily there was only one driveway leading to the house so if a car approached, he\u2019d hear it. On the bad side was the fact that someone could get incredibly close on foot before he was alerted. The tree\u2019s came within twenty yards of her back door. He\u2019d have to set up better surveillance.</p><p>He promised her family nothing would happen to her and he was going to make sure nothing did happen on his watch. He stepped inside the doors and his stomach knotted. What was she trying to do to him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bree turned and gave a tentative smile as Chad walked in. She frowned when she saw the scowl covering his features. She didn\u2019t understand what his problem was. She looked behind him and nothing seemed amiss so she shrugged and went back to cooking. She wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d asked for his invasion into her life and she didn\u2019t see why he was in a bad mood. If anyone had a right to be grouchy, it was her.</p><p>Chad gritted his teeth when he saw Bree cooking, wearing a pair of shorts showing off entirely too much of her long, beautiful legs, and a fitted tank top. Was she trying to see how far she could push him before he snapped? Did she want him to wrap his arms around her and take her against the kitchen wall? He was close to doing just that.</p><p>He sat down and adjusted his pants for what felt like the hundredth time and tried to look anywhere but at her. He knew he should walk away \u2013 leave the room. Find any other place to be, other than a few feet from her but his eyes kept drifting back to the shapely curve of her thighs. He could easily see she was a runner. Her legs were toned and tan and seemed to stretch for a mile.</p><p>She was only about five and a half feet tall, making her head fit perfectly underneath his chin. She was the right height for their bodies to fit like a glove while he lay on top of her, thrusting inside. Crap! He admonished himself silently. He absolutely couldn\u2019t go down that road. Being in her presence was the same as throwing a lit match into a dry hay field. He was burning up.</p> <p>Before he realized what he was doing, he was standing behind her. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop the forward movement. All his inner lecturing and self-pep-talks weren\u2019t penetrating his own thick skull.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d he asked, taken aback at his own husky tone. He wasn\u2019t holding himself together well. He could imagine what his team would think of his behavior. They\u2019d probably be on the floor laughing \u2013 no probably about it, they\u2019d definitely be cracking up at his expense.</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it...\u201d Bree started to say as she turned around. When she realized how close he was, her eyes widened. He watched as she looked from his neck, then tilted her head up, up, up to stare into his eyes. Once she reached their deep azure depths, hers widened even more.</p><p>Their gazes remained locked together, and he was losing the battle to maintain distance. Just one kiss \u2013 he could allow himself a moment of pleasure. They were both consenting adults \u2013 and no one would be hurt by a simple kiss. He was sure it wouldn\u2019t be as great as he expected. One kiss, then he could get back to his job of guarding her - minus the sexual tension.</p><p>Chad slipped his arm around her back. If she gave even a hint of protest, or resisted in any way, then maybe he\u2019d get a little sense back into his head. But instead she melted like butter against him. She never removed her eyes from his and her body seemed like it was made to fit only him. She sank against him, her eyes seemingly surprised by their behavior. One taste, he promised himself. He\u2019d only have one taste of her, then he\u2019d let go and get their relationship on a strictly professional basis. If he couldn\u2019t, he\u2019d tell George he had to find someone else to guard his daughter. He couldn\u2019t protect her if he couldn\u2019t keep it professional.</p> <p>His heart pounded as he leaned forward. His body tightened even more, and the sigh escaping her lips sent his heart racing. She was turning him inside out.</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss,\u201d he muttered out loud without conscious thought. Her eyes slid shut as his mouth edged closer. She was openly inviting him \u2013 he was doing nothing wrong.</p><p>Before his lips made contact with hers, there was a loud pounding on the door. Chad wanted to rip apart whoever dared to interrupt them. He swore aloud before he was able to stop himself. Bree\u2019s eyes slightly opened as she looked at him with confusion. It was obvious she hadn\u2019t heard the knock. She was wondering why he hadn\u2019t closed that final gap between them.</p><p>The pounding on the front door grew louder and Chad pulled back, forcing himself to concentrate. He didn\u2019t think her stalker was going to make his job as easy as knocking, but then again, there were criminals that stupid.</p><p>He pulled his gun from his belt and silently approached the front door. He didn\u2019t see the fear creep into Bree\u2019s eyes at the sight of the deadly weapon. He\u2019d carried it for so long, his hand felt empty without it \u2013 like something was missing. When he peaked through the curtain, he let out a frustrated breath, causing Bree to nearly panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he assured her before stepping to the door and flipping the lock. Did her siblings have built in radar? My sister\u2019s about to get violated by her bodyguard, we\u2019d better hurry over there. He was grateful for his many years of service; otherwise he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to pull himself together so quickly.</p> <p>As four huge men stepped through her doorway, Bree went from frightened to angry in two-seconds flat. She loved her brothers and cousins, but she had left to get away from the interference, not have them keep following her around. She hoped Chad wouldn\u2019t say anything to them about the break-in or they\u2019d really freak out on her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Larry, Mo and Curly?\u201d Bree asked with an innocent smile.</p><p>\u201cLucas, Mark and Austin couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Trenton stepped up and answered, knowing exactly who she was referring to. \u201cCharlie stepped up to take their place, though,\u201d he finished, pointing to his long-time best friend.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, kiddo?\u201d Charlie asked as he stepped forward and enveloped her in a bear sized hug. All the air was immediately squeezed from her body as he embraced her overly tight. He\u2019d been doing it since they were kids and it always made her feel awkward.</p><p>Charlie had always been the pimply faced band geek, but he\u2019d shot up about eight inches in high school and joined the football team, where he and Trenton had become inseparable. He\u2019d practically lived at their place. Now, he worked for the corporation so he\u2019d transferred with them during the move a few years back. She was glad he was there but could do without all the manhandling.</p><p>Charlie noticed Chad putting his gun away and narrowed his eyes at the weapon, but kept silent. No one else seemed to think it was out of place for Chad to be sporting a deadly weapon in Bree\u2019s tiny living room.</p><p>\u201cDid Dad send you?\u201d Bree asked when Charlie finally released her and she could breathe again. She noticed immediately when Chad stepped too close to her in a bodyguard manor. Who the heck was he protecting her from? Her brothers? She\u2019d like to pound the over-sized, macho men, but she didn\u2019t need protection from them. She looked at him quizzically but he didn\u2019t take his eyes from the group of men.</p><p>She stared back and forth from her brothers, cousin, and Charlie, to Chad, and found it almost funny how they were all standing so rigid, almost in preparation for a brawl. Last she knew, her family had been who\u2019d hired Chad so why did they seem like they wanted to rip him to pieces?</p> <p>Chad\u2019s libido was still revving to go, and from the look on her family member\u2019s faces, they knew it \u2013 and weren\u2019t happy about it. They glanced from him, around her room, then back, seeming to realize they\u2019d jumped their sister from the frying pan into the fire. She needed protection, but it was obvious they were thinking she may need a chastity belt as well \u2013 at least in his presence. They were probably right.</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with visiting?\u201d Max asked as he finally broke the odd standoff and stepped forward. He gave Bree a much gentler hug before stepping back. That seemed to trigger the others to step forward and hug her. When they were finished, she sighed and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI guess not, as long as that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing here. I\u2019ll make fresh coffee,\u201d she offered. The sooner they got to the real reason for the visit, the sooner they\u2019d leave her in peace. She\u2019d prove to them she didn\u2019t need to run home. After her house getting vandalized, she needed to prove it to herself as well. She was still extremely shaken from her stressful day.</p><p>\u201cNice to know we\u2019re so welcome,\u201d Alex said with sarcasm, but the smile he threw her showed he didn\u2019t have any hard feelings.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of room but we should all fit around the table,\u201d Chad said, taking over and leading them to her hardly adequate dining area. The men looked at the chairs skeptically, but gingerly sat, letting out relieved sighs when the chairs didn\u2019t break. Chad remained standing against the counter and Bree turned so he wouldn\u2019t see her smile. He was still in alpha-dog mode, protecting her, maybe without even fully realizing what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cGetting mighty cozy in this place, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Charlie asked, his entire attitude was yelling loud and clear that he didn\u2019t like Chad and didn\u2019t want him in Bree\u2019s home. It seemed Charlie was a little jealous. He decided to poke him a bit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making do,\u201d he said with a lazy smile. His comment earned him glares from all four men. Chad knew he could take them out \u2013 or he was cocky enough to think so, but he wouldn\u2019t want to do that to Bree \u2013 they were her family.</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough of this posturing. I don\u2019t know what the heck is going on in this room, but the testosterone is flowing in sickening waves. I thought you were the ones who hired Chad in the first place,\u201d Bree said, her tone full of irritation. No one spoke for several moments, then Trenton let out a chuckle and soon Max and Alex joined him. Charlie continued to glare.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sis. Dad wanted Chad to babysit... I mean act as a bodyguard,\u201d he quickly corrected. \u201cNone of us were thrilled to have someone so... well... um...\u201d Trenton trailed off, seeming at a loss for words for the first time in his life. Chastity finally put the puzzle pieces together and her grin spread in victory. Oh, the fun she was going to have for all the crap her family put her through.</p><p>She walked away from the coffee pot and stood right in front of Chad, who looked at her suspiciously. He knew she was up to something, but he had no idea what. She could see the concern in his eyes. Good, he was messing with her hormones; it was time to mess with his.</p><p>Before he could stop her, Bree leaned into him, pressing her body tightly against his and landed her lips on his frowning mouth. Her arms reached up and pulled his head down to hers. He was so stunned, he allowed her control over him for about two-seconds. Then, his body took over.</p><p>The electricity between them caused him to forget all about their surroundings and her family being in the room. He forgot everything and focused solely on the way he felt with Bree in his arms. She felt better than a cool lake on a hot summer\u2019s day. His arms snaked around her and he immediately deepened the kiss. Just when he was ready to pick her up and cart her to the bedroom, she pulled away on shaky legs.</p><p>Bree took a breath, her heart pounding as she tried to control her reaction from the kiss. She hadn\u2019t known it would cause her head to spin. She was trying to make a point and instead she felt like she was on a boat in the middle of the perfect storm. She turned to see all four men shooting daggers at both her and Chad. Good \u2013 she\u2019d gotten the reaction she wanted. It helped calm her thundering heart.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, Trenton? Young? Masculine?\u201d Bree mocked. She gave them a Cheshire cat smile as she turned back to the counter and pulled down six coffee mugs. She set them on the table as if nothing was wrong, then began pouring hot liquid into each cup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trenton was in shock at Bree\u2019s behavior but he finally pulled himself together and sent first her and then Chad a smile. It was obvious Chad didn\u2019t appreciate being used. He could instantly see Bree was playing them all and he wasn\u2019t giving her the victory of knowing she\u2019d done a great job of causing him more stress. He grabbed his cup and took a large gulp, not even wincing when the hot liquid burned his tongue and throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how you react, Bree. You need someone to protect you and Mark and Uncle Joseph both vouch for Chad so it looks like you\u2019re stuck with him. If you want to act that way, have at it,\u201d Trenton said, calling her on her bluff. Her shoulders slumped as her plan backfired. She forgot how good her brothers were at one-upmanship.</p><p>\u201cFine, as you can see, we\u2019re just comfy cozy here. There\u2019s no need for all of you to hang around, too,\u201d she said as she sat down.</p><p>\u201cSorry for hassling you, Chad, but we tend to worry about Bree,\u201d Max said, further shocking Bree. It seemed they were deciding it was smarter to team up with Chad than to fight against him. She figured they knew if he was their buddy, she would no longer want to side with him. He\u2019d become more of an enemy than a friend. They were right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d feel the same way if it were my family. Mark is like a brother to me, and Bree being his cousin is a good enough reason for me to want to protect her,\u201d Chad answered, all his animosity seeming to evaporate. Great, just great, Bree thought, next they were going to sing \u2018Save the World\u2019 and start a bonfire.</p><p>\u201cHas anything happened since you got here?\u201d Alex asked. Bree tensed, not wanting Chad to talk about the break-in. He ignored her as he looked at the men.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into her house,\u201d he answered, which had all four men sitting up straight in their seats again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Bree! Why didn\u2019t you say anything sooner,\u201d Trenton shouted. She expected that kind of response from him.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t tell you because it just happened today. Secondly, I\u2019m a big girl and can take care of myself. Finally, you guys hired this over-the-top bodyguard for me, so no one has a chance of getting near me, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone came pretty damn close,\u201d Max interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Bree fought back.</p><p>\u201cThis is getting ridiculous. I should just throw you over my shoulder and drag you home, whether you like it or not,\u201d Trenton threatened.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Bree shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be acting so tough when some maniac knocks you over the head and drags you away,\u201d Charlie said, speaking up for the first time in a while.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. You all need to settle down. I\u2019ve agreed to let Chad stick around, so cool your jets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour stubbornness is going to get you in too much trouble one of these times,\u201d Max stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to have a normal life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for too much. Give me a chance to live a little, then I\u2019ll be the good little girl and come home. I will make sure to get nice and pregnant, run around the house barefoot and serve you all,\u201d Bree said with sarcasm, but real pain was in her voice too. She needed them to trust her \u2013 to let her live.</p><p>Max was the first to cave. He couldn\u2019t stand seeing his sister hurting. He got up from the table and pulled her from the chair so he could hug her.</p><p>\u201cYou know we just love you too much to ever let anything bad happen to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve agreed to let Chad stick around, we\u2019ll back off. But, we would all feel much better if you\u2019d just come home. I promise to even back off if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019d try, but it would be impossible for you. Just give me a little while to see what it\u2019s like to make it on my own. I promise if the situation takes a change for the worse, or if I really do feel threatened, I\u2019ll come home. I barely got here, though. I need more time.\u201d Bree didn\u2019t want to upset her family so she was willing to make some concessions, especially when they were being reasonable instead of threatening or trying to exert their will on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ll agree. We all love you, and you know there isn\u2019t anything we won\u2019t do for you,\u201d Trenton spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019ll take off for now, but remember, we\u2019re only a phone call away. You know, barefoot and serving me drinks is good enough. There\u2019s no need to get pregnant,\u201d he finished in an attempt to make her smile. It worked, as he knew it would. Her brother was one of the good guys, he just had to learn she was grown-up, not the little five year old sister in pigtails, anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the plan was to drag her back, even if she was kicking and screaming,\u201d Charlie protested. Chad shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s an adult. I think she made a valid point,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Dad know you\u2019re all right,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep him from camping on your doorstep,\u201d Trenton added.</p><p>\u201cJessica said you can stay at our place anytime. She also told me to tell you that she\u2019d keep all of us ridiculously over-zealous guys away from you. Her words, not mine,\u201d Alex stated with a sheepish smile.</p><p>\u201cTell Jessica I\u2019ll think about that. Now, get out of here. I love you all,\u201d she said, relaxing since she knew she\u2019d won a small victory. She also knew it wouldn\u2019t last. They\u2019d go home and immediately begin worrying over the break-in, then they\u2019d be back again, trying to get her home. She should get at least a week or two of peace, though.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Chad paced the small house from one side to the other but felt like punching out a window instead. He only made it about six steps before he reached one end and had to turn around again.</p><p>Bree\u2019s family had left a couple hours ago and she was still hiding in her room, where she\u2019d rushed as soon as the front door had closed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to pressure her but he knew she needed to talk. They hadn\u2019t had a chance to discuss the kiss that had almost gotten out of hand. They also needed to discuss the living situation. He didn\u2019t like the poor security of her house and felt he could do a much better job of protecting her in a more secure location. She was too easily ambushed where she lived but convincing her to leave wasn\u2019t going to be an easy task.</p><p>He approached her door and listened, feeling like a peeping-tom. Finally, he knocked but there wasn\u2019t an answer. He started to worry so he opened the door and peeked his head in, knowing she\u2019d be furious with him, but willing to take the risk. Seeing her sitting on the bed with her head in her hands, looking defeated wasn\u2019t what he wanted. The creaking of the door hinges quickly brought her head up and she composed her face, but it was too late, he\u2019d seen the grief, and he wanted to make it right.</p><p>\u201cI told you I need to be alone for a while,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He took a relaxing breath before stepping inside her tiny space. He tried to avoid the fact that they were alone in her small room. She looked so enticing sitting on top of her purple bedspread.</p><p>She tried to keep her glare centered on him but he could see the fear behind her bravado. She was frustrated and didn\u2019t want to run home, but her family had brought more worry to the forefront of her mind. He sat down to comfort her. She flinched when he reached his hand out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone else coddling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t but you\u2019ve been given a lot to handle the last couple of weeks and even the strongest of us can use a friend to vent to sometimes,\u201d he calmly replied.</p><p>\u201cI know my family wants to keep me safe and I know you have a job to do but I\u2019m sick of feeling smothered. They treat me like a child, instead of an adult. I came here to gain independence, but it seems I\u2019m not even allowed that,\u201d she pouted. Chad had to carefully compose his features to make sure a smile didn\u2019t come through. She\u2019d probably haul off and hit him if she saw even the hint of a grin.</p><p>She said she was an adult and didn\u2019t want to be treated as a juvenile, but at the moment she was throwing a bit of a tantrum. The situation was amusing and helped ease the anger inside him that had been building since he saw her tossed house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to share something with you that I don\u2019t talk about to anyone \u2013 ever,\u201d he quietly whispered. \u201cI had a sister \u2013 she was the cutest little girl in the universe. I was ten years older than her and I worshipped the ground she walked on.\u201d The tone of his voice instantly put Bree on alert. She didn\u2019t think his story would have a happy ending, especially when he used the word, had.</p><p>\u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t a great person, not even the tiniest bit, and my sister wasn\u2019t planned. My mom was so messed up she didn\u2019t even realize she was pregnant until she was five months along. She tried to abort her, but it was too late at that point and the doctors refused to do it. Mother was working at a little diner when all this came to pass and the manager was a real decent guy. Apparently, he\u2019d had a crush on my mom for a long time so he jumped at the opportunity to date her. She was down and out and searching for a sugar daddy, and he was the only guy offering, so she accepted. We moved in with him and his place was heaven compared to the trashy apartment we\u2019d been living in,\u201d Chad spoke in a monotone voice. Bree grabbed his hand without either of them realizing it.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was a user \u2013 she took all she could from Ray. He was real nice to me. She stopped doing drugs long enough to get through the rest of her pregnancy, but she only did that because she liked living at Ray\u2019s place. She didn\u2019t have to worry about the bills, or food. She had my sister and wanted to give her away, but she knew the gravy train would end if she did, so she brought her home.\u201d Chad paused and Bree was shocked to see moisture in the corner of his eye. He turned away and took a moment to compose himself before continuing.</p><p>\u201cMother had nothing to do with Jackie from the day they came home from the hospital. Ray and I named her. We were the ones who fed and changed her. She was amazing. I don\u2019t know how something so perfect could come out of someone so horrible, but she was an angel. She hardly ever cried and she had this smile that would light up the room. The first time she laughed, I couldn\u2019t help but join her. It seemed like only days, but all of a sudden three years had gone by. My mother was gone more and more and I could see how upset it made Ray. He offered to marry her but she always managed to delay it. We both knew she was out with other men \u2013 sometimes she\u2019d be gone for a few days, then walk in as if nothing was wrong. Jackie didn\u2019t even call her mom.\u201d</p><p>Bree was horrified as she listened to Chad speak of his past. She certainly got upset with her family but she knew how much they loved her, and she loved them without question. They had grown distant after their mother passed, but she\u2019d never doubted their love. They had all just needed time to heal from the tragic loss of losing their mom.</p><p>\u201cI was watching Jackie \u2013 which was nothing new. I loved spending time with her. I know that sounds weird, because at that point I was thirteen, and most kids that age would feel put out by having to watch a baby sibling, but I loved her so it was never a burden. Besides, I knew she needed me.\u201d His voice grew more hoarse the longer he spoke. Bree knew she couldn\u2019t interrupt him, though she wanted to stop what was coming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe were at the park watching a few kids playing touch football. I took my eyes off her for just a moment, not even half a minute. She was playing on the large fort and laughing, having a great time. I looked at the game, for the first time feeling a little envious that I couldn\u2019t play with them. I heard someone scream and jerked my head back to where I\u2019d last spotted her. She was grasping the rail at the top. I jumped up, but before I even reached my feet, she slipped and fell to the ground. It was like the entire event happened in slow motion. One minute she was laughing, the next she was falling. It wasn\u2019t even that far, but she was so tiny, and she landed wrong. Her neck broke \u2013 she died instantly.\u201d</p><p>The pain in his voice ripped Bree apart. He was fighting to keep it inside, but even decades later, the wound was only a scratch away, just underneath his skin that she had thought was so thick. She couldn\u2019t even comprehend going through what he had.</p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks as she listened to him talk about his sister\u2019s last moments. What an imaginable thing for him to witness. Why was he telling her about it? What could she do to make the pain end?</p><p>\u201cApparently there was a pole that came loose. She leaned on it, and fell through. She grabbed another bar, but before anyone could help, she slipped. If I\u2019d been next to her, she\u2019d still be alive today. My mom showed up at her funeral, even managed to force a few tears. She ate up the sympathy from strangers. There was a huge article in the paper and crowds of people flooded the service. I hated them, every single one of them. What right did they have to be there! I was supposed to watch her. The guilt tore me in two. My mom got a huge settlement from the city and took off in the middle of the night. She never looked back and I\u2019ve never tried to seek her out. After she left, Ray couldn\u2019t handle me. I was angry and holding onto so much guilt that I was striking out at him \u2013 on everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Bree scooted closer and wrapped her arm around Chad\u2019s trembling form. He was in another place at that moment, but he seemed to draw comfort from what she was doing so she stayed pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cRay finally dropped me off at a human services office and I went into foster care. I was tossed from home to home. Nobody wanted to deal with a messed up kid like me. Finally, I ended up in the juvenile courts. That\u2019s where I met Mark and Joseph. They saved my life. I was on a path to destroy myself, but they wouldn\u2019t let me. They were doing volunteer work and took me under their wing. Mark and I became best friends, and Joseph helped me realize Jackie\u2019s death wasn\u2019t my fault. I still, to this day, feel responsible, but I know I didn\u2019t cause her death. I just never ever want to lose someone again who I\u2019m supposed to watch. Your family feels the same way, Bree. They love you, and if something were to happen to you, it would destroy them,\u201d he finished.</p><p>His words made Bree feel about two inches tall. She was so blessed, with a family who loved her enough to go out of their way for her, and she was being stubborn. She still needed to prove her independence but she\u2019d accept having her own personal bodyguard without complaining about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she finally said, feeling the words were inadequate. She knew they couldn\u2019t take away the pain, but she felt helpless to do anything more. What did you say to someone when they opened up to you the way he had?</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. I just wanted you to understand how much your family loves you \u2013 and also understand why I can\u2019t let anything happen to you. They\u2019d never forgive themselves if those threats against you were real and they did nothing to stop the man. I can\u2019t sit back and not give this my all \u2013 I\u2019ve committed to guarding you, and isn\u2019t it better to be over-protective than not protective enough. It\u2019s all done for the right reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Both of them were silent for a few minutes and Chad finally realized that Bree was practically wrapped around him. The heat of her body was more effective in healing his wounded soul than any amount of therapy he\u2019d gone to, insisted upon by Joseph.</p><p>As he closed his eyes and felt the tender touch of her hand caressing his arm, and the press of her rounded breast pushing against his chest, he felt the sorrow always present, ease and instead his body came to life.</p><p>He suddenly needed her with a vengeance. He knew she could take away the pain. The touch of her small hands, the feel of her silky skin, the sway of her body. Without thinking it through, he leaned down and his mouth connected with hers.</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t gentle. It was filled with despair and need. He was trying to push away his demons and quench his thirst. Bree paused for only a moment before she was kissing him back with her own hungry need.</p><p>Chad\u2019s body instantly hardened. He pulled her onto his lap and his hands explored her back, moving along the slender slope of her spine. She moaned into his kiss, igniting fire inside him. He moved his hands below the hem of her shirt and broke the kiss only long enough to pull her shirt off. Then, before either of them could come to their senses, his mouth connected with hers again.</p><p>His tongue pushed against the barrier of her lips and slid inside the warm recesses of her mouth. He greedily took all he could from her, but she wasn\u2019t a victim. She clawed at his head, tugging him closer to her, groaning into his mouth. He unclasped her bra and tossed it aside, needing to feel her untethered breasts pressed against him.</p> <p>He pulled back to shed his own shirt, then pulled her body tightly against his. The feel of her bare breasts pushing against his chest intensified the ache in his groin. Her nipples were hard as they pressed against his skin \u2013 sending a shudder straight through him.</p><p>He laid her back on the bed and took a moment to gaze down at her beautiful body. She was stunning, her skin flushed with arousal, her breasts rising and falling with the deep breaths she took. Her blue eyes were shining with excitement. Moving his head down her neck, he tasted a slight hint of coconut on her skin.</p><p>\u201cChad,\u201d she cried out when he circled his tongue around the top of her full breasts. He cupped their perfect weight in his hands and ran his thumbs across her tight pink buds. Her back arched off the bed, begging him to take her in his mouth. He gently nipped the skin around the peaks, but didn\u2019t give her what she so desperately wanted.</p><p>She pushed her hips up, grinding her pelvis against his straining erection. He groaned as the movement caused sweat to break out across his overheated body. Finally, he took one of her peaks into his mouth and she cried out in pleasure as he gently sucked her deep within his mouth, then moved back and gently raked his teeth across the sensitive nipple.</p><p>She gripped his head in her hands, pulling him closer. He moved from one peak to the other, giving them equal attention, while his hands moved down her body and undid her pants. When he moved his mouth down the gentle slope of her stomach, nipping the skin, then gently soothing the pink bites with his tongue, she arched into him.</p><p>She tasted like heaven.</p><p>He reached her lower stomach and inhaled her sweet scent, loving the feel of her quivering body. She was soft and smooth and had the most succulent curves. Her hips fit perfectly in his large hands. It took all his power not to strip her and sink deep inside her heated folds. He couldn\u2019t ever remember wanting a woman so badly it made him ache.</p><p>He slowly pulled down her shorts, sliding them past her feet and onto the floor. With his masterful tongue trailing along the inside of her thighs, she continued to groan beneath him, her legs opening in invitation. He looked up at the red satin covering her from his view and his pulsing manhood jumped inside his pants, causing him to cry out. He stood and removed the denim and his boxers in one swift movement.</p> <p>He nearly lost it again at the sight of lust in her eyes as she took in his naked body. There was no hiding her reaction from him \u2013 desire was evident in her eyes and trembling form. He dropped back to the bed and ran his tongue up her thighs, pausing at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Chad,\u201d she pled, reaching her hands down, trying to pull him to her.</p><p>He ripped her panties off, then leaned forward and swiped his tongue along her silken folds. The first taste of her made his head spin. He nearly came before he ever got the chance to sink inside her.</p><p>Chad inserted two fingers into her soft lips and groaned when he felt how ready she was for him. He took her pulsing skin into his mouth and flicked his tongue around the swollen nub while moving his fingers in and out of her. Her body began shuddering, then she tensed and cried out as she gripped him tightly. He swiped his tongue across her a couple more times, wanting to draw out her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cPlease, too much,\u201d she cried, and he finally lifted his head. Damn, she was beautiful, with her half closed eyes, flushed skin and satisfied smile. He had to join them together.</p><p>He quickly crawled up her body and brought his mouth back to hers. She tried to turn her head, exhausted from their lovemaking, but he knew he could bring her more pleasure.</p><p>He gripped both her hands with his and held them above her head while he trailed his lips across her own, then down her throat to her breasts, where he lavished attention on her swollen nipples. Her hips began to gently grind against him and then intensify, signaling she was ready for him to take her.</p><p>He moved his body above hers, his swollen head pressed against her opening. Her eyes widened as he started pushing inside. She was so wet and tight, he had to pause half-way inside, or risk their love-making ending before she could be satisfied.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she demanded, which brought a small smile to his face. Then she moved her hips and all humor fled.</p><p>Chad thrust deep inside her in one quick motion and her body stiffened as the full length of him stretched her. Afraid he was hurting her, he tried to pull back, but as her body adjusted, she relaxed and clamped her legs around his back. She pushed her hips up, not wanting to release him and he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer.</p><p>Chad let go of her hands and moved his arms down so he could grip her hips. He held her soft flesh as he started moving in and out of her tight body. She groaned as the pressure began building again, and he felt her grip him even more. His entire body was covered with sweat, making them slide together beautifully.</p><p>He pushed his upper body up, pressing their hips tighter together so she could move her lips down the column of his throat, swirling her tongue around his pounding pulse, then further, until she took his nipple into her mouth and gently bit down.</p><p>He completely lost it and quickly thrust in and out of her. She eagerly met him, pushing up, their hips colliding. He felt her stiffen in his arms seconds before she let out a cry of pleasure, then she started pulsing around him. He thrust inside her \u2013 in and out, then collapsed as he spilled his seed deep inside her wet folds.</p><p>Neither of them spoke as they gained control of their breathing again. He was burning up inside and out, and trying to find the energy to move, when she slowly moved her hips beneath him. He was still buried deep inside and he felt himself stir at her movement. His eyes opened in amazement. He couldn\u2019t understand how he could possibly feel any passion after the earth shattering orgasm he\u2019d just had.</p><p>\u201cMercy \u2013 I\u2019m begging you,\u201d he pled as he finally pulled from her sheath and turned them so they were on their sides facing each other. Her face turned scarlet as she looked at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI... I... wasn\u2019t...\u201d she tried to say.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said as he gently kissed her. He felt utter exhaustion overtake him as he lay next to her. She tensed for a moment, but he wasn\u2019t letting her retreat. They could fight when the morning came. Right then, he felt better than he ever had before and he just wanted to hold her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let the guilt wash through him, or think of the job he was supposed to be doing. He would fall asleep with her in his arms, and when morning came, they could deal with the world. He reached out and flipped off her light, then pulled her against his body, and fell asleep with a smile still on his face.</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>Chad woke up with Bree pressed tightly against him. He took a few moments to gaze at her face \u2013 so innocent in sleep. She looked young and carefree in the early morning hours. With reluctance, he untangled himself from her arms and legs, almost changing his mind when she grumbled in her sleep.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed while she twisted around, reaching out her arm. She finally found the pillow and pulled it against her chest, then sighed as her deep breathing resumed.</p><p>Chad quickly used the shower and dressed, then peeked in the door at her still sleeping form. He smiled, hoping she didn\u2019t wake before he was finished with his surprise. She\u2019d been through a lot in the last twenty-four hours and she deserved to wake up to something positive.</p><p>He searched her fridge, grateful to find all he would need, and then he got to work. Within a half hour he was ready and found a makeshift tray that he loaded and carried to her room. She started to stir when he sat down on her mattress. The smell of fresh coffee must have woken her.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she groaned as her eyes slowly opened and she looked around.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Chad said as he leaned down and kissed her soft lips. She tensed as her eyes opened fully.</p><p>\u201cWhat... What time is it?\u201d she stuttered, unsure of how to act the morning after.</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of time to get to work, it\u2019s only six-thirty,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She looked from his face to the tray on her night stand. He\u2019d made her his specialty dish, the one and only thing he knew how to cook to perfection, a Denver Omelet with crispy bacon, hash browns and toast on the side.</p><p>\u201cSit up and I\u2019ll hand you the tray. I thought after the day you had yesterday, breakfast in bed would be just what the doctor ordered.\u201d</p><p>Bree slowly rose and Chad placed the tray on her lap. She looked down as she fought to keep her tears from falling. No man had ever done something so sweet for her and she was having a difficult time maintaining her composure.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she finally murmured as she picked up the coffee and took a sip. It was perfect.</p><p>She lifted the fork and took a bite of the omelet and once again her eyes widened as the fluffy masterpiece practically melted in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis is delicious,\u201d she exclaimed before shoving another bite in. Before she knew it, her plate was clean and she gave him a sheepish smile.</p><p>\u201cI never get to eat so well. I\u2019m usually running late and lucky to have time for a piece of toast. That\u2019s one thing I miss from home. Dad has the best cook in the world,\u201d Bree said. She polished off the rest of her coffee, then knew she had to get up and ready for her busy day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it,\u201d Chad said, feeling pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Bree said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but I have to get ready for work...\u201d she hedged. She didn\u2019t want to climb from her bed naked, and she was currently sitting there, wrapped in nothing but a thin cotton sheet.</p><p>\u201cBefore you get ready, I have a gift for you,\u201d Chad said with a smile.</p><p>Bree looked at him to the small box in his hand. Her eyes rounded in excitement mingled with fear.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing too extreme,\u201d he said as he set the box in front of her.</p><p>She reached out tentatively as if the small package would somehow strike her if she moved too quickly. Chad gave her an encouraging smile.</p><p>She untied the bow and opened the box.</p><p>\u201cOh, Chad, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she gasped as she pulled out the necklace. It was a small locket on a thin gold chain. \u201cHelp me put it on,\u201d she demanded as she exposed the slender column of her throat.</p><p>With almost trembling hands, Chad held the dainty chain and clasped it around her neck. The slight feel of her satin skin sent awareness zipping through him. He had to leave now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take these,\u201d Chad said as his eyes drifted to the swells of her breasts, where the sheet had slipped. She tightened it back up while he grabbed the tray and exited the room.</p><p>Bree leaned her head against the wall and groaned. Oh, the man should come with a warning label. He was drop-dead-gorgeous, made love like a god, and could cook, too. She\u2019d never survive if he hung around her night and day. Right then she decided to take it a day at a time.</p><p>The days started drifting, one into the other and before Bree realized it, an entire month passed. She and Chad had found an easy rhythm, comfortable in each other\u2019s presence, but he didn\u2019t try to take her to bed again. She almost wished he would. She couldn\u2019t make the first move, but she also wouldn\u2019t resist if he did.</p><p>They watched movies together, laughed, yelled and had some pretty intense standoffs. He was still too over-the-top most of the time, but she also got to see a side of him she was sure he didn\u2019t show too many people.</p><p>He held doors open for her and pulled out chairs. He insisted on paying when they went to eat, though she would point out it wasn\u2019t a date, he\u2019d mutter about stubborn women and hand over his credit card.</p><p>The thing that scared Bree the most was how dependent she was becoming on him. She was asked out by her co-workers often on Friday nights, but she refused. She knew Chad would trail along, staying in the background, but she found she didn\u2019t want to go out with anyone other than him.</p><p>What had happened to her desire to be alone?</p><p>She continued to go to work, he followed. She left work and he was right there. No more threats came in \u2013 everything seemed to be back to normal so she didn\u2019t see any reason for him to stay, though she wanted him to. The thought of making him leave tugged at her gut. She had to firm her resolve and tell him his services were no longer required, because he was creating havoc with her body, which didn\u2019t want to listen to her mind. What she really wanted to do was rip every last piece of his clothing away and climb on top of him.</p><p>The last few days she\u2019d managed to stop talking to him all together, which seemed to make her die a bit inside.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think the cold shoulder is getting a little old?\u201d Bree nearly jumped out of her skin when Chad startled her from her self pep-talk.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to admit I don\u2019t need a bodyguard. No more letters have come in. No prowlers are lurking around corners. I\u2019ve called my father and told him, and even he seems to think he may have overreacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he said to me. He doesn\u2019t feel you\u2019re safe on your own. If you go back home, you can be rid of me,\u201d he said with a mocking smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most frustrating man I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she said as she jumped to her feet and got in his face. It wasn\u2019t an easy task to accomplish, considering he stood a good eight inches taller than her, but with her heels on, she made up some of the difference. Being short wasn\u2019t an advantage when dealing with a six-foot-four, muscle bound Neanderthal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of the pot calling the kettle black, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Chad said with a smile.</p><p>She pushed her finger into his chest, her temper escalating, along with her desire. She was furious at her traitorous body for wanting the insufferable man.</p><p>Chad snaked his hand out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her off balance and causing her chest to fall against his. When she felt the intensity of their touch, she instantly grew moist \u2013 her body readying in anticipation of him.</p><p>When Bree made a sound low in her throat, Chad\u2019s entire body came to life. He\u2019d been killing himself trying to fight his attraction to her. She was the devil in disguise and he knew she\u2019d be the end of him. Simply watching her do the most mundane of tasks, such as bending over to pick something up, sent his body into overdrive. One night of lovemaking hadn\u2019t been enough and he was furious at his lack of self-control.</p><p>It seemed all rational reactions were out the window where Bree Anderson was concerned.</p><p>He pushed his fingers through her silken strands of hair and pressed his lips against hers before he could stop himself. He had to taste her \u2013 just for one minute. A moment of weakness wouldn\u2019t kill them.</p><p>He had to stop.</p><p>His job was to protect her \u2013 not seduce her in the middle of a public park. They were out in the open with dozens of people walking by. He couldn\u2019t seem to get the message to his brain, though. His lips caressed hers until her mouth opened and he felt the tip of her tongue lick against his bottom lip.</p><p>His groin jumped to life and he pressed her back against the park wall, his hands tugging on her hair, holding her mouth firmly in place beneath his own as his tongue swept along her lips.</p><p>His mind said to stop \u2013 but his body needed more.</p><p>Deepening the kiss, he forgot everything around them until he heard laughter from some kids, then the sound of kissing noises. He finally managed to pull his head clear and turned to see a group of children laughing at the two of them while kissing their hands.</p><p>Bree looked at him through passion filled eyes, leaning toward him, when she finally heard the kids. Her eyes rounded as she turned her head, then her cheeks flushed as she realized the display they\u2019d put on.</p><p>She pushed against his chest and he could tell she was mortified by what they\u2019d been doing. Chad kept trying to tell his highly aroused body it just a kiss, not worth getting all worked up over.</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d she said breathlessly as she moved away another foot, putting space between them. He wanted to follow and drag her back but he knew she was smart to move away.</p><p>\u201cI know. I tend to lose my mind around you,\u201d he admitted. She looked surprised by his honesty.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t work together anymore. Obviously I don\u2019t use the best judgment around you, and contrary to what you may believe, I don\u2019t normally sleep with men I barely know. I\u2019m going for a walk. So help me, if you follow, I\u2019ll call the sheriff and tell him you\u2019re attacking me,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>He had a feeling she wasn\u2019t bluffing. He decided to give her a little space. Not too much, he still wasn\u2019t assured of her safety, but since nothing had happened in a month, she was safe to take a short stroll.</p><p>Bree turned and walked down the wooded path. When she reached the bend, he started following. He\u2019d just make sure to stay out of her sight. What she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her, after-all.</p><p>After five minutes of walking, he figured she was about thirty yards ahead of him. That\u2019s when he heard her scream and all bets were off \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have allowed her to walk away. He reached for his gun and took off, sprinting down the trail. He turned the corner to find Bree sprawled on the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded while surveying the area. He didn\u2019t see anyone, but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t danger.</p><p>\u201cA guy tried to grab me. He had a hold of my arm, but I dropped to the ground. He had a knife. He lifted it when I screamed. He was getting ready to grab me again when he heard you running and took off that way,\u201d she gasped as she pointed to a small trail.</p><p>Chad didn\u2019t want to leave her alone, but he had to try to catch the guy. If this was her stalker, he could get him behind bars, where he belonged.</p><p>\u201cGo back to the park, now!\u201d he demanded, then took off down the trail. He hoped for once she would actually listen to him. He didn\u2019t want her on the secluded trail. He needed her surrounded by the other people at the park \u2013 feeling she was safer among a crowd.</p> <p>As Chad quickly followed the trail, he heard the sound of twigs breaking ahead of him, and figured the guy had about a hundred yard lead on him. It should be no problem to catch him. Picking up his pace, his weapon still drawn, he listened for any changes in the guy\u2019s pattern. If twigs stopped breaking, or there was a sudden silence, he could adjust his own stride, but the perpetrator wasn\u2019t even trying to hide his departure.</p><p>Chad began to hear the sounds of cars and people and realized they\u2019d made a large loop and were going to break out of the trail in a minute. If this guy got into a large crowd, Chad could too easily lose him. He picked up his pace, but when he heard the snapping of twigs stop, he knew it was too late.</p><p>He pushed himself even faster and quickly ran into the grassy field surrounding the park. People were milling about, but he didn\u2019t see anyone running. He surveyed the area, seeking anyone who was out of place. He swiped his hand across his forehead, frustration making him want to yell.</p><p>He turned toward the swings, where he saw Bree walking to her car. Good, she was fine. He moved in the direction of the parking lot. The guy had to be there somewhere. He had to holster his gun so he didn\u2019t have someone calling the cops. He could easily explain himself, but by the time he got out an explanation, the perpetrator would be long gone.</p><p>Just when he was about to give up and head back to Bree, he saw a black car pull quickly out of a space. The windows had dark tints, but the driver\u2019s side was slightly down, allowing the top of a man\u2019s head to be visible.</p> <p>He knew it was his guy. Racing to the car at full speed, he saw the man\u2019s head turn as the car tires squealed, peeling out of the parking lot, nearly hitting a family, who jumped out of the way at the last second. Chad came close to the car when a note fluttered out the window, then the driver peeled out and was gone. There was no way he could catch him.</p><p>Chad glared at the vehicle without a license plate, making it impossible for him to turn the plate numbers in to the police. He jogged over and grabbed the note the man had thrown out. He was afraid to read what was written on it.</p><p>Fury coursed through him as he lifted the note. What the hell did the guy want with Bree? The freak had touched her, nearly managed to abduct her. Chad was acting like a love-sick boyfriend instead of her bodyguard.</p><p>A bad feeling began stirring in Chad\u2019s stomach. The danger was seemingly gone, but he\u2019d learned from his many years of service to never ignore his gut instincts. He headed quickly toward Bree, feeling an urgency in his movements.</p><p>Chad was halfway across the parking lot when a shot rang through the air. Several people screamed, as bodies dropped to the ground \u2013 parent\u2019s quickly throwing their bodies over their children.</p><p>Chad reached Bree and threw himself in front of her, while dragging her behind a large car. Once he made sure she was safely down, he poked his head out and looked for any sign of the shooter. He couldn\u2019t see anyone. They must have a sniper, which meant they weren\u2019t safe anywhere. He needed to get her to safety.</p> <p>Chad could feel Bree trembling beside him \u2013 maybe she finally realized the amount of danger she was in. It wasn\u2019t the time to lecture \u2013 he had to get her to safety first. There was an eerie silence through the park. Every few seconds he could hear the choked sob of some of the terrified people, who\u2019d only been out for a nice time with their families. He had to move \u2013 they were too vulnerable where they were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lead you through the cars. We\u2019re bait where we are. You need to follow directly behind me, and when I say move, don\u2019t hesitate,\u201d Chad whispered with authority in his tone. Bree nodded, her eyes huge in her pale face.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care who they hurt, do they,\u201d Bree practically sobbed. She was far more terrified for all the innocent children around the play area than she was for herself. She didn\u2019t want to die, but if a child got shot because of her, she\u2019d never be able to forgive herself.</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. They want us, not the kids. We just need to get you out of here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot us \u2013 me,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been in far worse situations in other countries. This is a piece of cake, comparatively. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you. Just do what I say and we\u2019ll get out of here,\u201d he said with confidence. His commanding voice had a way of soothing her. She put her complete trust in him and nodded her head.</p><p>As they began to move, they made it three cars forward without further shots fired. Bree could see her car about five spaces down. She didn\u2019t know how they would get in and get away without getting shot, but they had to have a goal in mind, and right then, that goal was her car. If they could somehow reach it, then everything would be okay.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too big of a gap between the last car and yours. Give me the key. I\u2019m going to make a dash for it. I\u2019ll get in and pull up to you. As soon as I pull up I want you to get in the back door and lay down on the floorboard. We\u2019re going to haul ass out of here. No looking back,\u201d he told her. Her gut clenched with fear. She didn\u2019t want them to separate \u2013 not even for a few seconds.</p> <p>Chad dashed away before she could argue any further. She knelt shakily next to the small red car, but stayed focused. She watched as he neared her car \u2013 keys ready. A relieved breath escaped as he opened the door and started to climb in.</p><p>Then another shot rang out and she watched in horror as his body jerked and he was slammed into the side of her car. She watched, paralyzed with fear, as a crimson stain spread across the back of his shirt.</p><p>Where was he hit? Was it fatal? He dropped to the ground and a guttural growl crept from her throat. Who were these people? Why were they targeting her \u2013 and why did Chad have to take a bullet meant for her?</p><p>She watched a man in black step from between a van and truck about fifty yards away. He was heading straight for Chad - she knew he planned on finishing what he\u2019d started. He wanted to make sure Chad was dead. She couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. If he wasn\u2019t fatally wounded already, she certainly wouldn\u2019t hide while he was murdered right before her eyes.</p><p>Bree jumped up, exposing herself to the people after her. She looked around with frantic eyes, then locked gazes with the man stealthily approaching Chad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, you coward,\u201d she yelled. He smiled in satisfaction and his direction changed. Refusing to stand there and make it easy for him, she knew she had to lead him away from all the innocent people \u2013 away from Chad.</p><p>She turned and started sprinting toward the road. She moved in a zigzag pattern, like she\u2019d been taught to do if someone was chasing after her with a weapon. She ran faster than she\u2019d ever thought she could.</p><p>She heard the thundering footsteps behind her and knew he was gaining speed. She thought she heard Chad cry out for her, but she knew it had to be her imagination. She wanted him to be alive so badly, she was starting to imagine his voice. It was in those terrifying moments of fight or flight that she realized how much she was falling for Chad.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to seep into her life without her permission. He was protective and loyal, stubborn and charming, strong, yet gentle. Please be okay, she silently cried.</p><p>Bree heard the squealing tires only seconds before a hand clamped around her waist. Maybe it was Chad, maybe he hadn\u2019t gotten hurt. She knew better, but she had to hold onto hope.</p><p>There was a creaking sound as a sliding door was thrown open, then she felt her body flying upward as she was roughly shoved inside the moving vehicle. Through terror filled eyes, she looked at the three men, all wearing black masks and smiling in triumph.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream, when a filthy hand was slammed across her lips. She automatically gagged from the vile taste of the disgusting fingers on her. She had to fight to not throw-up. She began shaking uncontrollably as she realized the hopeless situation she was in.</p><p>Chad was probably dead. She was being kidnapped to be taken, who knows where, and she may never get to see her family again. What a fool she\u2019d been thinking she was invincible. She should\u2019ve listened to her father.</p><p>Bree refused to give the men the satisfaction of seeing her cry. She glared at each one of them as the vehicle quickly sped down the road. Each mile they traveled, she knew the chances of rescue became increasingly more difficult.</p><p>One of the men gripped her hair and yanked her head back, a leering smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have a little taste of you,\u201d he said, his eyes filled with lust. She shuddered, realizing there were worse things than death.</p><p>\u201cPete, knock it off. You know the orders,\u201d another guy growled. Pete looked at her with frustration. She had a feeling if it were just the two of them, she\u2019d be in a much worse situation than she already was.</p><p>Pete leaned closer and inhaled the scent of her hair. She pulled her head back as much as she could, with his hand still gripping her hair, and spit in his face. She\u2019d rather he punched her than lay his lips anywhere near her. His eyes widened in rage and she thought she may have just run out of time.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d another man shouted. She felt another hand press over her mouth, but this one was holding a cloth. Suddenly the world started turning black and her last thought, before passing out, was how she hoped Chad made it out alive.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Chad struggled to his feet. His shoulder was on fire, but it looked like the shot had gone right through. He quickly cleared his mind and refocused, knowing he had to get to Bree. His wound was forgotten as he did a search of the parking lot.</p><p>He turned in time to see a couple of burly men haul her into a large black van and tear down the street. He jumped into her car and threw the keys in the ignition, only to come up with nothing. He cranked the key, and again nothing.</p><p>Chad slammed his fist into the dashboard, causing a huge crack, and a curse to fall from his lips. The bastards had dismantled the engine. How could he have been so stupid? They\u2019d walked right into a trap. He was trained to avoid these kind of situations. The lack of any activity over the past month had made him grow lax in his job \u2013 that and the fact he was falling for Bree.</p><p>He would find a way to get her back. He\u2019d done this a million times over on missions. He briefly thought about hot-wiring the car next to him, but the kidnappers were long gone. He was better off calling for help.</p><p>Chad grabbed a sweater from her back seat and compressed his wound. He didn\u2019t have time to pass out and he would if he lost too much blood. Next, he made a phone call to George Anderson. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to the other man answering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George picked up on the second ring, and was dead silent as Chad filled him in on the situation. He didn\u2019t have time for long explanations \u2013 he had to locate Bree and ensure her safe return.</p><p>\u201cI need a ride now. I have a plan,\u201d Chad said with authority in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a ride in twenty minutes,\u201d George said before disconnecting the line. Chad laid his head against the back of the seat and waited for his ride, frustration radiating from him.</p><p>\u201cSir, sir, are you okay?\u201d A woman questioned as she slowly approached.</p> <p>Chad turned his head and looked at her fear filled eyes. He didn\u2019t have time to reassure the people who were starting to get shakily to their feet. He saw cell phones out and figured the police would be arriving shortly.</p><p>The idiots couldn\u2019t open fire in a public place and not expect the police to respond. Chad sat up a little straighter, wondering where the law was. Why hadn\u2019t they already arrived? A chill ran down his spine as he thought about the possibility that maybe Bree\u2019s attacks went much deeper than just a single person stalking her. What if they had police help, or other people of power? He was going to get answers and he quickly narrowed his list of those he could trust.</p><p>When, not if, but when he got Bree back, he wasn\u2019t letting her out of his sight until he knew exactly who was after her, and they were behind bars. She was vulnerable and he didn\u2019t know how far the ring of outlaws extended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, check on the other people,\u201d Chad responded, dismissing the woman as harmless.</p><p>\u201cBut... you... you were shot,\u201d she stuttered as if he didn\u2019t know a bullet had passed through him. In actuality, he\u2019d almost forgotten about the wound. He\u2019d been hurt much worse in far more dangerous places, with many scars to prove it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he snapped. He didn\u2019t like being cold but he wanted her gone. He had a rescue to think about and didn\u2019t feel like making small talk.</p><p>Her face blanched at his tone and she quickly ran away. Several heads turned his way, but no one else approached, taking the hint that he didn\u2019t need, nor want help.</p><p>Twenty minutes later he wasn\u2019t surprised to hear the sound of chopper blades as the Anderson Helicopter landed in a patch of grass a couple dozen yards from him. Mark jumped out and rushed to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a doctor on standby at my Dad\u2019s place. Let\u2019s get you fixed up so we can figure out where they\u2019ve taken Bree and then bring her home,\u201d Mark said, not taking any time for a reunion. Chad appreciated it \u2013 he didn\u2019t need to make small talk.</p><p>By the time the chopper landed fifteen minutes later on the lawn behind the Anderson mansion, Chad was filled with unbelievable rage. The longer he thought about those idiots placing their hands on Bree, the more he felt the need to smash something.</p><p>The two men stepped inside the mansion and Chad rolled his eyes as he looked around the room. Her entire family was there, wearing varying expression, ranging from worry to anger to guilt. He knew how they felt. He was beating himself up inside \u2013 she never should\u2019ve been captured.</p> <p>\u201cSit down, Chad. We need to look at that arm,\u201d Joseph said as he led him to a chair with a medical table set up next to it. An older gentleman immediately cut his shirt off and started poking at his arm, sending white hot fire down to the tips of his toes. The wound hadn\u2019t bothered him until the damn man poured his so called medicine over it. Chad tuned the doctor out, ignored the pain and instead focused on George, who looked about ten year\u2019s older right then.</p><p>Questions started flying and Chad waited a moment before he told them the story. Every set of eyes was focused on him as he pushed the words past his tight lips. He needed a computer, but it was simpler to explain the situation, than demand access to the internet. It would save time.</p><p>\u201cTake these,\u201d the doctor commanded, handing him a couple pills and a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said while looking the man in the eye. After grumbling about ridiculous men, the doctor put the pills away and left them.</p><p>\u201cI need a computer. I gave Bree a gift about a month ago, a necklace. I know she\u2019s been wearing it daily. Inside the locket is a tracking device. I\u2019ll have her location locked down in less than two minutes, then I\u2019m going after her,\u201d Chad announced. Everyone froze, looking at him with varying degrees of shock and respect.</p><p>A laptop computer was placed before him and just like he said, he had her location within a couple of minutes. She wasn\u2019t moving, so it looked like the men were already at their destination. Chad frowned as he pulled up a satellite image of the abandoned looking building. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to sneak up on them, and he feared if they knew he was coming, they would harm her. That wasn\u2019t acceptable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Trenton insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trained, you\u2019ll only slow me down. We can\u2019t waste time, not with Bree in the hands of these men,\u201d Chad replied, knowing there was going to be an argument. The two men stared at each other to see who would back down first.</p> <p>Finally, Trenton held his hands up and turned to his father. It was either that or the two men were going to end up in a fist fight.</p><p>\u201cYou talk some sense into him because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m not helping with this. We\u2019re wasting time here. I can\u2019t even begin to think about what these deranged bastards are doing to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChad, you know her brothers aren\u2019t going to stand idly by, so why don\u2019t you just tell them what they need to do, give them a crash course in rescue, whatever it is you need from them, because I agree with Trenton. The more of you there are, the greater chance you have of a safe rescue,\u201d George said. He was speaking in a reasonable tone but there was an undercurrent of authority in his voice as well.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our sister, we\u2019re going,\u201d Austin insisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you don\u2019t make a move unless I specifically okay it,\u201d Chad announced.</p><p>\u201cTo hell with that,\u201d Trenton shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that or you can wait here for us to return,\u201d Chad said as he moved so he was standing toe to toe with Trenton. He wasn\u2019t budging an inch and he certainly wasn\u2019t jeopardizing Bree\u2019s safety. What Chad really wanted to do was knock Trenton\u2019s lights out, but he knew it wasn\u2019t the right time to get into a boxing match \u2013 no matter how much better it would make him feel.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Trenton conceded.</p><p>\u201cWe should call the cops,\u201d Amy said as she entered the room. The men turned in her direction. She was pale and her eyes were swollen from the tears she\u2019d shed. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to convince all of you of that for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe told you, baby, we can\u2019t do that. If the cops rush in, Bree could get hurt. Plus, as Chad explained, we don\u2019t know how far this thing stretches. If these people have cops in their pockets and we notify the authorities, we could be warning them of our arrival. They may figure out Bree has a tracking device on her, remove it, and make it impossible for us to locate her again,\u201d Lucas said as he wrapped his arms around his wife. She shook in his arms as her tears started flowing again. She and Bree had become very close over the years and she was terrified for her friend.</p><p>\u201cThe cars are ready, sir,\u201d a man said quietly as he stepped into the room. He took a step back as seven huge men turned to stare at him. \u201cThe keys are in them,\u201d he finished, then made a hasty retreat.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Armon,\u201d Joseph replied, stress evident in his eyes.</p><p>Joseph laid his hand on Chad\u2019s unhurt shoulder and the gesture instantly calmed him. The man seemed to have magic inside, because he\u2019d been able to do the same thing for Chad as he grew up. He could be spitting mad, or feel completely defeated, and the smallest touch from Joseph would somehow ground him.</p><p>\u201cGo get your girl back,\u201d Joseph said in a knowing tone. Everyone in the room heard his words and turned to glare at Chad. He ignored them and walked to the front doors. Joseph was right. He didn\u2019t know how or when it had happened, but he did think of Bree as his. He prayed he found her safe and sound so he could figure out where it was all leading.</p><p>Bree woke up and the darkness surrounding her nearly sent her over the edge, into panic. She attempted to move, then panicked even more when she realized her arms were tied to something. She struggled for several long minutes, the ropes securing her arms, tearing into her flesh. Finally, the pain was overwhelming and she lay back silently.</p><p>Calm down, you have to keep calm, she told herself. She slowly turned her head and looked around the small, dim room. She was tied to an old army cot and no matter how hard she tugged, she knew there was no chance of breaking either the rope or the metal bed. She had to figure out another way to get free.</p><p>Taking several deep breaths, Bree strained her ears to see if she could hear anything. Were her attackers nearby? She couldn\u2019t hear a sound. She listened a while longer before giving up. That had to be a good sign. No one was coming after her for at least a few minutes. That gave her time to break free.</p><p>She strained her memory to figure out the last thing she remembered. She could recall being in the van with several huge men, then the world going black. They must have chloroformed her. That would explain her raging headache.</p><p>She focused on her surroundings. She was in a small room with the windows boarded up. It looked like a house, maybe an abandoned one. She didn\u2019t know her location. Even if she managed to break free, she could be in the middle of a huge farm, for all she knew. She tried not to let hopelessness wash through her. She was an Anderson, and they didn\u2019t give up. Her father would lecture her for years if she were to throw in the towel.</p><p>Her wrist throbbed horribly, but the ropes weren\u2019t overly tight. She had nothing but time so she started working on the knots, grateful she could move her hands between the ropes. After what seemed like hours, she was ready to start crying. They weren\u2019t budging. She heard footsteps and froze.</p><p>There was a sound like someone inserting a key into a lock, then her door started opening. She made her body lay motionless and shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow much crap was on that cloth?\u201d someone snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just doused it,\u201d another man spoke.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t wake up, we\u2019re dead. Make sure she\u2019s breathing,\u201d the first voice said. She heard footsteps, then a large hand wrapped around her neck, lying against her chest. She forced herself not to panic and to take deep, even breaths, but it was difficult as the man\u2019s hands lingered too long. When he finally pulled away, his hand slipped across her breasts, making her skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still alive,\u201d the guy snarled, as if he could care less one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to wake her? I can think of a few ways that could be fun for all of us.\u201d Bree shuddered inwardly and hoped the fear of their boss was great enough for them to leave her be. There was no way she could fight them off in the position she was in.</p><p>She fought against shuddering as another hand stroked her body. It took all her strength not to tense as his hands moved over her still form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTempting, but I don\u2019t feel like getting shot,\u201d the man creepily whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow would he know?\u201d the other guy whined.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d tell him, dumb ass,\u201d the man snapped.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say she won\u2019t make something up anyway? We may as well get some pleasure if he\u2019s going to think we did it.\u201d</p> <p>The other guy hesitated and she could tell he was starting to cave to his friend\u2019s wishes. She swallowed back the tears pressing against her throat. She had a feeling her life was about to take a horrible turn for the worse. She pictured her family, Chad, and a hot summer day. She could survive this \u2013 she was strong, she tried to convince herself, but when the man\u2019s hand landed on her thigh, she knew she couldn\u2019t. How could anyone?</p><p>\u201cPete, Dave, get down here,\u201d another voice yelled from what sounded like the bottom of a staircase. She must be on a top floor. That was at least somewhat helpful if she managed to get the ropes untied.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes him the boss?\u201d one of the men growled and the hand tightened on her thigh and moved upward for a second. She thought they were going to ignore the order. She was getting ready to kick her legs out. She knew they\u2019d win, but she would fight for all she was worth.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d the voice yelled even louder. The hand finally left her leg and she heard the welcome sound of the two men retreating from her room. The door shut and she lay silently as she listened to them move down the stairs. She realized they hadn\u2019t re-locked her door. It was a sliver of hope in her seemingly hopeless world. If she could somehow get the ropes off, then maybe she could get out of the house.</p><p>She worked on the ropes, her mind drifting. She hoped Chad had been rescued. She\u2019d never forget the sight of his blood staining his shirt crimson. She prayed she\u2019d get to see him with her own eyes again. She didn\u2019t care about anything else; she just wanted the chance to lie in the safety of his arms one more time. She wouldn\u2019t even put her ever-present guard up.</p> <p>She pictured his hands moving through her hair, his gentle lips caressing her own. It was the only thing that got her though the endless hours as she worked and worked at the ropes binding her. She knew blood was dripping down her arms but she didn\u2019t care. At least the pain let her know she was still alive \u2013 it gave her hope.</p><p>Finally, she started to feel a little give in the rope on her right hand. She\u2019d done something to it and the pressure on that wrist started to lighten. She laughed aloud at the pure joy she felt at her small victory. She started moving her fingers around the loose piece of rope and after more struggling, she felt the rope release and she pulled her hand free. She turned her body, to better see the other rope and began working away at the knot.</p><p>She made much faster time being able to see what she was doing. She released her second wrist and then sat up in the bed. It was just the beginning of her flight to freedom, but it was a huge victory. She looked at her swollen wrists in the pale light seeping in through the bottom of the door, and cringed. They were cut up pretty bad but she couldn\u2019t feel pain at that moment with the amount of adrenaline pumping steadily through her body.</p><p>She got to her feet and quickly fell back down to the bed when her head started spinning. She\u2019d gotten up too fast. She winced as the bed made a loud squeak, straining her ears to see if the men had noticed. She sat motionless for about five minutes before she allowed herself to breathe normally again.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem as if they\u2019d heard her. Okay, I\u2019m out of here, she thought to herself with determination as she moved away from the bed. She stopped just before she opened the door because she heard shouting and the sound of a gun firing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s significant activity in the house and the windows are boarded up. I can\u2019t pinpoint her exact location but I know she\u2019s in there,\u201d Chad said to the group of men who were hiding in the brush in front of the seemingly abandoned house. There were no other homes around for miles and they couldn\u2019t spot any security measure in place. The men were either arrogant or just stupid. Chad was counting on the latter.</p> <p>\u201cI contacted my friend who\u2019s a cop I know I can trust. Now that we\u2019re in place, we may need his team for back-up. They should be here in about fifteen minutes so we need to move fast. You three take the back, Lucas and I will go in the front,\u201d Trenton said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for one minute. While you have them at a standoff, I\u2019ll find Bree,\u201d Chad said, agreeing with Trenton\u2019s plan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now or never, boys,\u201d Trenton called, then the men went into stealth mode and quickly ran toward the house. Chad counted to twenty while he watched them approach the steps. Trenton stood back, brought his leg up and smashed in the rickety front door.</p><p>Immediately, gunfire erupted as shots rang out.</p><p>Screw waiting a full minute, Chad thought as he rushed in. He had to get to Bree, and fast. There was no way he wanted her anywhere near the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cGet the damn girl,\u201d he heard someone shout, then saw a man dart for the stairs. Over his dead body! Chad charged the guy and caught him by surprise. He slammed the butt of his gun into the man\u2019s temple, making him crumble to the floor. Then he charged up the stairs three at a time.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d he called. Being discreet was no longer an option, as the house was an eruption of chaos. He had to evacuate her from the premises as quickly as possible and then notify the guys to stand down. She was their only goal. Let the cops deal with the mess of the kidnappers.</p><p>\u201cChad,\u201d he heard Bree\u2019s voice filled with hope. A door creaked open, and there she was. She was pale, shaking and he didn\u2019t even want to think about what was going on with her wrists, but she was alive.</p> <p>Chad swung her into his arms, slammed his lips against hers for a fleeting moment, then pushed her behind him and started descending the stairs, far more cautiously than how he\u2019d come up. She didn\u2019t say a word, just followed him, her body brushing against his with each step.</p><p>They reached the bottom of the stairs and Chad smelled smoke. The house was so old it wouldn\u2019t take much for it to become an inferno if a fire had already started. He needed to get her out. He looked around the corner and didn\u2019t see anyone so he pulled her tightly against his side and rushed through the room, and straight out the front door, flames starting to creep up the walls behind him.</p><p>He looked quickly from side to side and didn\u2019t see anyone so he pulled her to the safety of the bushes. Once they were hidden from view he spoke into the microphone on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe and out of the house \u2013 pull out,\u201d Chad spoke. There were several acknowledgments, more firing, then he saw the guys racing from the burning house, covering each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>Chad kept Bree behind him as he lifted his gun and fired into the house, covering the men as they ran from the flames. No one was going to die on his watch. Once the men were safely away he finally focused on Bree.</p><p>He ran his hands along her body, checking for injuries. When he reached her wrists, she let out a small gasp. He looked at her damaged skin in the light of day and had to fight the rage wanting to boil over. He wanted nothing more than to go back in that house and destroy the men who\u2019d been foolish enough to harm her.</p><p>Instead, he gently lifted her hand to his mouth and softly brushed his lips against her swollen and bloody flesh. He wanted to take her pain away \u2013 he should\u2019ve been able to prevent it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Chad. Thank you,\u201d Bree told him in a tear choked voice. He pulled her back into his arms and held her tightly, while waiting for her family to join them. He heard the sound of sirens in the distance. Their back-up had arrived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bree. I promised I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen. They never should\u2019ve been able to get close to you, let alone take you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one acting foolish. You\u2019re the one who rescued me. I was so terrified when I saw you fall to the ground. I\u2019m sorry I got you shot,\u201d she whispered. She was barely able to talk, she felt so guilty over him being put in such danger.</p><p>\u201cDid they.... they didn\u2019t... we should get you to the hospital,\u201d he choked. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask her how bad her torture had been. She seemed to realize what he was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cMy wrists are the worst of my injuries. They knocked me out in the van and when I woke up I was tied to the bed. It took me a long time to get out of the ropes. I struggled a lot \u2013 cutting up my skin in the process. They didn\u2019t touch me other than that,\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to know how close the men had come to doing exactly what he feared. She couldn\u2019t even think about it without panic setting in.</p><p>\u201cWe need to have you checked, anyway,\u201d he said, but she heard the relief in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if a man in my life wasn\u2019t trying to take control,\u201d she said with a small attempt at humor. He gave her a half grin before standing up. He saw the ambulance coming around the corner and he wanted to get her inside it.</p><p>\u201cChad, watch out,\u201d he heard Trenton yell. Everything slowed down as he turned toward Trenton, who was throwing his arms in the air. First he pointed to his gun, indicating he was out of bullets, then pointed to his left. Chad turned and realized one of the gunmen had gotten away from them. He had a gun pointed directly at Bree and him.</p><p>Chad reached forward to push Bree back to the ground, but she saw the gunman at the same time as he did. She dodged his hand, putting her in danger.</p><p>Chad whipped his gun back out and put a bullet through the man\u2019s head, but it was too late. He watched in horror as Bree moaned just before her eyes rolled back in her head and blood ran down the side of her face.</p><p>She started falling to the ground, but Chad grabbed her before she hit the solid surface. Trenton ran toward them, tears running down his cheeks as he saw the lifeless look on his sister\u2019s face. She\u2019d been shot in the head.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Chad cringed at the sight of Bree hooked up to so many machines. Wires ran from her arms to the consistently beating monitors next to her hospital bed. She looked so fragile lying in the stark room.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt more fear than in those moments when she\u2019d crumbled in his arms, blood escaping from the side of her head. The bullet had thankfully only grazed her temple. Still, so much blood loss \u2013 too much. One more inch and she\u2019d be dead instead of in a coma. She\u2019d been in it for two months, now, and the doctors didn\u2019t know when she was going to wake up. He\u2019d practically lived by her side, guilt consuming him.</p><p>Bree\u2019s pursuer hadn\u2019t been caught. The men, who\u2019d been holding her captive, said they\u2019d never met the man they were working for in person. Everything was done through the phone. Whoever it was, scared them badly enough, they\u2019d rather sit in jail than give anything up on him, which made Chad think there were some upper level men involved.</p><p>Bree\u2019s family was wealthy beyond what most people could imagine. With great wealth came even greater power. There were people out there who coveted what the Anderson\u2019s had. They weren\u2019t afraid of using terror, force, or even murder to get what they wanted. Chad didn\u2019t know who was behind the pursuit of Bree, but he would find out \u2013 and they would pay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chad had argued with the doctors countless times already, insisting they weren\u2019t doing all they could for her. She should\u2019ve woken by now. How could her body be working, yet her mind refuse to allow her to wake? He couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>Bree\u2019s family was at the hospital as much as Chad. Her brothers took every opportunity to shoot him dirty looks \u2013 though they knew he\u2019d done his best to save her. They, like him, needed someone to blame \u2013 so he was the easiest target.</p><p>\u201cMr. Anderson, we have some test results we need to speak about,\u201d the doctor said as he walked in the room.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d George replied. He looked like hell, with dark circles taking permanent residence under his eyes, and the loss of about twenty pounds. He was making himself sick with worry. It was hard on him being back in the hospital again. It reopened the wounds of grief over the loss of his wife, and caused a whole new mourning period for him and the rest of the family. Even his voice sounded almost dead \u2013 defeated, something Chad had never expected from the powerful man he\u2019d come to know.</p> <p>\u201cWe should speak in private,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cAnything you have to say about my daughter, anyone in this room can hear,\u201d George replied wearily. The doctor nodded his head before he gave them the shock of their lives.</p><p>\u201cBree is two months pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The room went utterly silent as all the men slowly turned their gazes from the doctor to Chad\u2019s stunned face. It was obvious those weren\u2019t the words they were expecting to hear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d George finally gasped. The doctor nodded.</p> <p>Suddenly George\u2019s face broke out in a small grin, the first one he\u2019d given since Bree had been abducted and then shot. Everyone was taken by surprise at his reaction.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be...\u201d he trailed off. He took Bree\u2019s hand in his own and looked at his daughter fondly. \u201cI know you can hear us, Bree. You\u2019re going to be a momma, so you need to fight real hard and wake up,\u201d he whispered in a tear choked voice.</p><p>Chad realized he wasn\u2019t breathing and took in a huge gasp of air. He was going to be a father. Words failed to describe the extreme myriad of feelings coursing through him.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Excitement.</p><p>Love.</p> <p>Each emotion had an equal hold on his teetering emotions. He was going to be a dad. He looked at Bree\u2019s still flat stomach and had to fight the itch in his throat.</p><p>\u201cOutside, Redington,\u201d Trenton snapped.</p><p>Chad stood instantly. He could use a good fight. It looked like it was show time. He followed Trenton into the hall, and the rest of the room cleared out behind them. No one wanted to miss the showdown.</p><p>Chad smirked at Trenton, trying to push his buttons. He needed to hit someone, but he wasn\u2019t going to throw the first punch and have Bree all over him when she woke up \u2013 and she would wake.</p><p>Trenton took a menacing step forward and Chad felt his adrenaline kick in. It had been a while, but he\u2019d been on many combat missions, and fighting was second nature to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, boys,\u201d Jennifer called out as she stepped between the two men. \u201cLast time I checked, you were both adults,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis piece of crap violated my sister,\u201d Trenton snapped. His wife glared his way and he instantly backed down. It almost made Chad smile.</p><p>\u201cYour sister isn\u2019t a child, Trenton and this isn\u2019t the eighteenth century. If they made love, it was a mutual decision, plus none of your business,\u201d Jennifer continued.</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d Trenton tried to speak, but Jennifer interrupted again.</p><p>\u201cThere is no, but. They have to work this out on their own, and like it or not, it looks like your sister made her choice and this is the father of your niece or nephew. Do you really want to start a relationship with a fistfight?\u201d</p><p>It looked to everyone like that\u2019s exactly what Trenton wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to deck you right now, Redington, my wife has a point. What the hell happened? You were supposed to be guarding her, not seducing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Chad snapped, frustrated that he wasn\u2019t going to get the fight he so desperately wanted. Trenton growled something, then started pacing the halls.</p><p>\u201cI need air,\u201d he snapped, heading for the doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thrilled about this but Jennifer\u2019s right. Bree is a big girl and can make her own decisions. I\u2019m warning you, though, if you leave my sister high and dry, there won\u2019t be a woman around to protect you,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d let you kick my ass if I did that to her,\u201d Chad said, meaning it. He was ready to take her to the courthouse right then. She carried his child; he would take care of her.</p><p>The men stared at each other for several moments and Austin must have seemed happy with what he saw because he surprised everyone when he clapped Chad on the back as he walked by. It seemed he had at least one of the brother\u2019s approval.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the news to spread through the family. After the shock wore off, everyone went into planning mode. Hopefully she woke up soon because they now had two irreplaceable people lying helpless in the bed.</p><p>Bree cracked her eyes open and felt instant terror. She was choking. She couldn\u2019t breathe, and her head was pounding. Where was she? Why were wires tugging on her arms? She forced her eyelids further open and glanced around the small room that had a beeping monitor next to her head.</p><p>Her heart accelerated and the machine started making a high pitched sound. Her only thought was that she was in danger and had to get away. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d gotten into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ms. Anderson. You\u2019re okay,\u201d a woman said as she stepped up next to her. Who was Ms. Anderson? Was that her? She didn\u2019t know who she was. Panic flared even more as she started thrashing around in the bed, the wires connected to her felt like chains.</p><p>\u201cYou have to calm down. We\u2019re going to give you something to help. We aren\u2019t trying to hurt you,\u201d the woman spoke in a calm manner. Bree didn\u2019t believe her. Danger! There was danger. She didn\u2019t know why or how, she only knew she was unsafe.</p><p>\u201cCall the doctor now, and notify her family,\u201d the same woman said to someone else, and the person quickly left the room.</p><p>The woman poked a needle into one of the wires hanging from her arm, while a man held her hands down so she couldn\u2019t unplug herself. She felt an instant calmness wash over her. She was still fearful, but the panic was ebbing.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? Who are you?\u201d she croaked, the words hurting her throat. She winced. The door opened again and a man walked in. He quickly glanced her way and their eyes locked together. She felt like she should know him, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBree?\u201d he asked questioningly, like he didn\u2019t know if it was her. She looked at him blankly. Was he talking to her?</p><p>\u201cBree, you\u2019re awake,\u201d he practically shouted as he stepped forward. She flinched when he reached down and brushed the hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she may have amnesia. We\u2019ve called for the doctor,\u201d the woman said when Chad looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHi Bree, I\u2019m Dr. Bailey. I know you\u2019re a little scared right now, but I\u2019m going to see if I can help you, okay?\u201d the man said. Bree nodded her head, reassured by the tone of his voice. He slowly approached the bed and started checking her vitals while continuing to ask her questions.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, the door opened again and more strangers stepped inside. Bree turned toward the doctor, not knowing what she should do or say. The room was too crowded \u2013 too many strangers.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be okay, Bree. This is your family. I\u2019m going to step outside and speak to them for a few minutes, okay?\u201d The doctor said. Bree had no choice but to nod. She watched as they all left the room. The same woman, who\u2019d originally come in, stayed with her, reassuring her. She didn\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like your daughter is suffering from amnesia, which isn\u2019t unusual in a coma patient. I\u2019m going to run more tests, but the good news is she\u2019s awake,\u201d Dr. Bailey said once they were in the hallway.</p><p>George and Chad were both speechless for a few moments. The doctor let them have some time to work through their thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Chad finally asked. It seemed the only words he could get past his throat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to know for sure. She could regain her memory at any time, or it could take months. She may even lose some memory all together. There was no permanent damage to the brain from the bullet wound, but I\u2019m unable to give any definitive answers,\u201d Dr. Bailey said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cCan we take her home?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cI need to run more tests. What you need to remember is that you can\u2019t force her memory to return. She needs to come to it on her own. If you push too much on her at once, it can make her retreat further. I know you\u2019ve had a trying time over the last couple months, but she needs to heal. I\u2019ll have more answers for you once I\u2019ve run those tests,\u201d he said before turning and walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Chad asked, feeling helpless.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I don\u2019t like it, we wait,\u201d George answered. Neither man was the type to wait for anything, or anyone, so they both took a few moments to compose themselves before walking back into her room.</p><p>Upon their return, Bree\u2019s eyes were shut and Chad felt like he was going to throw up. He shouldn\u2019t have been gone so long.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, she\u2019s only sleeping. I know it seems like that\u2019s all she\u2019s been doing, but this is different. She will wake up again, but she\u2019s only going to be awake for short periods,\u201d the nurse reassured them.</p><p>George sat by her side for a while before leaving to make phone calls. Chad refused to leave. He wanted to be there when she woke again. The doctor came in a few hours later, but didn\u2019t have positive news. There wasn\u2019t a physical reason for the amnesia, and all they could do was wait it out and pray she regained her memory.</p><p>Chad fell asleep with his head resting on her bed and her hand held securely in his.</p><p>Bree woke again in the dimly lit room but she didn\u2019t feel as panicked as the first time. She looked down and noticed the same man who\u2019d walked in earlier, was sleeping close to her, with her hand gripped in his.</p><p>She took a few moments to study his face, which seemed softer in sleep. He had short hair and was built like a tank, but for some reason he didn\u2019t scare her. She felt safe with him, which confused her, considering she didn\u2019t know who he was. He had to be a good guy, though, if the hospital allowed him in her room.</p><p>She lifted her free hand and brushed her fingers against his cheek, which had a few days growth of hair on it. The movement must have startled him because his eyes shot open, fully alert, and they were caught, staring into each other\u2019s eyes, both of them holding their breaths.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered. Her head wasn\u2019t hurting so much, but she was confused, disoriented and scared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere should I be?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know how to answer her question. She should be safe, and anywhere other than a hospital. She should be free to do what she wanted, not having to hide \u2013 not needing a bodyguard. He didn\u2019t know what he should say.</p><p>\u201cHome. Safe,\u201d he finally said. She looked at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cThey said my name is Bree. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChad, your boyfriend,\u201d he answered, knowing the lie might come to bite him in the butt, but not caring. She carried his child and he didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d get her memory back, so it would be much easier if she assumed they were a couple. He felt a twinge of guilt for lying to her, but he pushed it back. He had to protect her and his unborn baby.</p><p>Her eyes widened at his words and he could see she was digging in her memory, but not coming up with anything.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like hospitals,\u201d she finally said, making him smile for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do, either. I\u2019m not too fond of them these days, myself, but this one has kept you safe,\u201d he answered with a chuckle. His laugh made her smile and the slight flush that came to her face filled him with joy he didn\u2019t know he could feel again.</p><p>Chad couldn\u2019t resist pulling her into his arms. He needed to feel her close to him, to reassure himself she really was awake and everything would be okay. She stiffened \u2013 but only for a moment, then she let him hold her.</p><p>\u201cThis feels familiar,\u201d she finally whispered. The crack in her voice tore at him, but at least he was hearing her speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re awake,\u201d he said without thinking.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d</p> <p>Chad tensed. He didn\u2019t know if he should answer that. The doctor said to keep her calm.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me,\u201d she pled.</p><p>\u201cTwo months,\u201d he answered and watched the color drain from her face once more. \u201cIt will be okay, Bree,\u201d he quickly assured, tugging her close again.</p><p>Bree felt the walls closing in on her. She\u2019d been asleep for months and didn\u2019t remember anything. How could that happen to a person? She felt an overwhelming need to get out of there. She fought back the tears wanting to escape. She somehow knew she wasn\u2019t that kind of woman, she wouldn\u2019t lose control.</p><p>He gently rubbed her back, calming her, and she took a deep breath. She couldn\u2019t change the past so she had to move forward. Little did she know how many more shocks were coming her way. She felt exhaustion begin to overtake her again and didn\u2019t understand how she could be so tired when she\u2019d been asleep for months.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she finally asked. She had to know.</p><p>\u201cWe need to wait for the doctor and your family,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t going to be responsible for giving her any more information that could jeopardize her health.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I need to know,\u201d she tried, but he stood firm. He needed to find out what information was safe to give to her, and what wasn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t do anything else to cause her further harm.</p> <p>Dr. Bailey stepped in the room, saving him. She turned her eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you awake again, Bree,\u201d he said as he walked over and checked her charts.</p><p>\u201cI need answers. Why am I here?\u201d She got right to the point.</p><p>Dr. Bailey sat in a chair next to her bed and looked her over for a few moments before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a discussion for you to have with your family. I\u2019m here to tell you, your health looks good. If you can eat some solid food and work hard over the next week, we can let you get out of here,\u201d he answered, avoiding her question.</p><p>\u201cBut why am I here in the first place,\u201d she asked, her voice cracking even more in her frustration.</p><p>\u201cYour family will fill you in on all of that, but I do have some great news for you. It\u2019s the reason you need to focus on eating so you can leave here,\u201d Dr. Bailey said. Chad tensed. He didn\u2019t want the doctor to blurt out the news, but the man was either ignoring him, or disregarding what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bree asked, momentarily distracted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about eight weeks pregnant.\u201d</p><p>There was pure silence as the news sank in. Bree\u2019s startled eyes went from the doctor to Chad, who managed to muster up an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cI... I...\u201d Bree couldn\u2019t seem to find words.</p><p>\u201cIt will all be okay, Bree,\u201d Chad said, though he didn\u2019t know how to make anything okay. Bree had lost her memory, there were still unknown men after her, and he didn\u2019t know how to fight an unseen force.</p><p>Her hand glided to her stomach and he watched as tears flashed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered with zero hesitation. She gave him a tentative smile, and all her other questions were forgotten as she pondered the reality of impending motherhood.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cAfter your ultrasound, if everything is fine with the baby, you\u2019ll be free to leave,\u201d Dr. Bailey said before Bree was able to open her mouth.</p><p>She\u2019d come out of her coma two weeks ago but was still confined to her hospital room. Okay, not exactly the room, she was allowed to walk to the cafeteria, and even sit outside on occasion \u2013 as long as she had someone with her, but still, being stuck in a hospital, even a nice one, made her feel trapped.</p><p>She\u2019d been a good sport about it for the first week and a half, but then her irritation at the situation became quite apparent to everyone. She was now used to the revolving door of visitors who called themselves her family, though she still hadn\u2019t gotten her memory back, but she just wanted to leave. She didn\u2019t know where home was, but anything had to be better than the sterile hospital room.</p><p>\u201cLooks like he knows you well,\u201d Chad said with a laugh. Bree shot him a glare, and then regretted it. Chad was the one person she felt \u2018right\u2019 being around. She figured they must be incredibly close, because when he walked in the door, she felt butterflies in her stomach. He stirred things inside her she couldn\u2019t fully comprehend.</p><p>She thought she may be falling in love with him \u2013 though she had to love him already if they\u2019d made a baby, right? She hated to start having those thoughts because they made her head hurt trying to put the pieces together of her broken memory.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d she asked the doctor, ignoring Chad\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cI promise \u2013 but only if the ultrasound says everything is good,\u201d he reminded her. She refused to think anything could be wrong.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t felt the baby move, didn\u2019t show any signs of pregnancy yet, but still, she had a connection to her unborn baby. Being pregnant gave her hope that her endless blank of a mind would have to someday clear.</p><p>She had a huge, obviously loving family, who visited her every day. And she couldn\u2019t define Chad. He was by her side night and day, and he was just so... She couldn\u2019t even put into words what he was.</p><p>Masculine.</p><p>Charming.</p><p>Manly.</p><p>Handsome.</p><p>There were thousands of descriptions, she was sure could describe him better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, excited to see the first images of her baby. Maybe seeing the pictures would stimulate her brain somehow and she\u2019d regain her memory. She secretly crossed her fingers.</p><p>Another person came in the room, pushing a table with a machine and large monitor on it. She felt her nerves flutter at the sight. She was moments away.</p><p>Chad sat silently by Bree\u2019s bedside as he watched the hospital staff move around her room. He\u2019d been on combat missions where he hadn\u2019t shed a single drop of sweat, but waiting to see the first images of his unborn child was like sitting in a hole anticipating the first grenade to drop. He was terrified something could be wrong with the baby, but overjoyed to see his son or daughter.</p><p>Without thought he reached out and gripped Bree\u2019s hand. She grew stronger each day and he hoped his child did too. She tensed at the coldness of the gel placed on her stomach, but soon there was a fuzzy image on the screen.</p><p>They both watched intensely as the technician moved the small wand around her belly, stopping every few seconds and clicking buttons on his monitor. Chad wanted to strangle the guy and demand he tell them everything was going to be all right.</p><p>Chad looked on, but couldn\u2019t see anything even sort of resembling a person inside her. Was something wrong? He had to fight not to shout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting a few pictures of the womb right now. Your baby is very small at this point. Not even the size of a shelled peanut, and there\u2019s a lot of fluid and other internal things in the way, so it\u2019s hard to catch a good shot, but give me a moment longer,\u201d the guy finally spoke. It was a good thing, because Chad didn\u2019t think he could take much more silence.</p><p>The doctor bent down and looked at a place on the monitor where the technician had paused. They both spoke quietly for a moment and Chad felt a bead of sweat run down his brow. He was startled by how intense his emotions were. He\u2019d never thought it possible to love something so much that he hadn\u2019t even known he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou both will be pleased to know the baby is developing exactly as it should at this point in the pregnancy. This first machine gave us valuable information we needed. Now, Henry is hooking up our three dimensional ultrasound. Your baby is in a great position, so you\u2019re going to get a fairly clear image of him. At ten weeks along, your child is about an inch long and weighs less than an ounce,\u201d Dr. Bailey explained.</p><p>They both let out relieved breaths at the doctor\u2019s words. Bree turned toward Chad and sent him a stunning smile that would\u2019ve dropped him to his knees had he not already been sitting. She had her color back and looked even more radiant than before. Pregnancy was beautiful on her \u2013 as was everything else.</p><p>\u201cSo, I can go home, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re doing great. All signs point toward a full recovery and a healthy pregnancy,\u201d Dr. Bailey answered. He left out the amnesia. They didn\u2019t dwell on that as it would hopefully cure itself in time.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your baby,\u201d he said and they turned back to the screen. Before them was the image of their infant. It was obvious the baby was awake and moving around. Chad was dazed to see what looked like tiny arms moving in front of a large head. The image made it appear bigger than a peanut.</p><p>\u201cRemember, this image is blown up, but your baby is almost fully developed. They grow rapidly at this stage of pregnancy. In a few weeks he, or she, will be fully formed, just have a lot of growing left to do. The first three months of pregnancy move the fastest in terms of development,\u201d Dr. Bailey informed them. Neither could take their eyes from the screen and they only absently nodded at his words. It was amazing to watch the tiny babe moving inside her body.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hear the heartbeat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They both answered in unison and then smiled at each other.</p><p>Chad was already filled with unbelievable love for his son or daughter, but when the sound of its already beating heart filled the room, he thought his own would burst. Such a strong sound for something so tiny. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bree wasn\u2019t ready for the flood of love and protectiveness that washed through her. She couldn\u2019t remember a thing about her life, but it didn\u2019t matter. None of it did. Before her was the image of the life she carried within her, and the room was filled with the strong sound of its beating heart. Chad was holding her hand \u2013 she felt complete. Her stress drained away and she wanted to stay in the moment for as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the medical conditions, I want to see you next week. If everything is still going great, we\u2019ll go to every two weeks for a couple months. I want to see you a bit more than normal, just to make sure you and your baby stay healthy and safe. If you can promise me that, I\u2019ll sign your release forms,\u201d Dr. Bailey offered.</p><p>Bree quickly agreed. She would sign away anything just to leave \u2013 but she wanted to keep an eye on the baby, too, so agreeing to extra doctor visits wasn\u2019t a hardship.</p><p>Dr. Bailey left them alone to get their emotions under control, while the technician printed them their first pictures of their child.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Bree. Thank you for this gift,\u201d Chad told her once they were alone. Bree looked at him and felt her heart flutter. She had so many questions, but none of them mattered in that moment. She slowly stood up, anxious to get dressed, when Chad surprised her by coming around the side of the bed and lifting her off the ground in a spine shattering hug.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think about resisting him, she wanted his arms around her. She wanted more \u2013 so much more. Chad loosened his grip, but didn\u2019t release her. All of a sudden they were standing chest to chest, their faces only inches apart, and Bree\u2019s breath hitched again. Not from nerves or fear, but from pure excitement.</p><p>She could fully understand how she\u2019d gotten pregnant. Her stomach tightened with need, desire racing through her blood.</p><p>She watched as Chad\u2019s eyes darkened, answering the need in her own face. She felt the pressure on her stomach as his need made itself known to her, pressing against her softness. The knowledge that she\u2019d made this stronger than life man hard, caused her knees to tremble. She let out a moan without realizing it, and Chad quickly closed the gap between them.</p><p>As his lips brushed against hers, Bree moaned again. Sensation washed through her body as he molded his mouth against hers. She readily opened to his seeking tongue, and felt storm clouds building inside her.</p> <p>She pushed against his hardness, feeling power when he trembled against her. She was turning this strong man to a quivering mass. She wanted more \u2013 wanted to make him cry out, like he was making her.</p><p>She ran her hands up his solid arms, raking her short nails against his tan skin. She reached his neck and would\u2019ve smiled had her lips not been occupied, when she felt bumps appear on his skin. He deepened the kiss, thrusting his tongue far inside the recesses of her mouth.</p><p>Chad moved his hands to the back of her hospital gown, easily slipping inside the paper-thin robe. She shuddered as his large hands made contact with her bare skin. More. She had to have all of him.</p><p>She lost complete control and didn\u2019t care. She was safe. She was wanted. She was needed. She loved him, she somehow just knew it.</p><p>Chad reached down to lift her in his arms, having every intention of setting her on the hard hospital bed and taking her right there, when a knock on the door stopped him cold. It was better than an icy shower. He quickly shielded Bree\u2019s body, to give her time to get her gown back in place as the door opened.</p><p>\u201cAre you decent, Honey?\u201d George asked as he cracked the door. \u201cThe doctor said I just missed the ultrasound but that you had some pictures for me.\u201d</p> <p>George stepped in and looked from Chad\u2019s flushed face to Bree\u2019s shaking form behind him, and quickly put two and two together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt. I\u2019ll just wait out here for you,\u201d he said as he started to close the door. Bree was mortified to have been caught necking, by her father, nonetheless \u2013 even if she didn\u2019t remember him being her dad. She did know he loved her \u2013 as he\u2019d been at the hospital almost as much as Chad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay d... dad,\u201d she stammered. She still tripped on the name, but felt wrong calling him George. He\u2019d told her it was all right if she needed to, but he\u2019d said it with suspiciously moist eyes. \u201cWe just finished the ultrasound and Chad was just getting ready to leave so I can get dressed,\u201d she finished. She was bright red as she said the words, but George let her get away with the lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside with your father,\u201d Chad said. His entire body was on fire, and he knew he was going to have a difficult time walking, but she needed a few minutes to compose herself and get dressed. He\u2019d been hoping to help her dress... after he\u2019d gotten rid of the gown and sunk himself deep inside her.</p><p>He tried to rid himself of those thoughts. It wasn\u2019t helping his situation, and really not helping the pain in his lower body. He shifted as he stood awkwardly next to George. He really needed to get her alone \u2013 and in a bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside, then,\u201d George answered with a smile before stepping back out the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it gets more embarrassing than that,\u201d Bree said with a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt could have if he\u2019d been two minutes later,\u201d Chad said. He laughed as he saw the horror dawn on her face. Then he stepped through the doors and leaned his head against the cool metal. He couldn\u2019t seem to keep it together around her. He was beginning to think that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Trenton said with his arms folded across his chest. It seemed everyone was against him on the matter, though.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safest. The doctor said she shouldn\u2019t be forced into anything, plus this way Chad can still keep a watch on her,\u201d George argued.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be doing such a great job,\u201d he snapped, instantly regretted his words because he knew Chad was eating himself up about Bree getting hurt. It wasn\u2019t Chad\u2019s fault Bree had been shot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was uncalled for,\u201d he quickly added.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Chad replied. He would\u2019ve gladly taken that bullet, but they couldn\u2019t dwell on it. They had no choice but to move forward, and at that moment they were discussing where Bree was going after her hospital release.</p><p>\u201cLook, she\u2019s comfortable around me. I can look after her and my baby. Mark is only a couple miles away and you can camp in my back yard if you want,\u201d Chad said. He wanted Bree with him and wasn\u2019t compromising on the subject.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he can get her any more pregnant,\u201d Mark added with a chuckle. Trenton shot daggers at his cousin.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re a monk,\u201d Alex added. Trenton felt they were teaming up against him. He didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing me,\u201d Trenton said, but he knew they were right. His sister wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore. He figured the protective feelings just never went away. He felt like Chad was taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>\u201cListen, I understand how you feel. But you have to realize at some point that Bree is an adult and she wasn\u2019t hurt when she made the decision to sleep with me. She\u2019s carrying my child. That means something to me. I plan on marrying her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, her memory will come back, and if she\u2019s at home when it happens, there\u2019s going to be hell to pay. She\u2019ll accuse us of taking advantage of the situation, then we could lose her permanently. I think she needs to stay with Chad for now. He\u2019ll keep her safe,\u201d Austin jumped in.</p><p>Trenton reluctantly nodded his head but it was obvious he wasn\u2019t happy about the situation.</p><p>\u201cNow that we got that settled, we should stop fighting before Bree turns the corner and wonders what it\u2019s all about. It wouldn\u2019t do her recovery any good to know she\u2019s got a stalker,\u201d George reminded them.</p><p>Within a few minutes, Bree joined them in the waiting area. She had a tentative smile on her face as she glanced toward the door, obviously wanting to exit the hospital before the doctor changed his mind and told her she couldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, shall we?\u201d Chad said, placing his arm around her back. She looked a bit lost, but was more than happy to follow him from the sterile room.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed where I\u2019m going. I don\u2019t even know where I live,\u201d Bree said, starting to feel her first stirrings of panic. It was disorienting to not know anything about her life.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going home,\u201d Chad simply answered.</p><p>\u201cDo we live together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered somewhat truthfully. He had been staying with her so it wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. He had a feeling it was going to come back and bite him later, but he\u2019d deal with that then.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, seeming unsure, but putting her trust in him, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you at the ranch,\u201d George said before giving Bree a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you all should wait a day or two before overwhelming her?\u201d Chad asked. His question was ignored as everyone headed for their vehicles. They already had a welcome home party planned, and whether Bree was ready or not, she was about to be inundated with family.</p><p>Chad helped Bree into his truck, then went around and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. He turned the radio to a country station and quietly started navigating the vehicle, letting her get used to the idea of finally being free from what she considered a prison.</p><p>\u201cHow far away is the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a half hour from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I like living in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bought this property. Before you went into the hospital, we were staying in a small house on the outskirts of town. I think you\u2019ll really enjoy the ranch, though. We have horses, cows, chickens, goats, and a few other creatures running around,\u201d he answered, his voice filled with excitement.</p><p>Bree felt a stirring of familiarity at his words. Maybe she\u2019d spent time on a ranch before. She started to feel excitement as they left the city and glided past fields of hay, gently blowing in the breeze.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem like much time passed when Chad turned off the main road and started traveling down a long gravel driveway. Her head turned from side to side as she tried to take in everything around her. She looked out at the fruit trees and could practically feel the burst of flavor on her tongue. She knew she\u2019d spent time climbing apple trees and plucking fruit from their branches. She just didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d done it.</p><p>They turned a bend in the road and her eyes widened at the number of cars lined up in front of a huge three story home. She heard Chad curse and turned in his direction.</p><p>\u201cI told your family to take it easy and let you get adjusted first, but they don\u2019t seem to listen. It was only supposed to be immediate family members but it looks like they brought the entire gang. If you want me to turn around and take you to a hotel for the night, I will,\u201d he offered when he saw her frightened expression.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s obvious my family loves me, which is great. It\u2019s better to be overwhelmed, than have nobody at all,\u201d she answered. Chad would see if she still felt that way in a few hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re home. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d Jennifer said as she rushed up and threw her arms around Bree as soon as she stepped from the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cAunt Bree, I missed you,\u201d Molly cried out as she ran up to them and joined in on the hub.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d Bree automatically answered. She hugged both of them, though she still didn\u2019t recognize anyone. She was then passed from one pair of arms to the next for several minutes. It brought tears to her eyes, all the love she was receiving. She seemed to be a very lucky person.</p><p>\u201cWe have the steaks going, cousin. Come sit down and relax for a while,\u201d Mark said when she finally made it into the house. She looked around the large entrance with sparse furnishings.</p> <p>\u201cCome out back, Sweetie. We have a nice chair all set up for you,\u201d Joseph called in a voice that made Bree jump. She knew he was her uncle, but the man was a bit intimidating. He was as huge as a mountain, with a voice that could easily command an army.</p><p>\u201cJoseph, you\u2019re scaring the poor girl. Let her get settled,\u201d Esther said as she came up and put her arm around Bree.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. My niece would never be afraid of me,\u201d Joseph protested.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Esther replied before whisking Bree away. Bree had to admit she was grateful for the woman\u2019s interference.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is all just a little overwhelming,\u201d Bree admitted quietly to the kind woman leading her to a secluded space in the back yard.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, dear. Your family means well, and they love you deeply, but sometimes they can be a bit much to handle,\u201d Esther said with a knowing wink.</p><p>\u201cIt seems that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Esther. I\u2019ve worked for the Anderson\u2019s for many years. I\u2019m retired now but they\u2019ve become so much a part of my family, that I can\u2019t seem to stay away,\u201d she said with a gentle laugh. Bree felt completely at ease with her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems they wouldn\u2019t let you go, even if you wanted to leave,\u201d Bree said with wide eyes as she looked over the yard filled with people, young and old, all of them laughing and carrying on. She smiled as she saw a couple toddlers on one end of a see-saw and Chad on the other side. He was shooting them into the air, sending them into fits of contagious laughter.</p><p>Bree felt a flash of memory register. She saw herself flying high on a swing with Jasmine next to her, both of them laughing. Bree smiled, then giggled, overcome with happiness at the small piece of her past. For the first time since waking from her coma, she felt like it really was her family.</p><p>Chad looked over and their eyes connected, sending a bolt of electricity zipping through the air. Her stomach clenched with need so overwhelming she had to quickly sit because she didn\u2019t think her legs would carry her weight any longer. When she saw the instant heat in Chad\u2019s eyes, it caused her body to go from hot to smoldering. She instantly wished they were alone. Maybe when she was once again in his arms, it would flood her mind with her life before the accident. She suddenly wanted to have her memories back more than anything. It seemed she had a very fulfilled life.</p> <p>\u201cHigher,\u201d the kids on the see-saw called to him, impatient with his momentary pause. He jerked his gaze from hers and started playing with them again. Bree realized she\u2019d stopped breathing and took in a fortifying breath of air.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the heat flying between those two?\u201d George asked his brother with a satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the dry grass doesn\u2019t ignite,\u201d Joseph confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI hate that my daughter has been through so much, but I\u2019m sure glad Chad was the one to step into her life. I think another wedding may be in the near future,\u201d George beamed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, brother. You deserve joy in your life. Speaking of which, I think I\u2019ve detected some sparks between you and Esther,\u201d Joseph said with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t you start matchmaking on me. Esther and I are only friends,\u201d George said in a hushed tone as he looked around, making sure no one had overheard them. If his kids even suspected he had feelings for Esther, they\u2019d be all over him. He knew they had their own suspicions about Joseph and him stepping into their children\u2019s lives and matchmaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying...\u201d Joseph trailed off. He watched as George\u2019s eyes sought out Esther every few minutes or so. It looked to him like his brother may have found a second chance of happiness in life. He deserved it. Losing his wife was devastating for him, and Esther was a good woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you be saying anything. And don\u2019t even think about getting any fool idea\u2019s in your head,\u201d George said before he stomped off to speak to someone else. Joseph\u2019s loud laughter followed him across the yard.</p> <p>\u201cMy Dad and Esther, huh? I would\u2019ve never even imagined it,\u201d Austin said to his cousin, Lucas.</p><p>\u201cEavesdropping definitely has its benefits,\u201d Lucas said as he watched his uncle stomp away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mourned for long enough. I think it would be great if he was able to find a slice of happiness again,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cI just think it\u2019s time he gets paid back. I can\u2019t prove it, but I know Dad and Uncle George have been meddling in our lives. They think they\u2019re so slick, but they start crying about grandkids and all of a sudden they have more than a houseful. That seems like more than just a coincidence to me,\u201d Trenton mused.</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m smarter than the rest of you,\u201d Austin answered smugly.</p><p>\u201cSure, Cuz, we\u2019ll see how smart you are,\u201d Trenton laughed. Austin glared at his cousin before walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d Jennifer asked as she came up and wrapped her arms around her husband.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Dad may be falling in love. We think it\u2019s time to do some interfering of our own,\u201d Trenton answered, quickly kissing his wife. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her, no matter how much time he spent at her side.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how the old men have done it, but I know they\u2019ve been meddling in our love lives. Not that I\u2019m complaining \u2013 it led me to you,\u201d Trenton added. He loved his wife and wouldn\u2019t change a thing between them.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you want revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot revenge, my dear - payback,\u201d he said with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d she said before kissing him and heading back to the other women, who made far more sense. Trenton enjoyed watching her as she walked away. The longer he was with her, the more he fell in love. She only grew more beautiful each day.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still standing,\u201d Bree answered. She didn\u2019t think any of them planned on leaving the ranch anytime soon. They\u2019d all been there for several hours and the party was in full bloom. She was tired, but didn\u2019t want to admit her weakness to them. She had a feeling she wasn\u2019t normally one to complain about things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start rounding everyone up. They\u2019re just so excited to have you back home,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she automatically responded. She felt as if she were ungrateful, when everyone had been nothing but kind to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be tired, Bree. You\u2019ve been through a lot. Your brothers have always been protective over you, and the years of lost time when everyone mourned the loss of your mother has made them even more so. Too much time was lost, and now we all want to be reassured that nothing will rip our family apart again,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Bree loved him \u2013 she couldn\u2019t remember him being her father, but he was such a kind and gentle man, and she knew beyond a doubt that she loved her father. She threw her arms around him and clung for several moments. When she pulled back, there were tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dad. I\u2019m sure everything will eventually come back to me, but one thing I know is that I love you. I can feel it in my heart, even if my mind is shut down at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you could ever say to me. I love you, too, Sweetheart. Now, I\u2019m going to get all these testosterone filled men out of here so you can get off your feet and rest. You are growing my beautiful grandchild, after all.\u201d</p><p>Bree laughed as she let him take her arm and lead her to the porch. She thought a nap sounded pretty heavenly right then, though. She was passed around once again as everyone said goodbye. The little kids all needed a hug and kiss from her, and she once again felt that warm glow in her heart as she held them tightly against her chest. She obviously loved this big chaotic family. Memory or not, she felt at home \u2013 at ease with her world.</p><p>She stood next to Chad as they waved goodbye to the last departing family members.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, Bree. When your family makes up their minds, there\u2019s no stopping them. That\u2019s one of the things I love about them most,\u201d Chad told her as he led her inside. Bree collapsed in the comfortable chair, feeling like her eye lids weighed fifty tons.</p><p>\u201cI loved it. They\u2019re a bit overwhelming, but it\u2019s obvious they love me. I think my memory will come back. I have a good feeling about it...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>Her words sent an arrow of panic through Chad. When she realized he\u2019d lied to her, she was going to be furious. He would just make sure she fell in love with him before that happened so she wouldn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I need to go tend the animals,\u201d he said, sounding short as he strode out the door. He tried to ignore the startled look in her eyes, and the flash of hurt his words caused. He mucked the horse stalls until his muscles were screaming and sweat dripped from his brow. He pushed himself hard, hoping by the time he went inside, he\u2019d be able to fall face first into bed and pass out.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. After a hot shower, he crawled into bed, where he laid for hours, his mind filled with thoughts of Bree, and wishing she were lying next to him. He would\u2019ve most likely caved and went to her, had she not been sleeping so soundly.</p><p>She wanted her own room until she felt more comfortable in their relationship. She\u2019d laughed about it, patting her stomach, but she said it felt wrong for them to sleep together when he was too much like a stranger still. Though he may not survive it, he hadn\u2019t argued with her. But he didn\u2019t think he was going to get any rest with her sleeping only a few short feet away.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Chad took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. He wanted to marry her, and preferably before she got her memory back. She carried his child \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t let the baby be raised without a father. He\u2019d be there to always protect them both.</p><p>Bree was sitting in the kitchen when he came around the corner. She gave him a tentative smile, unsure of why he\u2019d stormed away from her the night before.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married now,\u201d he blurted, then wished he could take back his words when her eyes widened and she sat with a stunned look on her face. He should have gently approached the subject. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could see a myriad of thoughts running through her mind. He knew she thought he was probably insane. Hot, then cold. She wouldn\u2019t know what to think.</p><p>\u201cDid we discuss marriage before the accident?\u201d she asked, not taking her eyes from his. He could lie but he wouldn\u2019t go that far.</p><p>\u201cNo, but things were good between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a marriage of convenience. I know, I don\u2019t know how, but I know I can only marry for love. I can barely comprehend being pregnant, and I wish I had my memory back, but I\u2019m not going to marry you just because we slept together. Every time I ask you about the past, you hedge around it. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor said not to force anything on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cop-out and you know it,\u201d she replied, getting irritated with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWould you have asked me to marry you if I wasn\u2019t pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Chad stood there like a deer caught in headlights. All he needed to say was \u2018yes\u2019 but he knew it was a lie. Maybe eventually he would\u2019ve asked her, he tried to reason with himself. But he\u2019d always vowed never to get married. Having a baby changed things, though. They needed to put the needs of their child\u2019s welfare ahead of themselves. She should understand that.</p> <p>\u201cThat question doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I think it\u2019s completely relevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to raise my child. Does that make me a bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be active in your child\u2019s life without marrying me. I don\u2019t even know you, not really. Maybe I\u2019ll feel differently once my memories come back, but you\u2019re not helping matters by acting like a Neanderthal,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my responsibility. I don\u2019t shirk on what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now I\u2019m nothing more than a responsibility. One more daily chore for you to take care of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re twisting my words,\u201d he huffed in frustration. Chad moved around the room, running his fingers through his hair, trying to figure out how to get through to her. Why did she have to be so stubborn?</p><p>He walked to the fridge and started pulling items out. He had to do something with his hands or he feared he may place them around her small neck and strangle her. He smirked at himself. He would never, in a million years, hurt a woman. He wanted to kill the men who\u2019d dare to harm her. Until they were caught, she was still in danger. If she\u2019d just agree to marry him, he could protect her and the baby. Even with amnesia, she was pure Anderson, stubborn, even to the point of self-sacrifice.</p><p>Chad tossed a sandwich in front of her, then sat at the table and took a large bite of his sandwich. He was angry \u2013 and she was frustrated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just go and stay with my father. I think he\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just tell me no. I\u2019m an adult, in case you haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said with a glare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here,\u201d he commanded. He was really ticking her off.</p><p>\u201cYou insufferable pig. Don\u2019t you dare try to tell me what to do!\u201d she snapped, standing up so fast her chair went flying behind her.</p> <p>Chad jumped from his seat at the same time. He was furious with himself \u2013 the stalker \u2013 the situation \u2013 just about everything. He tried to calm himself down \u2013 remember she\u2019d only been home one day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the barn,\u201d he said, turning to leave. He was proud of the restraint he was able to use. His passion always flared whenever he was in the same room with her, hell, within the same county.</p><p>\u201cAfraid of a girl? Or is it that you just can\u2019t handle it when a female doesn\u2019t fall all over herself trying to please you. I bet you\u2019re used to men, women, and children bowing all over themselves to do your bidding,\u201d she said, then turned to make what she hoped was a dramatic exit. Men!</p><p>Chad sent her a smoldering look that was wasted on her retreating back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Does Princess Bree not like someone disagreeing with her? You have it all backwards, Honey. I think you\u2019re the one who\u2019s so used to getting her own way, she can\u2019t handle it when she doesn\u2019t get the last word in, or win the argument.\u201d</p><p>Bree had never in her life wanted to punch someone, but she felt her fists curling as she fought the urge to walk back and slug him in his smug mouth. He was calling her a princess. She looked around his impressive home with a derisive laugh. Sure, she\u2019d learned she came from money, but he didn\u2019t look to be hurting, himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It doesn\u2019t look as if you like that. Would you like for me to get on one knee and beg for forgiveness?\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat works just fine for me,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she answered and took a single step before he grabbed her arm and whipped her around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what it is you do to me, but I can\u2019t resist you \u2013 not even for your own good,\u201d he growled before grabbing a handful of her hair and pulling her against his body. His head dropped and his mouth connected with the sweet heaven of her lips.</p><p>Bree\u2019s eyes widened as anger turned into full-blown passion, but her body knew what she wanted, and she quickly clutched at his shirt, opened her mouth, and held on for dear life.</p><p>Bree instantly melted as he seduced her with his hands and mouth. The man could literally kiss the sense right out of her. She didn\u2019t care that they hadn\u2019t solved anything. She was hungry for him, and only he could feed her desire.</p><p>His body felt like steel underneath her hands. She wanted to feel skin against skin. Her nipples were painfully hard as they pressed into the lace of her bra. She needed it gone \u2013 there were too many clothes in her way.</p><p>She moved her hands to his shirt and tugged at the material, wanting to run her fingers along the contours of his masculine chest \u2013 down the washboard that was his stomach, and lower to his hardness, currently pressing tightly into her stomach.</p><p>Chad took the hint and moved an inch back so he could rip his shirt off, then in the next second stripped hers and tossed it somewhere behind them. His hands moved back to her hair, tugging her close, causing her to cry out in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMore \u2013 I need more,\u201d she cried as his hands moved to her neck, then lower to unclasp her bra. She breathed a sigh of relief when the cool evening air hit her aching nipples, then gasped in ecstasy as his mouth surrounded the tight pink bud of one, then the other. It felt so good, it was almost painful.</p><p>His teeth clamped down on her sensitive bud, making her back arch, and a guttural groan escape her dry throat. He swept his tongue along the well-loved skin, then moved back up the smooth column of her throat and she greedily bit down on his lip. He groaned and she felt her body heat rise to another level.</p><p>Chad stripped her pants and panties in one smooth motion, then lifted her up on the counter without breaking their mouths apart. She rubbed her nipples against his solid chest, trying to relieve the aching. It only stoked the flames higher.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she commanded him. She needed their bodies connected \u2013 she had to feel him inside her, or she\u2019d die of sexual frustration.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait anymore,\u201d Chad groaned as he parted her thighs, stepping between them. Bree barely caught a glimpse of his impressive manhood before his head was pushing against her tight entrance.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she called as he pushed slightly inside her. He stalled and she raked her fingers down his back to his firm butt and pulled him closer. With a groan, he finally pushed inside her, and Bree saw lights going off behind her closed eyelids.</p><p>So full \u2013 so very full.</p><p>She felt complete as he filled every inch of her, stretching her in the very best way. She thought she couldn\u2019t possibly feel any better than she did in that moment \u2013 until he began moving.</p><p>Chad began thrusting in and out of her, slow at first, but quickly increasing his speed. Bree could do nothing but hold on tight as their bodies slid together, building up pressure, until finally she exploded in a fusion of light. She shook around him as he pumped inside her a few more times, before his body locked tightly against her and he quivered underneath her touch.</p><p>His hot breath skimmed across her neck as he leaned into her, shudders consuming him. She ran her fingers down his spine, his skin hot to the touch. He gently nipped her shoulder, then brushed his tongue across the point, alleviating any pinch. She didn\u2019t want to let go. She felt more emotion locked in his arms, than she had since waking from her coma. She didn\u2019t want to let the feeling go.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter than okay. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to move for at least a month,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d he said lazily as he picked her up, their bodies still one, and carried her to his room. She tensed as she looked at his huge bed, wondering if it was too intimate of a step for her to climb in with him.</p><p>As her body tensed, she gripped his manhood, still hard within her, and caused another groan to escape him.</p><p>\u201cNo other woman has ever done this to me,\u201d he groaned as his body lit on fire once more. He laid them on the bed together with her locked tightly in his arms and started moving inside her still quivering body.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to feel the pressure building back up, and soon all her worries were forgotten, at least for a little while.</p><p>Bree gulped down large sips of icy cold water. She finished one glass, then quickly polished off another. As she stood by the sink hydrating her body, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>She\u2019d spent an entire day in bed with Chad, making love over and over again. She was surprised and delighted at how well he knew her body, inside and out. Between making love, she\u2019d managed to catch a little sleep, but hadn\u2019t minded when he woke her, only to send her flying again.</p><p>He was an incredible lover, and she had to fight not to shout out, yes, oh, yes, I\u2019ll marry you, anytime. Lust and love weren\u2019t the same thing.</p><p>She ran her hand over her stomach and smiled. It was obvious they had no problem in the bedroom, but she didn\u2019t know how well they could do outside of it. He\u2019d remained by her side the entire time she\u2019d been in the hospital so that meant something, but still...</p><p>Bree turned off the water and stood for a moment, unsure what she should do. Chad was in the shower and they hadn\u2019t discussed if she was spending the night in his room. She would assume he wanted her there, considering they hadn\u2019t been able to tear themselves away from each other all day, but what if he wanted her to go to her own room now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being stupid,\u201d she muttered out loud, then jumped at the sound of her own voice, causing her to giggle.</p><p>She heard the shower turn off and decided to stay where she was. She wanted to go to his bed, but at the same time, she wanted him to seek her out. There was nothing wrong with maintaining her pride, even if she\u2019d let go of every ounce of self-control that day, already.</p><p>She looked out the window and noticed movement in the backyard. She didn\u2019t really think anything of it since the ranch was surrounded by animals. It most likely was one of his dogs, or maybe even a large raccoon. But something just seemed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The full moon illuminated the area and the barn light was casting eerie shadows across the ground. A shiver ran down her spine and she leaned in closer to the window. Once she assured herself it was nothing more than an animal she\u2019d rest easier.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see anything further, so decided she\u2019d just made a mountain out of a mole hill. It had to have been a shadow. The wind was whipping through the area. It was most likely a branch blowing. She was about to turn when another movement caught her eye. Something was giving her the creeps enough that she couldn\u2019t turn her eyes away from the spot.</p><p>She pressed closer to the cold glass, goosebumps appearing on her skin. Something was out there. An animal \u2013 it had to be an animal. She was ready to go to the back door so she could get a better look, when a cloud moved and she got a clearer vision of the backyard.</p><p>It was a person.</p> <p>Someone was standing near the barn \u2013 looking right through the window at her. Bree made eye contact and felt a shudder ripple through her. She was so shocked; she stood motionless for several moments \u2013 until he took a menacing step in her direction.</p><p>She opened her mouth and screamed.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Chad was putting the towel around his waist when he heard Bree\u2019s cry. He immediately jumped into action, instinct taking over.</p><p>He grabbed his gun without stopping as he ran from the room and raced around the corner, leading him into the kitchen where he found Bree staring out the window, her body shaking.</p> <p>\u201cA man \u2013 there\u2019s a man out there, and he\u2019s staring at me,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cGet down, now!\u201d Chad commanded. The authority in his voice overrode the fear coursing through her and she dropped to the kitchen floor.</p><p>Chad hit the light switch over the stove, dropping the kitchen into darkness, making it easier for him to see outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bree whispered as she spotted the large gun Chad was carrying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he responded, but he could see she didn\u2019t believe him. She stayed silent, though as he slowly popped up and glanced out the window.</p><p>\u201cIt may be nothing, but I swear he was looking right at me,\u201d she whispered, her voice thick with fear.</p> <p>\u201cBree, I need you to crawl into the hallway. There are too many windows here and if this is a robber and he shoots, I don\u2019t want you getting hit by the glass,\u201d Chad once again commanded. He watched as Bree did as he asked.</p><p>Then, he went to the counter and picked up his phone.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, now,\u201d he said into the device before quickly hanging up. She didn\u2019t know who he\u2019d called, but obviously they didn\u2019t need more explanation than that.</p><p>Bree watched wide-eyed as Chad slowly popped up and looked out the window. He kept his body to the side, with only a portion of his head in the window while he searched the yard.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver by the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it was a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I locked eyes with him. It was definitely a man,\u201d she said with confidence.</p> <p>\u201cHe may have moved closer to the house, or your scream might have scared him away. I\u2019m still not taking any chances. Go into the bathroom and lock the door. I don\u2019t care what you hear; do not open that door. Underneath the vanity, feel around, there\u2019s a secret door, and inside you\u2019ll find a gun. Take it out. If anyone comes through that door, shoot first, ask questions later. I won\u2019t come in without knocking and letting you know it\u2019s me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Secret gun compartments? Crazy stalkers? What is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time right now, please, just do what I asked,\u201d he commanded. Bree scooted away to the end of the hall and waited on the other side. She wasn\u2019t quite ready to head to the bathroom.</p><p>She poked her head around and watched as Chad flipped on the back porch light and looked through the window. She saw him staring out it, looking in every direction. He moved to the back door and looked through that as well. It didn\u2019t seem real, with him standing there in nothing but a towel, holding a deadly looking black gun in his hand, with all the lights off inside.</p><p>Then the first shot rang out, seeming to echo through the house. The kitchen window shattered and Bree felt her face drain of any color that might have been left. She decided it was time to listen, and scrambled to the bathroom, shutting and locking the door.</p><p>There was a night light casting shadows in the large room. Though there were no windows in it, she still crawled to the vanity, where she felt around for the secret compartment Chad spoke about.</p><p>It took her several minutes, but finally she found the latch and opened the small door, reached her hand inside and came out with the gun he spoke of. Her fingers shook as she took the weapon in her hand, then crawled over to the back wall and sat there huddled.</p><p>Please don\u2019t have to use this, please don\u2019t have to use this, she repeated over and over in her head. What if she fired it and hit Chad? What if she hit her own leg? She wasn\u2019t used to weapons and didn\u2019t know the first thing about how to fire a gun. She just hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to have her first lesson on a real live person.</p><p>Chad waited to hear the click from the bathroom door before he moved forward again. He didn\u2019t know where the guy was \u2013 didn\u2019t even know if he was alone, or he had help. All he knew was that he wasn\u2019t going to let them near Bree again, not while he was still alive.</p><p>He glanced back out and caught a flash of light glinting off metal. It was an instant red flag and he quickly dropped to the ground as the gunshot rang out and slammed through the kitchen window.</p><p>He covered his head as the window shattered to his left, littering the kitchen floor with shards of glass. He kept his ears tuned toward the back of the house, making sure the door didn\u2019t open. Bree needed to stay out of there. He could hold them off, but he needed to know she was safe.</p><p>He crawled back from the door, wishing he would\u2019ve put on some pants after his shower. He felt too vulnerable in nothing but a small swatch of cotton.</p><p>The next shot rang out and hit the stone columns on his porch. He knew he just had to wait them out. He wanted to rush into the yard, take down the bastards daring to shoot at his home, but he couldn\u2019t leave Bree. That was probably what they were hoping for.</p><p>Chad moved to the hallway as more bullets besieged the house. He listened for several moments, noticing a pattern to the shots. They were ringing out exactly two minutes apart. He waited, counting, and sure enough, the next shot came right on time.</p><p>As soon as the shot went off, he moved back toward the window and peaked into his yard. He saw the glint of metal from the trees near his barn. There was a slight movement, then exactly two minutes later, another shot rang out. Holy Hell! It wasn\u2019t a person firing. They had some sort of device set up. He needed to get to Bree.</p><p>He heard glass shattering in one of the back bedrooms and he immediately ran for that area. The gun was nothing but a diversion to keep him busy. The stalker was coming after her.</p><p>Chad\u2019s body tensed as he made his way down the hall, looking through each open doorway, before quickly passing by them. He reached the room he\u2019d heard the glass breaking and looked inside. A man wearing a full black mask was looking right at him through the open window. Chad lifted his gun and fired a shot but the man ducked out of the way at the last minute.</p><p>He never popped back up and Chad was torn between chasing after him and ending the hunt for Bree, or staying in the house to keep her safe. If the guy had a partner and Chad left the house he\u2019d never forgive himself.</p><p>\u201cChad, it\u2019s me,\u201d Mark called out as he rushed in through the front door, not even considering his own safety.</p><p>\u201cBack here,\u201d Chad called, and he heard Mark\u2019s footsteps echoing down the hallway as he ran through the dark house.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Mark demanded, his own weapon drawn.</p><p>\u201cI just fired at him through the window. Bree\u2019s in the bathroom, watch her, I\u2019m going after this guy,\u201d Chad said as he stepped forward to jump through the window. Mark grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cThe guys are on their way, along with the sheriff. Get some pants on and guard Bree. I\u2019ll go after him,\u201d Mark said before rushing toward the window.</p><p>Chad wanted to argue, but Mark was right. He needed to get some clothes on. He was too vulnerable in nothing but a towel.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grimaced as Mark jumped out the window.</p><p>Chad quickly moved into action and rushed to his room, where he threw on his pants, a pair of shoes and gun holster in less than twenty seconds. He didn\u2019t bother with a shirt, there was no time. He quickly rushed back to the window Mark had jumped out, and didn\u2019t see anything. He wanted to chase after him, but he wouldn\u2019t leave Bree.</p><p>\u201cChad,\u201d Trenton called. Chad changed directions and ran toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d he answered so they\u2019d know it was him. \u201cBree\u2019s in the bathroom. Knock and tell her who you are before opening the door. I told her to shoot first if anyone tried to enter,\u201d Chad warned as he rushed past Trenton and out the front door.</p><p>He stayed low to the ground as a shot rang out near his barn. He needed to get out there. He skirted the barn and came up behind the trees, looking in every direction, making sure he wasn\u2019t headed into an ambush.</p><p>Just as another shot rang out, he rounded the back of the barn and spotted the contraption firing at his house. Chad was filled with rage as he approached the rotating gun. He quickly disarmed it, trying to be careful not to touch too many areas, just in case they were able to pull prints from the weapon. He had a feeling the stalker was smart enough not to leave prints, though.</p><p>\u201cChad, get over here,\u201d Mark hollered.</p><p>Chad turned toward the sound of Mark\u2019s voice and jogged to the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill someone,\u201d Mark replied. Chad was surprised by his words. Mark was normally the mellowest guy he knew, though Chad knew his best friend could certainly be counted on. He was afraid to know what it was that had gotten him so riled up.</p><p>\u201cThey left this.\u201d</p><p>Chad turned to see a bloody doll on his front steps with a sign attached to it.</p><p>We got her once, we\u2019ll get her again.</p><p>\u201cWho are these people,\u201d Chad shouted. He quickly calmed himself down. He had to stay strong, he couldn\u2019t afford to lose his composure.</p><p>Bree sat shivering in the bathroom. She heard the men shouting in the hallway. Trenton was there, along with Mark. She didn\u2019t know who else. She couldn\u2019t make herself move, though. She still clutched the gun in her hand, pointing it toward the door. Fear of any small movement would make her fire the dang thing, but she couldn\u2019t force her arms to lower the weapon.</p><p>She listened as footsteps ran up and down the hall, doors slammed, and voices shouted. What was going on? Who would want to harm them? Chad hadn\u2019t seemed surprised, confusing her even more. Why wouldn\u2019t he tell her if something was going on? Would he really be so stupid as to think she couldn\u2019t handle the information?</p><p>Considering she didn\u2019t really know what she could handle or not handle, maybe he was right not to tell her. The thoughts just kept running over themselves through her mind, leaving her in a constant state of terror as she waited for Chad to come back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The worst part was the image of that man staring at her. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever get the picture of those deadly looking eyes from her mind. The moment had seemed to stretch on forever, their eyes locked together. A shiver ran down her spine.</p><p>Bree shut her eyes and shook her head, trying to dispel the man from her mind. Chad wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her. She knew that \u2013 she somehow had complete faith in the man \u2013 faith that he\u2019d never let harm come to her \u2013 not if he could help it.</p><p>Finally, the shots stopped firing. She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been counting them until the midnight silence. Ten shots \u2013 ten agonizing booms in the night. Each time the gun fired, she\u2019d clenched, praying one of those deadly bullets didn\u2019t hit Chad.</p><p>The silence was almost worse than the exploding sound of bullets. She at least knew something was happening, could pinpoint where the danger was when there were shots fired. In the silence, she strained her ears, trying to pick up any sound.</p> <p>What were they doing?</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t anyone coming to reassure her?</p><p>Were they dead?</p><p>She was terrified and hanging on by only a very short thread. She didn\u2019t care what Chad had told her to do. If someone didn\u2019t come soon, she was leaving the bathroom. She\u2019d rather face the masked man than sit in the dark, not knowing, weak with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cBree, it\u2019s me, Trenton. I\u2019m going to open the bathroom door now. You can put down the gun, okay?\u201d</p> <p>It took a couple of seconds for the words to process in her head. She stared at the doorknob as it slowly started to turn. Her arms never moved - the gun still aimed straight for whoever came through the opening.</p><p>\u201cBree, can you answer me. I\u2019d prefer not to get shot,\u201d Trenton said with a nervous chuckle.</p><p>The door opened and he looked around the side of the door. She met his eyes; hers rounded in shock, the gun aimed toward him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to put the gun down, Bree? It\u2019s over. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t say a word, just looked at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cListen, sis, you\u2019re in shock. I need you to lower the gun. You don\u2019t even have to let go of it, just lower it. Then I\u2019ll come in and help you, okay?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t make herself move. She told herself to do what he asked, but she couldn\u2019t make her muscles listen to her mind.</p><p>\u201cChad,\u201d Trenton called. He wasn\u2019t afraid of getting shot, but he didn\u2019t want Bree traumatized any more than she already was. She obviously wasn\u2019t coping, and if she did shoot at him, or actually hit him, she\u2019d be filled with regret and sorrow.</p><p>Chad quickly came running through the house, arriving at the door and looking inside. Bree\u2019s eyes seemed to clear a fraction when she saw Chad standing there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019m going to come in now, and I\u2019d really appreciate it if you didn\u2019t shoot me,\u201d Chad said as if he were talking to a child. He slowly stepped into the bathroom and started walking to her. He stayed close to the wall, trying to keep out of range of the weapon, just in case her finger twitched and she accidentally shot it.</p><p>Upon reaching her, he quickly sat down. She turned her head and made eye contact with him, her body beginning to tremble in earnest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take the gun now, okay?\u201d he asked, reaching up and gently releasing her fingers from the weapon, sliding the gun across the floor to Trenton, who stood back and watched.</p><p>As soon as the weapon was taken away, her arms dropped and tears poured from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re all okay,\u201d Chad reassured her as he pulled her onto his lap and started rocking her. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, Bree. Your family is here, there\u2019s no sign of the shooter.\u201d</p> <p>She fell against him as the shock turned into fear and she rocked in his arms. Her own arms wound around his neck and he continued to rock her, running his fingers through her hair, giving her time to cry out her fear and confusion.</p><p>Finally, Chad stood with her cradled in his arms and walked from the bathroom. Trenton had turned on the house lights, casting the eerie shadows away. Chad went straight to his room, where he gently laid her on his bed, continually whispering soothing words in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure the area is secure,\u201d Trenton said. It was obvious Chad couldn\u2019t leave Bree right then. \u201cThe doctor is on his way.\u201d</p><p>The doctor showed up within a half hour and gave Bree a sleeping aid. Chad held her in his arms until the medicine did its job and she fell asleep. He let Trenton and Mark lock up the place, neither of them would leave. They\u2019d make sure the house was safe while he made sure Bree was alright. He didn\u2019t want her to wake alone \u2013 not after the night she\u2019d had.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Bree woke up and stretched, a smile playing on her lips, as for one moment she blissfully forgot about the night before. She stretched her arms out and came into contact with solid muscles. She slowly turned her head and found herself staring into the piercing blue eyes of Chad.</p><p>She blinked, momentarily disoriented by the mesmerizing quality of his baby blues with thick black lashes. But as she leaned forward, the night\u2019s events came flooding back and her body tensed. How could she have forgotten, even for a moment?</p><p>Chad didn\u2019t say anything as she sat up. Bree slipped from the bed and padded over to the bathroom, quietly shutting the door behind her. She leaned her head against it, taking a few deep breaths.</p><p>She just needed a hot shower and a few minutes alone to put her thoughts in order. She nearly laughed at that idea, considering she\u2019d love to have a slate of memories, instead of just the few new ones she\u2019d obtained since waking in the hospital.</p><p>She climbed under the pulsing shower spray and it felt as if the water washed her worries down the drain. It was almost ironic how a nice shower could cleanse her mind and body. She stayed in long enough that she knew Chad would be getting worried, but she couldn\u2019t seem to drag herself out.</p><p>When she eventually climbed out and brushed her teeth in the steam filled room, she was grateful the mirror was fogged and she didn\u2019t have to look at her reflection. She was sure her face was gaunt, with dark circles underneath her eyes. It was a good thing Chad was too much of a gentleman to say anything about it.</p><p>Bree stepped out the door and found Chad lying in the same spot she\u2019d left him. He watched her enter the room in his oversized robe she\u2019d found hanging on the back of the door. She felt her spirits lift from the way his eyes narrowed in desire. It made her feel like a wanton woman instead of just a victim.</p><p>She walked toward the bed, her heart accelerating the closer she got to him. She wanted his hands all over her. She wanted answers about the night before, but her body needed him more. They could always talk later \u2013 hopefully, much later.</p><p>She leaned down - noticing his eyes never left her. They explored the opening of the robe, where only a hint of cleavage showed, then moved down to catch glimpses of her legs as they peaked out from the bottom of the oversized garment, exploring every inch of her.</p><p>He suddenly moved, causing her to tumble down on top of him. He didn\u2019t hesitate in kissing her. He was rough with urgency as he worked his fingers into her wet strands of hair, using it to pull her closer.</p><p>He quickly twisted their bodies so he was on top of her \u2013 trapping her beneath his solid mass of muscles as he continued to ravage her mouth. She reached up and gripped his shoulders, her nails digging into his flesh, overwhelmed by the desire consuming her.</p><p>There was an urgency in their lovemaking, as if they both felt they wouldn\u2019t survive if they couldn\u2019t join together. It felt dangerous, hot and explosive \u2013 and she wanted more.</p><p>She moved her hands down his back, scraping along his flesh as she reached for his bare ass. She gripped him, pulling him into the heat of her thighs as she pushed against him.</p><p>He moved back a few inches to tear open the robe so they could touch \u2013 flesh to flesh. His pulsing erection was cradled at the heart of her, but not penetrating. She jerked her hips, hoping he\u2019d take the hint and bury himself deep inside her more than ready body.</p><p>Still, he only rocked his hips, sliding his solid flesh along the outside of her aching core. He brushed against her, causing her to cry out in both pain and pleasure.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she demanded as she pulled her lips from his. He gave her a wicked smile and gave the slightest nod of his head, denying her.</p><p>Bree glared at him, her body on fire, needing completion. His touch was making her crazy.</p><p>She bent her head to his shoulder and nipped his skin, making him lean back and smile again. He thought he had all the power, but after a full day of lovemaking, she knew how to bring him to his knees.</p><p>She ran her tongue along his throat, before moving down his neck, causing him to arch up as he enjoyed the sensation of her exploring mouth. She circled his chest and took his nipple into her mouth and gently bit down, causing his stomach to shake.</p><p>When he was putty in her hands, she easily pushed him over to his back, then didn\u2019t waste any time climbing on his upper thighs. She looked down into his lust filled eyes before she bent and kissed him again. Her lips ached to taste him while mating their tongues together.</p><p>He placed his hands on her hips, pulling her to him, trying to rub his manhood against her heat.</p><p>Finally!</p><p>She sat up, moving her hips forward so his swollen head was at her opening. Slowly, never taking her eyes from his, she slid down his hard staff, nearly exploding as he filled her up.</p><p>Chad\u2019s entire body tensed as she settled fully on him, her slick heat making it easy for them to slide together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most stunning woman I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said with a groan as his eyes traveled down her throat, breasts and smooth stomach. She beamed at him before rising up, then quickly falling back down, loving every inch of him moving inside of her.</p><p>Bree leaned forward as Chad raised his hands to cup her breasts. They bounced against his hands as she picked up her pace, moving steadily up and down his throbbing rod.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed when he pulled on her so he could take her nipple into his mouth. He teased the swollen peak mercilessly before he moved on to the other one. She rode him faster and faster as he loved on her breasts.</p><p>She sat up, the sensation almost becoming too much to bear. She leaned her hands on his legs behind her, giving her more leverage and picked up her pace once more. She was so close, she needed to feel the explosion she knew was coming.</p><p>Chad reached his hand forward and flicked his fingers over her sensitive skin, sending her over the edge in a whirlwind of pleasure.</p><p>She sank against his thighs as she clenched around him over and over again. She couldn\u2019t even open her eyes the pleasure and exhaustion was so consuming.</p><p>Chad suddenly flipped them over so she was beneath him, his body still fully inside her. He grabbed her leg, pulling it up high and started thrusting in and out of her. Too much, she wanted to cry as her orgasm intensified to the point her entire body felt on fire.</p><p>He pushed hard into her, reaching deeper than she thought possible, and the fireworks exploded again before her first orgasm even finished. She yelled out as her body shook with pleasure, every inch of her skin tingling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she pled.</p><p>He seemed to know just what she needed and moved off her, his own breath coming out in pants. They lay side by side as their breathing slowed and their bodies finally quit quivering. \u201cI think I may have just lost a few years off my life,\u201d Chad said with a chuckle. Bree smiled, she knew how he felt.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t open my eyes,\u201d she murmured, feeling better than anyone should possibly be allowed to feel.</p><p>Chad pulled her close and she fell asleep within seconds.</p> <p>When Bree woke again, Chad was next to the bed putting on pants. She sleepily got to her feet and put the discarded robe on. Her mind cleared quickly, and since her body was temporarily sated, her worries came back to the forefront.</p><p>She tilted her head and pointed toward the kitchen, then left the room. She\u2019d get dressed later. She felt light headed and wanted nothing more than a hot cup of coffee. She\u2019d even try eating a bagel or muffin. She knew her stomach needed something in it other than acid.</p><p>Bree walked to the coffee pot and started it brewing, then sat at the table. Chad entered the room behind her, grabbing a package from the cupboard and joining her at the table. He looked amazing in the morning with stubble dotting his chin, and low riding pajama bottoms. She didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her, but she wanted to crawl into his lap for round two and forget everything but the pleasure he brought her.</p><p>\u201cHere, eat this,\u201d Chad told her as he placed a pastry in front of her. She pushed it back, the sugary donut turning her stomach. \u201cYou have to eat. You\u2019ve already lost too much weight,\u201d he insisted as he pushed it back to her. She glared at him for a moment, but he didn\u2019t back down, so she finally took it.</p><p>Bree broke off a piece and placed it in her mouth, surprised by the burst of flavor on her tongue. Maybe she was hungry. After all, she\u2019d had quite the intense workout a short time ago. She took another tentative bite, then polished off the donut in under a minute. Chad slid another one in front of her and she started picking at it, nibbling small bites. She missed the knowing grin on his face.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get any information last night? Who they were? What they wanted? Did the sheriff tell you anything?\u201d Bree threw questions at Chad, no longer able to hold it in. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t treat her like a child. She needed to know.</p><p>She watched as he took a deep breath, like he was fighting with himself, before he finally let it out and looked her deep in the eyes. She felt almost giddy as she realized he was going to tell her something real \u2013 not try to protect her fragile feelings like her brothers kept doing.</p><p>As Bree sat there, she had a small memory of racing down the road with her hand in the air. She\u2019d been running away... She lost the thought and frowned in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chad asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cI remembered something, but...\u201d she started to say, still concentrating.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing huge, dang it. Just that my brothers are over-protective. I was trying to get away from them \u2013 trying to prove I could make it on my own. Is that how I ended up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d he answered vaguely, which made her want to throw the rest of her donut at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone now, what were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff came up empty last night. Whoever was out there was long gone by the time we got a proper search formed. They were smart. Are you sure you\u2019re up for the whole story, Bree? I think it would be better for you not to know,\u201d he hedged. She had to push down her temper. She didn\u2019t want kid gloves \u2013 she wanted the truth.</p><p>\u201cI can handle it,\u201d she said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cFine. You have a stalker. He\u2019s been after you for months. He\u2019s the reason you were in the hospital, and apparently he hasn\u2019t given up, as last night proves. We have no leads on who it is, or how he\u2019s getting his information. He shouldn\u2019t have had any way of knowing you were here last night, but he did,\u201d Chad said, short and to the point.</p><p>\u201cM... maybe he followed us,\u201d Bree stuttered. She was trying to act like his words weren\u2019t affecting her, but it was a lot to take in. Someone wanted to kill her. Why?</p><p>\u201cI guess it would help if I could remember my past,\u201d she finally said.</p> <p>\u201cNot really. We didn\u2019t know anything before you were shot. You racked your brain trying to figure out who it could be. We\u2019ve done background checks on ex-boyfriends, old friends, people you\u2019ve come in contact with. They\u2019ve all had alibis for the times when events have taken place. We\u2019ve come up with nothing but dead ends,\u201d he trailed off in frustration.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he followed us from the hospital,\u201d she said, trying to keep the fear from her voice. She\u2019d asked him to be honest with her; she didn\u2019t want him to regret that decision.</p><p>\u201cI was watching for that, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>Bree sat back and thought about it. She wished she could just wake up and everything would be right with her world. Had she led some kind of double life her family knew nothing about? Was she really a double agent with top secret information? Really, she didn\u2019t know who she was. For all she knew, she could be a horrible person who deserved to be hunted like an animal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I can see the wheels turning in your head. Whoever this creep is, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about him. You\u2019ve done nothing to deserve this,\u201d Chad assured her. She didn\u2019t know if she believed him.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t stay here. It seems he\u2019s determined to get to me, and anyone who\u2019s in his way could get hurt,\u201d she said, trying to sound reasonable.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly believe I\u2019d let you deal with this on your own. Even if you weren\u2019t carrying my child, I wouldn\u2019t let you leave my side. I will keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it feels like we\u2019ve had a discussion like this before,\u201d she said with a smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cMy motto is to serve and protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do we just hide out like victims, or can we have some kind of a life while we wait for the other shoe to drop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been one to hide. We\u2019ll up security, make sure guards are on duty twenty-four-seven, and we\u2019ll live somewhat normally. I don\u2019t want you going anywhere alone, though \u2013 not even to the backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be treated like a child. I can agree to security, but you\u2019re being absurd,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cI love when you get all riled up,\u201d he said as he slowly stood up.</p><p>Bree wasn\u2019t in the mood for games, but she could see he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you, Chad,\u201d she said, but she slowly rose from the table and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me. You\u2019re mad at me a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should change the way you act,\u201d she said as she skirted the table. He slowly followed her, making her heart speed up.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had too many complaints about the way I act, certainly not earlier this morning,\u201d he answered as he made a quick veer to the right. She dodged him and kept him at a safe distance \u2013 or so she thought.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings,\u201d she said, but couldn\u2019t keep the laughter from spilling out as he almost slipped on the smooth tile.</p><p>\u201cYou also moan a lot when you\u2019re underneath me,\u201d he said. She noticed his pants expanding. Their bantering was turning him on. It sent an arrow of desire straight through her. She didn\u2019t know how she could possibly want him again after being so fully satisfied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very gentlemanly like to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed to be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally you say something that makes sense,\u201d she laughed. He lunged again, but she managed to avoid him. She knew he was toying with her. If he really wanted to catch her, she\u2019d be on the ground in moments. Him allowing her to think she held some kind of power was exhilarating, though. She knew how she wanted their game to end.</p><p>Chad looked her in the eye and lifted his hand to the waistband of his flannel pants. Her breathing thickened as she waited. His body was sinful in its perfection. Her eyes stayed glued to his large fingers as they slipped under the elastic.</p><p>She practically drooled when they dropped to the floor and he stood before her with nothing on. She could feel the saliva building in her mouth. She wanted to taste him, run her tongue along his washboard abs, straight down to his manhood, and slip his head deep into her mouth.</p><p>She gave up on the game of chase and took a step toward him, her eyes finally lifting to his eyes, which were narrowed in desire. The depths of his blue eyes were darkened to the color of a stormy ocean.</p><p>At that moment she held all the power \u2013 and yet none at all. He could bring her to her knees, but knowing she could do the same to him, made her able to stand.</p><p>Bree\u2019s trouble with stalkers, memory loss, and bullets flying all faded. She forgot about everything but the deep need inside her stomach \u2013 the burning sensation invading her body.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he commanded as he stepped toward her.</p><p>It rang over and over.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have an answering machine?\u201d she asked with frustration.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think I needed one. I\u2019m regretting that now,\u201d he said as it continued to ring. Their caller was persistent.</p><p>Chad finally stomped over to the phone and practically ripped it from the wall.</p><p>\u201cThis better be damn important,\u201d he yelled into the phone.</p><p>He paused as he listened, and Bree watched in frustration as he answered in one syllable clips. Within a minute, he was grabbing his pants and sliding them back on. She nearly screamed in sexual frustration.</p><p>Obviously the call was important. He\u2019d quickly forgotten about their game.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d he finally said, then hung up the phone.</p><p>He turned to her and she knew she wasn\u2019t going to get her needs met. It was obvious from the anger on his face.</p><p>\u201cThat was your brother. There was a break in at your place last night. We\u2019re assuming it was after the bastard left here. This is the second time, now. We should\u2019ve kept the place under surveillance, but we didn\u2019t think he\u2019d go back,\u201d he said in frustration as he ran his fingers down his face. \u201cI\u2019m in your presence for thirty seconds and I seem to forget how to do my job,\u201d he sighed, almost as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean your job?\u201d</p><p>Chad looked at her like a dog that had just wet on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI repeat, what job are you referring to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all bent out of shape. I just meant... I need to be watching out for you,\u201d he tried to cover.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap and you know it. Tell me the truth, now,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, your brothers were worried about you, and rightfully so, because this creep was sending all kinds of letters about how you should be with him, so they figured you needed protection,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you my freaking bodyguard?\u201d she demanded to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Bree.\u201d He tried to pacify her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally, yes, I was asked to guard you. But I\u2019m not being paid to do it. I wanted to,\u201d he said in a half-truth. He hadn\u2019t wanted to babysit her in the beginning, but now they couldn\u2019t pay him to stay away.</p><p>\u201cThis just keeps getting better. So, what? You were guarding the princess, got bored, and decided to bed me to pass the time,\u201d she practically shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. We slept together because neither of us could keep our hands off the other. You\u2019ve never complained, so don\u2019t act all high and mighty,\u201d he shouted back.</p> <p>Their morning wasn\u2019t going the way he wanted it to go, and he\u2019d much rather be ripping her clothes off than fighting over something insignificant.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get ready and go to your place,\u201d he said as he walked to the bedroom. Bree was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you explain everything to me,\u201d she stormed.</p><p>Bree watched in amazement as he ignored her tantrum and walked into the bathroom, shutting the door with a resounding click. She thought about pounding on the wood until she drove him crazy, but finally decided to just get dressed. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 she\u2019d get information one way or the other.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>Bree stepped into her home and looked around. She was hoping the familiar surroundings would jar her memory, but the more she looked over her items, the more frustrated she became. She didn\u2019t feel a personal connection to any of it. Nothing \u2013 not even a twinge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bree. You didn\u2019t live here very long. Don\u2019t expect a floodgate of memories to come flying back,\u201d Chad reassured her, reading the emotions on her face.</p><p>She watched as Chad joined her brothers and they looked through the apartment. Items were strewn across the floor and she looked in horror at her torn up clothing. Why would the person want to destroy her things? That didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way. Where\u2019s my daughter? Why wasn\u2019t I called last night?\u201d Bree heard the unmistakable voice of her father. She smiled, already feeling as if she knew him well.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see a reason to alarm you. We had the situation under control,\u201d she heard Chad say, to which George started thundering again.</p><p>\u201cUnder control! My daughter was shot at, and you say the situation was under control. I ought to take you out back and whip you, boy,\u201d George roared. Bree figured it was a good time to get out there and save the men.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said as she walked up and gave him a hug.</p><p>His anger evaporated as he took her in his arms and held her so tightly she couldn\u2019t breathe. When she started gasping for air, he finally released his death grip.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, baby? I\u2019ve been so worried. They should\u2019ve called me,\u201d he said in a rush of words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Dad. They really did handle everything. It was late,\u201d she said, instantly regretting it when she saw the fire light back up in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI had to learn about the shooting from my friend who works at city hall. How do you think that makes me feel? My child gets shot at, and a virtual stranger is the one to tell me about it. I would think I\u2019d raised you kids well enough that you\u2019d call me in a crisis,\u201d he said, sounding more hurt than angry.</p><p>Bree quickly threw her arms back around him, and had to fight the tears wanting to fall. She couldn\u2019t stand hurting this man who\u2019d been nothing but good to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really am. Next time, we\u2019ll call you the minute something happens,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope there won\u2019t be a next time. I think you need to come back home,\u201d he said as if that would solve all problems.</p> <p>Bree watched as Chad tensed on the other side of the room. She thought about taking the easy out and going home. She even tried to make herself nod her okay, but found herself shaking her head, instead. No matter how much she told herself to accept, her head wouldn\u2019t listen. She just kept shaking it, no.</p><p>She noticed Chad visibly relax at her refusal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it. You\u2019re still as stubborn as ever, even with amnesia,\u201d he said, but there was also pride in his tone. She could see he was proud of her for taking a stance. For some reason, his approval meant a lot to her.</p><p>\u201cI just want to keep you safe,\u201d he pled.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. I\u2019m overwhelmed with all the love you\u2019ve given me. I know it won\u2019t take long for me to remember everything. With a family like mine, I have to. It would be a crime to lose an obviously great life,\u201d she said, soothing his feelings.</p><p>Though she was trying to make him feel better, she found that she meant the words. She wanted to remember her past, her family. Even if the worst were to occur and she never regained her past, she would love them anyway.</p><p>\u201cBree, maybe it would be better if you just went back home. I know you don\u2019t have your memory back, but as the only impartial person in the room, I think I can speak honestly without a lot of emotions getting involved. Someone is obviously out to get you, and you don\u2019t know who it is. It seems the smart thing to do would be to go home, where your family can keep you safe,\u201d Charlie said.</p><p>Bree looked at him blankly, not having a clue who he was.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Bree. This is Charlie, my best friend. You\u2019ll remember everyone after a while. He wanted to come to the hospital, but got called away on business,\u201d Trenton said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sorry, Charlie. I still don\u2019t have my memory back,\u201d Bree said, feeling bad when she saw the hurt expression on his face.</p><p>Bree looked over at Chad who was glaring daggers at Charlie and not even trying to hide it. It seemed Chad didn\u2019t like another good-looking man in the room who wasn\u2019t related to her. Bree\u2019s hackles stood up and she gave Charlie a hug, partly to make up for not knowing who he was, and partly to show Chad she could do whatever she liked. She could swear she heard him growl. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe may as well sit down and try to figure this out,\u201d George said, and Charlie released her. Bree thought that was wise, considering she noticed Chad took a menacing step toward them. She decided to back off Charlie before a fist fight started.</p><p>She sat on the couch, where Chad quickly joined her, cutting Charlie off. The testosterone was flying through the room. Bree wanted to get up and open a window, but dutifully stayed where she was.</p><p>\u201cI may not have my memory back, but I know I want independence. I feel safe at Chad\u2019s ranch, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for me to be moved. I\u2019m not a child, and I don\u2019t need to run home every time I get scared. I hope you can all understand that,\u201d Bree stated with little emotion in her voice. She wanted to make a point without hurting feelings.</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019re all just concerned about your safety. If you come home until the person after you has been caught, then none of us will complain when you want your independence,\u201d Trenton said.</p><p>\u201cDo you run home each time you receive a threat?\u201d Bree asked. Trenton laughed as if what she said was funny, until she raised her eyebrow, letting him know she was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different, Bree,\u201d Trenton said.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... um... you know,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cNo. Obviously, I don\u2019t know. So please explain it to me,\u201d she said, not backing down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, well, I\u2019m a guy,\u201d he said, and her eyes fired at him. If looks could kill, Trenton would be dead where he sat.</p><p>\u201cThat is completely chauvinistic and you know it. Just because I\u2019m a girl, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less than any of you. I\u2019ve obviously managed to stay alive this long. I\u2019ll admit, getting shot and losing my memory is not the funnest experience I\u2019ve had, not that I can remember my funnest times right now, but still. You can\u2019t treat me like a five year old child. You\u2019re acting like pigs,\u201d she said as she looked into the eye of each man in the room.</p><p>They looked down uncomfortably, then Chad squeezed her hand. She turned on him.</p><p>\u201cI may be choosing to stay with you, but the same goes for you. I\u2019m only staying because I think it\u2019s important for me to know the father of my child. I won\u2019t be treated like an invalid, though,\u201d she said, causing the smile to drop from his lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, and it needs to stop. I don\u2019t mind you wanting to protect me, but you won\u2019t keep information from me anymore, and you\u2019ll treat me as an equal. My son or daughter won\u2019t think their father is the all-mighty, while their mother is a weakling,\u201d she said. Chad grinned before leaning down and kissing her square on the mouth, taking the rest of her words away.</p><p>\u201cVery well said,\u201d he agreed, but she could see the twinkle in his eyes. They\u2019d talk more once they were in private.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of what a strong woman you\u2019ve become, Bree. I won\u2019t ever stop worrying about you, but rest assured that I worry just as much about your insufferable brothers. I\u2019m a father, and that\u2019s what we do. You\u2019ll soon understand how I feel,\u201d George said as he pointedly glanced at her stomach. He was visibly upset \u2013 but trying to hide it.</p><p>Bree hated knowing she\u2019d upset her father, but she couldn\u2019t back down or she\u2019d never regain the ground she\u2019d managed to forge for herself. She had to stay firm \u2013 but that didn\u2019t mean she had to be cruel.</p><p>\u201cYou all trusted Chad enough to appoint him as my personal babysitter, so you should trust him enough to continue the job,\u201d Bree said, glaring at Trenton, who squirmed in his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d Charlie asked in stunned disbelief, causing all eyes to turn to him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Trenton said. \u201cWith everything else going on, I forgot. Sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the father,\u201d Charlie practically spit at Chad. \u201cMaybe if you were more concerned about her safety, instead of getting her into bed, she might not have been shot.\u201d</p><p>Chad\u2019s eyes widened at Charlie\u2019s words, and Bree felt him tense next to her. She knew he was about ready to jump up and pound the guy.</p><p>\u201cListen, you son of a...\u201d Chad started to say.</p><p>\u201cCome on guys. Let\u2019s not let this get out of hand,\u201d Trenton interrupted, standing up so he could play referee if things escalated.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to let this piece of work be alone with her?\u201d Charlie practically yelled.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I don\u2019t know you, but you\u2019re way out of line. I\u2019d back down if I were you.\u201d Chad spoke with so much authority, Bree expected Charlie to back off, but the man was either an idiot or had a death wish.</p><p>\u201cBree, this guy\u2019s taking advantage of you. He obviously can\u2019t keep you safe. He seems more concerned with taking your innocence than doing his job,\u201d Charlie said and made a move to take her hand.</p><p>Chad jumped between Charlie and Bree so quickly Trenton didn\u2019t have time to blink, let alone stop him. Chad slammed his fist into Charlie\u2019s chest, sending him flying back and pinned him against the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you are Trenton\u2019s best friend. If you try to touch her again, you won\u2019t walk for a month. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is ridiculous. Chad, let him go. He\u2019s just worried about Bree. He\u2019s known her since she was a toddler,\u201d Trenton said, tugging on Chad\u2019s immovable shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan we please leave now,\u201d Bree whispered, wanting them to leave before the situation got worse than it already was. Chad immediately responded to her and dropped Charlie as if he were nothing more than a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, sincerely regretting the loss of his temper.</p> <p>\u201cBree, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just so worried about you,\u201d Charlie called out as she headed to the front door.</p><p>She turned around and looked at the man, who was close to weeping. She felt bad for him. He must care about her a lot, and she had no clue who he was.</p><p>\u201cI know, Charlie, but I need to get out of here,\u201d she said, then walked from the room with Chad\u2019s arm around her. Her father followed her out the door, but her brothers gave her space.</p><p>\u201cWhether you get your memory back or not, my dear, you\u2019ll soon discover our family is passionate. Emotions always run high, but if someone we love is in danger, they shoot through the roof. Just know we love you and you can count on us for anything,\u201d George said, giving her a hug goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad. Being here isn\u2019t doing me any good, though. I\u2019d rather just get out of here, let everyone cool off. I promise I\u2019ll call you later tonight, okay?\u201d she said, hoping he\u2019d understand.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll feel better if you do,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d</p><p>George let them walk away and Bree felt instantly calmer the moment she sat down in Chad\u2019s familiar truck. She didn\u2019t want to go back to the ranch, but she may have hyperventilated if she\u2019d stayed in that place for one moment longer.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go to a movie?\u201d Chad asked. She could kiss him, she was so happy with his suggestion. A calm movie was just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful, but only if it\u2019s a romantic comedy,\u201d Bree replied. Chad groaned but navigated the truck toward the Cinemark complex. They studied the selections, and Bree nearly jumped up and down when she spotted, The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks.</p><p>Chad groaned but he reluctantly purchased the tickets and took her to see the movie. He enjoyed watching it through her eyes. She cried, laughed, and snuggled in close to him. It was a nice break from the stress that seemed to always consume their lives.</p> <p>\u201cThanks again, Chad. That was just what I needed,\u201d Bree said as they walked to his truck.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do for you,\u201d he told her, realizing he meant the words. She could ask for the moon, and he\u2019d do his best to get it for her. She looked in his eyes and something shifted.</p><p>Bree didn\u2019t know which of them moved first, but suddenly she was melting in his arms as his mouth gently caressed her lips. The moment stretched, filling her with a sense of rightness and love. He could be passionate and aggressive, or gentle and loving. He seemed to know what she needed exactly when she needed it.</p><p>His cell phone rang and Chad seriously considered throwing it against the building across the street. He didn\u2019t care who was calling, he wasn\u2019t getting interrupted again.</p><p>\u201cWoo hoo, ride that cowboy,\u201d someone called out, and Chad groaned against her mouth. It looked like he couldn\u2019t catch a break.</p><p>He reluctantly pulled away, nearly changing his mind when he saw Bree\u2019s flushed cheeks and swollen lips. Her eyes slowly opened, full of confusion \u2013 probably wondering why he stopped. He was going to take her to a deserted island \u2013 no phones, no teenagers and no stalkers.</p><p>His phone went off again and he pulled the annoying device from his pocket. Bree just buried her head against his shoulder, seemingly as frustrated as him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped into his phone. After a pause, he spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cIs it necessary? She\u2019s been through a lot the last couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he answered, then hung up.</p><p>\u201cThe police have someone in custody. They think we should come in,\u201d Chad told her. Bree\u2019s eyes widened, but he was impressed by how quickly she squared her shoulders and pulled herself together.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better get down there,\u201d she said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI can deal with it on my own,\u201d Chad offered.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want answers. I want this to be over,\u201d she answered and he heard the steel in her voice.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Bree\u2019s stomach turned as they stepped inside the huge double doors into the sheriff\u2019s station. She glanced at the reception area with people calling out orders, and chaos reigning. Somewhere among the throng of individuals was someone who could be responsible for disrupting her life, shooting her in the head, and endlessly pursuing her.</p><p>She squeezed Chad\u2019s hand tightly in her own. She was unaware of Chad scoping the room, looking for possible exits, noticing anyone looking suspicious. She would feel more reassured if she could see how aware he was of everyone and everything around him.</p><p>This could be the end of the chase. She could possibly start focusing on her life and getting her problems worked out, without having to look over her shoulder every five minutes. If the person after her was caught, then she could focus on her child, and if she were relaxed, then maybe she\u2019d get her memory back.</p><p>She smiled at the thought. She really wanted to know her past \u2013 her family.</p><p>Chad led her to the reception desk, where a harried looking woman in uniform barely glanced away from her computer screen as they approached.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she practically yelled, reaching into her messy hair and grabbing a pen that had seen better days.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see Captain Musket,\u201d Chad replied. That seemed to snap her to attention.</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChad Redington and Bree Anderson.\u201d</p><p>She typed something on her computer keyboard, dropping the pen on her desk.</p><p>\u201cID, please,\u201d she said while sticking her hand out, still without looking up. Chad reached into his wallet at the same time as Bree pulled her purse forward. They handed over their ID\u2019s and waited while she typed something else.</p><p>\u201cHead over to the door on the far right. Deputy Mitchel will let you through,\u201d she said without as much as a smile. Bree felt like a criminal for all the warmth the woman showed. She\u2019d hate to be on the wrong side of the law.</p><p>\u201cThis way, please,\u201d Deputy Mitchel said when Bree took too long to move forward. She jumped at the sound, then followed Chad\u2019s assured steps as he made his way toward the huge officer. He looked around the room, his hand resting on his gun, before opening the door for them. \u201cGo down this hallway, turn right. It\u2019s interrogation room number two. Wait there and the Captain will meet you.\u201d</p><p>Chad pulled Bree along as they made their way down the plain, narrow hallway. They passed a door where she heard someone shouting and a chill went down her spine. The place gave her the creeps.</p><p>Bree had always been curious what a jail was like from the inside. How the cells looked, if the interrogation rooms really were the same as they appeared on her favorite crime dramas. Now that she was there, her curiosity took a nose dive. She couldn\u2019t wait to get back out into the fresh air. She didn\u2019t understand how prisoners could stand the confined space, day in and day out. It was too much.</p><p>They stood where the officer told them to and waited.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Chad asked, startling Bree out of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I wouldn\u2019t want to be locked up in one of these places. Just standing here in the hallway is intimidating enough,\u201d she answered with a nervous laugh.</p><p>\u201cThis is luxurious, believe it or not. I\u2019ve been places overseas that still give me nightmares,\u201d he said in a voice that made Bree realize she didn\u2019t want to hear about those places. If he wanted to talk, she\u2019d listen, but she knew it would rip her apart. She knew nothing of his life, nothing at all about the father of her unborn baby.</p><p>\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Chad, Bree,\u201d Captain Musket said as he stepped up to them with his hand out. He was a pleasant looking man, appearing to be in his sixties; probably about five feet seven, with a round belly. Even with his weight, he still looked like he\u2019d be able to take down a criminal if the need arose. By the twinkle in his eye, Bree had a feeling he\u2019d love for someone to get out of hand. She liked him instantly.</p><p>\u201cWe understand. You\u2019re a busy man,\u201d Chad replied.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s step into the viewing room so Bree can look at who we have,\u201d the Captain said while opening a door. Bree was the first to enter, coming face to face with a dreadful looking man. She didn\u2019t have any clue who he was, but he was staring right in the window at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bree. He can\u2019t see you. He just knows we can see him and he\u2019s trying to intimidate you. This room is soundproof so he doesn\u2019t even know we\u2019re in here for sure. He\u2019s just assuming,\u201d the Captain assured her.</p><p>The man seemed to be looking directly at her, freezing her with his cold stare. Then, she watched as he placed his hands on the window and leaned his head forward. He stuck his tongue out and swiped it up the glass. Bree jumped back, completely disgusted.</p><p>Chad bunched his fist, having to fight the urge to punch the bullet proof glass, rattling the window, surprising the creep.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a winner,\u201d the Captain said with a disgusted sigh. \u201cIs anything coming to you, Bree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have no clue who he is or what he could possibly want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay in here and watch the interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he said he wanted to speak to me, so I\u2019ll go in there. I refuse to let him intimidate me,\u201d she said with resolve. The Captain patted her back, then opened the door and waited. Bree took a deep breath before she stepped out. She could do this. She wouldn\u2019t let any person control her emotions, especially a disturbing, pathetic man.</p><p>\u201cHey, sexy lady. You can use my lap if you want a more comfortable seat,\u201d the man said with a leer as Bree entered. She heard Chad curse behind her, and she put out her hand to touch him, letting him know she was fine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine in a chair. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to act when a man calls on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can cut the act, or sit it off in a cell. Your choice,\u201d Captain Musket said, bending down on the table and pressing his face up close to the man\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just no fun, are you?\u201d he sneered, but he leaned back, intimidated by the Captain.</p><p>\u201cNot with dirt bags like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want? Spit it out,\u201d Chad said as he took a seat facing the man. Bree slowly sat next to Chad, her leg brushing against his, keeping her grounded, reassurance that he was right there.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been trying to get an honest job in this town for a year, but because of my past record, no one wants to give me a chance. So this guy approaches me and asks if I want to make some money. Of course I wanted to make money, not like anyone is handing out jobs,\u201d the man started speaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat man?\u201d Chad interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the type of guy who gives you a name, you know? I just called him Mr. X. Well, I was just supposed to write these letters and stuff. Trail a girl. Nothing big \u2013 not anything that could get me in any real trouble, and he was paying well \u2013 real well,\u201d the man continued.</p><p>\u201cYou consider scaring an innocent woman not a crime?\u201d Chad demanded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break the law. It wasn\u2019t like I tried to touch her or anything,\u201d the man defended himself.</p> <p>Chad stood up from the table, leaned down and got in the man\u2019s face. The guy scooted his chair back, fear displayed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re a freaking boy scout. Do you have any useful information for us?\u201d The Captain interrupted before things got out of hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, things started escalating. Mr. X wanted me to break into her house and take some items. I wasn\u2019t going down for that crap. I know the lock-up time for breaking and entering. I was just supposed to shadow her, you know? I\u2019m not up for the hard core stuff. I\u2019ve cleaned up my act \u2013 learned my lesson,\u201d he said with a fake smile.</p><p>Bree knew the man was full of it. She wouldn\u2019t put it past him to do anything for a few bucks.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t get paid after the last time I hand delivered a note. I\u2019m out there risking my reputation, and he stiffs me,\u201d the man stated.</p> <p>Bree realized why he was so willing to turn over his boss. He wasn\u2019t getting money any longer, so he had nothing to lose. He thought maybe he could get out of charges if he came forward instead of being busted.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get ahold of this man?\u201d the Captain asked.</p><p>\u201cHe gets ahold of me. I don\u2019t have contact information on him. But, I thought you could do one of those wire thingy deals, or something like that. I\u2019d be willing to risk my life... if there were some benefit to me,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think we\u2019re going to pay you after what you\u2019ve done? You\u2019re going to be lucky to get out of jail in the next five years,\u201d the Captain thundered. He was obviously furious at what was looking more and more like a waste of all their time.</p><p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t have to come forward,\u201d the man said, starting to sweat as he squirmed around in his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou came forward because you thought it could somehow benefit you, you piece of crap,\u201d Chad said. He was sick of speaking to the low-life thug, and he didn\u2019t think they were going to get anything useful out of him.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d he shouted when it was obvious he\u2019d lost their attention. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to be calling me soon. He said he has something real big planned for the upcoming holiday,\u201d the man said, trying to hook the bait.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not listening to this anymore. You\u2019re obviously where you belong,\u201d Bree said. She couldn\u2019t stand the stench of the man any longer and wanted out of the room. She felt like the walls were starting to close in around her.</p><p>\u201cYou high and might b...\u201d he started to say, when Chad reached out and backhanded him across the room.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to complete that sentence,\u201d Chad said, itching to pummel him.</p><p>The man glared at him, then turned his head and spat a stream of blood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s assault. I want to press charges,\u201d he shouted to the Captain, who was looking at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t see anything. It looks to me like you tripped over the legs of the table. You really should work on your balance,\u201d the Captain said with a serious face.</p><p>\u201cAll you high and mighty pieces of crap stick together. I\u2019ll sue you \u2013 all of you. I know you have lots of money, little girl. Mr. X talked all about what a rich family you come from. I\u2019ll own everything you have. This is brutality,\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>Bree had to fight the sudden urge to laugh. The man was pathetic and he couldn\u2019t help them. Her hopes had been raised for nothing. She stepped past him, and at the last minute dug her three inch heel into his shoeless foot. He screamed out, but Bree was at the door before he made a lunge for her.</p><p>Chad threw his elbow back, connecting with the man\u2019s head, sending him sprawling to the floor. His yelling stopped as he was knocked unconscious.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Chad told her. Neither of them looked back as the Captain ordered one of his deputies to lock the man up.</p><p>\u201cHave you verified his name? Done a background check?\u201d Chad asked as they made their way down the hall.</p><p>\u201cGot his name. Robert Loren. Just a small-time petty thief. He served about five years up state and has been out for two. He hasn\u2019t held a job longer than two weeks, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of being the mastermind behind this. I think he\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d the Captain stated.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I was hoping he had useful information when you called, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, I\u2019m sorry to have wasted your time,\u201d the Captain said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we came, and we did get some information. Apparently, Mr. X isn\u2019t finished with his games,\u201d Bree said. She was more furious than afraid at that moment.</p><p>\u201cGo home. If I get any other information, I\u2019ll call right away,\u201d the Captain said while leading them back to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough day. We\u2019ll start over tomorrow,\u201d Chad told her as he led her down the stairs and over to his truck.</p><p>He helped her inside, then walked around and started the vehicle. They were silent on the way home, both lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Bree woke up to a beautiful, bright, sunny morning and decided she needed a walk. She knew Chad would be furious, but it had been a week and no one had shot at her, left ominous notes, or tried to kidnap her. The ranch was surrounded by security men and she was safe to walk the short distance to the lake. She\u2019d deal with Chad\u2019s lecture \u2013 it was worth it to get a little alone time.</p><p>She quickly showered and dressed in a light summer dress, thankful for a rare day of warmth in the unpredictable Washington weather. She didn\u2019t bother with makeup or doing her hair, just threw it up in a messy bun and called herself good.</p><p>Her foul mood the last few days had chased Chad to the barn, and even caused her brothers to back off. She was tired of being treated like the princess Chad had called her. She was a woman, and it was time he knew it.</p><p>Chad hadn\u2019t so much as kissed her all week, and she thought she may die of sexual frustration. She didn\u2019t want to be the one to make the first move \u2013 that was his job. His idea that them being intimate clouded his ability to protect her was getting on her nerves.</p><p>Maybe if she agreed to marry Chad, he\u2019d actually take her to bed again.</p><p>Bree reached the pond and sat down, grabbing a handful of rocks and tossing them in the water, one by one, watching the ripples as they floated further from her.</p><p>She leaned her head back and enjoyed the sounds around her. She could hear the cows in the pasture mooing, the horses neighing, and all kinds of woodland creatures playing in the nearby woods. It was peaceful, relaxing, and soon she found herself drifting to sleep.</p><p>Bree stirred restlessly on the ground, her nightmare causing her body to sweat and her muscles to tense. Chad was standing such a short distance away. He was yelling something at her, but she couldn\u2019t hear him. She could see his mouth moving, but no sound was coming out.</p><p>Then, there was a man wearing a dark mask. He had a gun and it was pointed right at Chad. No! she screamed, but Chad wouldn\u2019t face the man. All of a sudden a shot rang out and she watched as he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Bree jerked awake, tears falling down her face. She turned her head, trying to get her bearings. Where was she? Where was Chad? He was hurt \u2013 she had to help.</p><p>Upon becoming fully awake, she realized she\u2019d only been dreaming, and vivid details of her nightmare came flooding back to her, overwhelming her in their intensity. Suddenly the fog in her mind began to lift and color filled its place, bringing her lost memories to life.</p><p>She remembered everything. Chad getting shot, the men capturing her, Chad saving her, and the man facing them, firing his gun. She flinched, remembering the fear as she saw that small puff of smoke rising from his gun right before the bullet struck.</p><p>Bree sat by the water for another half hour, too shaken up to move. With her memories back, she couldn\u2019t stop the overwhelming emotions that came with them.</p><p>After compiling all the pieces of the last several months together, she felt such relief at the picture of her life she was able to visualize again. She was one-hundred-percent in love with Chad. She\u2019d started falling in love with him before she was hurt, but was even more in love now. He\u2019d been by her side night and day \u2013 risked his own life for her. She couldn\u2019t imagine being without him.</p><p>Her hand moved down to her still flat stomach as she fully comprehended she was having his child. They\u2019d made a baby together. Their child was strong like its father. Her pregnancy survived Bree being shot, sitting in the hospital in a coma, and all the stress that was known to cause miscarriages.</p><p>Bree was filled with unbelievable joy at how her life had changed so much in only a few short months.</p><p>She had to find Chad. His quest of keeping them platonic was about to end because if he didn\u2019t take her to bed soon, he may see a true tantrum from the princess. She laughed aloud at her own joke.</p><p>Ah, she missed Jennifer, her brother\u2019s wife. They\u2019d become so close since she\u2019d married Trenton. Bree hurt thinking about how hard this must have been on her best friend. Jennifer hadn\u2019t shown how hurt she must have felt at having Bree not remember her, but Bree knew if the situation was reversed and Jennifer didn\u2019t know who she was, she\u2019d be devastated.</p><p>She had to call her.</p><p>Well, after she spent alone time with Chad.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d she heard Chad shout. She grinned in anticipation. His tone sounded furious, mixed with a twinge of worry. She\u2019d broken his rule of never going anywhere alone. Bring it on, she thought. Their fights always ended most satisfyingly.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d she called, then heard his footsteps racing toward her. She grinned more. She knew he could move silently through the woods. He wanted her to know he was coming. Her stomach tightened with raw need.</p><p>Chad came to a halt five feet in front of her. He quickly scanned the area before turning back to glare at her. She smiled sweetly at him. She wasn\u2019t ready to tell him her memory was back. He\u2019d played with her, now it was her turn to play with him.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to go off by yourself,\u201d he finally said between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI needed a walk,\u201d she answered sweetly.</p><p>She watched as his forehead wrinkled. She could practically hear him counting in his head. Oh, how she loved pushing his buttons.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own safety,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m alive and well,\u201d she answered in the same tone she knew was grating on his nerves. Her nipples grew hard, and she felt heat building. She tried to tell herself anticipation was half the fun, but she was about out of patience. She was salivating at the thought of his thick erection plunging into her. She looked down his body and licked her lips when she saw him tense at her overly sexual glance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you... what\u2019s going on?\u201d he stammered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, Chad, simply famished.\u201d She looked at his painted on jeans, open shirt, and sexy cowboy hat and she felt like flames were igniting all over her. Her skin burned and her core pulsed. She was about to go off without a single touch from him. He was all man \u2013 and he was hers.</p><p>She saw him shift, watched his jeans tighten as he became aware of her arousal. He shifted as he tried to maintain his anger, but she saw his eyes dilate. She knew she\u2019d won. Bree reached up and undid the top button on her dress. Then she slowly moved down and released the next one.</p><p>She felt triumphant as his eyes practically jumped from their sockets as she moved down her dress, exposing her tempting cleavage to his view.</p> <p>\u201cBree,\u201d he groaned. He didn\u2019t move, just watched as she performed her strip tease.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted as her dress fell open, exposing her lacy green bra to him. Her nipples were beaded into hard buds and poking uncomfortably against the fabric, but even that was erotic.</p><p>She slipped her hands into the waistline of her dress and with a quick shimmy, it floated to the ground, leaving her standing before him in nothing but her lacy bra and matching panties, which barely covered her womanhood from his view.</p><p>Chad finally moved forward and pressed her body against him. His hungry kiss left her even more breathless and she reached up and grabbed ahold of his hair, holding on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cWe should go inside,\u201d he gasped as he pulled back a fraction of an inch.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d she demanded, not wanting to take the time to go anywhere. The sun felt amazing on her nearly naked body, his arms were around her, and she felt free from the prison she\u2019d been locked in for months. She leaned forward and bit his bottom lip, eliciting another groan from him.</p><p>He gripped her butt and pulled upward, grinding her wet womanhood into the rough fabric of his jeans. She wrapped her legs around his waist and moved her hips, sliding against him, so close to completion with barely a touch.</p><p>Chad deepened the kiss, his tongue slowly moving in and out of her mouth, mimicking the love making she so deeply desired. She wanted him inside her, filling her. Seductively grinding against him again, he seemed to take the hint. He moved them backward to a huge boulder next to the edge of the woods.</p><p>The spot offered a semblance of privacy, not that either of them noticed, but better yet, offered them a place to sit. She pushed down on him as her feet touched the rock, giving her leverage to better move.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do to me,\u201d he groaned as her breasts pushed against him. Ripping off his open shirt, he then dispersed with her bra and cupped her heavy breasts. She leaned back, giving him better access and he bent his head and took her nipple in his mouth, alternating between biting down and sliding his tongue across the pebbled pink bud.</p><p>He squeezed them together, moving his head back and forth, driving her insane as he pleasured her nipples over and over.</p> <p>She reached her hands down and unclasped the buttons on his jeans, pushing her hand inside the tight denim until she hit payday and wrapped her fingers around his silky smooth erection. She pulled it free, rubbing her thumb across the head, nearly giddy when moisture dripped out, showing her how ready he was for her.</p><p>Chad cried out when she ran her nail across the sensitive tip, then down his long length. Then she gripped him tightly and moved her fist up and down several times.</p><p>With another groan, Chad released her breasts and ripped off her panties, leaving her naked on his lap. He closed his mouth on hers at the same time that he thrust hard inside her hot, wet core.</p><p>\u201cOh... I\u2019ve missed you, Chad,\u201d she cried out, the intense feeling of pleasure causing so many emotions to rush through her newly found mind. She didn\u2019t want gentle. She didn\u2019t want slow. She wanted fast and hard, and now!</p><p>She ground herself against him, her swollen nub rubbing against the base of his erection, making her cry out. He gripped her hips tightly in his and pushed up in her.</p><p>Bree gripped his shoulders and used the rock as leverage as she met him thrust for thrust. Her thigh muscles burned as the two of them moved together, but she ignored it. She ignored everything but the immense sensations washing through her.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d she called as her body convulsed with release. She gripped him tightly as wave after wave of pleasure washed through her. Then he cried out as he pushed so hard against her, she didn\u2019t know where he ended and she began and she continued to ride the wave with him.</p><p>Bree was spent. She couldn\u2019t move a single muscle if she had to. She laid her head on Chad\u2019s shoulder and soaked up the sun on her back and the feel of his hands caressing her damp skin. She took in the moment \u2013 the intensity \u2013 the love.</p> <p>Chad didn\u2019t move for several minutes. Eventually he placed his hand under her chin and lifted her face so she had no choice but to look at him. She gave him a sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always want you,\u201d he replied with his own smile. It seemed their fight was over. \u201cI usually have more restraint than to ravage you in the open, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t resist,\u201d she said, then leaned in and sucked his bottom lip into her mouth. Chad quickly grabbed her hips and moved her off him so suddenly her legs almost gave out. She caught herself at the last second.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. We need to get you dressed before one of my hands come wandering out here,\u201d he commanded as he turned around. She walked up and wrapped her arms around his back, trailing her fingers down his stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to kill me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said with a chuckle. He turned and gave her a quick kiss on the nose, before bending to retrieve her dress. He slipped it over her head before he realized her bra was still on the ground.</p><p>He shook his head, then picked up the green lace and stuffed it in his pocket. Bree gave up and started buttoning her dress. He\u2019d satisfied her initial itch; she could wait ten minutes to get to his bedroom before starting round two.</p><p>\u201cIf this causes death, then yes, I am. Meet me in the bedroom and I\u2019ll...\u201d she whispered the rest in his ear and felt extreme pride when she watched the air leave his body and he gaped at her. She turned and ran toward the house.</p><p>She heard him quickly catching up behind her. Just as she ran through the kitchen door, the phone went off.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait,\u201d he said as he pinned her to the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou know it might be important,\u201d she countered. She wanted to ignore it but he still didn\u2019t have a stupid answering machine.</p><p>\u201cWhy does this damn phone ring at the worst possible moments,\u201d was Chad\u2019s greeting. She giggled as she ran her hands along the bulge in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d The tone of his voice stopped Bree. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said before hanging up. He turned and the look in his eye made Bree want to run. She didn\u2019t want to know what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cBree...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said, holding up her hand.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s your dad. He\u2019s had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Bree fainted, barely giving Chad time to catch her before she hit the kitchen floor.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bree asked as she came to. Chad was pressing a cold compress to her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go. Your father had a heart attack. I don\u2019t know how bad it is, they just said to get down there right away,\u201d Chad answered. The worry in his eyes made her stomach clench. She just got her memory back. She couldn\u2019t lose her dad \u2013 not yet. He was too young, so full of life. Their family couldn\u2019t survive the loss. Losing their mother was hard enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, let\u2019s go,\u201d she told him as she got to her feet. Her knees were shaking but she was determined to stay strong.</p><p>Chad placed his arm around her as he led her to his truck. They were silent on the way to the hospital, stress keeping them from speaking. Bree hadn\u2019t told Chad she got her memory back, but that could wait.</p><p>Chad made the normally thirty minute drive in half the time, but it still felt like it took forever. Bree was jumping from the truck before he had it in park. He quickly caught up to her as she rushed through the emergency room doors.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Anderson, please,\u201d Bree demanded.</p><p>\u201cOne moment please,\u201d the nurse replied as she typed on her keyboard. Bree drummed her fingernails on the counter, staring a hole through the nurse\u2019s head. After taking much longer than Bree thought necessary, the nurse finally looked up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being attended to by the doctor, now. If you have a seat in the waiting room, someone will notify you of his progress as soon as we know something,\u201d the woman said, then looked back down at her computer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You can\u2019t give me any other information. How would you like it if it was your father back there? Would you just want to sit quietly and wait?\u201d Bree yelled at the cold woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am, but there\u2019s no other information we have at the moment. The doctors are doing all they can,\u201d the woman answered calmly. She was more than used to worried family members yelling at her.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d Joseph called as he rushed through the doors.</p><p>Bree turned and ran to her uncle. He grabbed her up in a bear hug and she sobbed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay, Sweetie. Your father is a strong man. A heart attack won\u2019t keep him down,\u201d Joseph said. He was trying to reassure her but she heard the worry in his tone. He was afraid for his brother.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tell me anything,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cHe just got here about ten minutes ago. Your brother called you from the chopper. We were all at the house, having a drink and visiting, when his face got real pale and he clutched his chest. I know the signs. I\u2019ve seen a man have a heart attack before. We got him here fast, Bree. They say the first thirty minutes are the most important. Let\u2019s sit down and wait for the good doctor,\u201d Joseph said, speaking far more quietly than normal. His tone scared her worse than the not knowing. Her Uncle Joseph was supposed to be loud \u2013 not sober.</p><p>Soon, their entire family was in the waiting room, quietly talking, glancing at the clock, stress clearly visible on their faces. None of them liked the sterile room; all of them prayed George would be okay.</p><p>They\u2019d all spent months in the hospital when their mother was dying. It had been heartbreaking watching her slowly wither away. Bree couldn\u2019t stand the quiet any longer. She jumped up and began pacing the room. Chad kept a close eye on her.</p><p>\u201cTrenton Anderson?\u201d the desk nurse called out. Everyone stood and turned at once, causing her professionalism to slip a tad before she quickly recovered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Trenton,\u201d he said as he walked over.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor\u2019s on his way out,\u201d she said, making Bree want to hit her. They all turned toward the E.R. doors and waited.</p><p>Soon, the door opened and a man walked out, looking down at a chart in his hand. The room was completely silent. He finally looked up and Trenton stepped forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you Trenton Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Doctor Michaels. Would you like to follow me so we can speak in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is all family and whatever you have to say, they\u2019re going to need to hear,\u201d he said, staying planted to the spot.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your choice, Mr. Anderson. We have you listed as emergency contact, so I\u2019ll give you the information and you can relay it. Your father had a mild heart attack known as a Posterior Infarct, also known as Inferior Infarct. There was clogging in one of the branches of his right coronary artery. We were able to help him in time, and his condition is stable right now,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>Bree\u2019s head whipped between her brother and the doctor, not understanding what they were talking about. Posterior Infarct? Inferior Infarct? What the heck? She just needed to see her father, physically see that he was okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Trenton asked.</p><p>\u201cWe need to run more test, he may need surgery, but his vitals are steady right now, which is encouraging. He\u2019s in the E.R. so he can only have two visitors at a time, and you need to stay calm and supportive. We don\u2019t want to raise his blood pressure, and if he thinks you\u2019re stressed, it can cause him stress as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Can I see him now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can bring one person along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Trenton?\u201d Bree asked. He looked at her and held his hand out. She grabbed hold of him and followed the doctor through the double doors.</p><p>They made their way down a long white hallway and Bree looked only forward. She could hear weeping from one of the rooms and had to fight the tears choking her throat. She hoped to not have to step foot in another hospital for many years. She knew they saved lives, but being there was draining for her soul.</p><p>\u201cThrough here. Stay only ten minutes,\u201d the doctor said as he pointed to a closed door. Trenton didn\u2019t hesitate as he quietly pulled the door open.</p><p>Bree rapidly blinked her eyes as she saw her larger-than-life father lying in the small hospital bed with wires hanging from his arms. He was so pale, except for his bright red cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d she whispered. If he was sleeping, she didn\u2019t want to wake him, but she really needed to hear the sound of his voice.</p> <p>\u201cBree, come here, sweetheart,\u201d he croaked, and she rushed to his bedside and sank into the chair, quickly gripping the hand he held out to her.</p><p>\u201cI remember, Dad,\u201d she said, needing to tell him. His eyes widened and brightened beneath the bright hospital lights.</p><p>\u201cAh, Baby, that\u2019s so wonderful. I knew it was only a matter of time.\u201d He knew exactly what she was talking about \u2013 of course he did, he was her Dad. She sniffled as she gave him a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I\u2019m going to be okay. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to leave you kids. Besides, I have a brand new grandchild coming into this world who\u2019s going to need a lot of spoiling,\u201d he said with a gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Dad. Don\u2019t you ever scare me like this again,\u201d Bree demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to, Princess,\u201d he answered, reverting to what he\u2019d called her when she was just a young girl.</p><p>\u201cYou gave us all quite a scare, Dad,\u201d Trenton said as he took the seat on the opposite side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAh, boy, you know your old man\u2019s too tough to let some clogged arteries keep him down. Stinking doctor is trying to blame food and liquor, but give me a week and I\u2019ll be dancing circles around that young punk,\u201d George said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming home and I\u2019ll make sure you stay on any diet the doctor puts you on. You\u2019re not invincible,\u201d Bree gently scolded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have you home, Bree, but I\u2019m the parent here,\u201d he tried to sound commanding but couldn\u2019t quite pull it off while lying in a small bed hooked up to machines. Bree arched her eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later,\u201d Bree promised. She didn\u2019t want to cause him stress right then.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want you home, Bree, what will Chad think about that?\u201d George asked.</p><p>Bree looked at him for a moment without having an answer. She was confused. She\u2019d only just gotten her memory back and needed to really analyze what had happened since she\u2019d met him. They had moved so quickly in their relationship, constantly under extreme circumstances.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, Dad,\u201d she answered. Even though he was hurt, he was still her father, and he always seemed to have the answers.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied as she leaned in and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek. There was no point in lying to him.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Anderson, your time is up,\u201d a nurse interrupted as she looked in the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Betsy, they just got here,\u201d George grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare sass me, George,\u201d she said and it was obvious the two knew each other well. \u201cTwo more minutes,\u201d she compromised before looking pointedly at the clock, then them. She quietly closed the door and Bree had a feeling she was waiting on the outside of it, looking at her watch.</p><p>\u201cWe better go, Dad. You know the rest of the gang is anxious to get back here. If I\u2019m not mistaken, Esther seemed pretty worried as she paced up and down the hallway,\u201d Trenton said with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be starting any rumors,\u201d George said, but Bree noticed a bit more color infuse his cheeks. It looked to her like her father and Esther may have a little romance going on.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think of it,\u201d Trenton replied. He stood up and kissed George\u2019s cheek before walking to the door and waiting for Bree to say Goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she said as she bent down and clung to him, taking in a deep breath of his special dad's scent.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than you could ever imagine. Now, promise me you aren\u2019t going to worry about me. You need to be focused on my grandbaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise not to worry just a little bit, but I do promise to take good care of this baby,\u201d Bree said.</p><p>\u201cI can settle for that,\u201d George said with a small smile. \u201cNow send in the troops.\u201d</p><p>The nurse popped back in and looked at them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Trenton grumbled. She was quite the rule enforcer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the lobby. I need to use the bathroom,\u201d Bree told him. He seemed about to stop her, so she rubbed her stomach as a reminder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t take too long. I\u2019m sure Chad\u2019s already pacing the lobby while waiting for you to get back,\u201d Trenton said. She realized her brother finally had respect for Chad. That was a good thing if there was any chance of him being her husband.</p><p>She turned down the hall and slipped in the bathroom, where she leaned against the door and took a deep breath. She allowed the tears to fall while she sank to the floor. It hadn\u2019t been easy for her to see the strongest man she knew looking so frail.</p><p>She finally got up, washed her face and deemed herself ready to emerge. When she stepped from the bathroom, her body took her left instead of right, though. She didn\u2019t want to head back to the lobby just yet. She needed a few more minutes before she faced the mob.</p><p>Bree turned a few corners and found herself lost. She knew that wasn\u2019t good. Chad wasn\u2019t going to be happy with her when she didn\u2019t return right away. Well, he\u2019d have to get over it. They were in a public hospital where nothing could happen to her. There were security cameras and policemen all over the place.</p><p>She found an exit sign and stepped through the door, taking a deep breath of fresh air. It was much better smelling than the antiseptic smell of the hospital. She stepped further out and looked around, trying to figure out where she was. It looked like she was on the backside of the building. She started walking along the covered breezeway, figuring she had a ways to go before she made it back to the E.R. entrance.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d someone called. She tensed as she looked around. She was being ridiculous. There was no way any harm could come to her in a public place. There were people all around her.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d the voice called again and she turned, sighing in relief when she saw Charlie running up to her.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me, Charlie,\u201d she said with a relieved chuckle.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. Everyone is looking for you. It seems you made the great escape,\u201d Charlie said with the same grin she remembered from their childhood.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I just wanted a few minutes to myself before having to sit in the crowded waiting room again,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cI understand. It\u2019s still pretty intense in there. Do you want to walk down by the pond? I\u2019ll send Trenton a text and let him know where we are so they stop worrying,\u201d he offered. She knew she shouldn\u2019t. Chad was going to be having a cow. But then she tensed her shoulders and decided she\u2019d like that very much.</p><p>Chad was going to have to get used to her having a mind of her own. They were on hospital grounds and she wasn\u2019t alone, she was with a family friend.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect, Charlie. Make sure you let Trenton know, though, so the lecture isn\u2019t too bad when we get back,\u201d she said. Charlie took out his phone and typed in a message, before placing it back in his pocket.</p><p>Charlie stuck out his arm and Bree placed her hand through it and followed him along a flower strewn path. She could hear birds chirping and smiled in delight when a squirrel ran right in front of them and scaled a tree. It turned and made noises at them as if they were disturbing his home.</p><p>Bree laughed aloud at the expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cI learned this hospital inside and out when my dad was here last year,\u201d Charlie said as they moved further away from the hospital. The closer they came to the pond, the more peaceful Bree felt. She hadn\u2019t realized how much stress the building placed on her.</p><p>\u201cI heard about that, Charlie. I\u2019m so sorry you lost him,\u201d Bree responded. So many unnecessary deaths. His father had only been fifty when a truck driver had slammed into his small car, putting him in critical condition. He\u2019d hung on for three months before his body finally gave out.</p><p>\u201cIt was a hard time,\u201d Charlie said quietly. She squeezed his arm, offering her support.</p><p>They continued in silence until they reached a small stream that fed into a nice pond. There was a family of ducks swimming in it, and a couple benches on the side. No one else was around, which Bree was grateful for. She didn\u2019t want to make small talk with strangers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Charlie murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know, me either,\u201d Bree replied, rubbing her hand across her flat stomach. If she had a bump, it would all seem more real.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019d do anything for you, don\u2019t you,\u201d Charlie said as he turned and pulled her close to him. Bree started to feel a bit uncomfortable with the intimate gesture. She had to remind herself it was Charlie, Trenton\u2019s best friend for more years than she could remember.</p><p>\u201cI know, Charlie. You\u2019re like a brother to me,\u201d she answered as she tugged against him, trying to subtly let him know she wanted him to let go. Instead of responding to her signals, he pulled her tight against his body, and she felt her stomach turn when she felt his erection pressing against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could be so much more than that, Bree,\u201d he said as he quickly bent his head and covered her lips with his.</p><p>\u201cHow is dad?\u201d Austin asked as Trenton stepped through the doors.</p><p>Chad looked behind him, but the doors shut without Bree following. He stepped forward, wanting to know where she was. He waited for a minute before walking up to Trenton.</p><p>\u201cIs Bree staying with your Dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s right behind me. She had to use the bathroom. I think she just needed a minute to herself. I wanted to get out here so the next two could go back,\u201d Trenton answered.</p><p>\u201cThat would be me and Esther,\u201d Joseph said, not giving anyone else a choice. He took Esther\u2019s arm in his and they made their way through the double doors.</p><p>\u201cI think we may be having another wedding here pretty soon,\u201d Trenton said as he watched the two of them disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou may be right,\u201d Lucas said with a smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say how your dad was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing him hooked up to those monitors, and he looks too pale, but he\u2019s a fighter. I know he\u2019s going to pull through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we needed to hear,\u201d Lucas said as he patted Trenton\u2019s back.</p><p>Chad continued to watch the door. He was getting a bad feeling in his gut, and if Bree didn\u2019t get out there soon, he was hunting her down.</p><p>As he watched the clock, deciding she had five more minutes, the doors opened and Joseph stepped out with Esther at his side. She looked teary eyed, but not as concerned as she\u2019d looked before going in.</p><p>Chad waited for Bree to come with them. The doors once again closed with no sign of her.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Bree?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>Everyone turned, alerted by his tone.</p> <p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t in the hallway,\u201d Joseph said, his forehead creasing with worry.</p><p>\u201cWe need to do a search,\u201d Chad commanded, his body on instant alert. No one argued with him. The stalker still hadn\u2019t been caught, and they weren\u2019t taking chances.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through the E.R.\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll alert security and see if they can spot her on the cameras,\u201d Lucas said as he walked to the front desk.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of you span out. Check all the doors and the parking lot. You all have my number if you find her,\u201d Chad said as he rushed out the front doors. He tried not to panic. She most likely had just stepped outside for fresh air. He knew she couldn\u2019t stand the smell of the hospital. He tried calling her, but in their haste to get to the hospital, she\u2019d left her phone at the ranch.</p><p>Chad tried reassuring himself that even if she had gone outside, there was no way for the stalker to know she was there, or be able to kidnap her with security everywhere. If he could shake the bad feeling, he\u2019d feel a whole lot better.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Bree fought against Charlie as he defiled her lips, trying to access her mouth. She tried to tell him no, and that gave him the opening he was looking for. His tongue snaked out and slipped inside her mouth.</p> <p>She gagged as he assaulted her. She couldn\u2019t figure out what had gotten into him. His hand crept down her back and gripped her backside, tugging her hard against his body, as he thrust his hips forward, forcing his arousal against her.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she yelled when he released her mouth. She grabbed at his hair, pulling his head so he\u2019d get the clue she didn\u2019t want him kissing her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bree. I always have and always will,\u201d he said as if it were obvious. \u201cI\u2019ve waited so long for you to be ready for a relationship, and then you get knocked up by that complete piece of crap. I can be your husband and raise your child. He isn\u2019t deserving of you. He doesn\u2019t know you like I do,\u201d Charlie said in an impassioned speech.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you, but this isn\u2019t what I want,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His eyes darkened in rage and he reached his hand up and slapped her hard across the face. Bree felt fear spike through her as she fought not to black out. Who was this man she thought she knew?</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re too good for me just because I don\u2019t have as much money as your family? I\u2019ve always been there for you, Bree. We just need to get you away from here. I figured if things started happening and you got scared, you\u2019d need me. I could be your savior, rescue you from the crazy stalker,\u201d he said. His eyes were wide as he made his speech. Bree realized he wasn\u2019t exactly stable at that moment.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right, we really need to sit down and talk. I haven\u2019t been very good to you lately \u2013 too self-absorbed,\u201d she said, willing to do anything to get them back in sight of other people. She never should\u2019ve walked off with him.</p><p>His shoulders relaxed at her words, but she knew she wasn\u2019t out of danger yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about my father right now, Charlie. Can we stop by and see him, then we can leave and talk about us?\u201d Bree asked in what she hoped was a convincing voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t go back in there. If we do, Chad won\u2019t let you leave. Can\u2019t you see how obsessed with you he is?\u201d Charlie asked as he shook her, making sure she was listening to him.</p><p>Bree thought that was rich, him calling Chad possessive, when he\u2019d been stalking her, breaking into her home, and had her held against her will at that very moment.</p><p>\u201cI know, Charlie. He doesn\u2019t give me time alone, but we can sneak in the back door, and I can peak in on my father. I don\u2019t even have to go in the room with him,\u201d she pled. If she could just get inside the hospital, she could notify security and get away from the psychotic man.</p><p>She saw him considering her request, so with her stomach turning at the thought of touching him, she reached her hand up and cupped his cheek, trying to act reassuring that she actually cared about him.</p><p>He bent down and kissed her again, and she forced her body not to tense. She was so close to him taking her back. He pulled her tightly against him once more and she fought the tears wanting to fall. If he saw even an inkling of her disgust, he\u2019d never let her in public again.</p><p>He pulled away and looked in her eyes, then his narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou almost had me fooled. You\u2019re just trying to get away from me. If I take you back in there, you\u2019re going to run away. I know you\u2019ll come to love me, though. I just have to get you away from Chad and everyone else for a while,\u201d Charlie roared.</p><p>He grabbed her arm and started leading her around the pond, farther from the hospital. If he got her too far, she knew her chances of survival became slimmer than they already were. She started fighting against him, but he just pulled harder, laughing like he enjoyed her terror.</p><p>Chad ran through the parking lot of the hospital grounds, searching for any sign of Bree. He checked each car as it passed him, looking for anything unusual. Nothing! It was like she\u2019d disappeared without a trace.</p><p>His phone rang.</p><p>\u201cTell me you have good news,\u201d he barked into the mouthpiece.</p><p>\u201cSecurity footage showed she exited the back door about twenty minutes ago,\u201d Trenton said with hesitation. Chad tensed.</p><p>\u201cA man met her outside; they chatted for a few minutes, then walked toward the trail at the rear of the hospital. The trail leads down to a serenity pond for visitors. Chad, I saw the footage \u2013 it was Charlie. I don\u2019t know if anything is wrong, but I just... I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d just disappear like that, not with my Dad in here like this...\u201d Trenton trailed off.</p><p>Chad changed direction while still holding the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you know Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known him since high school. I don\u2019t... there\u2019s no way... I can\u2019t imagine him being involved in any of this. Maybe, somehow the stalker found out she was here and ambushed them,\u201d Trenton trailed off.</p><p>Chad could hear the pain in Trenton\u2019s voice. Trenton didn\u2019t want to admit it, but it looked like they may have found their perpetrator. His stomach turned as he thought about the man with her. He should have done a better background check on him, but he was Trenton\u2019s friend... Chad didn\u2019t have time for excuses. He had to get to Bree. Hopefully, she was just sitting at the pond, visiting with an old friend, but his gut told him that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>He found the trail and silently ran down it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming out. We\u2019re right behind you,\u201d Trenton said before disconnecting the call. He knew Chad was close and wouldn\u2019t say anything further.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have let her out of his sight at the hospital. He could\u2019ve escorted them to the room and waited outside. He had many what ifs running through his head, but he knew those didn\u2019t do him any good.</p><p>Chad felt his adrenaline kick into high gear as he neared the pond. He heard Bree cry out and his body went into fight mode. He had his answer. She was in danger.</p><p>He pulled out his gun as he made his way the last several feet. He spotted Charlie dragging Bree down the trail. It looked like he was leading her to the other side. He must have some sort of exit strategy planned. Charlie underestimated Chad.</p><p>Chad hid among the trees as he trailed about fifty yards behind them. He tensed when he noticed the gun in Charlie\u2019s hand. He\u2019d been afraid of that. Chad couldn\u2019t risk Bree getting shot in the heat of battle.</p><p>He moved closer as he tried to get a good aim on Charlie. He had no problem shooting the man threatening Bree, but he didn\u2019t want Charlie\u2019s gun to somehow go off and hurt her. Chad needed to get him to point the gun somewhere else.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to shoot you right here?\u201d Charlie cried when she continued to struggle against him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that defeat the whole purpose of you wanting us to be together?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to kill you, Bree. I can shoot you in the leg, then throw you over my shoulder. The pain is excruciating, but you\u2019ll be too busy focusing on that to fight me anymore,\u201d he threatened. Chad wanted to beat him to a bloody pulp.</p><p>\u201cJust let me go,\u201d Bree begged as a tear fell. That seemed to stop him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, you don\u2019t understand. I really do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t love, Charlie,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love me, you will,\u201d he said with determination.</p><p>Chad realized the man had completely lost his mind. He somehow thought he could make her love him. When he realized that wasn\u2019t going to happen, he\u2019d have no other choice, at least in his mind, than to kill her. He wouldn\u2019t even care if she was pregnant. Heck, as twisted as he was, he\u2019d probably wait until the baby was born, then kill her and take the child, thinking he\u2019d at least always have a piece of her.</p><p>Chad would never let the situation get that far. They weren\u2019t getting out of his sight. He continued to track them, drawing closer as he waited for his chance to strike.</p><p>Charlie grabbed her arm again and pulled her close and Bree threw her head back as she twisted away. She turned in Chad\u2019s direction and their eyes locked together. He tried to silently signal her to not give him away, but her eyes softened and her lips turned up in just the barest hint of a relieved smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlie didn\u2019t miss her changed demeanor. He moved faster than Chad expected him to, and whipped their bodies around so Bree was shielding him as he held the gun out and looked into the bushes, straight where Bree had been gazing.</p><p>He pressed his finger in and the gun fired, the bullet flying toward Chad. Lucky for him, Charlie was a bad shot. The bullet slammed into the tree two feet to his left, splintering the wood. The man also hadn\u2019t been smart enough to place a silencer on the weapon. He\u2019d just given their position away to the rest of Bree\u2019s family and probably the entire security force at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Charlie. Just let her go. Don\u2019t make this any worse for yourself,\u201d Chad said calmly, keeping his body blocked behind a large tree. He knew the man wouldn\u2019t hesitate to put a bullet in him and he\u2019d be no good to Bree if he was dead.</p><p>\u201cYou got here faster than I thought you would, Chad. If you take one step closer, I\u2019ll put a bullet through your bastard child,\u201d Charlie snarled.</p> <p>Chad had no doubt he\u2019d do just that.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think this can end, Charlie. You know I can\u2019t let you take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d the man screamed as he took a few more steps down the trail, dragging Bree with him. She stared at Chad, her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, how do you plan on leaving?\u201d</p><p>Chad knew he needed to keep saying his name. The more he humanized him, the more he\u2019d think about the bad choices he was making. He looked to Bree, but only for a moment. He had to keep his eye on Charlie. If he could just get one shot in, that\u2019s all it would take to end this whole thing.</p> <p>Bree started to pull against him and Chad wanted to yell at her not to. He didn\u2019t want her getting accidentally shot. He knew Charlie didn\u2019t really want to shoot her and only would if he felt he had no other choice.</p><p>Charlie ranted at her, then jerked against her chest, causing her head to slam against Charlie\u2019s body. He\u2019d pay for the agony he was inflicting on Bree.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Charlie. Why are you doing this?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you really need to ask? She\u2019s mine and always has been, from the very first time I saw her. She was too young then, so I waited. I watched her date other men, but I knew it wasn\u2019t serious. Then, she got on this kick about being independent. I figured that was my perfect time to be with her. She didn\u2019t want her family smothering her, but she needed someone. I figured if I scared her a little bit, she\u2019d come running to me. It was perfect, too, because she\u2019d been getting threatening letters. Trenton showed me. It wasn\u2019t hard to escalate things to break-in\u2019s and stalking. It all would\u2019ve worked out, too, if you hadn\u2019t gotten involved,\u201d Charlie sputtered.</p><p>\u201cEven if Chad and I hadn\u2019t gotten involved, I wouldn\u2019t have come to you, Charlie. I wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. I just wanted to focus on me for a while. What happened with Chad and I wasn\u2019t planned. It just happened,\u201d Bree said gently. She was trying to appeal to the boy she\u2019d know so long.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Bree. You would\u2019ve needed me \u2013 I know it,\u201d Charlie argued. She was telling him they didn\u2019t have a chance, yet he was determined to change her mind.</p> <p>Chad didn\u2019t want him to come to the realization that she\u2019d never be his. Once he had nothing to lose, he had no use for her anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou need help, Charlie. Just let Bree go and we\u2019ll get you all the help you need. Trenton\u2019s on his way. You don\u2019t want him to see you pointing a gun at his sister, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll understand. He made a comment once, back in high school, that it would be great if Bree and I married, cause then we\u2019d be true brothers. I knew then he\u2019d be okay with us being together, no matter how it happened.\u201d</p><p>If Trenton heard that comment, he\u2019d come unglued. If he had any inkling that he\u2019d played a part in his sister\u2019s predicament, he\u2019d be on his knees.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all just sit down and talk about this,\u201d Chad offered.</p><p>\u201cGet away! I\u2019m not telling you again,\u201d Charlie snarled. He pointed his gun toward Chad again and fired, not coming close. Chad was grateful the man had poor aim.</p><p>Charlie was moving further down the path and Chad continued to follow. He kept under cover, but didn\u2019t let them get more than twenty feet ahead of him. Charlie had to have a car nearby. He\u2019d have to expose himself at that point and that\u2019s when Chad would take his shot. There was no way he could let Charlie drive away with her.</p><p>\u201cBree, you\u2019ll grow to love me, I promise. I\u2019m a good guy. This day has just gotten kind of messed up. I\u2019ll raise your baby, then we\u2019ll make more. We could even get rid of this one if you want. Of course that\u2019s what you\u2019ll want, so we\u2019ll have to do that. You may not think so, but you won\u2019t want his baby growing inside you. If we just get rid of it, I can plant my seed in you. We\u2019ll be a family.\u201d</p> <p>Bree\u2019s eyes widened in horror at his words. She started clawing at his arm around her throat. Chad tried to send her a single to calm down, but Charlie was threatening her child and her mother\u2019s instincts had kicked in, full-throttle.</p><p>\u201cStop struggling. You\u2019re only going to get yourself hurt. If you don\u2019t stop now, I\u2019ll shoot you, I will, then I\u2019ll make sure my shot doesn\u2019t miss Chad. He\u2019ll rush forward, try to save you, making him such an easy target,\u201d Charlie sneered.</p><p>His words did their trick. She didn\u2019t want to watch Chad get shot, and she knew Charlie was right. If he shot her, Chad would run forward, disregarding his own safety. She couldn\u2019t get away from him, so she had to trust Chad wouldn\u2019t let her out of his sight. It was the only thing she had to hold on to.</p><p>Charlie reached the other side of the pond and started down another trail. She could hear traffic nearby. Bree\u2019s heart pounded as she realized they were running out of time. If he managed to get her to his vehicle, Chad wouldn\u2019t be able to find them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Charlie?\u201d Trenton\u2019s voice called out as he rounded a corner, not even trying to take cover.</p><p>\u201cTrenton, I know this looks bad, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted. Bree\u2019s supposed to be mine, and then we\u2019ll be related. She just got messed up, being around Chad. It will be fine,\u201d Charlie pled with his friend to understand.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, let my sister go. We\u2019ll sit down and talk. You\u2019re hurting her, Charlie,\u201d Trenton said as he took a few steps forward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset right now, Trenton. Bree doesn\u2019t really know what she wants. Chad has her brainwashed,\u201d Charlie said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Charlie. We\u2019ve been friends a long time. You don\u2019t want to do this. Let Bree go and we\u2019ll talk. We can work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re brainwashed, too. This man has gotten to all of you. Bree loves me, she does! She wants us to be together,\u201d Charlie screamed. The hand that held the gun against Bree\u2019s stomach was shaking. He was starting to really lose it and with Trenton distracting him, Chad moved closer. He had to move soon or he might lose Bree.</p><p>\u201cThis has gone on long enough. Let her go!\u201d Trenton shouted. He stopped talking as a friend and spoke with power in his voice.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyes widened at the tone, and Chad saw the shift in his expression. He was going to make a move.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that,\u201d Charlie screamed as he lifted his arm and pointed the gun at Trenton.</p><p>\u201cGet down,\u201d Chad yelled as he jumped up, his gun aimed at Charlie.</p><p>The next few seconds slowed down as several things happened at once. Bree jerked against Charlie\u2019s slackened hold and fell to the ground at his feet. Charlie\u2019s gun fired, the bullet aiming straight for Trenton. Chad pressed his finger, his deadly aim slamming into Charlie\u2019s chest.</p><p>Bree blacked out as her head slammed into a rock on the ground. She didn\u2019t even have time to know if her brother or Chad were okay.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Chad ran toward Bree, too late to catch her fall. His insides clenched as he saw blood spread out from her temple. He had to make sure Charlie was down before he could tend to her, though.</p><p>He quickly approached the man and kicked his dropped gun out of the way. He knelt by him and placed his fingers on his throat.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Charlie wasn\u2019t going to hurt anyone else ever again.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d Trenton called as he stumbled forward.</p><p>Chad looked at him, startled by the blood.</p><p>\u201cLooks like his aim improved when he was aiming for me,\u201d Trenton said, sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is everyone else?\u201d Chad yelled. Trenton had been shot in the stomach. He needed to be admitted for surgery immediately and Chad still didn\u2019t know how bad Bree had hit her head.</p><p>He knelt down next to Bree as he heard voices approaching. He gently lifted her head, relieved when he saw only a small cut. Head wounds always bled more than average. He knew it wasn\u2019t too bad, but he still wanted her checked into the hospital.</p><p>He lifted her in his arms as several people arrived, shouts ringing out around them. Security personnel were there with their guns drawn, and several medical members were moving toward him. One stopped to help Trenton, ordering a stretcher be brought down right away. Another approached Bree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her. I\u2019ll bring her up to the hospital,\u201d Chad insisted. He wasn\u2019t letting her out of his arms until he released her into a hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone better start talking now,\u201d the sheriff yelled as he approached the scene. One person dead on the ground, one passed out, and another bleeding, barely able to keep on his feet.</p><p>\u201cThis is Bree Anderson\u2019s stalker. He was trying to abduct her. I was in pursuit. Her brother showed up, and the situation escalated. The perpetrator, Charlie, aimed and fired at Trenton Anderson, Bree jerked forward, so I had no other choice but to shoot. I don\u2019t miss,\u201d Chad explained.</p><p>There was no need to go into a further explanation at that moment; they\u2019d do that once Bree and Trenton were patched up. He knew all about the paperwork involved when someone was killed, whether it was self-defense, or not.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who is not immediately needed, get the hell off my crime scene. Deputy, tape this area off. The rest of you, get moving. Get the injured into the hospital and anybody who witnessed this, don\u2019t even think about leaving. I want statements,\u201d the sheriff commanded. Chad had instant respect for the man.</p><p>He nodded his assent, then moved quickly up the trail and walked with Bree into the E.R. She got admitted immediately, everyone was already buzzing about the shootout at their serenity pond.</p><p>Bree woke up in a hospital bed once again and immediately jerked forward. Chad! Trenton! She looked around frantically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bree. Everyone is fine,\u201d Chad quickly assured her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, calming at seeing Chad sitting next to her looking strong and assured.</p><p>Chad quickly filled her in, letting her know Charlie was dead. She lowered her eyes, feeling empathy for the man. She\u2019d known him her entire life and hadn\u2019t wanted him dead. He\u2019d needed help, but she couldn\u2019t fight the twinge of relief at knowing he wouldn\u2019t ever come after her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrenton is fine. He was shot in the stomach, but it missed all major organs. He came out of surgery a couple hours ago and your family has been going back and forth between your room, your brother\u2019s, and your father\u2019s. The hospital is filled with Andersons,\u201d he finished with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI feel sorry for the staff,\u201d Bree said with an attempt at humor.</p><p>\u201cYes, they may go on strike at any moment if Joseph doesn\u2019t calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d Joseph said as he stepped into the room and nudged Chad out of the way so he could get closer to Bree. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you. Your father is beside himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Uncle Joseph. Really, I am,\u201d Bree assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through so much. I\u2019m sorry, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a baby, Uncle,\u201d she said, but there wasn\u2019t any bite to her words. Joseph leaned down and kissed her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cChad, I don\u2019t know how I could ever express my gratitude to you,\u201d Joseph told him.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not necessary, Joseph. Your family has always been there for me, and I\u2019m more than happy to do anything at all for you,\u201d Chad responded.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that apply to me, too? I have a few things I\u2019d like for you to do for me,\u201d Bree said with a wink. She got immense satisfaction at the look of shock on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go to the ends of the earth for you,\u201d Chad replied. Bree couldn\u2019t tell if he was serious or not. At times, she just couldn\u2019t read him at all.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving my life. You are everything I\u2019d ever wish for as a father to my child. Strong, passionate, fierce, and the greatest man I know,\u201d Bree said. She loved him so very much. She still hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to tell him she had her memory back, yet.</p><p>\u201cOnly because you make me that way,\u201d he replied as he bent down and kissed her gently.</p><p>\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI should\u2019ve said something sooner, but everything has kept happening. My amnesia\u2019s gone,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>Bree watched as Chad\u2019s eyes rounded. She could see the nervousness in him, but didn\u2019t understand why. She would think he\u2019d be happy she had her memories back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, baby,\u201d he finally said, though he still looked upset.</p><p>\u201cI have another confession,\u201d she said, her stomach rolling over.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say that would upset me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Chad. I love you so much that the thought of not being with you kills me,\u201d she whispered as she looked at him with rounded eyes.</p><p>Chad stared at her in wonder for several moments, before his face split in a huge grin. He leaned down and took her mouth with his, kissing her with all of his love and passion. He brought his hand up and caressed her face, loving her so much, he felt close to bursting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for happy moments, but I think I\u2019ll leave the two of you alone,\u201d Joseph said with a chuckle, then they heard the door quietly close behind him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too, Bree. So much so that the thought of not having you in my life is unbearable. I can\u2019t stand the thought of not being with you, not even for one night. You\u2019ve slowly but surely carved a place in my heart, and now, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>All talking ceased as he gently stretched his body out next to hers on the bed and kissed her so intensely, her monitors started going off.</p><p>They had to stop when the nursing staff rushed in, thinking something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly inappropriate, Mr. Redington,\u201d the nurse scolded while making him climb out of her bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bree murmured. The nurse gave her a stern look before leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cThat was mortifying,\u201d Bree admitted.</p><p>Chad began laughing before he bent down and gave her one last gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find out how soon I can get you out of here. I want to take you home,\u201d Chad said as he rushed from the room to find the doctor.</p><p>Bree laid there and wondered how something that had started out so terrifying could end so well. She\u2019d gained her independence only to find she didn\u2019t need it. She had a wonderful family she greatly loved and who would always be overprotective, which now didn\u2019t seem so bad. She also had a wonderful man who had walked into her life and taken her by complete surprise. Her life had gone from one extreme to the other and that was just fine with her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her family to rush through her doors, surround her bed and ask her dozens of questions about her health. She smiled, loving every second of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been so worried about you,\u201d Jennifer exclaimed as she bent down and gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to quit getting in shootouts,\u201d Amy added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, there are better ways to get a day of pampering other than getting admitted to a hospital,\u201d Cassie added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking a spa would be supremely more comfortable than in here,\u201d Jessica joined in with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I think you\u2019re all right. As soon as these people realize I\u2019m fine, you can cart me away for a day of pampering. I think I\u2019ve earned it,\u201d Bree said. She adored her cousins and in-laws. They were wonderful women. She realized the men were starting to get outnumbered at least, with all the marriages and babies being born. She finally didn\u2019t feel like the minority.</p><p>The men eventually left the women to chat and Bree felt herself relax, enjoying catching up on the latest family gossip.</p><p>A little while later, Chad stepped through the door carrying a huge bouquet of mixed flowers and a large bag of chocolate. Ah, a man after her own heart. He stopped in his tracks at the sight of the room full of women. Bree had to fight the giggle wanting to escape at his look of panic.</p><p>\u201cI can come back in a while,\u201d he said as he set the vase on her nightstand.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, you can be here, too,\u201d Jennifer spoke up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait. I want to talk to Bree alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s just going to tell us anything you say, so you might as well talk to her with us here. It saves time,\u201d Cassie said with her trademark smile.</p><p>Chad looked at each of the women, then at Cassie. He squared his shoulders, then dropped to his knee next to her bed. Bree\u2019s eyes widened as she realized what he was doing. The room became instantly silent as all eyes moved from Chad to Bree and back again.</p><p>\u201cBrianne Lynn Anderson, I know I asked before, and not in the best way, but circumstances have now changed. I love you with all my heart and I want you by my side each and every day. I want to watch your beautiful body change with the growth of our child, and then I want to do it all over again as many times as you want. I\u2019ll treat you like royalty, worship you day and night. I love you and it would be the greatest honor if you\u2019d agree to be my wife,\u201d Chad asked. His voice became a bit choked at the end.</p><p>Bree didn\u2019t even try to stop the tears that were falling down her face. He was everything she could have ever wanted and so much more. She\u2019d never let him get away. From his pocket, Chad retrieved a small box and opened it, showcasing a beautiful solitaire diamond nestled in an exquisite setting.</p><p>\u201cYes, nothing would make me happier,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Chad gripped her hand, his own slightly shaking as he slipped the ring on her finger. She looked at their joined fingers and knew that\u2019s how their life would be.</p><p>There was a round of applause and many congratulations as everyone beamed at the happy couple.</p><p>\u201cDid I just hear we have a wedding to plan?\u201d Joseph said as he stepped in the room. Bree turned stunned eyes on her uncle. He could be a thousand miles away and hear the word wedding if it was spoken by one of his family members.</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle Joseph, we\u2019re getting married,\u201d Bree said as she beamed at him, then lifted her hand to show him her beautiful ring.</p><p>\u201cAh, that makes me so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see your father. We have much to do... much to do,\u201d he muttered, his head already in planning mode. Bree laughed as he exited the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to run to Vegas?\u201d Chad asked, only partially kidding. He knew what Joseph was like.</p><p>\u201cWe could never start our marriage that way. You\u2019ll just have to deal with my family,\u201d she said, knowing he was man enough for the challenge.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cI knew we could do it, even with your daughter fighting us the entire way,\u201d Joseph said as he filled his brother in on Bree\u2019s upcoming nuptials.</p><p>\u201cI hate being confined to this stinking bed. These doctors are being ridiculous,\u201d George pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the doctors on this one, brother. You gave us all a good scare,\u201d Joseph said with suspiciously bright eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start in on that,\u201d George choked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only had our family back together for a couple years. I don\u2019t want anything happening now. We have a wedding to plan,\u201d Joseph said while taking his brother\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>\u201cAnd we still have one child to marry off,\u201d George added, the twinkle back in his eye.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that will be an easy task. Cassie\u2019s friend, Kinsey has been here all day, and sparks are still flying between her and Austin. I think the two of them just need a little push. They\u2019re running scared, and I think I have the perfect plan in place to give them the shove they both need,\u201d Joseph said with delight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me hanging, Joseph. I need something to do other than watch this terrible television and stare at my monitors,\u201d George demanded.</p><p>Joseph leaned in and let the planning begin. </p> </body></html>"]
