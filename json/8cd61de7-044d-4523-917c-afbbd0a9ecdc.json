But Jensen was frustratingly unaffected by her icy demeanor around him. He acted as if he didn\u2019t have a clue that he bugged the shit out of her. But no, she imagined he knew exactly how much he bothered her, and he just chose to ignore it. Stubborn, impossible, completely overbearing man. Precisely the kind of man she avoided at all costs.</p><p>Only he was her boss. That put another sour expression on her face. Carson had been her boss, he and Dash. And then when her brother had died three years ago, Dash had become her only boss and she had liked it that way.</p> <p>Jensen should hire his own damn personal assistant, but he seemed perfectly content to dump his workload on Kylie and annoy the piss out of her in the process.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she said in a tone to match her glare. \u201cNice to know I pass muster around here.\u201d</p><p>Jensen strolled into her office, uninvited. But then he\u2019d never come in here if he waited for an invitation. Kylie had made it clear she didn\u2019t want him anywhere near her. Another thing he chose to ignore.</p><p>He took a seat in one of the chairs in front of her desk, and she made a mental note to get rid of them. They were unnecessary. Jensen and Dash did all the entertaining of their clients. There wasn\u2019t a need for anyone to ever enter her office. She did her job quietly and efficiently, never drawing attention to herself. Only for some reason, Jensen seemed determined to invade her personal space. A fact that had increasingly frustrated her in the weeks since he\u2019d joined Dash in their consulting firm.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t sleeping,\u201d he said in that same straightforward tone he\u2019d used to tell her she looked like hell.</p> <p>His gaze penetrated her, raking over her features, and she knew what he saw. What she saw in the mirror every morning. Eyes haunted with the past. Deep shadows seemingly permanently etched underneath her eyes. She knew what she looked like. She didn\u2019t need this arrogant as**ole to point it out to her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that my appearance or sleep habits in any way interfered with my duties here.\u201d</p><p>Her sarcasm was wasted because Jensen just let it roll off him, much like he did everything else. Never once had she seen him express any sort of emotion. He didn\u2019t get upset or angry but neither had she ever seen him express happiness or excitement. Nothing but that steady gaze that saw too much. Peeling back the layers of her skin\u2014and her mind. She hated it. She felt like a bug under a microscope. She wouldn\u2019t put it past him to know when she went to the damn bathroom.</p><p>He was a man who nothing escaped his notice. He was quiet, observant. He stood back and observed others. It suited him well for the career he\u2019d chosen. But it discomfited her. He could save his scrutiny for the consulting jobs he and Dash took on. Those companies needed his unbiased and discerning eye. She sure as hell didn\u2019t need it or want it.</p><p>\u201cYou do a damn fine job, Kylie. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever given you reason to doubt my confidence in your abilities. If I have, then I apologize. Dash and I would certainly be lost without you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise over the unexpected praise, and unwanted color washed into her cheeks, warming her skin. She didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the brief surge of pleasure his veiled compliment had brought.</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you slept?\u201d he asked pointedly, still staring at her, studying intently.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cJust like I do every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the growl in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re even getting a few hours of sleep I\u2019d find that hard to believe. Why don\u2019t you take some time off? Go somewhere. Relax. Take a vacation. Dash says you\u2019ve never once taken off. Only when Carson died.\u201d</p><p>Kylie flinched, unable to temper the surge of grief that hit her square in the chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can say it,\u201d Jensen said in an almost brutal tone. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, Kylie. Joss has moved on so why can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She slapped her palms down on her desk and stood, staring him down, not giving a single inch.</p> <p>\u201cHe was my family,\u201d she hissed. \u201cMy only family. He was all I had left in the world. He was the only person who loved me, who protected me, and now he\u2019s gone. If you think I can just blithely forget that and go on about my life like his death didn\u2019t affect me, you can go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Finally some emotion, Kylie. Even if you\u2019re spitting mad. But at least you\u2019re not acting like some goddamn robot working on autopilot. Would it kill you to be human like the rest of us? Shit happens. You deal with it, pick up the pieces and move on. Just like everyone else in the human race. You aren\u2019t special. You aren\u2019t the only person who\u2019s had a shitty past and who\u2019s lost someone they love.\u201d</p><p>Fury clouded her vision, making the room go hazy. Anger tightened every one of her features and for a moment she was paralyzed, unable to respond around the knot in her throat choking her.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she raged. \u201cWho the hell are you to judge me? You don\u2019t know a goddamn thing about me. Get the hell out of my office and don\u2019t come back. If you want or need something, you can damn well e-mail me, call me or text. But do not come back into my office.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react to her outburst. To her astonishment, a faint smile glimmered on his lips.</p><p>\u201cI know a hell of a lot more about you than you think. But you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know everything. But I plan to change that. Starting now. You and I are going to be working very closely over the next few weeks because Dash and Joss are going on their honeymoon. We\u2019re trying to land a contract with Simpson &amp; Gerrick Oil and it\u2019s a big one. They\u2019re downsizing and they want to cut the fat. Get rid of the unproductive workers. Rearrange duties. Decide who goes and who stays. And that\u2019s going to fall on you and me.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t have any experience in handling that. I work in the background, Jensen. You know that. I run the office. You and Dash are the cutthroats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have the heart for it, do you, Kylie?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. Admitting her weaknesses wasn\u2019t on her top-ten list of things to reveal.</p><p>\u201cYou act the bitch. You come across as abrasive, even to the people who love you. I wonder why? Are you so afraid of loving someone, of getting close to someone and losing them like you lost Carson? Because you don\u2019t fool me, Kylie. Not in the least. Underneath that tough-as-nails exterior lies a vulnerable, bighearted woman and she\u2019s who I want to pull out. And I will. Take it to the bank, sweetheart. You and I are going to be seeing a lot more of one another so get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t have to put up with this in my own office.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s said. It doesn\u2019t change what will be. And what will be is you and me, Kylie. I go after what I want and I don\u2019t fail. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, her blood pressure rising, her breath hitching in her throat. His words terrified her and yet there was something about them that made her pulse kick up several notches.</p><p>Jensen Tucker was everything she didn\u2019t want in a man. Not that she wanted any man. But especially not a dominant, alpha, overbearing male. There was no way in hell she\u2019d ever put herself in a position of vulnerability again and no matter what woman was with Jensen, she\u2019d definitely be vulnerable. Hell, she\u2019d be eaten alive. Jensen would chew her up and spit her out in ten seconds flat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d she said in a frigid tone. \u201cIt will never happen. And so help me, if you ever even hint about this again, I\u2019ll slap a sexual harassment suit on you so fast your head will spin.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, surprising her with his reaction. He stared lazily at her, his gaze stroking up and down her body, making her feel as though he\u2019d just undressed her.</p><p>\u201cSomething else you should know about me, sweetheart. I love a challenge. Telling me no is like waving a red flag in front of a pissed-off bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart. Save it for a woman who gives a damn because I\u2019m not her.\u201d</p><p>His grin got bigger and she swore this was the first time she\u2019d actually seen the man smile. He was always so quiet and brooding. He didn\u2019t frown, but he didn\u2019t smile either. He always wore an inscrutable expression that drove her crazy because she never had any clue what he was thinking.</p><p>Only now she got the distinct impression he\u2019d been thinking about her. A lot.</p><p>She mentally went through every single one of her favorite four-letter curse words and added a few with extra syllables for good measure.</p><p>\u201cLet me make this simple for you since you love a challenge. I\u2019m not a challenge, Jensen. I will never be a challenge because you don\u2019t have a chance in hell with me. You\u2019re out of your goddamn mind anyway. What the hell would a man like you see in me? According to you I\u2019m scared of my own shadow. I\u2019m timid, apparently I look like hell and have as many issues as People magazine.\u201d</p><p>He rose, ignoring her outburst, which only infuriated her more. He seemed utterly unfazed by her cutting remarks. Then he leaned over the desk so they were nose to nose. To her surprise he traced one finger over the dark smudges under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet some help, Kylie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cGo to a doctor. Get something to help you sleep. See a shrink if that\u2019s what it will take. You can\u2019t keep up like this forever. Sooner or later you\u2019re going to crack. And then you\u2019re going to fall apart and shatter. If you won\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for the people who love you and are worried sick about you.\u201d</p><p>And then before she could respond to that particular bit of nonsense, he turned and strode out of her office, closing the door with a soft bang.</p><p>She sagged into her chair and dropped her face into her hands, suddenly so weary that she couldn\u2019t even hold her own head up.</p><p>He was right and that pissed her off even more. She was walking a very fine line between sanity and insanity. She wasn\u2019t sleeping. Her sleep was too fractured by nightmares. Of the past. The demons of her past and how they still controlled her present.</p><p>But see a shrink? Ask her doctor for sleeping pills? That would be like admitting defeat and she was not a quitter, damn it. Not her. She\u2019d survived hell and she was past that now. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Or was she every bit the prisoner now that she\u2019d been as a child? Her father\u2019s abuse was as recent as yesterday in her mind. Because she couldn\u2019t forget. She couldn\u2019t just get over it. Couldn\u2019t make peace with her past.</p><p>She closed her eyes, another wave of fatigue nearly flattening her. Sleep. She just needed one night without the nightmares that visited her so frequently. Maybe she\u2019d stop on the way home and get some over-the-counter sleep aids at the pharmacy. Then there would be no embarrassing, weak trip to the doctor and certainly no visits to a damn shrink where she\u2019d lie on a couch and bare her soul.</p><p>Oh hell no. Hell would freeze over before she ever allowed anyone to know her torment and shame.</p><p>WHAT was it about the woman that drove him to the brink of insanity? Jensen was absorbed in his thoughts as he stalked back to his office. He had a mountain of paperwork, contracts to look over and sign, if no changes were necessary. For the next two weeks, he was solidly at the helm while Dash took Joss away on their honeymoon.</p><p>Dash was happy. Disgustingly so. Now that he\u2019d made up for his fuck-up of monumental proportions. Joss was a good woman. The best. Dash was damn lucky to have his heart\u2019s desire. A beautiful, submissive woman who\u2019d granted Dash everything. Her trust, her love and her complete surrender.</p><p>In other words, the complete opposite of the woman who preoccupied so much of Jensen\u2019s thoughts lately.</p><p>Kylie Breckenridge was as prickly as a cactus and yet every time she sent him one of her withering gazes, he got a hard-on from hell. He wanted her so damn much that he couldn\u2019t breathe around her. And that pissed him off.</p><p>She was a woman who was strictly off-limits to him. The complete antithesis of the women he liked to fuck. And he said f**k because that\u2019s what it was. His heart was certainly never involved. His need for control precluded any warm and fuzzy thoughts.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was a bastard to the women he dominated. He made certain they were cared for, provided for and that they were sexually satisfied.</p><p>But Kylie?</p><p>Hell. A dominant, alpha male was the very last thing she wanted. If she wanted any man at all. Not that he could blame her. Dash had told him of Kylie\u2019s childhood. It made him shake with rage that she\u2019d been so abused, so shattered by the one person in her life she should have been able to trust for absolute protection. Her father.</p><p>But when he looked at her, he saw past that abrasive exterior and what he glimpsed made his heart soften to the point of aching. It made him want to hold her, cherish her, show her how it could be with a man who had her best interests at heart. A man who cared about her.</p><p>Hell, did he care? That was the million-dollar question. He cared, but to what extent? Was she, as he\u2019d said, simply a challenge? Something to conquer before he moved on to the next? He was a man who thrived on challenges. It was what had made him successful at a very early age. So just how much did he care about Kylie Breckenridge? Because she wasn\u2019t a woman to trifle with. She\u2019d had enough hurt for two lifetimes, and he damn sure didn\u2019t want to be yet another man who destroyed her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fool himself into thinking he could \u201cfix\u201d her. No one could do that but her. But she had to want to be fixed, and so far she\u2019d shown no signs of doing it herself. Which increased his desire to step in, take over and push her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The urge to dominate was powerful. It beat like his pulse, strong with anticipation, even as he knew Kylie was not a woman to dominate. She wasn\u2019t a woman who\u2019d submit. Ever. Not physically. But dominance was so much more than the physical trappings that often accompanied such a relationship. Emotional surrender was much more powerful, and perhaps that was what he craved when he looked into those shadowed eyes of hers.</p><p>She needed a man who\u2019d cherish her, protect her from any and all hurts, provide shelter for her. A place of refuge from the rest of the world. She needed a man she could turn to and trust unerringly in his ability to shield her from any threat. Even those that weren\u2019t physical, but emotional, because those were hurts far worse than physical ones.</p><p>She was infinitely fragile. So very vulnerable. He watched her. He watched her a damn lot, and when she didn\u2019t realize others were observing her, she lost the icy fa\u00e7ade and he got a glimpse of the frightened young girl behind the ballsy exterior.</p><p>She was complex, a puzzle, one he had every intention of figuring out. But how?</p> <p>His normal method of operation certainly wouldn\u2019t work with her. There was no approaching her, taking control, laying down the law according to him and telling her the way it would be. He\u2019d attempted to do precisely that just moments ago and it had been like hitting a brick wall.</p><p>She\u2019d remove his balls with a rusty knife if he pushed her that way again and, well, he wouldn\u2019t be able to blame her.</p><p>She had no reason to trust him whatsoever, but damn if he didn\u2019t want to get behind those carefully erected barriers she threw up. It was only with the people closest to her that she let her guard down and he got a taste of the real Kylie.</p><p>Soft. Sweet. Fiercely loyal and protective of her loved ones.</p><p>He wanted to teach her that not all men were bastards. He wanted to show her that dominance did not equal pain or humiliation. That dominance was so much more. Emotional surrender was the most powerful of all, but it also made people so much more vulnerable. And that would absolutely frighten her as much as the more physical aspects of dominance and submission.</p> <p>This was a woman he\u2019d have to tread very lightly with. His old approach would have to be thrown out the window and he\u2019d have to come up with something new. She was, as he\u2019d said, a challenge. One that he had every intention of overcoming. The how hadn\u2019t occurred to him. Yet. But he wasn\u2019t a quitter. He\u2019d been absolutely serious when he\u2019d told her that he went after what he wanted and he didn\u2019t fail. Ever.</p><p>There was a first time for everything, or so the saying went. But he\u2019d be damned if his first failure would be Kylie Breckenridge.</p><p>TWO</p><p>\u201cKYLIE, can you come into my office?\u201d Jensen said over the intercom.</p><p>He knew the summons would annoy her, but she\u2019d been clear about wanting him to stay out of her office\u2014her space\u2014and so he\u2019d make her come to him. Not an unreasonable request from a boss to his personal assistant.</p><p>\u201cRight away, sir,\u201d she said in a crisp tone that made him smile.</p> <p>She was so determined to keep their relationship, if you could even say they had a relationship, strictly impersonal and confined to boss and employee.</p><p>He knew she hated that Dash was out of the office for an extended period of time because Dash usually acted as a buffer between Jensen and Kylie. Most of the requests came from Dash, even ones that involved Jensen, because Dash sought to protect her.</p><p>But enough was enough. If they were to work together long-term, and he had every intention of doing just that, Kylie had to learn to deal with Jensen. And he planned to push her. She was extremely intelligent. She had an MBA and, in his opinion, that degree was wasted in her current position. It was one she was comfortable in, and he knew she liked it that way.</p><p>She liked nothing that pushed her out of her comfort zone. She liked routine\u2014a trait they shared, though it would annoy her that the two of them had anything in common.</p><p>But in fact, they had far more in common than Kylie knew or would admit to. They were both disciplined people who liked control. He was fully prepared to be involved in a battle of wills, a battle he intended to win. He just hoped he didn\u2019t push her to the point of her walking away from her job.</p><p>A moment later, Kylie appeared at the door, her features locked and impassive as she stared coolly at him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can drop the sir,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cYou don\u2019t call Dash sir. My name is sufficient. Call me Jensen or call me nothing at all.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips thinned and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cIs everything going to be a battle with you, Kylie? It was a simple enough request. Say it. Say my name,\u201d he challenged. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something . . . Jensen?\u201d</p><p>His name came out strangled-sounding, as if she\u2019d had to force it from her lips. It was a start.</p><p>He motioned her to the seat in front of his desk. Reluctantly she walked over and then perched on the edge of the chair, her hands folded primly in front of her, but she had the look of an animal prepared to bolt at the first sign of danger. He doubted she knew that she telegraphed her fear so broadly. Her eyes were wide, her nostrils flaring, and he could see the pulse beating a rapid staccato at her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leap across the desk and attack you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019d kick your ass if you tried.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed, and her eyes widened in surprise. She looked . . . shocked. He sobered and glanced curiously at her. \u201cWhat was that look for?\u201d</p><p>She immediately dropped her gaze and remained silent.</p><p>\u201cKylie?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>She sighed and then lifted her head, her stare rebellious, her chin thrust upward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never seen you laugh. Or smile, really. In my office earlier was the first time I\u2019ve seen you look anything but mildly interested. You don\u2019t show your emotions much. No one can ever tell what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow quirked upward. So she had been studying him. She knew enough about him for him to realize she\u2019d spent a lot of time observing him and his reactions.</p><p>His features relaxed into a smile, as he noted again her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of being an emotionless, uptight bastard by more than one person,\u201d he said in amusement. \u201cPerhaps you draw out another side to me that no one else sees.\u201d</p><p>She looked disgruntled by that suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something?\u201d she prompted, obviously anxious for the meeting to be over.</p><p>He had no such plans for her to scurry back to the safety of her office where she shut the rest of the world out. He knew she went straight home every day. Didn\u2019t have a social life unless you counted her lunches with Chessy and Joss, her two best friends. In fact, their circle of friends were the only people Kylie had any sort of a connection to.</p><p>It had to be a lonely life and he hated that for her. Hated that her past had shaped her future\u2014was still shaping her future\u2014and that she didn\u2019t seem to be able to shake off the bonds of her childhood.</p><p>He shuffled the stack of papers in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to study up on these profiles. As I said in your office, S&amp;G Oil is downsizing one of their refineries. They need to cut one hundred million in expenses so they\u2019re looking for ways to combine jobs. They want to eliminate at least thirty positions and cut nonessential expenses, and they want us to find those for them.\u201d</p><p>She was clearly flabbergasted by his request.</p><p>\u201cBut Jensen, I know nothing about this sort of thing. I\u2019m an administrative assistant.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, watching her reaction to his expression. She wasn\u2019t indifferent to him and that likely pissed her off all the more.</p><p>\u201cI want you to learn,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWhen Carson was alive, he and Dash were looking to take on a third partner. They certainly had the business. After Carson died it was too much for Dash to handle, and he had to work his ass off to keep the business solvent until he brought me in. There is still a need for a third partner and you have the credentials. All you lack is experience.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open and she was speechless. He felt smug over causing that anomaly. The woman was never short on retorts.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to be a partner?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cConsider this your trial by fire. It won\u2019t happen today or tomorrow or even over the next few months, but there\u2019s no reason to seek out another partner when we have a perfectly capable person working with us already. You know everything that goes on in this office, Kylie. Every single piece of information is passed through you. You know all our clients. You schedule our meetings. You absolutely know the ins and outs of this business. There is no reason you shouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to be promoted.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the papers he\u2019d shoved across his desk to her. The information she\u2019d collected and organized for him and Dash. She was certainly acquainted with the process.</p><p>He could swear excitement flared in her eyes, but it was gone almost before it fully registered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cWe have a meeting with the CFO of S&amp;G in three days\u2019 time. I want you to accompany me. You have three days to familiarize yourself with their business. The positions, salaries and duties of each employee listed. Their overhead and every single penny they have in expenses. I want you to draw up your own plan and present it to me in two days. I want your ideas and then we\u2019ll discuss before you and I meet with the CFO.\u201d</p><p>She gaped incredulously at him. \u201cYou\u2019d trust this big of a contract with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that I\u2019d agree with your ideas,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cMerely that I want to see them. We\u2019ll put our heads together and see what we agree\u2014and disagree\u2014on, and then we\u2019ll put together a plan that incorporates both our ideas before we attend that meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>But he could see the spark in her eyes. She loved a challenge every bit as much as he did. He hadn\u2019t been wrong. She was wasted in her position as an administrative assistant. It was too safe. She could do that job in her sleep. She needed this. Something to get her blood pumping and remind her that she was alive.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you, Kylie. Can you say the same about yourself?\u201d</p><p>This time fire shone in her eyes and he held back the grin of triumph. Oh yes, she loved a good challenge, and perhaps she hadn\u2019t been challenged in such a way ever. Dash had been far too easy on her. Not that he expected Dash to be a flaming asshole, but he\u2019d wrapped Kylie in cotton after Carson\u2019s death, and from all Dash had said, Carson had wrapped her in that same cotton when he was alive. Neither man wanting to do anything to hurt this fragile woman.</p><p>But her fragility disguised the intelligent, fiery woman underneath that shell and Jensen intended to draw her out. Dash would likely kick his ass if he knew what Jensen was doing, but for the next two weeks, Jensen was in control and Dash would be completely oblivious to anything business related\u2014as he should be. And Jensen intended to make the most of those two weeks.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, resolve tight in her voice. \u201cWhen do you want to meet to go over my proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday night. Dinner at Capitol Grill. I know you and the girls like the Lux Caf\u00e9, but I want something quieter and more intimate if we\u2019re to discuss something confidential. I can arrange for a table in a quiet corner where we won\u2019t be overheard.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s brow furrowed into a frown and he could literally see the wheels spinning in her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat would be more private than here in the office?\u201d she asked. \u201cCertainly dinner isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to say to that, though he could see she had no liking for the idea of them having dinner together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a reservation for seven,\u201d he continued, as if he were oblivious to her discomfort. \u201cI\u2019ll read your proposal beforehand and we\u2019ll discuss it over dinner. I\u2019ll prepare the final analysis before our meeting with the CFO. I\u2019ll pick you up at your house at eight Thursday morning and we\u2019ll ride together to meet with S&amp;G\u2019s CFO in his office.\u201d</p><p>He could tell she was caught in an epic battle with herself. She did not want to have dinner with him or even meet him outside of work, nor did she want to ride with him to their meeting, but neither did she want to pass up the opportunity he\u2019d presented her with.</p><p>She bit her lip in consternation, and he\u2019d never wanted something so badly as to reach across the desk, thumb her lip free and then kiss away the damage she was doing to the tender flesh. His dick reacted to that image, and he was glad he was seated behind his desk where she couldn\u2019t see his physical reaction to her. She\u2019d tuck tail and run for the hills, and she\u2019d very likely tender her resignation within the hour.</p><p>He sighed, silently commanding his dick to behave. Not that it did a bit of good because the woman just did it for him and he couldn\u2019t even explain why. Challenge. She was a challenge. That had to be it. Because he simply couldn\u2019t resist a challenge. Even as he reasoned away his inexplicable attraction to a woman who in no way returned it, he knew he was a goddamn liar.</p><p>She riled every single one of his protective instincts. She made him want to treat her gently, cherish her and protect her from anything that could ever hurt her, physically or emotionally.</p><p>Damn it, he wanted to show her that not all men were assholes. That not all dominant men were focused so solidly on the more physical aspects of dominance. Emotional surrender was what he was after with Kylie. He\u2019d never mark her, never tie her up. Never take a flogger to her tender flesh. He\u2019d never do anything to frighten her or make her feel as vulnerable as she\u2019d felt in the past in the hands of a monster. He\u2019d never do anything to remind her of her past abuse. He\u2019d die before allowing that to happen. He too had demons he fought, and it would have made him physically ill to ever do anything to a woman that could be construed as abuse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He just wanted . . . her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally said in a husky voice that made him go even harder. Because there was capitulation in her voice. Not quite submission, but it was close and it fired his blood, made it sing through his veins, because just this once, he\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the restaurant at seven,\u201d she said.</p><p>She lifted her gaze challengingly to his, as if to dare him to argue with her statement. He merely smiled back. He\u2019d allow her this small victory because the bigger one was already his. Dinner. Just the two of them. Yeah, they\u2019d talk business, but he also planned to delve deeper into this intriguing woman. Figure out what made her tick. And he\u2019d pick her up the next day and drive her to their meeting. Which meant she was dependent on him the entire day.</p><p>He liked that idea. Liked it too damn much. Her dependent on him. The hell he\u2019d ever let her down or make her regret her grudging trust. Oh, he knew she didn\u2019t trust him yet. That would be the biggest hurdle to overcome. Baby steps. Take it one small victory at a time.</p><p>\u201cSeven it is,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She was surprised. It showed on her face. She had already been bracing herself for an argument, her shoulders squared and chin thrust upward in defiance. Even that aroused him, almost violently.</p><p>He might like submissive women, but submissive didn\u2019t mean being a doormat. He loved an independent woman perfectly capable of making her own choices. Submissive women, or at least the ones he\u2019d been with, chose to submit. Chose to offer their surrender into his keeping. And that was a very powerful thing indeed.</p><p>He wanted a strong woman. Someone who didn\u2019t need him and what he offered but wanted it. That made all the difference to him. He wanted someone who could stand up for herself and not back down. Who would go toe-to-toe with him and meet him halfway.</p><p>In return? He\u2019d lay the world at her feet. She\u2019d never want for anything he could give her. He\u2019d pamper her, utterly adore her, worship her and cherish her.</p><p>He ached to do that for Kylie. Had ached for that since the very first time he\u2019d met her when they\u2019d had dinner at Dash\u2019s that night. He\u2019d seen the shadows under her eyes, had seen the torment she hid from the world. And he wanted nothing more than to be a balm to the agony she\u2019d endured and still endured to this day.</p><p>But it would require infinite patience on his part. Patience had never been high on his list of good qualities, but for the right woman? He could exert the patience of Job.</p><p>She gathered the papers, already scanning the contents. He could see her mind working furiously, taking it all in. He knew well she was an extremely intelligent woman with an eye for business. Just as he knew she was wasted in her current job. Even if things never worked out for them the way he intended, she\u2019d still make a valuable asset as a partner one day. If he didn\u2019t frighten her away first.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all,\u201d she said absently, still absorbed in the paperwork, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to my office and start going over this. I\u2019ll have my ideas ready by our dinner Wednesday night.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, taking in her adorable features. For just one moment, the shadows that seemed a permanent fixture in her eyes had been removed and a determined fire had replaced them. He could sense her excitement, her anticipation. She wanted to prove herself. She was rising to his challenge beautifully and he couldn\u2019t wait to see the results.</p><p>He knew she wouldn\u2019t let him down. That she was far more intelligent than either Carson or Dash gave her credit for. It wasn\u2019t that either man belittled her or didn\u2019t believe in her abilities. They were just too emotionally involved and their instincts were to protect her. He understood it, even agreed with them to a certain point.</p><p>But they\u2019d done her no favors by sheltering her so vigorously. She needed more of a challenge. Needed an outlet for her analytical mind and intelligence. A trained monkey could do her current job. Answer phones, schedule appointments, ready contracts for signature and run the office.</p><p>But he was offering her a hell of a lot more.</p><p>Equality.</p><p>And when in her life had she ever felt she was an equal to anyone else? She\u2019d lived her life as a victim. With good reason. But it was time to move beyond being that victim and become a survivor. A survivor who rose above her past and kicked the present\u2019s ass.</p><p>If he could have any part in that at all, whether they entered a relationship or not, he\u2019d be fiercely proud of her.</p><p>THREE</p><p>SHE couldn\u2019t believe she was following through with this lunacy. Kylie rolled to a stop in front of the Capitol Grill and the valet opened her car door to assist her out. After collecting her ticket she headed inside the darkened interior.</p> <p>The restaurant screamed rich old farts, or at least it catered to that crowd. The furnishings were very masculine and portraits of rich old farts even dotted the walls. She glanced down selfconsciously, wondering if she was dressed appropriately for this joint. The other women in the waiting area all wore cocktail dresses and plenty of expensive jewelry with elegant, upswept hairdos.</p><p>Kylie had worn her hair down. It was either that or a ponytail, and even she wasn\u2019t gauche enough to sport a ponytail to a restaurant like this. But she\u2019d worn a simple black sheath with no sparkles or adornments. It fell to her knees with a gentle flare, giving her room to at least walk, unlike some of those skintight hiphugger jobs that one had to take teeny tiny steps in or face-plant.</p><p>And her shoes were flats, though they did have some sparkle to them. Sparkly shoes were her one weakness. Anything with a heel? No. She\u2019d embarrass herself trying to walk in them. But blingy sandals or flip-flops? She had a closetful. She wore a different pair every day to work, and her other weakness, thanks to Joss, was wearing her toenails painted. A different color every week, but her favorite was hot pink. There was something mischievous about having hot pink toes and it was as daring as she ever allowed herself to be.</p><p>The rest of her wardrobe was a study in trying not to attract attention. Specifically male attention.</p><p>Jensen appeared seemingly from nowhere, melting from the shadows to stand right in front of her. She swallowed, her mouth suddenly gone dry, because while his dress code at work was business casual, usually meaning a button-up shirt\u2014without a tie\u2014and simple slacks, tonight he was dressed in a black suit that screamed wealth and privilege, and the darkness of his clothing only enhanced what she already knew to be true. That this was a man not to be trifled with. He was someone who could crush her like a bug without any effort whatsoever.</p><p>But then he smiled, transforming the harsh lines, the almost cruel beauty of his face, so that he became someone more approachable. Someone who wouldn\u2019t eat her alive. Maybe.</p><p>She was a fool for even thinking that. For relaxing her guard even for that rare smile from him. She needed to remember that he was a natural-born predator. Strong. Implacable. And so easily capable of hurting her.</p><p>\u201cGlad you made it,\u201d he said easily, cupping her elbow as he steered her farther into the darkened interior.</p><p>They walked by larger tables, filled with various business types and others dressed more formally. Couples having intimate dinners, waiters hovering with expensive wine to refill glasses. This was Carson\u2019s world\u2014a world he\u2019d created for himself. But it had never been hers, even if Carson had been determined to share it with her.</p><p>He\u2019d been determined to rise above his circumstances and go in the opposite direction from their childhood. And Kylie? She seemed to be in a holding pattern, one she recognized even in her denial.</p><p>She\u2019d never stepped fully into the present or even tried to embrace it. She was still too firmly rooted in the nightmare of her past, paralyzed and unable to move past it.</p><p>That Jensen had nailed her so precisely on it in her office two days ago only made her more uncomfortable with his scrutiny and those eyes that saw far too much.</p><p>Jensen courteously seated her, pushing her chair forward once she\u2019d settled into it, and then walked around to the chair directly across from her. At least he hadn\u2019t taken the seat catty-corner to her. But now she\u2019d be required to actually look him in the eye and meet that intense gaze.</p><p>She glanced hastily around, noticing, to her discomfort, how intimate they appeared. A cozy corner in a dimly lit restaurant, no other people occupying the tables nearest to them. It was, as he\u2019d promised, a spot where they wouldn\u2019t be overheard. Had he arranged it so no one else would be seated near them or had he simply gotten lucky?</p><p>But no, he wasn\u2019t a lucky sort of man. He wasn\u2019t someone who\u2019d leave anything to chance. He\u2019d arranged this as he did everything else in his life. To his liking and his specifications. A delicate shiver snaked down her spine at the raw power emanating from him. It\u2014and he\u2014scared the holy hell out of her.</p><p>Yes, this was supposed to be a business dinner, and by resolving that in her mind, she\u2019d been able to make herself go through with it. But now, sitting here across from him in a decidedly intimate setting, she knew damn well this could have been done just as easily in the office.</p><p>She hated that he made her so nervous. Hated admitting that weakness to herself. She\u2019d spent her entire life being weak, though she disguised it by being abrasive and even bitchy. She wasn\u2019t proud of those things, but it was far preferable to ever showing vulnerability to another person.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Kylie,\u201d Jensen said, drawing her gaze to his.</p><p>She saw warmth in his eyes and pondered that oddity. It wasn\u2019t that Jensen was some heartless, cold bastard. But he\u2019d perfected the look. Anyone would think twice about crossing him. Usually his eyes were impenetrable, showing nothing of whatever emotion he was feeling, if he even had them.</p><p>But now? There was an odd tenderness in his eyes and it seemed to be directed at her. It was one beat off of sympathy and that got her back up because the very last thing she wanted from this man was pity.</p><p>\u201cDid you just scowl at me?\u201d he asked, his lips twisting in amusement.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. Maybe,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said again, his tone growing as gentle as his eyes had been just moments ago. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bite you. Unless you ask me to. Nicely,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>Her scowl deepened before she realized he was merely yanking her chain. Something he did with more frequency ever since coming to work with Dash.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do the biting,\u201d she said with a sardonic smile, not even realizing the sexual connotation until it was too late. She\u2019d envisioned snapping at him like a ferocious dog. Not biting him . . . sexually.</p><p>But it was obvious that was the way he took it because his eyes suddenly smoldered with a fire that made her shiver again. Yes, this man was dangerous. Far too dangerous for her to bait. It was better to ignore him. And only speak about work. The reason they were here in this damn restaurant to begin with.</p><p>Thankfully he didn\u2019t respond to her ill-thought-out remark. But that look . . . It was still there in his eyes, his gaze positively glowing, almost as if he were imagining her biting him and taking much pleasure in the act.</p><p>Gah, she had to stop this train of thought and push the conversation to the topic at hand.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve read my analysis,\u201d she said in a crisp, businesslike tone. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment and then evidently decided to let her have her way. Again, something she was certain was rare for him. He appeared to her to be a control freak. Was she surrounded by them? Tate, her best friend\u2019s husband, she knew to be in absolute control. Chessy had relinquished it willingly in their relationship. But Dash . . . She still shook her head over that one. Only recently had it come to light\u2014at least to her\u2014that he was every bit as dominant as Tate, and more shocking was that it was what Joss had wanted.</p><p>Her head-in-the-sand approach to life likely made her unaware of a lot, and she was happy that way. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>So much was changing around her, in her very small circle of friends. Dash and Joss married. Happy. Jensen coming on board, replacing Carson. And only Kylie was the same. Predictable, dull, scared-of-her-shadow Kylie.</p><p>She grimaced her disgust and Jensen\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cYou think I hated it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSorry. Was thinking of something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to share? It must not have been very pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust reflecting on what a coward I am and how I live my life with my head in the sand.\u201d</p><p>Her frank admission shocked her. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d just blurted it out. She never did things like that. It appalled her that she\u2019d just broadcast her weaknesses to a complete stranger. No, maybe he wasn\u2019t a complete stranger, but he certainly wasn\u2019t someone she\u2019d ever seen herself confiding in. And she couldn\u2019t even blame it on alcohol since they weren\u2019t drinking wine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on yourself, Kylie,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>She shook her head, waving her hand in a dismissive gesture. \u201cPlease. Let\u2019s just forget I said that. I can\u2019t believe I did. We\u2019re supposed to be talking business. What did you think of my analysis?\u201d</p><p>He sent her one of those searching looks, one that told her he could see beyond her prickly exterior to the heart of her. The timid, freaked-out heart of her. And that was never a person she wanted anyone to see. Ever again. Only Carson had ever seen her that way. He and their father.</p><p>She had to call back the shudder that even thinking of that monster evoked. It took everything she had to sit there, looking at Jensen expectantly, calm and collected, when her insides were a seething, writhing mess.</p><p>\u201cIt was very thorough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd dead-on. I admit, especially when you said you didn\u2019t have the heart for this sort of thing, that I thought you wouldn\u2019t be objective and wouldn\u2019t go right to the heart of the matter when it came to cutting positions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cheeks warmed under the praise. Her hands trembled and she dropped them into her lap so he wouldn\u2019t see the effect he had on her. As though she needed or wanted his approval.</p><p>She shrugged instead, giving him the impression his words had no effect whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cI looked at areas where they could reduce costs, and honestly, there was a lot there that is completely unnecessary. They could reduce employee perks, the things that don\u2019t really matter, and not have to reduce benefits, the things that are necessary.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his agreement. \u201cI too saw a lot of unnecessary expenditures, and by focusing on those areas, it will eliminate the need to cut some of the positions, though there are those that could easily be absorbed into other jobs.\u201d</p><p>She stared thoughtfully at him a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t like cutting jobs. I mean, they aren\u2019t just nameless, faceless people to you, are they?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all certain what had given her that flash of insight into his character. It was something in his tone though, and the brief glimmer, almost a grimace, that had registered in his eyes. Perhaps he was more human than she gave him credit for.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not an unfeeling asshole, Kylie. Those people have families to support. Children to feed and put through college. They need their jobs, however unnecessary they may be to the company\u2019s survival.\u201d</p><p>She winced at the guilty stab that tightened her chest. She\u2019d as much accused him of being just that directly to his face. He made her antagonistic and at first she hadn\u2019t known why. Their first meeting had left her off-balance and it wasn\u2019t until later that she\u2019d understood her reaction to him more clearly.</p><p>He scared her. Not on a physical level. But on a feminine one. Scared her as a woman. He frightened her. Riled her self-preservation instincts. Ones she was well acquainted with. And she hated that feeling, had sworn no one\u2014no man\u2014would ever make her feel vulnerable and afraid again.</p><p>\u201cIf I implied you were heartless, I apologize,\u201d she said quietly, hoping he could hear and see her sincerity.</p><p>She\u2019d lifted her hands from her lap and rested them on the table and Jensen reached for one, surprising her with the speed of his capturing it before she could withdraw. Almost as if he\u2019d anticipated such a reaction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you implied anything. No offense was given or taken.\u201d</p><p>She went utterly still as his hand continued to cover hers. He didn\u2019t tighten his fingers around her hand. She couldn\u2019t really even consider it holding hands, but his hand blanketed hers, warm, heavy. Thankfully, her wrist was not facing up or surely he would be able to feel how rapidly her pulse beat.</p><p>Desperate to keep the topic to business, she casually pulled her hand away, reaching for her glass of water as if she only wanted a drink and wasn\u2019t breaking free from his grasp. The quick flash of amusement in his expression told her he hadn\u2019t been fooled for a moment. Did nothing escape this man\u2019s attention?</p><p>As if conceding to her thoughts, or perhaps because her desperation showed, he leaned back and resumed their conversation.</p><p>He studied her intently, his gaze more professional than before. This dynamic was one she was more comfortable with. Boss and employee. Not a man and a woman sharing an intimate dinner. A date for God\u2019s sake. She hoped to hell this didn\u2019t qualify.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve incorporated many of your ideas into my final proposal, as they align with my own. I\u2019ll have the completed analysis for you to look over on the drive to the meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d nearly forgotten that they\u2019d already ordered and this was in fact a dinner when the waiter arrived with their entr\u00e9es. Silence descended as their plates were set, glasses filled with wine, the bottle left on the table at Jensen\u2019s request. Then the waiter silently departed, leaving the two in seclusion once more.</p><p>She stared down at the filet and lobster she\u2019d ordered. They looked succulent. Perfectly cooked and yet she was so unnerved by . . . Jensen. It was him. She\u2019d certainly had dealings with other men. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d avoided any and all contact with them in her adulthood. But none of them had ever made her feel as starkly vulnerable as Jensen did. And he was absolutely the kind of ruthless man who\u2019d exploit any weakness, take advantage and swoop in like an avenging god.</p><p>She mentally rolled her eyes. God, Kylie. Dramatic much? You\u2019re a flaming moron. You flatter yourself to even imagine he has any interest in you whatsoever. He just likes pissing you off and you\u2019re an easy target. Eat your damn food and quit pretending this is a date and not the business matter it is before you really freak yourself out.</p><p>After chiding herself, something she seemed to do with more frequency since meeting Jensen, she dove into the delicious-smelling food. The flavor burst over her taste buds and she hummed her pleasure before she could call back the sound.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Jensen asked.</p><p>She glanced up to see his gaze fastened solidly on her mouth. Following the up and down motion of her jaw as she chewed. His eyes glittered predatorily and for a moment she couldn\u2019t swallow.</p> <p>Finally forcing down the food, chasing it with wine she couldn\u2019t even taste, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said in a husky voice she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>God, she was acting like they were out on a date. Making cute and feeling awkward over the sudden absence of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it meets with your approval,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite places to eat.\u201d</p><p>She actually did roll her eyes then. \u201cThat somehow doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>He arched one dark eyebrow in question. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt suits you. Very . . . masculine. Your kind of crowd.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with an imperious look. \u201cAnd what crowd is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowerful,\u201d she said after giving a moment\u2019s contemplation. \u201cWealthy. When I first walked in I thought, \u2018This is a place that caters to rich old farts.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughed, startling her with the rich, vibrant sound that rumbled from his throat. She would have never imagined laughter to be beautiful. Laughter was alien to her anyway. But coming from a man who rarely smiled, it sounded almost magical. She wanted to hear it again. Savor the sound for the brief pleasure it gave her.</p><p>\u201cYou think me a rich old fart?\u201d</p><p>She grinned then, teeth flashing, and she hoped she didn\u2019t have any food in those teeth. How embarrassing would that be?</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo a rich fart then. I feel so much better,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit, everything about this place caters to wealth and power.\u201d She gestured to the walls. \u201cHow many restaurants do you know of that hang portraits on their walls of older men who look like judges or politicians or bankers or some other guy who founded some corporation and has loads of money?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched and he took another sip of his wine, licking his upper lip to remove the excess moisture. Her breath hitched and she yanked her gaze away from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing about the whims of the proprietor, or whom he wants to cater to. All I know is that they serve a damn fine steak and their service is impeccable. I\u2019m easy that way, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like your creature comforts. Fine food and being waited on hand and foot.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t intend it to be an insult, and she hoped he didn\u2019t take it as such. It was merely an observation spoken aloud, though perhaps it shouldn\u2019t have been. She didn\u2019t want to encourage anything more than a strictly professional relationship with him. She had friends\u2014good friends\u2014and she wasn\u2019t looking to broaden that small, intimate group. But she might have no choice since Jensen would surely be included in more of her friends\u2019 get-togethers.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t? Life is short. I choose to enjoy life\u2019s pleasures, even the little ones.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath, pain sharp through her chest. He was certainly right about that. Why couldn\u2019t she be as simple as he? She, more than anyone, knew she should move on, quit living in the past, grab onto the good in life. Let go of the bad. The bad was behind her, wasn\u2019t it? She\u2019d moved way beyond her past. And yet? She was stuck much like a truck in the mud, buried to the bumpers. Still allowing her past and fears to rule her present.</p><p>Weak. She was weak and she was so damn tired of feeling that way. Acting strong didn\u2019t make her so. It just made her an abrasive, standoffish bitch, and she wasn\u2019t proud of that. Thank God her friends\u2014the people who loved her\u2014accepted her, warts and all. She couldn\u2019t even contemplate her life without them. That unconditional love and support.</p><p>She\u2019d very nearly botched things royally with Joss. She\u2019d said unforgivable things to her sister-in-law. Things that had hurt Joss and had made Kylie feel an inch tall. But Joss was . . . Well, she was Joss. A sweet and loving heart incapable of holding a grudge or withholding her forgiveness. Kylie wished with all her heart that she could be more like Joss.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good philosophy to have,\u201d she said, able to admit it even if she wasn\u2019t able to practice it. Yet. But she was determined to get there. One day. And soon, damn it.</p><p>He nodded. And as she suspected he would do, he said, \u201cOne you should adhere to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were talking about you, not me,\u201d she said lightly, directing the conversation away from her. Always away from her. Anything beyond the superficial pleasantries with her was strictly off-limits. She\u2019d already allowed him to see far more than anyone ever should.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for dessert?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the abruptness and his instant acceptance of her diverting attention away from herself. It would seem he had at least some give to him. Who knew?</p><p>Then she glanced down at her half-eaten entr\u00e9e and smiled ruefully. \u201cNo. I\u2019d much rather fill up on the rest of my steak and lobster. It\u2019s delicious and there\u2019ll be no room for anything more. Besides, we should be going soon. Early morning for us both tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She forced the same lightness into her tone so it wouldn\u2019t seem as though she was in a hurry, dismissing him. But again, that gleam in his eyes told her he saw far more than she was comfortable with. She was beginning to think he was a damn mind reader with extrasensory perception.</p><p>\u201cFinish then, but take your time. Tomorrow morning is no earlier than any other business day for us. I know well what time you\u2019re in the office every morning and it\u2019s certainly not eight.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would know. She punched no time clock. She was salaried and Dash had always been absolutely flexible with her hours, though she never took advantage of that. It had been easy to lose herself in work after Carson died. It kept her occupied, an outlet. At work she could blank out her grief and desolation. At home, she didn\u2019t have any distractions. And at home, she was alone. Achingly alone. So she was always in the office between six thirty and seven each morning. Normally before Dash ever came in.</p><p>But with Jensen\u2019s arrival, to her annoyance, he often beat her in and was in his office when she entered her own.</p><p>She was nearly finished with the succulent feast before her when she glanced up and saw a man walking from the far right of the restaurant toward a table in the back. Not very far from where she and Jensen sat.</p><p>She froze, the food she\u2019d consumed now sitting like lead in her stomach. Bile rose and her hand shook so badly that she dropped the fork, the noisy clang startling in the silence.</p><p>She knew her face had drained of blood. She was utterly paralyzed and she couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t force much-needed air into her lungs. Her chest constricted tighter and tighter and her throat followed suit until she was well into a full-blown anxiety attack.</p><p>Perspiration beaded her forehead and upper lip. The desire to flee, to run as fast as she was able and to get as far away from this place as possible seized her. But she couldn\u2019t make her legs obey. Couldn\u2019t even manage the simple act of breathing, much less acting on her desire to get away.</p><p>And then Jensen was right in her face, kneeling on the floor next to her chair. His hand jerked her chin so she was forced to look at him and away from the man who was now seated, alone, several tables away from theirs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded sharply. \u201cDamn it, Kylie, breathe. You\u2019re going to pass out if you don\u2019t start breathing now.\u201d</p><p>She tried to obey the forceful command even though it humiliated her beyond measure that he was witnessing her falling completely apart. But her lungs were frozen, her chest so constricted she hadn\u2019t a hope of breathing.</p><p>An anxious-looking waiter immediately appeared, offering his assistance, asking if she needed help. Jensen turned on him, his face a black thundercloud.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he barked. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Would she? She didn\u2019t feel fine. She didn\u2019t feel as though she\u2019d ever be fine. A wave of despair hit her and the room swayed around her. She knew she was precariously close to blacking out.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cNow. I have to leave. Now,\u201d she said again, with more emphasis.</p><p>The words were hard to form around her starving lungs, the knot in her throat making her voice hoarse and raspy.</p><p>Jensen did a quick scan of the room, following the direction of where she\u2019d been staring when she\u2019d freaked out. Shame rolled over her, wave after humiliating wave.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Jensen asked in a menacing tone. \u201cWhat the hell did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>The barely controlled violence in his voice made her shudder. Black spots danced in front of her eyes and she tried again to pull in a breath, anything to ease the horrible pain in her chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she croaked. \u201cHe just looked like . . .\u201d She trailed off helplessly and to her further horror, tears slipped down her cheeks. \u201cHe reminded me of someone. Please, can we just leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m letting you drive home in your condition.\u201d</p><p>He got up, tossed several bills onto the table, then pulled her to her feet, instantly propelling her toward the entrance, not stopping until they were outside, fresh air blowing over her like the most soothing balm.</p><p>Some of the tightness eased. Her horrific fear began to subside, leaving stark embarrassment in its wake.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Jensen ordered even as he barked an order to the valet to get his car.</p><p>She sucked in breath after breath, gulping at the air greedily until finally the tightness eased and the spots receded. The world had stopped its sickening swaying, but as she tried to step away from Jensen and his hold on her, her knees buckled, and with a muttered curse, he hauled her right back up against his side, his arm anchoring her there so she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>His warmth bled into her icy cold skin. Permeated the arctic layer surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cMy c-car,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my car here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your car,\u201d he said rudely. \u201cYou aren\u2019t driving anywhere tonight. I\u2019m taking you home. We\u2019ll get your car tomorrow after the meeting.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>THE drive to Kylie\u2019s house was strained and silent. Jensen cursed a blue streak every time he glanced sideways to her pale face and tortured eyes. She sat rigid in her seat, hands clenched together in a ball in her lap. Her gaze was directed forward, like she was in some trance, not even taking in his presence.</p><p>She\u2019d scared the f**k out of him in the restaurant. And then his fear had quickly turned to rage when he realized that the man seated several tables away had scared the holy hell out of her. He\u2019d wanted to go beat the man into a pulp, but then she\u2019d said he only reminded her of someone. Since the man was older, he could well imagine just who he\u2019d reminded her of and he swore all over again.</p><p>His instinct was to take her home. His home. Where he knew he could protect her from anything that could possibly hurt her. But she wouldn\u2019t take that at all. She\u2019d likely dissolve into another panic attack, and the one had already put a vicious strain on her.</p><p>So he\u2019d take her home. To her home. But damn if he was leaving her in this state. She wouldn\u2019t want him there, but too f**king bad. No way he was leaving her to endure her private hell alone.</p><p>Kylie needed someone, though she\u2019d never admit that. She saw it as a weakness, and she was a woman who\u2019d die before allowing others to see her perceived weaknesses. Damn it, didn\u2019t she realize that everyone needed someone at some point in their lives?</p><p>And he wanted to be that person she needed even though he knew he was all wrong for her. He wasn\u2019t the man she wanted, that much was obvious. But she did need him. He knew it as well as he knew anything else. Unwavering certainty.</p><p>He just had to crack those walls and peel back the layers to the vulnerable, fragile woman behind that iron fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy. He wasn\u2019t stupid enough to ever assume that. But nothing good or worth it was ever easy. And he knew in his gut that no matter how crazy it might make him, she was worth it.</p><p>He had to tread lightly though, and consider doing something he\u2019d never been willing to do before. Especially for a woman. Let go of his tightly held control and hand over that control\u2014or at least the semblance of control\u2014to her.</p><p>It was a new experience for him. One he wasn\u2019t altogether sure was to his liking. It would be hard for a man like him, used to being in control over every aspect of his life. But Kylie needed security. She needed . . . confidence. She needed to be able to trust him, and if he was going to gain that trust, he was going to have to do the bending for them. Because she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d refuse to bend until she finally broke. And she was nearing that point with every passing day and every sleepless night. Because if she was sleeping then he was a monkey\u2019s uncle.</p><p>He\u2019d be willing to bet everything he owned that her past intruded on her dreams on a nightly basis. He\u2019d seen the evidence far too many times. The bruised shadows in her eyes and under them. Her paleness. The fatigue that beat relentlessly at her, that he could sense with her every breath.</p><p>Tonight she\u2019d sleep and she\u2019d sleep knowing she was safe. Because he wasn\u2019t leaving her in this state. No way in hell.</p><p>And so he readied himself for the ensuing confrontation, knowing she\u2019d object to his presence in her home. Her space. Perhaps the only place she truly felt safe. But no, that wasn\u2019t true either, because in sleep, even in her closely guarded sanctuary, her dreams tortured her.</p> <p>Not tonight. Not if he had any damn thing to do with it.</p><p>When they pulled into her drive, he got out before she could say anything at all and walked around to open her door, not waiting for her to accept his outstretched hand. He simply reached in, gently took hold of those icy cold fingers and pulled her from the car.</p><p>Her gait was unsteady and so, as he\u2019d done outside the restaurant, he pulled her into the safety of his side, tucking her underneath his shoulder as he walked her to her door.</p><p>He knew she expected to brush him off once they reached the door. Issue a stiff, polite good-night and perhaps even a stilted thank-you for his help. But then she\u2019d retreat inside and back to her private hell, shutting the door, barring him from her domain.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>He plucked the keys from her hand and unlocked the door, ushering her forward, making sure he was with her the entire way, and only then did he close the door and lock it.</p><p>\u201cJensen,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you, but I\u2019m okay now. It was stupid. And embarrassing. But I\u2019d rather be alone right now. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see me right now,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>Even as he spoke, he directed her toward what he guessed was her bedroom. Her house, as he\u2019d suspected, was the picture of tranquility. Her haven. Not a single thing out of place. A study in calm and peace.</p><p>She resisted when they reached her bedroom, turning, a fierce, stubborn glint to her eyes. \u201cYou can go now, Jensen.\u201d No trace of her earlier panic attack was evident in her eyes. But it was the tight lines around her lips. The strain in her forehead and the paleness of her face that told him otherwise.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t okay and he wasn\u2019t leaving.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed for bed while I fix us both a drink. Is your bar stocked? I think something strong is called for.\u201d</p><p>She paled and then shook her head. \u201cOnly wine, and I rarely indulge. Usually only when I go out with Chessy and Joss or if I\u2019m over at one of their houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen wine it is. You need something to relax you. You have five minutes to change if you don\u2019t want me walking in while you\u2019re getting undressed.\u201d</p><p>After that directive, he strode out of her bedroom, closing the door so she would be assured complete privacy. He purposely took longer than five minutes because he knew she likely spent the first several minutes arguing with herself and forming all sorts of ways to tell him to go f**k himself.</p><p>He shrugged. He\u2019d had far worse said to him. And he had already discovered her bark was far more ferocious than her bite. Underneath the tough exterior lay a soft heart and an even softer soul.</p><p>He poured them both a glass, though he had no desire for the drink. His thoughts were too consumed with Kylie and the episode he\u2019d witnessed at the restaurant. Whether she wanted to or not, she was going to explain to him exactly what the hell had spurred that panic attack. He had a good idea, but he wanted to hear it from her. Wanted her to trust him enough to open up and perhaps talk about things she never spoke of to anyone else.</p><p>It was an unrealistic expectation, but it didn\u2019t prevent him from wanting it.</p><p>When he shouldered his way back into her bedroom, she was sitting on the edge of the bed, pale, shaken, dressed in very modest pajamas, long sleeved, covering every inch of her delectable flesh.</p><p>It was in the unguarded moment when she hadn\u2019t yet registered his presence that he saw beyond the fa\u00e7ade she presented to the rest of the world.</p><p>She looked infinitely fragile and so very vulnerable. She looked . . . lonely. Sadness clung to her like a fog, surrounding her with such heaviness it made his heart ache. Then she glanced up, eyes startled as she realized she was no longer alone.</p><p>And just as quickly, the barriers were back up, her face becoming impenetrable. But he\u2019d already seen beyond it. Knew what was underneath.</p><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she protested when he shoved the glass of wine into her hands. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Jensen. It was very kind of you to bring me home, but I feel foolish. It was stupid of me and now I\u2019m just embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>Jensen ignored her protests and settled onto the bed next to her, their thighs nearly touching.</p><p>\u201cWho did he remind you of, Kylie?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>She went pale and immediately averted her gaze. She took a long swallow of the wine, gulping at it almost as if she needed the liquid courage it would bring to even dwell on the earlier episode.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>She immediately squeezed her eyes shut, regret etched in her forehead. She shook her head in bewilderment, obviously asking herself why she\u2019d confided that much.</p><p>\u201cIs he still alive?\u201d Jensen asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd does he live here? Do you ever see him?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t see him. Ever. I have no desire to. I wish he were dead. I wish it had been him and not Carson. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Tears thickened her voice and slid down her cheeks. She seemed embarrassed by them but he didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t react. He didn\u2019t want to draw any more attention to the emotion she tried to hide from him. He wanted her to continue. To speak of the demons that haunted her. He wanted to understand every aspect of her pain and fear so he would know how to help her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Carson have to die?\u201d she said on a sob. \u201cHe was so good. Never did anything to hurt anyone. He loved and adored Joss. He loved and protected me. He\u2019s the only one who ever protected me. And yet he died and our father lives. It\u2019s unfair,\u201d she said again, anger seeping through the grief.</p><p>Jensen gently took her hand, curling it into his much larger one, stroking her knuckles with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t fair, baby. And you\u2019re right. It isn\u2019t fair that the son of a bitch that fathered you is alive and well and Carson was killed. But little in life makes sense. We have to deal with the cards we\u2019re dealt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that I can\u2019t move on,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hate it, Jensen. I hate being so weak. Do you understand that? I hate it!\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand, offering his reassurance, when what he wanted most was to take her in his arms and simply hold her. Nothing else. Just hold her.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t weak,\u201d he denied. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to know everything you\u2019ve gone through, but I know enough to recognize you are a survivor. You didn\u2019t allow yourself to be beaten down. You\u2019re stronger than you give yourself credit for.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, and whether it was conscious or not, he wasn\u2019t complaining either way. Taking a chance, he let go of her hand and wrapped his arm around her, pulling her more firmly into his embrace. She rested her head on his shoulder and he could feel the exhaustion tugging at her. The need to simply rest without fear or memories of the past intruding.</p><p>How long had it been since she\u2019d truly slept? One night where her mind was blank and she gave in to complete and utter rest.</p><p>\u201cAt times I don\u2019t think I survived at all,\u201d she said in a voice so low he had to strain to hear. \u201cAnd I wonder if he didn\u2019t win after all. I used to think I\u2019d beaten him. That what he did didn\u2019t damage me, but that\u2019s not true, is it? He did win because even now, when he isn\u2019t any part of my life, my present, he\u2019s still there, just as if he was standing in front of me. And no matter what I do, I can\u2019t get rid of him or the memory of all he did.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her silky hair, unable to prevent himself that small indulgence. She stiffened and he cursed under his breath. Because whatever slip she\u2019d made, a small moment where she\u2019d been able to surrender to the need to turn to someone, it was now gone and she was very aware of the fact that he was in her bedroom and she was in his arms, his lips pressed to her head.</p><p>She pulled away, unable to meet his gaze, but he could see the shame and embarrassment in her eyes and it gutted him. Because he didn\u2019t want her to feel that way with him. He wanted her to feel comfortable enough with him to let those barriers down and let him into the heart of her.</p><p>\u201cYou should go now,\u201d she said in a quiet, tight tone. \u201cI\u2019ve taken up far too much of your time already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you tonight,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>Her head whirled around and shocked, wide eyes met his gaze. Surprise was evident, yes, but what slayed him was the abject terror in those huge eyes. He could see another panic attack was imminent and that was the last thing he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou c-can\u2019t s-stay here,\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cAnd I am.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, panic spreading over her face.</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder, feeling the violent trembling she tried so hard to control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, baby,\u201d he said in a tender voice. \u201cI get that you\u2019re freaked out and afraid. But I swear to you that you have nothing to fear from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth dropped open and she swallowed as if she couldn\u2019t even come up with a response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to stay,\u201d she protested.</p><p>He put a finger to her lips and simply shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to stay,\u201d he amended. \u201cBut yes, you do need me to stay. And that\u2019s the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said desperately.</p> <p>\u201cShh, baby. I understand far more than you realize. Don\u2019t you think I know how frightened you are of me? How much that guts me and how much I wish it were different? The very last thing I want is for you to fear me, and no matter what it takes, Kylie, I\u2019m going to prove to you that you are absolutely safe with me. Safer than you\u2019ll ever be with anyone else. I will never hurt you. Never.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>His entire heart softened at her admission. No, she didn\u2019t want to fear him, but fear was irrational. It defied explanation, and the simple fact was that it wasn\u2019t personal to him. She\u2019d fear any man being this close to her. In her bedroom, sleeping in her bed. But before the night was over with, she\u2019d know that there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do in order to ensure she no longer feared him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleeping here tonight. With you. In this bed,\u201d he said in a calm voice as if they were discussing the mundane.</p><p>Terror blistered through her eyes and her breath quickened. Her pulse stuttered and panic slammed into her. He could see her struggling for breath, her nostrils flaring with the effort.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me, Kylie. I understand you far better than you think. You value control in all things, because you once had that control taken from you. I\u2019m going to give that back to you. Tonight. I\u2019m going to sleep here, with you, so that you know you\u2019re safe. I want you to rest. One night without dreams, or at the very least someone to comfort you when the dreams torture you. And so you are in absolute control and so you know you have nothing to fear, you\u2019re going to tie my hands to your bedpost so that I am, in effect, helpless.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>KYLIE stared at Jensen in complete astonishment. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><p>It was more than crazy. It was absolute insanity. Tie him to the bed? Despite the fact that this was a man she\u2019d never imagine putting himself in a vulnerable position with anyone, particularly a woman, the idea of tying anyone to her bed was just nuts!</p><p>\u201cWould it make you feel safer?\u201d he asked mildly, as if he hadn\u2019t just proposed such lunacy. \u201cThink about it, Kylie. You would have complete control. Nothing to fear. I would, in effect, be utterly helpless. But I will not leave you alone tonight. So your only two options are to trust me enough to share your bed with me or tie my hands to the headboard.\u201d</p><p>Her head spun. Her thoughts were a jumble of chaotic mess. The sheer selflessness that such an act involved was overwhelming.</p> <p>Without waiting for her response, he abruptly got up and left her room. Maybe he had decided that he\u2019d experienced a brief break from reality and was now getting the hell out. She didn\u2019t know if she was relieved or disappointed.</p><p>No matter how much she protested the idea or how much her instincts screamed that this man was dangerous to her, the thought of being alone tonight, like so many other nights, was more than she could bear.</p><p>She\u2019d just about decided he had run for cover when he returned, striding through her door as though he belonged there, a pair of handcuffs in his hand.</p><p>Handcuffs.</p><p>Her eyes bugged out as she stared openmouthed at him.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell carries handcuffs around with them unless they\u2019re a cop?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The corner of his mouth quirked upward. \u201cNever know when one might need them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you into kink? That dominant stuff Dash and Tate are involved in? Are you like them?\u201d</p> <p>His gaze was level and he seemed unruffled by her suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI can assure you I am not like them. I\u2019m me. Jensen. I don\u2019t need or have any desire to model my desires after another or to emulate others. What Dash and Tate do is their own business, between them and their partners. Just as what I do, what I need and desire, is my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to use those. On you,\u201d she said in a voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>He sat down beside her, his fingertips grazing the skin from her shoulder to her elbow. Even through the material of her pajamas the heat from his touch scalded her.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you to feel safe,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd if this enables you to feel safe. With me. Then yes, that is exactly what I want you to do. Handcuff me to your bed.\u201d</p><p>Did it make her a raving lunatic to give consideration to his bizarre proposition? But she didn\u2019t want him to leave. She didn\u2019t want to be alone. She\u2019d been alone for so very long. Just one night she wanted what he promised. Peace. A respite from fear and the agony of her dreams. A source of comfort, one he was selflessly offering her. Would she be a fool to refuse him?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps just one hand,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be too uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed, the only outward sign of his triumph. He remained still and silent, almost as if he were waiting for her to change her mind and back out. She wasn\u2019t a coward and she was trying damn hard to stop being so weak. It was one night. And he\u2019d be handcuffed to her bed. Even so, she didn\u2019t believe for a single minute that he\u2019d ever harm her. Her heart knew that, but her mind was firmly entrenched in self-preservation. Her mind was screaming at her to make him leave. Her heart and mind were at constant odds when it came to this man. An unusual occurrence since they normally were in perfect alignment. Trust no one. It had long been her mantra. Only now, her heart was sending different signals than her brain and the battle was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything to wear?\u201d she asked awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI can sleep in my clothes.\u201d</p><p>Her brows furrowed. \u201cBut what about tomorrow? The meeting, I mean. I know how important it is. I don\u2019t want to screw it up for you, Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get up early enough to go home and shower and change and then I\u2019ll come back by to pick you up,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>\u201cUhm . . . okay,\u201d she finally conceded and then closed her eyes, wondering what had possessed her. Maybe she was finally losing what little of her sanity she\u2019d retained.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes and then unbuttoned the neck of his shirt and slipped his belt off, tossing everything to the side. Then he motioned for her to slip underneath the covers. He moved to the other side, careful to keep distance between them even as he slid underneath the covers with her. Then, facing her, he lifted his left arm and extended the cuffs to her with his right hand, motioning for her to secure his wrist to the headboard.</p><p>Dear God, had it really come to this? That she couldn\u2019t have a man in bed with her without handcuffing him so he was no threat? She wished she was brave enough to tell him it wasn\u2019t necessary. The rational part of herself told her it was exactly what she should do. And not return his generosity and his care of her with mistrust. But the irrational part that controlled so much of her thoughts and actions told her she\u2019d be a fool not to ensure her safety.</p><p>Carefully she cuffed his wrist to one of the slats of the headboard and then leaned back, biting into her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look comfortable,\u201d she said in consternation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve slept in far worse conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He glanced curiously at her, reaching out to touch her chin with his free hand. \u201cWhat are you sorry for, baby?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cThat I\u2019m not brave enough to let you sleep here without the handcuffs. That I\u2019m too much of a coward to refuse your unselfish gesture. I\u2019m the selfish one, Jensen. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not as strong as you.\u201d</p><p>His expression gentled as he cupped her chin, brushing the pad of his thumb over her jaw.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start that you\u2019re even allowing me in your bed, with or without handcuffs. I\u2019ll take that gift, no matter how it\u2019s given.\u201d</p><p>She flushed at the promise in his voice. The promise that he\u2019d be there again, that there would be another occasion and that this wasn\u2019t a freak occurrence. No, it wouldn\u2019t happen again. She wouldn\u2019t let it. She\u2019d agreed to this lunacy in a moment of weakness. The weakness she loathed so much. Because she didn\u2019t want to be alone for just one night.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t allow it again.</p><p>\u201cReady for lights-out?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>He nodded, his gaze still on her like a warm blanket.</p><p>She reached behind her to turn off the lamp and then turned back, snuggling under the covers, trying not to focus on the fact that Jensen was mere inches away. She could hear his soft breathing. Could feel his warmth reaching out to her, enfolding her in its tender embrace.</p><p>\u201cGoing to get the closet light too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was glad it wasn\u2019t light enough that he could see her embarrassed flush.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI leave it on. I don\u2019t like to sleep in total darkness. Does it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything that brings you comfort doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said, further baffling her with his statement.</p><p>The man was twisting her in knots. For weeks he\u2019d baited her, annoyed her, pissed her off, and now he was treating her so very gently. As if she was something precious and fragile. She was in way over her head and despite what he\u2019d said about giving her complete control tonight, she felt anything but in control. Her mind\u2014and heart\u2014were in utter chaos. Her head was spinning so fast it was a wonder she could even breathe. No, she definitely was not in control.</p><p>Because even handcuffed to her bed, there was little doubt that Jensen was controlling the situation.</p><p>It should by all rights terrify her. She should be running as fast and as hard as possible in the opposite direction. But something stopped her. And she didn\u2019t know what. There was a promise of something in his eyes that made her want to find out what. And whether she had any hope of ever moving beyond her past and into the present.</p><p>JENSEN woke with a start and cursed viciously under his breath. Kylie was curled into a protective ball on the far edge of the bed. Out of his reach. A low whimper tore out of her throat followed by more sounds of terror.</p><p>She sounded like a frightened child. And in many ways she was still that frightened, vulnerable child she\u2019d been while she suffered abuse at her father\u2019s hands.</p><p>This was why he\u2019d insisted on staying with her. After her panic attack at the restaurant he\u2019d been certain she\u2019d suffer nightmares, that her past would be hovering on the fringes of her consciousness, just waiting for when she was asleep and vulnerable to attack.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t get to her, helpless to watch as she struggled against invisible monsters. Damn him for insisting on the handcuffs, even if he\u2019d have done anything to make her feel safe. Because now he couldn\u2019t hold her, couldn\u2019t soothe her when she was in the throes of terror.</p><p>\u201cKylie. Baby, wake up. You\u2019re safe. You\u2019re with me. Wake up, baby.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was too firmly entrenched in the grasp of her nightmare to respond to his gentle crooning. Then she came awake with a gasp, sitting upright in bed, eyes wild and enormous in her small face. She looked straight ahead, pulling her knees protectively to her chest, and rocked back and forth.</p><p>Then she buried her face in her knees, and he could hear the muffled sounds of her sobs.</p><p>It broke his heart. Ripped him right in two. His heart was as shattered as hers, her agony his. Her heartbreak his own. Never had he felt so helpless, so full of despair that this beautiful, fragile woman was still a prisoner of her past.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said gently, praying she wouldn\u2019t refuse his overture.</p><p>To his surprise, she didn\u2019t argue. She turned, nearly diving into his one-armed embrace. Then she reached back to her nightstand for the key to the cuffs, fumbling to unlock them, yanking desperately until he was free.</p><p>He instantly wrapped both arms around her, pulling her against his body. She clung to him like a burr, her heart pounding against his. Her face was wet with tears and her breaths were coming in ragged puffs as she struggled to gain control.</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby. I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he soothed. \u201cNothing can hurt you now. I swear it. Let it go. Don\u2019t let it control you any longer.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, kissing the top of her head, waiting for her to calm. To realize she was safe and that he had her. That nothing would hurt her when he was near.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sorry, sorry,\u201d she chanted, the words muffled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. Don\u2019t apologize. Never apologize for this.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand down her back, stroking and caressing until he could feel some of the knotted tension leave her body. She wilted, sagging against him, her face buried in his chest.</p><p>Her shoulders still shook and he knew she was still crying. Every tear gutted him. Made his heart ache for all the hurt she\u2019d endured. For the hurt she still experienced each and every night.</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold you,\u201d he said softly, allowing all the tenderness he felt for her into those simple words. \u201cGo back to sleep now. I\u2019ve got you. Nothing can hurt you here.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little sigh and settled against him, her body sheltered by his own. Their legs tangled and she wiggled as if trying to get as close as possible to him.</p><p>He thought for a moment that she\u2019d followed his directive and had drifted back into sleep. But then she went still. He could feel her pulse, a rapid staccato against his chest. She tensed as if gathering her courage to say something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instinctively, he tightened his arms around her, offering her silent encouragement.</p><p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d she said in a broken voice. A statement she\u2019d made multiple times when it came to her weaknesses, as she deemed them.</p><p>He rubbed one hand up and down her arm, from shoulder to wrist, before tangling their fingers together, squeezing so she felt the support he offered.</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor what he did to me. To us. Me and Carson. I hate my mother for leaving us with him. I get why she would want out. But why would she leave us, knowing what a monster he was? Sometimes I think I hate her more than even him. How screwed up is that?\u201d</p> <p>Jensen knew that he was seeing a side of Kylie she hid from the rest of the world. That she was opening up to him when she firmly held back that part of herself from everyone else.</p><p>He was humbled and grateful that she\u2019d chosen him. He realized it was due to proximity and the fact he\u2019d forced himself into her bed, but he\u2019d take whatever he could however he could get it. In time, she\u2019d come to him willingly. Would open up to him without reservation or hesitation. Until then he\u2019d satisfy himself with whatever tidbits she allowed to slip through her carefully guarded barriers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not screwed up at all, baby. She abandoned you. And not just simply abandoned you but left you with a man she knew would harm you. You have every reason to hate her. I hope to hell you don\u2019t spend even a minute feeling guilt over your feelings about your mother. You should have no guilt for hating the two people who should have loved and protected you. Two people you should have been able to turn to when you could turn to no one else. They betrayed you, Kylie. You don\u2019t betray them now by hating them and what they did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said so quietly he almost didn\u2019t hear the aching softness of her voice.</p><p>He squeezed her, holding on to her, never wanting to let her go.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome, baby. But I want you to promise me something, okay?\u201d</p><p>She shifted in his arms and pulled her head away to look at him, though her lips trembled and he could tell it was difficult for her to meet his gaze. She was mortified that he was witnessing her at her most vulnerable. It made him want to kiss her all the more, but he refused to take advantage of her when she was so achingly fragile. It would make him a complete asshole.</p><p>When he was certain he had her full attention, he let one finger drift down the line of her cheekbone and then to her chin.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning, when this night is but a memory, and you think back on all that\u2019s happened, promise me you won\u2019t have a single moment of regret. Promise me that you won\u2019t be embarrassed or uncomfortable with what has occurred between us. Promise me that you won\u2019t start avoiding me even more than you do already. Some things are inevitable, Kylie. You and I are inevitable. No matter how much you fight it. No matter how much you deny it. We are inevitable.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve given me tonight is very precious and I\u2019ll forever be humbled and grateful that you put your trust in me. That you allowed me inside those carefully constructed barriers that you erect to keep the rest of the world at bay. But I\u2019ve seen inside. I\u2019ve seen the real you, baby. And that\u2019s the person I want.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed in concentration and her lips pursed and then fell open as if she couldn\u2019t quite form a response.</p> <p>He put his fingers over those lush lips, not wanting to hear anything but her assent.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he whispered in a husky tone.</p><p>She closed her eyes but finally nodded.</p><p>\u201cGive me the words, your promise. I need to hear them. We both do. Because one thing about you, baby, is that you\u2019re loyal. And you\u2019re honest. And once you give your word, you won\u2019t go back on it. So give me your promise. Let me hear it. Do this much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking under the strain of having to capitulate.</p><p>He leaned forward and brushed his lips over hers. Just a light kiss. Nothing like what he truly wanted. Just something warm and comforting, meant to soothe and not overwhelm.</p><p>\u201cNow go to sleep, baby. Here in my arms where nothing can hurt you. I\u2019ll be right here. This time when you dream, dream of me.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled back into his arms to his immense satisfaction and then gave a soft sigh, closing her eyes as she pillowed her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>He lay there awake, long after she finally drifted into a dreamless sleep. Staring up at the ceiling as he pondered the puzzle that was Kylie Breckenridge. What was he going to do with her?</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t walk away from her. He didn\u2019t fool himself into thinking things would miraculously change after one night. If anything she\u2019d be more determined than ever that he\u2019d never see her at her most vulnerable again.</p><p>Somehow, some way, he had to break past those barriers. Bust them down for good and insert himself in her heart and soul. He\u2019d already decided that she was well worth the fight, and he knew it would be a fight indeed.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t give up. Kylie was stubborn. Proud. Defiant. But he was every bit as stubborn and determined as she was. For the first time in her life, she\u2019d met her match in him. Because he sure as hell wasn\u2019t giving up. This was one battle he would win, no matter the cost.</p><p>SIX</p><p>KYLIE awoke to a completely alien sensation. She laid there, trying to process just what was different. She felt . . . rested. No lingering darkness from nightmares. She felt . . . safe.</p><p>It was then she registered the fact that she was not alone in her bed. Not only was she not alone, but a very male, very hard body was wrapped protectively around her and her head was pillowed on a muscled shoulder.</p><p>Jensen.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>Memories from the night before\u2014humiliating memories\u2014crashed through her mind like a landslide. She\u2019d made an utter ass of herself. Completely fallen apart on him. For God\u2019s sake, she\u2019d handcuffed him to her bed.</p><p>\u201cRemember your promise, Kylie.\u201d</p><p>His soft voice rumbled from his chest, bringing with it another reminder of the hastily given promise not to regret. Not to be ashamed or embarrassed. Not to freak out. She didn\u2019t have a prayer of keeping the promise because everything about this situation completely freaked her out.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she croaked out. A perfectly neutral question, one that would remind them both that they had important matters this morning that had nothing to do with the fact they were in bed. Together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only six,\u201d he said in that infuriatingly calm voice of his. He sounded completely unruffled by the fact they were wrapped up like two lovebugs.</p><p>\u201cYou want coffee?\u201d she asked even as she pushed herself up and away, putting distance between them.</p><p>He smiled, almost as if he knew her utter panic. \u201cCoffee would be nice. I\u2019ll have a cup and then head over to my place to shower and change. Then I\u2019ll run back by and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cI can just meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget you\u2019re without a vehicle,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBesides, I thought we\u2019d have lunch after and discuss the results of the meeting. Then I\u2019ll run you by the restaurant to get your car.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound like business, all business, but she knew differently. There was a tone to his voice that had been absent until now. Somehow more intimate and . . . tender. He looked at her so tenderly it made her heart ache. And made her even more desperate to increase the distance between them.</p><p>She slid to the edge of the bed and got up, going to her closet to get her robe. Her pajamas more than adequately covered her but she still felt vulnerable and she wanted\u2014needed\u2014that extra barrier of clothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the coffee ready in a few minutes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTake your time. Feel free to make use of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She turned before she could see his expression, that knowing smile. Her world felt tilted on its axis. She had no idea what to make of this abrupt shift in their relationship. What relationship? He was her boss. Well, one of them. She was his employee. Certainly not his bed partner even if he\u2019d spent the night, part of the night, handcuffed to her bed.</p><p>Heat rushed like fire through her cheeks. God, how humiliating. What kind of freak did it make her that she\u2019d handcuffed a man to her bed? How weak did it make her that she\u2019d actually needed it to feel safe? And weaker still, because in the throes of a nightmare, she\u2019d wrenched his arm free so he could hold her.</p><p>Jensen Tucker had held her, had wrapped himself completely around her the entire night, and God help her, she\u2019d loved every minute of it. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d slept so peacefully. That she\u2019d felt absolutely safe. After that first nightmare, when he\u2019d pulled her into his arms, she\u2019d fallen into a deep, dreamless sleep, completely unbothered by the demons that taunted her on a regular basis. Who needed therapy? Apparently all she needed was Jensen Tucker\u2019s strong embrace. Not that she\u2019d ever admit that to him. It would only give him that much more power over her, and she\u2019d vowed never to give anyone that kind of power over her. Never again.</p><p>She busied herself making the coffee, her thoughts chaotic and unbalanced. He made her that way. What the hell did he want from her? He\u2019d all but staked his claim. Some of the things he\u2019d said she was still grappling with. Had no idea of their meaning. Or perhaps she knew only too well and was too chickenshit to deal with them with her big girl pants on.</p><p>But why did he seem to want her? Why would he even care? She was one hot mess. A head case. And worse, he knew it. Calmly accepted it like it was the most normal thing in the world. He\u2019d inserted himself as her . . . protector? He certainly seemed to accept the role. Even embraced it. He\u2019d made no bones about the fact that they were, what had he said? Inevitable?</p><p>He was as crazy as she was apparently. Two hot-mess head cases? Surely a recipe for disaster. He was strong. She was weak. Not the ingredients for a successful relationship for sure. And he was a control freak. She knew that much about him. His world was meticulously well-ordered. No chaos. No messes. He was every bit as dominant as Tate and Dash were, no matter that he said he was nothing like them. He hadn\u2019t seemed to like the comparison, but then she could understand why. He was definitely a law unto himself. There were certainly no two Jensen Tuckers. God help her. One was enough. More than enough.</p><p>He came in a few moments later and her gaze flitted to him, taking in his rumpled appearance. The fact that he was still wearing the same clothes from the night before. But even wrinkled and unkempt the man was just damn sexy.</p><p>She could admit that to herself now. Hell, she\u2019d spent the night with him. No, they hadn\u2019t had sex, but in many ways, what they\u2019d experienced was far more intimate than sex. He\u2019d simply offered her comfort. What she\u2019d needed the most. She would not be an ungrateful bitch even if that was her instinctual, self-protective reaction. Her reaction to anything that could possibly hurt her.</p><p>She could see that about herself. She could see herself as others likely did and what she saw made her cringe. It was a miracle she had any friends left because God knew she hadn\u2019t been a very good friend herself. But she could change that. Starting now. She could bend without breaking. It was time to start returning the unconditional love and support her friends had offered her since Carson died.</p><p>She\u2019d been so wrapped up in her own grief and misery that she\u2019d become a selfish bitch. She didn\u2019t like herself very much, and if she didn\u2019t like herself, how could she expect others to like her? Why the hell did Jensen seem to like her? She certainly hadn\u2019t been remotely receptive to any of his overtures. She\u2019d returned every kindness he\u2019d offered her with blatant rudeness. And yet he\u2019d stayed with her last night, offering unconditional, unquestioning support. Why?</p><p>Was he a masochist?</p><p>He sat down at the bar and she pushed a cup of coffee in his direction. For a moment there was an awkward silence between them but then she gathered her courage and took the bull by the horns.</p><p>\u201cThank you for last night,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cIt meant . . . a lot. You didn\u2019t have to do it, but I\u2019m grateful you did. That you . . . stayed. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were warm as he stared at her, his gaze stroking her face as surely as if he\u2019d reached out and touched her with his hand. She almost wished he would. Touch her. Her skin came alive at the mere thought and her thoughts drifted to the night before. Of how wonderful it had felt to be in his arms, surrounded by his strength and the unspoken promise that nothing would hurt her while he was with her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Kylie. I\u2019m glad I was here so you didn\u2019t have to suffer alone as you do many other nights, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, not even bothering to deny it. He\u2019d know she was lying.</p><p>\u201cYou going to have a cup?\u201d he asked, his gaze taking in the fact she hadn\u2019t poured herself any coffee.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m jittery enough. Caffeine would only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I make you that nervous?\u201d he asked mildly. \u201cSurely after last night you realize I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d</p><p>She felt the betraying heat creep up her neck again. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that at all,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThis is just . . . uncomfortable for me. You have to understand. I don\u2019t allow others to see me as you saw me last night. It bothers me. I feel . . . vulnerable, and I hate that feeling.\u201d</p><p>He set his mug down and reached across the bar to take her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you feel that way, baby. I want you to feel just the opposite. You can be yourself with me. I understand you. Far better than you realize. We all have our demons to battle. You aren\u2019t alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cocked her head, curious at the odd note in his voice. \u201cAnd what are your demons, Jensen?\u201d</p><p>His face tightened and his eyes became shuttered. She instantly regretted the innocent question, but then he\u2019d seen her at her worst. Wasn\u2019t she entitled to know something about him? Something that made him vulnerable?</p><p>He checked his watch, effectively dodging her question. \u201cI need to get going if I\u2019m going to get back in time for us to make our meeting. Will half an hour be enough time for you to get ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>He got up and to her surprise walked around to where she stood and pulled her into his arms. He kissed her. Softly. Just a brush of his lips against hers, but she felt the warmth all the way to her toes. Her entire body tingled. Her br**sts became heavy and aching, her ni**les straining outward. She was grateful that the robe disguised her reaction to such a simple kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>And then he turned and strode out of her kitchen, the front door opening and closing as he walked out.</p><p>She stood there a long time, her fingers fluttering to her still-tingling mouth. What the hell had just happened here? Last night? The entire episode? How in the hell had their relationship taken such a dramatic turn?</p><p>She shook herself out of her stupor and headed for the bathroom to shower and ready herself for the meeting with S&amp;G. This was important. Her chance to prove herself. Jensen believed in her. She believed in herself. Perhaps for the first time in her life. And she wasn\u2019t going to let either him or herself down.</p> <p>SEVEN</p><p>\u201cYOU did very well today, Kylie. I\u2019m very proud of you,\u201d Jensen said as they took their seats at the Lux Caf\u00e9. \u201cThe CFO was very impressed with your recommendations. I\u2019d say we\u2019re a shoo-in for the contract.\u201d</p><p>Kylie flushed with pleasure and ducked her head, but she knew her eyes glowed with happiness. Her stomach had been tied in knots for the entire meeting, especially when Jensen had let her take the lead and make the presentation. He\u2019d sat back, a bystander, as Kylie had outlined their suggestions for minimizing costs to the corporation.</p><p>It had shocked the hell out of her that he\u2019d given her control over such an important meeting. This was a huge contract for him and Dash. Dash would likely have a heart attack if he knew just how much leeway Jensen had given her in this meeting.</p><p>But after a shaky start, and with Jensen\u2019s confidence in her evident in his gaze, she\u2019d taken control and had crisply and efficiently delivered their recommendations to the CFO.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cFor giving me this chance, I mean. It means a lot to me. I had no idea I could do it. I was scared to death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t show, though,\u201d he said. \u201cYou oozed confidence. You had the CFO in the palm of your hand. Hell, he\u2019d have probably eaten out of it. He was hanging on your every word. I was tempted to knee him in the balls if he didn\u2019t keep his damn tongue in his mouth.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSo you think he was so attentive because I\u2019m a woman?\u201d</p><p>Jensen laughed. \u201cNo, I think he was attentive because you are an extremely intelligent, well put together, beautiful woman. Make no mistake, Kylie. Your looks certainly don\u2019t hurt, but no businessman worth his salt is going to make such a huge decision based on sexual attraction. He may have enjoyed the view, but you damn well got his attention because of your intelligence and attention to detail.\u201d</p><p>Feeling somewhat mollified, she relaxed in her seat as the waiter approached to take their order.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to prove, Kylie,\u201d he said in a soft voice once the waiter drifted away. \u201cThe only person who doesn\u2019t believe in you is you.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze because he was right. She didn\u2019t have the confidence she should. But damn it, she wanted it. Wanted it so badly she could taste it. She wanted to take on the world and grab on with both hands. Wanted to be someone unafraid to walk into a room like she owned it. But she\u2019d learned from a very young age to be as unassuming as possible and to draw as little attention to herself as possible. It was a matter of survival. Of self-preservation.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he reached across the table and twined their fingers together. What did it say about her that it no longer startled her when he touched her? That she\u2019d come to like it. Crave it even.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there, baby. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but you\u2019ll get there. I see inside you to the real you. I know she\u2019s there just waiting to break free. And she will. One day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is it you know so much about me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cThings I don\u2019t even know myself? You haven\u2019t worked with Dash that long.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI watch people. I study them. It\u2019s helpful in my line of work and, well, in life, for that matter. I\u2019m good at reading people. Knowing when they\u2019re sincere and when they\u2019re just bullshitting me. And my instincts tell me that you\u2019re a fierce, brave woman who\u2019s faced a hell of a lot of adversity in her life but who\u2019s come out stronger for it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound brittle and not at all joyful. \u201cStronger? I disagree there. I\u2019m scared of my own shadow. Or did you forget that I handcuffed you to the bed last night?\u201d</p><p>His expression grew tender. She\u2019d grown to love the way his eyes warmed when he looked at her just so.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you took them off,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou trusted me enough to take them off when you were at your most vulnerable. I\u2019d say that was very brave of you.\u201d</p><p>She flushed because he had a way of turning around every argument she posed. Made what she deemed as weaknesses, strengths. If only she had as much confidence in herself as he apparently did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you to dinner tomorrow night,\u201d he said casually. \u201cAnd not a business dinner. A date. You, me, no office talk. Just us and we see where this takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no us,\u201d she blurted, stunned by his invitation.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cI spent last night in your bed, baby. I\u2019d say that makes us something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a choice!\u201d she sputtered. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly the basis of a date!\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo forget last night then if it bothers you so much. But you know and I know that I\u2019ll be back there. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>Her throat threatened to close off. She could barely breathe around the knot growing larger by the second. This man thoroughly intimidated her. She found it telling that he didn\u2019t scare her. Not physically. She knew in her bones that he\u2019d never lift a finger to her. It seemed to enrage him, the thought of anyone or anything hurting her. But there were other kinds of hurts. Some more painful than even the physical kind.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t play games with you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes lost the playful, flirty glimmer and his expression grew suddenly fierce and very serious.</p><p>\u201cThis is no goddamn game, Kylie. Not to me. Never to me. You are not a game. You aren\u2019t a challenge, a notch on my bedpost. I don\u2019t f**k around. I haven\u2019t f**ked my way through countless women and I\u2019m not some bored bastard who sees getting with you as a victory.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless. Utterly speechless. Her hands shook so hard that she had to put her water glass down because liquid sloshed over the rim, spilling onto the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>His gaze was direct and unflinching. Grim and unrelenting.</p><p>\u201cYou. Just you, Kylie. And everything you have to give.\u201d</p><p>She was light-headed from holding her breath for so long and she forced herself to breathe as spots appeared in her vision. She had to hold it together and not melt down right in the middle of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to give you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>For some reason the starkness of her statement made her want to cry. Tears burned her eyelids but she refused to let them fall. She had nothing to offer this man. Any man. But certainly not someone like Jensen who could have any woman he wanted. Who would never have to look far for female companionship. There was probably a line outside his bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said just as softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expound. Just kept staring at her with that intense gaze, his eyes never leaving her face, taking in every thought, every reaction. She was certain he could see the tears glittering in her eyes, burning, begging to fall free. She swallowed hard, her head aching with the effort not to allow him to see how affected she was by . . . him.</p><p>But he knew. Damn the man, he knew. At least he wasn\u2019t smug. He didn\u2019t look triumphant. He just stared tenderly at her, like he always did, as if he knew exactly the battle she waged with herself. Saw every fear. Heard every doubt. And yet he still wanted her.</p><p>It baffled and awed her all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a date,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cDinner. Maybe a movie. We could rent something and relax on the couch. I won\u2019t try and get into your pants. Yet,\u201d he added with a sly grin.</p><p>His teasing should infuriate her, but she was grateful because his levity took the burn from her eyes and lessened her need to weep.</p><p>It was just dinner. What was the harm? Even as she asked that stupid question she knew the answer. Giving in to him would be like opening the gates to an invading army. Give him an inch and he\u2019d take the whole bloody mile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to bruise my ego,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cSurely I\u2019m not so terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, not willing to let him think so. He\u2019d done too much for her. Been too kind, understanding. He\u2019d seen her at her worst. How could she ever think he was horrible?</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d he said, breathing out with exaggerated relief. \u201cNow, about dinner. I promise not to take you back to the place that caters to rich old farts. Is it a date?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, unable to prevent her reaction to him. He could be quite charming when he wasn\u2019t all broody and intense\u2014which was most of the time. Why was it she thought that she was the only person who saw this side of him? It was awfully egotistical of her to assume and yet the thought took hold and wouldn\u2019t go away. She\u2019d seen the way he was with others. Polite, but distant. Observant. Ever watchful.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally conceded.</p><p>She\u2019d vowed she was through being a coward, and to turn him down would be the height of cowardice. Especially after last night. She refused to tuck tail and run even if that\u2019s what her instincts were screaming at her to do. But it was time to start refashioning her outlook on life and stop cowering at the least bit of conflict. She couldn\u2019t avoid the rest of the world forever. Perhaps going out with Jensen would give her back a little of herself in the process.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d end up losing every part of herself to him.</p><p>\u201cOh crap,\u201d she murmured, her eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She reopened them, hoping he could see how earnest she was. \u201cI can\u2019t go to dinner with you Friday night.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI promised to have dinner with Chessy. Tate is entertaining an important client and with Joss gone, she\u2019s been lonely. I can\u2019t ditch her, Jensen. Tate\u2019s been so busy with work and I worry about her.\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a very loyal friend. She\u2019s lucky to have you. I\u2019ll let you off the hook if you\u2019ll give me Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through her veins. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect then. I\u2019ll pick you up at six thirty. Dress casual. You want to watch movies at your place or mine?\u201d</p><p>It was stupid that panic frayed her nerves at the idea of being in Jensen\u2019s space. Of being alone with him in his home. He\u2019d been alone with her in hers! Hell, he\u2019d slept in her bed, wrapped solidly around her.</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d she said quickly, hoping he didn\u2019t pick up on that sudden surge of panic and take it personally.</p><p>But he only smiled that same damn smile that told her he knew exactly what she was thinking and feeling.</p><p>\u201cYour place it is. If you\u2019d prefer not to go out, I could cook you dinner at your house and then we can watch movies,\u201d he said in a casual tone.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat hardly seems fair. Shouldn\u2019t I be cooking for you?\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI invited you on a date and if you\u2019re giving me your hospitality, the least I can do is cook a meal for you. Besides, I\u2019m an excellent cook, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hands. \u201cOkay, okay. You win. Give me a list of everything you need and I\u2019ll run by the store Saturday morning.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. All I ask is for you to sit and keep me company while I work my magic in your kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly appears I\u2019m getting the better end of this deal,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI get your company. I find that\u2019s worth a hell of a lot more than one cooked meal.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless again, an affliction she seemed to suffer on a regular basis around him. And the hell of it was he sounded absolutely sincere.</p><p>\u201cI swear I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with you, Jensen Tucker,\u201d she said in a bewildered voice.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll be happy to show you.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>IF Kylie expected hers and Jensen\u2019s relationship to be strained in the office, she was wrong. She\u2019d expected awkwardness. Even outright discomfort. She wasn\u2019t a fool and even she wasn\u2019t so ensconced in denial that she could ignore the current of attraction between her and Jensen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was the old saying? Opposites attract?</p><p>And in their case, could they possibly be more opposite? She and Jensen were polar opposites. He was strong, invulnerable, courageous, confident. Nothing would ever get him down. He oozed authority and self-assurance and she envied him that. She was weak, a coward, and confidence could never be listed as one of her better qualities.</p><p>She sat in her office, staring down at one of the many reports she was supposed to proof and get back to Jensen within the hour. But she was numb, her mind blank. And if she was going to be honest, and she certainly hadn\u2019t held back with herself yet, she was terrified to face him.</p><p>They had a date tomorrow night. He\u2019d spent the night in her bed. They\u2019d gone to lunch where he\u2019d asked her on a real date. And he\u2019d made it clear that it would have nothing to do with business.</p> <p>How was she supposed to act around him? She nearly laughed at the idea that somehow she was living one of those crackalicious category romances she read about CEOs and their secretaries. Bosses and their personal assistants. In real life, most people were well aware of the difficulties in mixing business and pleasure and most companies had strict rules about their employees becoming personally involved.</p><p>But Dash and Jensen answered to no one save themselves. They weren\u2019t a typical corporation and Kylie pitied the person who ever tried to tell them how to run their business.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have an employee handbook and there certainly wasn\u2019t a rule against employee fraternization. But that didn\u2019t mean that Kylie wasn\u2019t a complete idiot for becoming involved with Jensen Tucker.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s separate the fact that he\u2019s your boss,\u201d Kylie muttered grimly to herself. \u201cThat\u2019s the most obvious one under the \u2018no\u2019 category.\u201d</p><p>There was also the fact that he was the antithesis of what she wanted or needed from a man. She couldn\u2019t really say what she wanted, though. Because the truth was she hadn\u2019t sought out relationships with men. Sure, she\u2019d had a few casual dates here and there, but it had quickly become evident that Kylie\u2019s issues weren\u2019t endearing her to the men who asked her out.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t blame them. She could reflect on herself objectively and realize that she was difficult. Bitchy, prickly, defensive and timid. Not the hallmarks of a desirable, kickass woman who made men drool at a hundred paces.</p><p>Still, it was nice to think about having that effect on men just once. That Kylie could actually summon the courage to be ballsy and confident. Walk into a room like she owned it in a pair of killer heels and a dress to die for and have every man there wanting her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and then what would you do with them?\u201d she said in disgust.</p><p>Absolutely nothing. That was what. She\u2019d run like the chicken she was and she\u2019d stick her head in the sand like an ostrich and pray that life passed her by and didn\u2019t use her as a whipping post anymore.</p><p>At what point was she going to say enough? She was in her midtwenties. Still young by all accounts, and yet there were days she felt so much older. The weight of a lifetime bearing down on her, suffocating and miserable. Her childhood had seemed to last an eternity, her imprisonment stretching to infinity.</p><p>At her worst times, when she and Carson were just children, she\u2019d had the secret hope that she could end it all. It shamed her now to even think of just how close she\u2019d come to taking her own life. She\u2019d been just a child, and what child had such dark, horrific thoughts?</p> <p>The only thing that had stopped her was the fact that Carson would be by himself. He and he alone would bear the brunt of her father\u2019s rage. And she wouldn\u2019t allow that.</p><p>Carson had put himself in between her and her father many times, but just as many times, Kylie had done the same for him.</p><p>When her father was in a drunken rage, he seemed to target Carson. It was the other times, when he was absolutely sober, that his hatred for Kylie shone through and nothing she did was right. Everything was a punishable offense. Carson had tried to protect her just as Kylie protected him when their father drank too much and vented his rage on his son.</p><p>She\u2019d never admitted to Carson that she\u2019d considered suicide. It would have destroyed him. Kylie had never told anyone at all. It had remained her darkest secret, buried under layers of hurt and despair but still there. A memory that burned brightly in Kylie\u2019s mind. A reminder of how close she\u2019d come to her breaking point.</p><p>And yet she seemed to be drifting further in the direction of that dark, murky past. Seemed to be reaching that breaking point that she\u2019d never quite come to before. Why now?</p><p>She was safe from her father. No one could hurt her. She had a home, her fortress, where she could lock herself behind the walls and have a safe haven, no intrusion from the outside world.</p><p>Carson\u2019s death had been a strain on her. Was still a strain. Maybe she\u2019d never properly dealt with her grief. She\u2019d performed robotically during the entire ordeal, unable to comprehend that the only person who\u2019d ever loved and protected her was gone. That she was alone in the world, the one thing she\u2019d always feared the most.</p><p>She\u2019d known that Carson and Joss would be her only family. That she had no desire for one of her own. She\u2019d also known that Carson didn\u2019t want children, though Joss did. She understood his fear. That somehow their tainted genes would be passed down to his children. It was a fear she shared.</p> <p>Her own mother had abandoned them to a monster she knew was capable of horrific atrocities. She had no example. No one to look up to. An absent mother and a father who was alcoholic and abusive and a misogynist to boot.</p><p>She shook her head, her lips tight. No, she didn\u2019t want to risk having children either. What if she was a horrible mother? What if her children turned into monsters like her own parents? God only knew all the things that could go wrong if she or Carson ever had children.</p><p>She was perfectly content for her father\u2019s name and blood to die with her, his only remaining blood relative in this world. If only she could take him to hell with her. Because God knew, she lived that hell every single day and had since she was just a baby.</p><p>\u201cDo you have those reports ready?\u201d</p><p>Jensen\u2019s crisp voice came over the intercom, startling Kylie from her dark thoughts.</p><p>She ruffled the papers frantically, glancing to see that she had indeed finished proofing the stack.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, hating the catch in her voice. \u201cWould you like me to bring them to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>She rose and gathered the papers, tidying them into a neat stack. Then she sucked in a deep breath and strode down the hall to Jensen\u2019s office. His door was open and he wasn\u2019t paying attention. His attention was focused on his computer and he wore a slight frown.</p><p>His shirt was unbuttoned at the top and his tie had long been shed. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and his jacket tossed over a nearby chair.</p><p>He was a creature of comfort, and while Dash and Carson both seemed comfortable in finer clothes and embraced the world they\u2019d created for themselves, Jensen seemed less at ease. He was quiet, reserved. And he seemed content to allow Dash to do most of the talking.</p><p>But Kylie would bet her entire paycheck that Jensen didn\u2019t miss a single beat. That he knew every single client and the ins and outs of the contracts and the job that needed to be done.</p><p>She approached his desk hesitantly, not wanting to disturb his obvious concentration. She slid the stack of papers onto the edge and turned hastily, intending to get out quickly.</p><p>\u201cKylie, wait,\u201d Jensen commanded.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have surprised her that he\u2019d known the moment she\u2019d come through the door. Even though he hadn\u2019t acknowledged her in any way and had kept his focus on whatever he was studying on his computer screen.</p><p>She glanced up to see him staring at her, his gaze stroking over her skin like a tangible touch. She loved the way he looked at her. She loved the way it made her feel. Safe. Protected. Like he cared about what happened to her.</p><p>Those looks were addicting. She soaked up every single one of them with unabashed greed.</p><p>His look changed to one of displeasure, and apprehension gripped Kylie\u2019s chest. She hated conflict of any kind. It was her nature to avoid it at all costs and if she couldn\u2019t avoid it, then soothe, soothe, soothe.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>Jensen reached for her hand, shocking her, because he\u2019d always maintained a semblance of casualness between them at work. He gently squeezed and pulled her closer until she stood right by his chair, her back to his desk. He pushed back his chair so he was looking squarely at her.</p><p>\u201cI have to go out of town Monday. I fly back in Wednesday night so I\u2019ll be in the office early Thursday.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, wondering why that had set him off. It certainly wasn\u2019t unusual for him and Dash both to be out of town.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the S&amp;G contract,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe CFO was very impressed and wants to move forward with our proposal. He wants me to attend a meeting with the CEO and the board of directors in Dallas. The contract is ours. We\u2019re just going through the motions of getting approval up the chain. And of course they want to meet me\u2014us.\u201d</p><p>It was then that he grimaced and ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThis is your contract, Kylie. It\u2019s you who should be going. Not me. At the very least, you should be attending with me. But with Dash gone, we can\u2019t leave the office unattended for three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Kylie said, shocked that he\u2019d even considered it. \u201cMy job is to run the office, Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you deserve this,\u201d he said, his lips still turned down into a frown. \u201cMost of the suggestions were yours, even if they were in agreement with mine. You handled yourself very well in the meeting with the CFO. I have absolute faith you\u2019d have their entire corporation eating out of your hand if you gave the presentation.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, pleased beyond measure with his praise, but at the same time, panic-stricken over the idea of presenting their proposal alone. Without Jensen there to back her up. She might like the idea of breaking out of her shell and taking on the world one day, but it wouldn\u2019t be today. Or tomorrow for that matter.</p><p>Baby steps, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be gone Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI believe I can hold the fort down while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that much,\u201d Jensen said, his tone serious. \u201cBut damn it, I wanted you with me.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes widened as finally the reason for his irritation became clear. He hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her behind and yet they had no choice. They didn\u2019t employ a full staff, though Kylie had been after them to hire one or two more office assistants. For that matter, both men needed personal assistants. Employees who would travel with them, work side by side with them and take care of personal as well as professional matters.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s job was to manage the office. Ensure that everything ran smoothly, that things got done on time and accounts receivable were kept up to date. But she acted as a personal assistant to both men instead of just an office manager, and they definitely kept her on her toes. There was enough work for two more employees but neither man seemed to have any interest in taking on anyone else. They claimed to like the job Kylie did for them and seemed content with the services she provided.</p><p>She made a mental note to ask for a raise if one wasn\u2019t automatically given in her annual performance review, which was coming up in just a few weeks. She deserved it. The old Kylie would have never rocked the boat. Continued to take the same pay and not complain when she took on more of a workload. Anything to keep peace and to keep away from conflict.</p><p>The new Kylie? Knew she was worth more than what her paycheck reflected. Not that either man ever took her for granted. She felt appreciated. Both men went out of their way to tell her she was doing a good job and that they couldn\u2019t manage without her.</p><p>The new Kylie was going to be crisp and efficient and ballsy. She was going to ask for a raise. And not a small one.</p><p>She had goals just like everyone else did. She wanted a new house, one not in the same neighborhood as Dash, Joss, Tate and Chessy. Jensen lived just a mile away in another upscale gated community. It was time for her to break free. To not be so dependent on the people around her and for them to constantly have to baby her.</p><p>Kylie felt like a fraud living where she did. Carson had insisted that she live near him. Where he could look in on her, protect her. Just like he\u2019d always done. And she\u2019d failed him when he\u2019d needed her most. It should have been her. Not him. He had Joss. Someone who loved him and whom he had adored beyond reason. Kylie had no one. Just Carson, and by extension Joss.</p><p>It should have been her.</p><p>It had nothing to do with a death wish. Not since she\u2019d been a little girl and had that awful moment when she\u2019d considered that she\u2019d be alone, protected, away from the violence and turmoil of her everyday life if only she gave in and took the easy way out, had she given any serious consideration to giving up and ending her life.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going through your mind?\u201d Jensen muttered.</p><p>She glanced guiltily in his direction, knowing she wasn\u2019t giving him the attention he deserved as her employer. Heat scorched her cheeks. Shame. That she\u2019d even dwelled on those awful moments in the past.</p><p>\u201cNothing worth repeating,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>Jensen shook his head. \u201cOne of these days, you\u2019re going to trust me enough to share those dark thoughts you seem to have on a regular basis. You may think you hide them from the world, and maybe you do, but not from me. I see past the practiced fa\u00e7ade, Kylie. And I don\u2019t want that to alarm you. I want you to trust in the fact that I will never hurt you. I\u2019ll never do anything to cause you pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed and nodded, not knowing what else to do. How could she explain that some things just weren\u2019t meant to be shared? Even if he thought he knew about her past, there was no way for him to know it all. Because no one did. Not even Carson.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cYou\u2019ll go seal the deal with S&amp;G and I\u2019ll keep things running here at the office. Dash will be back in a week. He and I used to run the office ourselves, so I\u2019m certainly capable of running things alone while you\u2019re away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cYou deserve this, Kylie. It should be you going. Not me.\u201d</p><p>She paled, shaking her head in instant denial. \u201cI appreciate the opportunity. I appreciate your confidence in me, Jensen. But you did enough. You let me help with the proposal. That\u2019s enough. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable presenting to the higher-ups. That\u2019s your specialty. Not mine. No way I want the responsibility of us losing a contract like this because I\u2019m not experienced enough to pull it off.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes warmed with understanding and gave her that peculiar shiver she experienced every time he looked at her like that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you there, baby. Maybe not right now, but in time definitely. I plan to have a long talk with Dash when he returns about your position in this company.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. A protest was already forming on her lips but Jensen shushed her with a look.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t changing my mind on this.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a rueful smile. \u201cAll I was going to ask for was a raise\u2014a big one\u2014at my next performance review. I\u2019m afraid that would have used up all my assertiveness for at least a year.\u201d</p> <p>Jensen chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your raise, and if I have any say, a promotion will come with it. Which means we\u2019ll be in the market for another office manager, because if you\u2019re going to be working more closely with me and Dash, you won\u2019t have time to juggle everything else.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that. She was territorial when it came to the office. It was her domain. She ran it. Organized it. Knew the ins and outs even better than Dash and Jensen. It was she who kept things going smoothly. She liked that she was indispensable. That she had worth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than being an office manager, Kylie. You have a degree. You certainly have the intelligence. All you need is the confidence. Once you gain that, you\u2019ll be an unstoppable force. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>She flushed again, a warm glow enveloping her. He seemed utterly confident in her abilities, and if he was that confident, shouldn\u2019t she be as well?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He gave her a smile and she shifted, knowing she\u2019d spent too long in his office when she had other work to be doing.</p> <p>She turned to go and Jensen\u2019s call stopped her.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time with Chessy tonight. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Your place. Six thirty.\u201d</p><p>It was a reminder of their date. And the way he dropped the casual reminder told her that he likely thought she\u2019d cry off or come up with some excuse.</p><p>But she did neither. She turned, making sure her turmoil wasn\u2019t evident in her expression. She answered him as calmly as she could.</p><p>\u201cSee you at six thirty then.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>\u201cSO what\u2019s new with you?\u201d Chessy asked as they were seated in their favorite booth at the Lux Caf\u00e9.</p><p>For as many times as they ate here and requested the same booth, it ought to have their names engraved on it. The waitstaff was certainly on a first-name basis with all three women and didn\u2019t even ask where they wanted to be seated. They just escorted them to their booth in the corner as soon as they walked through the door.</p> <p>Kylie took her seat, wondering if Chessy could see her every thought. Because typically Kylie never had anything \u201cnew\u201d to share. She always just listened to whatever was going on with Joss and Chessy and responded to whatever they wanted to talk about.</p><p>Now that Chessy had forced the focus on her, Kylie was at a loss as to what to do. They were girlfriends, which meant that they were supposed to share intimate details. Secrets. Gossip. Things they wouldn\u2019t share with anyone else. Only Kylie had never really held up her end of the deal.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Kylie said lightly. \u201cSame ole same ole. Work is keeping me busy.\u201d</p><p>Chessy studied her, her green eyes gleaming with mischief. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about you. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but my first guess would be a man.\u201d</p><p>Kylie flushed to the roots of her hair. Good God. Save her from all-knowing and interfering friends. Without Joss, the peacemaker, as a buffer, Chessy would latch onto Kylie\u2019s ass and wouldn\u2019t be able to be pried loose with a crowbar.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Chessy crowed.</p><p>She leaned forward, her eyes alight with mischief and curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSpill,\u201d Chessy demanded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t leave a word out.\u201d</p><p>Kylie sighed but at the same time, warmth invaded her veins. This was what having girlfriends was about. She\u2019d never really felt she\u2019d taken advantage of her close friendship with Joss and Chessy because she\u2019d never had anything to share. But now?</p><p>The question was whether she wanted to confide in Chessy when she herself had no clue what the hell was going on between her and Jensen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kylie said honestly.</p><p>Concern entered her friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jensen,\u201d Kylie blurted.</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cJensen Tucker? As in works-with-Dash Jensen?\u201d</p><p>Kylie nodded. \u201cOne and the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d Chessy murmured. \u201cTalk about biting off more than you can chew! That guy intimidates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the crowd,\u201d Kylie said ruefully. \u201cI have no idea what the hell he wants from me. But he\u2019s different with me. I mean different than he is with everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Chessy grinned. \u201cWell a woman\u2014the right woman\u2014can do that to a man. But explain this different. What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Kylie sighed again, knowing Chessy wouldn\u2019t rest until she dragged every detail out of her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a date. Tomorrow night. He was specific in saying this was a date. No business talk. Nothing to do with the office. A real date. Oh my God, just saying that makes me freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go out with him or did he pressure you into something you don\u2019t want?\u201d</p><p>Chessy frowned fiercely, clearly going into protective mode. Kylie smiled.</p><p>\u201cI agreed. I may need my head examined, but yes, I do want to go out, although we\u2019re not exactly going anywhere. He\u2019s cooking dinner for me at my place. And then we\u2019re going to watch movies. Not exactly an exciting date, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds perfect to me,\u201d Chessy said wistfully. \u201cI\u2019m tired of eating out all the time. It seems like Tate is always entertaining a client and he likes for me to be with him when possible. A nice evening at home, alone, him cooking dinner for me and afterward spending the evening on the couch? Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Kylie frowned and leaned forward. She\u2019d been worried about her friend for months. She and Joss both had been worried about Chessy and her marriage to Tate. Chessy was perpetually cheerful. She could warm even the hardest heart. Good as gold. Naturally sunny and generous. But lately? The light had been extinguished in her eyes. She seemed . . . unhappy. And that bothered Kylie a lot.</p><p>Kylie had even worried that Tate was somehow abusing her, though Joss had been adamant that it wasn\u2019t even a possibility. But then Joss hadn\u2019t seen the darker side of men like Kylie had. She knew that behind a perfectly polished exterior sometimes lay a monster.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay between you and Tate?\u201d Kylie asked bluntly, finally putting to question what she and Joss had both privately wondered over the last few months.</p><p>Chessy looked startled, but it was the hesitation that sold Kylie on the idea that she wasn\u2019t far off the mark. Chessy didn\u2019t immediately deny it, nor did she act horrified over the idea. In fact, she didn\u2019t say anything at all. Just sat there with those sad eyes.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d Chessy finally said lightly, though her lips weren\u2019t smiling. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just feeling lonely. I see so little of Tate and\u2014 I guess that isn\u2019t true. I do see him, but never in private. We\u2019re always entertaining clients or in a public setting. What we haven\u2019t had is time together, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut are you happy?\u201d Kylie persisted.</p><p>Chessy glanced down, not meeting Kylie\u2019s gaze. \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot now anyway. It\u2019s silly. I\u2019m being selfish. Tate takes very good care of me. He\u2019s busting his ass because he wants to provide for me. For us. For me to never want for anything. But all I want is him, Kylie. Not money. Not things. I just want him and for things to be the way they were before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not selfish,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cHave you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?\u201d</p><p>Chessy shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. It would destroy him if he thought he was making me unhappy by doing the one thing he thinks will make me happy. I just have to ride it out. Things will get better. Marriage isn\u2019t easy. If it was, there wouldn\u2019t be so many divorces, and the last thing I want is to plant a seed of doubt in Tate\u2019s mind. I don\u2019t want out. I just want him. I love him so much.\u201d</p><p>Kylie reached across the table and squeezed her friend\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you do. And I know he loves you. It\u2019ll work out, Chessy. You have to believe that. Have you given any more thought to whether he\u2019s cheating? I know that was a concern, however brief, and you didn\u2019t want to ask him because of what it would do to your relationship if he thought you ever doubted him.\u201d</p><p>Though Joss had been the first person Chessy had confided in, Chessy had later brought up the issue with both Joss and Kylie, but only after Chessy had made Kylie swear she wouldn\u2019t confront Tate over it. Kylie was more of a take-the-bull-by-the-horns kind of girl, not as sweet and understanding as Joss. And well, maybe Kylie would have confronted Tate if Chessy hadn\u2019t exacted the promise from her. She hated the idea of her friend hurting in any way. And she knew, whatever the reasons why, that Chessy wasn\u2019t happy and she hated that she couldn\u2019t fix this for her friend.</p><p>Kylie had never admitted to Chessy that she\u2019d been concerned that Tate abused her. She\u2019d only shared that fear with Joss. She was glad now she hadn\u2019t because it might have caused an unmendable rift in their relationship. And Kylie was trained to believe the worst of people. She\u2019d very likely overreacted. She didn\u2019t really believe Tate was capable of abusing Chessy, but then such was the case of many abusive men.</p><p>Chessy shook her head. \u201cI was being silly and emotional. I don\u2019t really believe he\u2019d ever cheat. I can\u2019t allow myself to even think that way or the seed of doubt will be planted and it will just drive me crazy. Besides, when would he have time to see another woman? I know he loves me. I really do. It\u2019s just hard right now. I wanted to start trying to have a baby. It\u2019s what we both want, or did want. Now I\u2019m not so sure. Tate hasn\u2019t talked about it lately. The one time I mentioned it, he said he\u2019d rather wait until his business was more secure. So I haven\u2019t brought it back up again. And maybe I\u2019m just looking for something to fill the void so I\u2019m not so lonely all the time. Which is a pretty lame reason for having a child.\u201d</p><p>Kylie grimaced in sympathy. But she agreed that Chessy should wait. Kylie wasn\u2019t altogether certain things were that good even though Chessy made the best of it. Bringing a child into an uncertain situation would only make it worse. If Tate was gone so much, how would Chessy cope with being a new mother without her husband as a support system?</p><p>But she kept those thoughts to herself because she didn\u2019t want to upset Chessy any more than she already was. Her heart ached for her friend. Loneliness was an emotion Kylie was intimately acquainted with.</p><p>She made a mental note to spend more time with Chessy, especially while Joss was gone on her honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cBut let\u2019s get back to you and Jensen,\u201d Chessy said, the teasing light back in her eyes. \u201cHow on earth did the two of you hook up? Is it one of those office romance things we read about in novels?\u201d</p><p>Kylie snorted. \u201cAt first I thought he was an overbearing ass whose sole ambition was to make my life miserable. He told me I looked like hell. What a great prelude to asking me out on a date, right?\u201d</p><p>Chessy seemed to choose her words carefully. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wrong, exactly, hon. You do look . . . tired. Have you been having nightmares again?\u201d</p><p>Kylie shrugged indifferently. \u201cWhen don\u2019t I have nightmares? It\u2019s not something you can just get over, you know.\u201d</p><p>She hated when they spoke of things personal to her. She was much more comfortable talking about Chessy or Joss and what was going on with them. She rarely ever volunteered personal information because she didn\u2019t want her friends to worry. They knew of her childhood. Joss knew because of Carson and Chessy had learned after they\u2019d become friends. But them knowing didn\u2019t mean it was a subject open to speculation.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cI wish there was something we could do to help you. Have you considered talking to a therapist? Getting medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like Jensen,\u201d Kylie muttered.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it doesn\u2019t make you weak to ask for help,\u201d Chessy said softly.</p><p>Chessy well knew Kylie\u2019s hatred of appearing weak. It was the one thing Kylie had confided in her best friends. She hated feeling powerless, like she wasn\u2019t solidly in control of her life and her surroundings. Hell, maybe she did need a shrink, but the very idea of sharing deep dark secrets she\u2019d never confided in anyone with a complete stranger freaked her out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kylie shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t, Chessy. I don\u2019t expect you to understand. Hell, I barely understand it myself. But the idea of allowing a complete stranger inside my head scares me to death. I think it would only make things worse, not better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me, you know,\u201d Chessy said quietly. \u201cYou know I\u2019d never betray your confidence. I wouldn\u2019t even tell Joss if you didn\u2019t want me to. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t share anything you told me with Tate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kylie said sincerely. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you and Joss. I don\u2019t know why y\u2019all put up with me. I know I\u2019m bitchy and prickly. It baffles me why either of you want to be my friend. I\u2019ve said some horrible things. Just look at how I ripped into Joss when she and Dash got together. It still embarrasses me when I think about it. Joss didn\u2019t deserve my vitriol. I acted like such a hateful shrew.\u201d</p><p>Chessy smiled, her eyes softening with love. Unconditional, unwavering love. Something Kylie had never experienced except with Carson. It still unbalanced her. At times it even made her uncomfortable, which was pretty messed up when she thought about it. But the simple truth was she didn\u2019t know how to handle such devotion and loyalty because she\u2019d never had it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful person, Kylie. And a very loyal, loving friend. Joss and I are lucky to have you. And hell, no one is perfect. We\u2019ve all been bitchy with each other at some point. That\u2019s how friendship works. You hurt the people you love the most but then you apologize and you forgive and you move on, even better friends than before. Joss certainly doesn\u2019t hold any animosity for the things you said. She knew you were upset and out of sorts. Heck, I didn\u2019t even see that one coming. Her and Dash? Or that Dash had a thing for her for so long? I mean, like I told you both in the beginning, there was a time I suspected, but then so much time went by and Dash never acted so I thought I\u2019d imagined the way he looked at her. I think it took us all by surprise. Even Tate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if things got bad between you and Tate, wouldn\u2019t you, Chessy?\u201d Kylie asked. \u201cYou know I\u2019d do anything at all to help you.\u201d</p><p>Sadness entered Chessy\u2019s eyes again and Kylie cursed the fact she\u2019d ruined the mood. Again. Her and her big mouth. She was going to have to seriously work on the bitchy, prickly part of her personality. Her friends didn\u2019t deserve that from her. They deserved better. They deserved the person Kylie hoped to become.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer, hon, but I\u2019m not going anywhere and Tate sure as hell isn\u2019t either. I\u2019ll tie him to the bed if it becomes necessary, never mind it\u2019s usually him tying me to the bed.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes sparkled with humor and Kylie breathed a sigh of relief that the mood had lightened.</p> <p>Kylie grinned mischievously. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s one for you then. You can never accuse me of holding out on you after I tell you this. And if you ever tell anyone, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chessy demanded. \u201cThis has to be good if you\u2019re getting all serious on me.\u201d</p><p>Kylie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh. I couldn\u2019t laugh at the time. I was pretty freaked-out. But now? I have to admit, it\u2019s pretty damn funny, especially in light of the kind of guy Jensen is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me drag it out of you!\u201d Chessy growled. \u201cSpill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Jensen wanted me to work with him on this latest contract. Completely shocked me. I mean I\u2019m their office manager. I don\u2019t get involved in the actual dealings with their clients. Only, he wanted my input. And he took my suggestions seriously. Then insisted I go with him to the meeting. But we met at Capitol Grill the night before to go over the final proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Chessy said, leaning forward eagerly.</p> <p>Kylie grimaced. \u201cI freaked. I mean completely freaked out. I saw someone who reminded me of my father. I\u2019m so embarrassed over it now, but to me it was real. It was like looking at him. He was just a few tables away and I lost it. Complete meltdown and panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chessy said, her face drawn in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cSo Jensen gets all worried and goes into alpha protective mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stop a moment and let me savor that image,\u201d Chessy said, shivering in exaggerated delight. \u201cBecause that is just too good not to imagine.\u201d</p><p>Kylie laughed. \u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t even really notice, but yeah, he\u2019s pretty impressive in alpha protective mode. Not the kind of guy I\u2019d usually even give a second glance but I have to admit, he made me feel . . . safe.\u201d</p><p>Chessy smiled. \u201cI know that feeling well. Tate does the same for me. I just feel . . . safe. Like nothing can ever hurt me. That he\u2019d go to the wall for me and never allow anything to happen to me. So? Go on. What happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me home and I was all prepared to thank him, say good night, retreat to my bedroom and die of embarrassment. Only he insisted on staying. And not only staying, but he was going to sleep in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cHoly shit. Did y\u2019all have sex?\u201d</p> <p>Kylie shook her head. \u201cNo, here\u2019s where it gets funny. At the time? Not so much. But now, yeah, I can laugh about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so gentle and understanding. The way he looks at me. I can\u2019t explain it. It just makes me warm inside, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to handcuff him to the bed so I\u2019d feel safe with him. So I\u2019d know he couldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Chessy nearly choked on the tea she\u2019d just taken a sip of. She put the glass down, her mouth gaping open. \u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>Kylie nodded.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Chessy breathed. \u201cNow that is a guy I can never imagine giving up control. Especially to a woman. I mean he seems like the ultimate dominant guy. Like Tate and Dash, you know?\u201d</p><p>Kylie nodded. \u201cYeah, I do know. I was shocked. But I was also so freaked-out that I didn\u2019t really know what to do. Part of me wanted him gone so I could huddle in my bed and put the covers over my head and die of shame by myself. The other part of me really didn\u2019t want him to leave but at the same time him being in my bed freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes softened with understanding. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty amazing that he offered that. I mean, he put himself in a vulnerable situation for you. So you\u2019d feel safe. That\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kylie said softly. \u201cSo he goes to bed, fully dressed, and I\u2019m in my granny pajamas. I handcuffed one of his hands because it looked really uncomfortable and I was humiliated that the only way I could let a man sleep in my bed was with him handcuffed and helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever feel shame for your need to feel safe, honey.\u201d</p><p>Kylie huffed out a breath. \u201cSo we both go to sleep, only I had a nightmare about my father. Seeing someone who resembled him so closely in the restaurant just brought it all back, and then Jensen was calling my name. Telling me to wake up, that I was safe with him. And I don\u2019t know. I just kind of freaked. I dove into his arms, only one of his hands was still handcuffed to the bed and all I could think about was wanting both of his arms around me. So I tore off the handcuffs and he held me. Just held me and told me to go back to sleep, that nothing could hurt me, that he\u2019d never allow it. So we slept that way the rest of the night and I\u2019ve never had a better night\u2019s sleep once I was in his arms.\u201d</p><p>Chessy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Kylie. He sounds delicious. And so tender and caring. I mean, what more can you ask for? The guy is drop-dead gorgeous, extremely alpha and protective. And he made huge concessions for you so you\u2019d feel safe. He put you and your needs before his. Not many guys are willing to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kylie said softly. \u201cAnd the thing is, Chessy, I do feel safe with him. I can\u2019t explain it. He\u2019s the kind of guy who should terrify me. He\u2019s the kind of man I\u2019d usually steer clear of by a mile. And yet the way he looks at me, the way he is around me. I just melt into a puddle. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ridiculous,\u201d Chessy refuted. \u201cSounds to me like you\u2019ve got yourself a solid winner. So you\u2019re going on a date tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wanted to do it tonight but I told him I had dinner plans with you so he changed it to Saturday. And then he\u2019s going out of town for the first three days of next week. I guess that\u2019ll give me plenty of time to think about our date and figure out what the hell I\u2019m doing and if I\u2019m in way over my head,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me!\u201d Chessy exclaimed. \u201cWe could have rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>Kylie shook her head adamantly. \u201cNo. Friends come first and I\u2019ve been worried about you, Chessy. I know you\u2019ve been lonely and I know what that feels like. I don\u2019t want you to feel like that ever. You come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the bitch you call yourself,\u201d Chessy said firmly. \u201cYou have the biggest heart of anyone I know, honey. If I ever hear you disparage yourself again I\u2019ll kick your ass. And I love you for it, but in the future? If you have an opportunity to go out with a delicious specimen of an alpha male like Jensen? We will reschedule. You and I can get together anytime. I think it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re venturing into the dating world. It\u2019s time, Kylie. You\u2019re ready. You need to do this for yourself. Prove to yourself that not all men are assholes.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s heart filled with love for her friend. She missed Joss and couldn\u2019t wait for her to return, even though it was selfish since Joss was on her honeymoon and should enjoy every minute of it. But Kylie loved Chessy and Joss. They were solid. Her anchor after Carson died. The only two people who\u2019d kept her sane and had given her a reason to keep living.</p><p>They didn\u2019t know that. Maybe they\u2019d never know how much Kylie depended on them. But she couldn\u2019t fathom her life without them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try,\u201d Kylie said truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being a coward. Of hiding from the world. Maybe Jensen is the one. Maybe he\u2019s not. But at the very least he\u2019s my opportunity to work on my courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cAnd you know I\u2019m going to want to hear all the juicy details Sunday. If you don\u2019t call me, I\u2019m so coming over. But in the afternoon. You know, in case Jensen sleeps over again.\u201d</p><p>She winked as she said the last and Kylie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself,\u201d Kylie said dryly. \u201cRemember the fact that I had to handcuff him to the bed in order for him to be able to sleep in the same space. I\u2019m such a head case that I wouldn\u2019t count on me ha**g s*x with anyone for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cAt the risk of sounding disloyal, my money\u2019s on Jensen. I bet you two do the deed much sooner than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Kylie muttered.</p><p>But at the same time, hope unfurled in her heart like a flower budding in the spring. Could she be intimate with Jensen? Was it possible that he was the man who could get past her barriers? The fact that she wasn\u2019t melting down over the mere thought said a whole lot. The fact that she was actually anticipating the act itself said far more.</p><p>TEN</p><p>KYLIE wiped her hands down her jeans, removing the dampness from her palms. She stared at her reflection in the mirror, critically surveying her appearance. This was stupid. Utterly ridiculous for her to be so worked up over a date.</p><p>Women dated. People dated. And now, apparently, she dated. It was an absolutely ordinary occurrence in the world. Except that her world and the rest of the world were two entirely different things. In her world, she didn\u2019t date. Didn\u2019t pursue relationships or encourage men\u2019s attention.</p><p>Only now it would seem she did indeed date and she was in fact trying to gain the attention of Jensen.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out if it annoyed her or pleased her, this tilting of her universe. On one hand she was actually looking forward to the evening with Jensen. Craved his company and how safe and comforted she felt around him. Was she simply using him because he was a security blanket of sorts? And would she chicken out the minute things became more intimate?</p><p>Because she sincerely doubted Jensen was just signing up to be a source of comfort. He was a man. An attractive, mouthwateringly gorgeous man. Of course he\u2019d expect sex at some point. He\u2019d pretty much said as much. The question was how patient he\u2019d be.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t opposed, in theory, to the idea of ha**g s*x with him. The idea appealed. But what appealed more to her was her being capable of having a physical relationship with him. Of being able to overcome the panic that such an idea instilled within her.</p><p>So, in fact, it did mean that she was using him. For all the wrong reasons.</p><p>She closed her eyes, willing herself to stop being so analytical. Did it matter why she wanted to be around him? Did it matter the reasons why if they ended up having sex? To most men reasons would be very far down their list. They wanted sex. Most red-blooded men did. It was the women who got all touchy-feely and analytical over the reasons behind sex.</p><p>Jensen wanted her. He\u2019d made that clear enough. But what exactly did he want? How much? Would he be satisfied with physical release? Hot sex? Or did he want more? Something she couldn\u2019t give him?</p><p>Her head was spinning and she was making herself crazy over a simple date. She\u2019d changed clothes four times, each time deeming herself too obvious. Too blatant, like she was seeking his approval. But what normal woman wouldn\u2019t want to look good for her date? Especially a man like Jensen who oozed sensuality just by breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d finally opted for jeans and a comfortable top. Casual. Not too desperate. She wanted to appear as though she were comfortable with him. And that wouldn\u2019t be a stretch because she did feel at ease with him even if she hadn\u2019t in the beginning. All of that had changed during the night he\u2019d spent with her.</p><p>Trust, something she didn\u2019t readily give to anyone, had been formed the night he\u2019d held her through her nightmares and offered her comfort. A part of her recognized that this man wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Her mind protested, used to self-preservation. Her heart, on the other hand, had quickly offered its trust, leaving her brain to wonder if she\u2019d lost what little of her sanity she had left.</p><p>The doorbell rang, spurring her into action. She nervously gave herself one last glance in the mirror, satisfied that she looked . . . normal. Then she went to answer the door.</p><p>Jensen filled her doorway the minute she opened the door. He loomed there, larger than life. Tall, muscular. Strong. To her relief, he too had dressed casually. Faded jeans that conformed to his body and made her want to get an eyeful of how his ass filled them out. And a simple T-shirt that stretched over his muscled arms and chest.</p><p>If she thought he looked sexy in his business clothing, seeing him in jeans and a T-shirt was mind-blowing. God, was she actually lusting after him? She hadn\u2019t thought herself capable of feeling physical attraction to a man\u2014any man. And yet here she stood, drinking her fill and having decidedly naughty thoughts.</p><p>Who knew she had it in her?</p><p>Instead of inspiring panic, she was filled with the unfamiliar sensation of . . . optimism. She offered him a genuine smile and then gestured for him to come inside. He was carrying two grocery bags and had a bottle of wine tucked under one arm.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll dump it all in the kitchen and get started. I\u2019d love for you to join me and keep me company, though.\u201d</p><p>She followed behind and slid onto one of the barstools as he unloaded the items from the grocery bags.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cAussie chicken,\u201d he said. \u201cEver heard of it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re in for a treat. It\u2019s basically baked chicken br**sts in a homemade honey mustard sauce with bacon, mushrooms and cheese. Can\u2019t go wrong with that combination.\u201d</p><p>She took in his warm smile, soaked it up like an addict in need of a fix. He just had a settling effect on her. She worried she\u2019d become too dependent, that she\u2019d need him too much. She\u2019d never considered herself a clingy person. Just the opposite. She avoided relationships, any bonds with people other than her immediate circle of friends. But she could well see how dependent she could become on Jensen and that scared her. She didn\u2019t want anyone but herself to have any control over her happiness.</p><p>But was she truly happy?</p><p>Even she knew the answer to that one. She wasn\u2019t unhappy but neither was she happy. She just . . . existed. Went through the motions. Lived day-to-day on autopilot. Wasn\u2019t it time for her to wake up and live? Really live?</p><p>\u201cIt sounds delicious,\u201d she said, huskiness lacing her voice.</p><p>He smiled again and she caught her breath. Good God. She was sitting here lusting over him. Her! She breathed in, savoring the newness of such overwhelming emotions. Feelings she\u2019d kept under tight rein her entire life. What was happening to her? Had she merely been waiting for him? Was he the one who\u2019d break through her barriers and make her get over her fears?</p><p>\u201cHow did your dinner with Chessy go?\u201d he asked as he set to work preparing the dish.</p><p>He poured two glasses of wine and slid one across the counter to her. She picked it up and brought it to her lips, inhaling the aroma. She rarely drank and usually only with friends. Alcohol made her uneasy because she was intimately acquainted with the dark side of it. Being around people drinking heavily was something she always avoided.</p><p>\u201cIt went well,\u201d she said, after sipping the drink. \u201cShe\u2019s lonely. Tate\u2019s so busy with his job.\u201d</p><p>Jensen glanced up, his expression seeking. \u201cShe unhappy?\u201d</p> <p>Kylie grimaced. She shouldn\u2019t have said anything. She felt like the worst sort of friend betraying Chessy\u2019s confidence. But there was something about Jensen that caught her off guard and made her relax. Her lips loosened around him and she found herself telling him things she\u2019d never share with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to betray your confidence, Kylie,\u201d Jensen said in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019re just having a conversation. Nothing more. You don\u2019t have to worry about me involving myself in someone else\u2019s relationship. Besides, Tate and I are mere acquaintances, brought together by circumstance more than friendship. I like him and Chessy both. I\u2019d hate to know she was unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me who\u2019s betraying a confidence,\u201d Kylie muttered. \u201cFor some reason I find myself blurting stuff out to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d he observed, staring thoughtfully at her. If there had been any hint of triumph in his eyes, it would have annoyed her, but there was just intent consideration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to feel as though you can talk to me about anything,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Kylie sighed. \u201cTate\u2019s just super busy and Chessy is lonely. I understand that feeling but unlike me, she isn\u2019t used to it. She\u2019s outgoing and bubbly. She needs to be surrounded by people and she needs more of Tate\u2019s time than she\u2019s currently getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how she feels?\u201d Jensen asked. \u201cJust from observing them the few times I\u2019ve been around them, I\u2019d say the man worships the ground she walks on. Most men, upon learning their woman was the least bit unhappy, would move heaven and earth to correct the problem. But if he doesn\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Kylie supplied. \u201cOr at least she hasn\u2019t confronted him. It\u2019s a difficult position she\u2019s in because she feels that if she were to tell Tate she\u2019s unhappy, he would feel as though he failed her. There was a time we talked about her fear that he was cheating. But she wouldn\u2019t confront him because she knew if she ever expressed that kind of doubt in him that it would be a rift that wouldn\u2019t be easily mended. She didn\u2019t want to give him any hint that she didn\u2019t have faith in him. I just want her to be happy. I hate seeing her so sad. It makes me want to smack Tate upside the head and ask him if he even sees what he\u2019s doing to his wife.\u201d</p><p>Jensen grimaced. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a fun place for her to be. Worried but unable to voice her fears. I prefer open communication myself. I\u2019d hate for my woman to ever fear speaking to me about anything.\u201d</p><p>There was an undertone to his statement that was aimed at her. She knew it. He wasn\u2019t talking about Chessy and Tate. He was talking about him and her. He was telling her not to fear ever talking to him about anything.</p><p>\u201cFor some reason I don\u2019t seem to suffer that affliction around you,\u201d she said in bewilderment. \u201cIn fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s just the opposite. I can\u2019t seem to quit just blurting stuff out. I\u2019m not usually such a blabbermouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d he said, his expression sincere. \u201cI like the idea that you\u2019re comfortable enough around me to speak your mind. I hope that it\u2019s the beginnings of trust between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have no idea why. God knows I don\u2019t trust anyone. But for some reason I feel safe with you and that kind of freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>He stopped what he was doing and walked around the counter to where she sat. He spun the stool until she faced him and he framed her face in his hands. His eyes glittered with intensity as he stared down at her. She thought he was going to kiss her and he did, just not where she expected.</p><p>He pressed his lips tenderly to her forehead and she closed her eyes in pleasure over the simple gesture.</p><p>\u201cYou are safe with me, Kylie,\u201d he said as he drew back, his hands still framing her face.</p><p>He stroked his thumb over her lips, lips she thought he would kiss.</p><p>\u201cIf you believe nothing else, you can believe that. You are absolutely safe with me and I don\u2019t just mean physically. You are safe in all ways because I will absolutely protect you from anything that could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she blurted. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m not fishing for compliments, Jensen. It\u2019s a sincere question. You can\u2019t have to look far for female companionship. You could likely have any woman you wanted. So why are you interested in me? Do you have any idea what you\u2019re getting yourself into?\u201d</p><p>His smile was so tender that it made her heart leap and speed up.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m getting myself into,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAs for why you? I can\u2019t answer that. Some things just are. And for me that\u2019s you. I see beyond the image you present to the world to the woman underneath and that\u2019s who I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too different,\u201d she said in a fretful tone. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a control freak and I\u2019m a control freak. It\u2019s not like I have some OCD thing, but I like things a certain way. I need them a certain way. Two control freaks in a relationship? Surely that\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p><p>He continued to smile at her, his eyes warm. He didn\u2019t seem at all put off by her fretting.</p><p>\u201cI understand you far more than you realize,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m no threat to you, Kylie. For the right woman, I have no issue with relinquishing control. What I\u2019m after has nothing to do with physical submission.\u201d</p><p>His words puzzled her. He was speaking as though he were dominant. Like Dash and Tate. And he probably was. Which made his interest in her all the more mystifying.</p><p>\u201cAre you dominant?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou never really answered me before when I asked if you were like Tate and Dash. I know you said you were you and not them. But that wasn\u2019t what I meant. Do you like submissive women? Do you like to dominate them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer submissive women, yes,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cUntil you I would have said that it was the only kind of relationship I would entertain.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up, thundering in her chest. \u201cYou said what you were after had nothing to do with physical submission. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair, his hands returning to her face as he caressed and stroked over her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat it means is that I would never act out any of the more physical aspects of dominance and submission with you,\u201d he said gently. \u201cHave I ever? Yes. I\u2019ve been involved in dominant/submissive relationships with other women where I employed the physical components that sometimes accompany such a lifestyle. But I would never ever demand of you what you can\u2019t give. So when I say that what I\u2019m after has nothing to do with physical submission, in effect what I want is your emotional surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cBut it sounds scary. Perhaps even scarier than physical surrender.\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly more powerful. A woman can give of her body and never share her heart or her soul. A very hollow victory indeed. But a woman who surrenders emotionally to the man who has her care in his hands is a very precious thing. And that\u2019s what I want from you, Kylie. Your emotional surrender. Your trust. Your heart. Your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t ask for much.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the sound low and rumbling from his chest. Then he kissed her forehead again. \u201cYou\u2019ll get there, baby. Just breathe. Don\u2019t overanalyze it. Just breathe and go with it and know I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>She nearly toppled off the stool when he released her to walk back around and resume dinner preparations. Her pulse was racing and she was light-headed. A heady, euphoric feeling took hold, replacing her earlier panic and worry.</p><p>She took a steadying sip of the wine and tried not to let how rattled she was show.</p><p>Several minutes later, Jensen opened her oven and slipped in the casserole dish. He set the timer and then turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another glass of wine in the living room while we wait for dinner to finish cooking.\u201d</p><p>She slid from the stool, hoping she didn\u2019t face-plant. She felt giddy and a little silly around him, like a teenager crushing on the quarterback. But then what did she know about such feelings? She\u2019d never experienced them before because she\u2019d never allowed herself to.</p><p>He waited for her at the end of the bar and held out his hand for her to take. She slid her fingers through his, enjoying the firm imprint of his hand against hers. They walked into the living room and then simply stood there, hands still entwined.</p><p>After a moment, he lifted her hand and pressed a kiss to the inside of her wrist then lowered their clasped hands between them once more.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in half an hour. Would you like to start the movie now or wait and watch it from start to finish after we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can wait,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cNo reason we can\u2019t sit and wait, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all,\u201d he said in smooth tones.</p><p>He led her to the couch and sat, tugging her down beside him.</p><p>She was out of her element and she well knew it. She had no idea how to hold cutesy, flirty conversations. What was she supposed to say? Or do? Did they just sit here and stare at each other?</p><p>She glanced sideways at Jensen, looking for some clue, but he seemed perfectly content to sit next to her in silence. Several long, painful minutes ensued, the awkwardness growing more pronounced with each passing second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe we should wait in the kitchen,\u201d she hedged, uncomfortable with the quiet that had descended.</p><p>He glanced at her, his gaze indecipherable. It wasn\u2019t warm like she\u2019d become accustomed to. Just seeking. Had she committed some dating faux pas she was unaware of? God, she hated this. Surely there were rules or something.</p><p>\u201cLook, uhm, you should know I really suck at this,\u201d she said lamely.</p><p>Amusement glimmered in his eyes. \u201cBreathe, Kylie. Like I told you before. It\u2019s all right. We can go back into the kitchen if that makes you more comfortable. Why don\u2019t you set the table and I\u2019ll check on the progress of the chicken.\u201d</p> <p>Relieved to have something to break the awkwardness, she eagerly rose and headed back to the kitchen. Jensen\u2019s hand on her shoulder stopped her just as she reached the bar.</p><p>\u201cRelax, okay?\u201d</p><p>His voice was soothing and as gentle as his touch. Her shoulder sagged beneath his hand and she turned.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI told you I suck at this. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do. I don\u2019t date. I don\u2019t know how this is supposed to work.\u201d</p><p>He put his other hand to her shoulder and pulled her carefully into his embrace. He tucked her head beneath his chin and simply hugged her. It baffled her that such a mundane thing as a hug from this man instantly calmed her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to work however we make it work,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cI have no expectations for you to fulfill, Kylie. I merely want to spend time with you. Share a meal and enjoy your company. That\u2019s all. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot. You can say it.\u201d</p><p>His body shook with laughter and then he patted her on the behind. \u201cGo set the table and let me finish my pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\u201d</p><p>She busied herself putting out plates and silverware and then got fresh wineglasses and placed the opened bottle on the table just as Jensen took the casserole dish from the oven.</p><p>It smelled heavenly and there was oodles of gooey, melty cheese bubbling over the bacon and the chicken. Her stomach rumbled in appreciation as he set it down on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt looks fabulous,\u201d she said. \u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do? You\u2019re like Superman or something. I bet you don\u2019t suck at anything.\u201d</p> <p>He pretended to give the matter serious consideration before grinning at her. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll be up to you to find all my faults. And believe me, the list is long, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already surmised during our somewhat short acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>She marveled at just how different he seemed around her. Somehow lighter and not as . . . broody. She\u2019d had the thought before but it was reinforced all the more now. He no doubt was good for her, but maybe she was also good for him? It made her feel better to think so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we did get off on the right foot,\u201d she admitted ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m willing to admit that I was mistaken about you. You aren\u2019t quite the ogre I thought you to be.\u201d</p><p>He arched one eyebrow as he dished out portions onto the plates. \u201cNot quite? So there\u2019s still room for some ogreness in your dissection of me?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at the mock seriousness of his question. \u201cThat remains to be seen, but I\u2019m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo very generous, this woman I\u2019m cooking for.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened, all the early awkwardness dissipating. It was starting to feel like a real date. Like two people flirting and verging on the cusp of something new. Good God, an actual relationship even.</p><p>Okay, she had to stop that line of thought or a panic attack would hit her full force. She focused instead on the delicious-smelling plate in front of her and dug in with her knife and fork.</p> <p>The first bite hit all her taste buds in just the right spots. It was perfectly seasoned, tender, the homemade honey mustard sauce utter perfection, and bacon and cheese? It was a well-known fact that it was pretty damn hard to ruin anything by putting bacon and cheese on it.</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful,\u201d she breathed as she swallowed her second bite. \u201cA man who looks like you and who can cook. I can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019re still single.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief flicker in his eyes, gone almost before she registered it was there. But there had been something. A shadow. A remembrance. A sore spot, evidently, judging by that betraying flash. But it was quickly gone, replaced by that warm smile that she loved so much.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m merely waiting on the right woman to settle down,\u201d he said sagely. \u201cOne can never be too finicky when choosing the person they want to spend their life with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, did you say a mouthful,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. Or in my case, it would be more applicable to say that there is no desire to choose that person.\u201d</p><p>He studied her a moment, pausing in eating his meal. It was that intent, steady stare that told her he was reaching into the heart of her, like he could read her mind and pull out every secret. His scrutiny made her feel vulnerable and she didn\u2019t like that at all. Especially when she\u2019d admitted how very safe she felt around him.</p><p>\u201cSo you never intend to find the right guy? Settle down, have a family, fall in love. Not necessarily in that order mind you. Usually love comes first and then the rest, but these are modern times after all. I\u2019d say there no longer is a rhyme or reason to relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, we sound like an episode of Dr. Phil,\u201d she said with a grimace.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd yet you avoided the question. Sorry if I\u2019m getting too philosophical, but you fascinate me and I\u2019ve made it my mission to figure you out. What makes you tick, what makes you happy. Or rather what it will take to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cWhy would you care? This is technically our first date. Surely you can\u2019t be thinking of all of those things yet.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOne never knows when the one will walk into his life. It pays to be prepared. Besides, like I\u2019ve said, you fascinate me. You\u2019re a puzzle I haven\u2019t quite put together yet.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out I have more issues than TIME magazine. You know my history, or at least the major points. No need for all the sordid details. So I\u2019m sure you can understand why I\u2019m not lining them up in the dating department nor am I freaking out because I haven\u2019t found my soul mate at the ripe old age of twenty-five. I figure if it does ever happen, I have plenty of time to figure it all out. For now I just concentrate on living. Surviving. Taking it day-by-day. It\u2019s what has gotten me this far. If it ain\u2019t broke, then don\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch cynicism and pragmatism from someone so young is astounding,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou lay it out so casually, as if it doesn\u2019t bother you one way or another, and yet there\u2019s something there. Maybe others don\u2019t see it. But I do. You want those things, Kylie. You just haven\u2019t worked up the courage to reach out and take them. Nor have you admitted to yourself that you do have needs just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a degree in psychology or something?\u201d she asked with narrowed eyes. \u201cBecause I swear you sound like a damn shrink.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cNope. Just observations on life and my experiences with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith women, you mean,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he said, unruffled by her correction.</p><p>\u201cJust how many women have you been with?\u201d she blurted. Gah! There she went again. Just spewing stuff out without reason or thought. It made her sound like some jealous shrew. Quickly trying to cover up her gaffe, she amended her statement.</p><p>\u201cI mean submissive women. Or have all of your relationships revolved around the dominant/submissive lifestyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t keep count,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThere have hardly been enough to need a catalog. I\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t f**k around nor have I f**ked my way through countless women. I\u2019m not that much of a bastard. I\u2019ve had casual sex, yes. I\u2019ve had relationships. More than five, less than a dozen.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cHow old are you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five. You look surprised. Why?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMost single thirty-five-year-old men have been with far more than a dozen women. It just surprised me, that\u2019s all. I wasn\u2019t judging you. Or condemning. I was genuinely curious about your relationships, and if you enjoy having a submissive woman, why then did those relationships end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t the one,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>His response puzzled her. \u201cHow do you know when you meet the one?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, his eyes warming, giving her that heady pleasurable glow that was ever present when he looked at her that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>She let out a snort of aggravation. This was a man who could well drive her crazy. Crazier than she already was. Vague. His words full of hidden meaning. Some innuendo she was supposed to catch on to. And maybe she was able to read between the lines but was too chickenshit to admit that or to venture into the area of understanding.</p><p>\u201cSo you believe in love and all that accompanies it? Undying loyalty, fidelity and trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He seemed genuinely confused that she spoke so blithely of such an important issue. And she supposed it was important to other people. Just not to her. Love to her was a four-letter word and not the good kind. She\u2019d seen the many manifestations of love in her lifetime and she wasn\u2019t sold on the concept, even if her two best friends were disgustingly happy and head over heels in love with their husbands. She saw Chessy\u2019s unhappiness and knew that love wasn\u2019t a cure-all and that in fact, love was often a complication. It certainly wasn\u2019t an inconvenience she wanted to suffer.</p><p>Love meant giving up the essential part of herself. Her trust. And that wasn\u2019t given lightly to anyone. Loving someone meant making yourself vulnerable. It meant placing your emotional well-being into another\u2019s hands. No thanks. She\u2019d seen the turmoil Joss had suffered as she and Dash had struggled in their relationship. She saw the effects of love in Chessy\u2019s eyes. Saw the hurt and pain brought to you by the letter L. Love.</p><p>She finally shook her head when she realized he was waiting for an answer to his question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t believe in it, I guess. I mean obviously Joss loves Dash and he loves her. She loved Carson and Carson loved her. And while I know Chessy is currently unhappy, I do know that she loves Tate and that Tate loves her. But love is messy and complicated. It seems much simpler and safer to just avoid that kind of emotional entanglement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard-core cynic,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized just how much of one you were. You\u2019re going to be a tough nut to crack, baby, but I\u2019m up for the task. I\u2019ve never backed down from a challenge and I don\u2019t plan to start now.\u201d</p><p>She stared incredulously at him. The things she\u2019d said to him had sent every other man she\u2019d ever attempted to date running for the door like the hounds of hell were after them. And yet Jensen wasn\u2019t remotely put off by her \u201cissues.\u201d If anything they seemed to make him more determined to break through those walls she\u2019d erected. Walls that had been solidly in place her entire adult life and most of her childhood.</p><p>She\u2019d learned at a very young age how to protect her mind, her sanity. To shut out the world around her and stay in self-preservation mode. It had served her well, but had made personal relationships impossible. Because who wanted to deal with such a head case, much less make a commitment to one?</p><p>She glanced down at her plate, surprised to see it was empty, then she looked over at Jensen\u2019s to find he too was finished. What now? Once again, she felt the awkwardness of not knowing what came next.</p><p>The movie. He had a movie. The plan was to eat dinner and watch a movie. Simple enough. She could handle that.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for the movie?\u201d she asked, proud of the initiative she took. \u201cI\u2019ll just put the plates in the sink and wash them later. Why don\u2019t you go start up the movie and I\u2019ll bring us both a glass of wine, unless you\u2019d prefer something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine is fine. Your company is what I want most. Anything else is just bonus material.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. What to even say to that? He was seducing her with mere words and that heart-melting, warm, fuzzy smile he sent her way every so often. He hadn\u2019t even tried to get into her pants and they were already halfway down.</p><p>Disgusted with her raging hormones\u2014why had they picked now to rear their ugly head?\u2014she took the plates and did a quick rinse before leaving them in the sink to take care of later.</p><p>She took a moment to compose herself and calm her racing pulse down. It was just a movie. For God\u2019s sake, get it together.</p><p>She poured two glasses of wine, though she had no intention of drinking hers. She\u2019d already had her limit and the last thing she wanted was a fuzzy head. Jensen did that to her all on his own. No alcohol needed, though the liquid courage aspect might be appealing.</p><p>When she entered the living room, Jensen was leaning back on the couch looking very much at home. The remote was in his hand and he had the movie paused at the beginning. She didn\u2019t even know what they were watching. Did it matter? She doubted she\u2019d remember much of it anyway.</p><p>He held out his hand to her, not for the wine, but to take her hand once she placed the glasses on the coffee table. She allowed him to slide his fingers through hers and pull her gently to the couch beside him.</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s better,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNow the evening can begin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSome zombie apocalypse movie,\u201d he said with a twist of his lips. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea at the time. I had to be careful with my selection so you didn\u2019t read anything into my choice or my intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should I worry that you\u2019ll bite me and infect me with some virulent strain of some super virus?\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI like your sense of humor, Kylie. It fits mine well. Though some would likely argue that neither of us has one. But I think we fit just fine.\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks warmed because no, no one had ever accused her of having a sense of humor, twisted or not.</p><p>He laid his arm over the top of the couch, a silent invitation for her to move closer. She hesitated at first, not wanting to be obvious, but she found herself gravitating to the warmth and strength of his body.</p><p>Soon she was cuddled up next to him, his arm hung loosely over her shoulders. His fingers danced idly over her upper arm, eliciting a trail of chill bumps. His touch was like fire, even through her shirt. She tried to focus on the movie but found herself increasingly distracted by her proximity to his body.</p><p>At one point she turned to look at him only to find him staring intently at her, his eyes glowing. So very warm. Comforting. Unconsciously she leaned in, not even realizing what she was doing. He met her advance and brushed his lips softly across hers.</p><p>It was an electrical shock to her system. She shivered uncontrollably and then he deepened the kiss, his tongue swiping over her lips, licking and then sliding inside to brush over hers.</p> <p>He tasted of the wine they\u2019d drunk. That and something altogether different. Heady. Masculine. The taste was undefinable. But she liked it. A lot.</p><p>She breathed out a soft sigh as his arms wrapped around her, turning her more solidly so the angle was better. His lips never left hers, his mouth devouring hers hungrily.</p><p>She was lost in a cascade of sensation, dizzying, intensely pleasurable and also warm and soothing. Her br**sts ached, pressed flat against his chest. Her ni**les beaded, pushing outward as if begging for his attention. His mouth.</p><p>Shocked that she\u2019d have such a thought, she went still, the strong beat of his heart thudding against her chest. His respirations were fast, rushing into her mouth and over her face.</p><p>And then he lowered her to the couch, angling his body over hers, pressing hard and heavy down on her. Panic snaked up her spine as dark memories surfaced, clawing their way to the present.</p><p>She lost her sense of awareness. Of where she was and who she was with. All she knew was that she was in immediate danger. His strength overwhelmed her. She felt helpless. Weak. Unable to prevent whatever he wanted to do to her.</p> <p>Blackness gushed through her mind, wiping away all sense of euphoria and safety. Her chest caught on fire as she desperately tried to breathe but found no air. Her throat constricted as she tried to scream. To beg him to stop. To have mercy. Not to hurt her.</p><p>And then self-preservation kicked in and she began to fight. She went wild beneath this predator, wanting only to escape the harm he intended. She scratched, kicked, and finally was able to gather enough breath to scream.</p><p>Hysteria rose sharp, quickly overwhelming her. She was unaware of the firm hands around her wrists, holding them so she couldn\u2019t hurt him or herself. Of the soothing voice calling her name. Telling her it was all right.</p><p>She dimly registered those things, but they were so distant. All she was cognizant of was her will to survive. Not to ever again endure what she\u2019d endured before.</p><p>Tears bathed her face and she became aware of a high keening sound. It was coming from her. God, it was her making that god-awful sound. Why wouldn\u2019t it stop?</p><p>\u201cKylie! Kylie! Listen to me. It\u2019s me, Jensen. You\u2019re safe, baby. God, please come back to me. I won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The entire room was spinning like some crazy Tilt-A-Whirl at the fair. Nausea rose, swift and violent, and she bolted upward, the bands around her wrists suddenly gone.</p><p>She hunched over in a protective position, shielding her most vulnerable parts. Her ribs, her belly, places that could easily be injured. Wetness soaked into her shirt sleeves and she realized she was sobbing. Giant, silent sobs welling from the deepest recesses of her chest.</p> <p>A strong hand hesitantly touched her shoulder and she flinched, turning, determined to ward off an attack.</p><p>\u201cKylie, God, baby. It\u2019s me. Please, baby. Look at me. See me.\u201d</p><p>Jensen\u2019s worried plea broke through the haze. Some of the panic dissipated, leaving her with only humiliation and abject despair. She was broken. Broken. Unfixable. Nothing would ever be right. Not for her. Never again.</p><p>She buried her face in her arms and rocked back and forth, too mortified to even look at him. How crazy he must think she was. Not think. Knew.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just go away,\u201d she begged, her voice muffled by her arms. \u201cPlease. I can\u2019t bear it. I\u2019m so sorry. Just go. Please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, you won\u2019t apologize for this,\u201d he seethed.</p><p>The fury in his voice made her wary again and she risked a quick peek at him to gauge his temper, readying herself for the violence that would surely follow.</p><p>But he was sitting a distance from her, almost as if he were careful to maintain a barrier between them. A barrier she\u2019d erected. Damn it, but when would she stop freaking out? Could she ever expect to have a normal life? Was it too much to ask?</p><p>Another sob welled low in her throat and tears ran like rivers down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do to help you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Jensen\u2019s voice was pleading. He sounded desperate and as out of sorts as she was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she choked out. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s me. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I didn\u2019t,\u201d he bit out. \u201cIt was a stupid, boneheaded thing of me to have done. I got carried away. That\u2019s on me. Not you. Goddamn it, Kylie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, shaking it almost violently, tears still running in rivulets down her face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cNot your fault. Please, just go. I just want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He looked uncertain. It was obvious he didn\u2019t want to leave her in her present state but neither did he want to further upset her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she said, attempting to reassure him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just go. I\u2019ve ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you like this,\u201d he said, fury lacing his voice. \u201cI did this to you. I reminded you of him and I\u2019d goddamn die before ever making you feel that way with me. I can\u2019t stomach the thought.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head miserably to her arms, grief overwhelming her. Jensen had been nothing but kind and gentle with her. So very understanding. And she\u2019d repaid him by making him feel like some abusive asshole. Her father. Oh God, why couldn\u2019t she control her reactions? Why did she have to freak out the minute things got heavy?</p><p>\u201cKylie?\u201d</p><p>His voice was tentative and seeking. But she couldn\u2019t look at him. Not knowing how she\u2019d made him feel. She shook her head, the words sad and defeated as they slipped from her lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease just go, Jensen. That\u2019s what you can do for me. And please, don\u2019t bear the burden for what happened. It isn\u2019t your fault. You were nothing but gentle and patient with me. I\u2019m mortified and just want to be alone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the very last thing you need,\u201d he huffed out in frustration.</p><p>She looked up to see him run an agitated hand through his cropped hair. He looked utterly indecisive, something she\u2019d normally never associate with him. He was a man who was self-assured, if nothing else.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust go. I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before.\u201d</p><p>Her statement only seemed to enrage him more. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to deal with this alone. But if I\u2019m making things worse, I\u2019ll go. It\u2019s not what I want, but for you, I\u2019ll do it. But I don\u2019t have to f**king like it or agree with it.\u201d</p><p>She managed a shaky smile through watery eyes.</p><p>He hesitated, as if deciding whether to touch her or do anything other than say good-bye. Then finally he rose from the couch, defeat burning in his eyes. She hated that she\u2019d done that to him. That she\u2019d taken him down with her in her never-ending mire of despair.</p><p>This was a lesson to her. A hard one, but a lesson nonetheless. She wasn\u2019t capable of a normal, healthy relationship with anyone. She was an idiot to have dreamed, even for a moment, that it was possible.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>JENSEN got behind the wheel of his car and pounded the steering wheel in frustration. Goddamn it! It went against every instinct to leave Kylie in the state she was. Only the knowledge that his presence was making it worse, that she was utterly humiliated and he was only adding to her distress, had convinced him to go.</p><p>What he wanted to do was barge back in, take her in his arms and hold her the entire night. Even if it meant spending another night handcuffed to her bed.</p><p>The idea that he\u2019d brought back even a moment of her past gutted him. That going forward she would associate her abuse at the hands of a monster with him was more than he could stomach.</p><p>Seeing her pale and shaken, utterly broken and in despair, had reopened old wounds of his own. Memories long suppressed crowded to the surface making him feel as helpless as he had as a kid, watching his mother being abused, powerless to make it stop and then feeling the brunt of his father\u2019s rage when he tried to intervene.</p><p>No, Kylie wasn\u2019t the only one who had demons to fight. But it was evident that she\u2019d never found a way to cope. She, unlike Jensen, was still rooted solidly in the past. It was as alive and vivid in her mind as if it had happened yesterday.</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to break through? How could he ever gain her trust? And why was it so important to him that he did?</p><p>Kylie was a woman who was all wrong for him and yet so very right at the same time. She was nothing like the other women he\u2019d involved himself with. She was fragile and so very breakable and being around her meant suppressing everything of himself that made him who he was.</p><p>Was she worth it?</p><p>As soon as the question fluttered through his mind he already knew the answer. Knew he\u2019d already committed himself to the fact that she was very much worth the effort. But for the first time, failure seemed a possibility and he was not accustomed to failing in anything. Not since he was a child.</p><p>While he sat in the driveway of Kylie\u2019s home, he picked up his cell phone and scrolled through his contacts for Chessy Morgan\u2019s number. He hit Send and then put the phone to his ear, waiting for her to pick up, praying that she would pick up.</p><p>\u201cChessy?\u201d he said when a female voice answered. \u201cThis is Jensen Tucker, Dash\u2019s partner,\u201d he added hastily so she wouldn\u2019t assume it was a telemarketer and hang up.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jensen.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was friendly and wary at the same time, as if she was puzzled over him calling her. Hell, he couldn\u2019t blame her. They\u2019d only met once, though Dash had given Jensen Tate\u2019s and Chessy\u2019s numbers in case there were problems while Dash and Joss were away.</p><p>\u201cYou know Kylie and I had a date tonight,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Chessy said in a stricken voice. \u201cWhat happened? Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cShe was hysterical and then humiliated and embarrassed. She insisted I leave and she doesn\u2019t need to be alone right now. I thought maybe you could check in on her. I don\u2019t like leaving her this way but neither will I stay and add to her stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you so much for calling, Jensen. It was very thoughtful of you to do. I\u2019ll come right over. She won\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m pushy that way and she loves me, even if I piss her off.\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled, some of the tension easing from his shoulders. Kylie would be in good hands. Caring hands. She\u2019d be with someone who loved her and wouldn\u2019t allow herself to be pushed away. Not like Jensen had.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jensen said sincerely. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about her. I . . . care . . . about her,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI think that much is obvious,\u201d Chessy said softly. \u201cTry not to worry, Jensen. I\u2019ll call you if things don\u2019t get better or they worsen.\u201d</p><p>Jensen thanked her again and then hung up, backing out from Kylie\u2019s driveway before he gave in to his impulse to burst back through her door and take care of her himself.</p><p>IT was a long time before Jensen drifted into an uneasy sleep. And when sleep did finally come, so too did the nightmares he\u2019d thought he\u2019d left behind.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s panic and stress had opened a door he\u2019d firmly shut on his past. It brought back so much of what he\u2019d tried to forget. To shove firmly to the back of his mind never to haunt him again.</p><p>He\u2019d told Kylie they shared far more in common than she realized, but he\u2019d never intended for her to know just how much. He wouldn\u2019t burden her with that. Ever.</p><p>He woke in the firm grasp of a nightmare. He came awake with a gasp, sweat soaking his skin. His fingers curled into fists, lashing out at an unseen attacker. Someone trying to hurt not him, but Kylie. Kylie had replaced himself, his mother, in his nightmares and helplessness gripped him, just as it had so many years ago when he\u2019d been forced to stand by, unable to prevent his father from hurting either of them.</p><p>Only now it was Kylie. Hurting. Crying. And he was as helpless now as he had been then. A vulnerability he\u2019d sworn never to suffer again.</p><p>He rolled to his side, his breaths coming short and ragged, the images still too bright in his mind for him to settle. What was Kylie doing right now? Was she being tortured in her sleep just as he was? And was there hope for either of them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or were they too fucked-up to ever be able to build a solid foundation?</p><p>Being with her was a hell in itself. Being without her was worse. But if he hurt her . . . He closed his eyes, warding off the invading darkness, the violent spiral spinning round and round his head.</p><p>He cursed the fact he was leaving the next day and welcomed it in turns. He hated the thought of being away from Kylie that long, of not knowing how she was doing. If she was eating and sleeping. Taking proper care of herself. But he also welcomed the break. Perhaps it was what they both needed. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but it could well be what he needed.</p><p>A break. Like they were some longstanding couple in a relationship where one or both needed to take a step back and gain perspective. They weren\u2019t a couple. They\u2019d only had one official date.</p> <p>The question was whether she\u2019d ever give them\u2014him\u2014another chance or if he\u2019d f**ked up any possibility at something special with her. They were kindred spirits. Both wounded souls in need of solace. She was a much-needed balm to his senses, to those dark memories that lurked just beneath the surface. But what was he for her?</p><p>A nauseated feeling entered his gut once again at the thought that his touch had made her think even momentarily of the sick f**k who\u2019d abused her. It honest-to-God made him want to vomit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you up, Kylie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEven if I never had you to begin with. I can\u2019t just walk away even if that\u2019s what you beg me to do.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes on the fervent vow, holding it close, like a talisman.</p><p>The next four days would be the longest of his life. But when he returned? He was coming back to Kylie and whatever it took, they\u2019d face down her demons together.</p> <p>TWELVE</p><p>KYLIE closed her eyes, mentally getting it back together before she refocused on the stack of memos in front of her. Chessy\u2019s admonishment still rang in her ears. Her friend hadn\u2019t wanted her to go into work Monday. Or Tuesday for that matter. Now it was Wednesday and perhaps Chessy had seen the inevitability of her trying to make her friend stay home because she hadn\u2019t gotten her usual morning phone call, nor had Chessy come over to try and persuade her not to go into work.</p><p>It should have comforted Kylie that Jensen had cared enough to ask Chessy to come over, that he hadn\u2019t wanted her to be alone, but somehow Chessy seeing her at her worst just made the edge of humiliation worse. Chessy had insisted on staying the night, and she\u2019d been there when Kylie had woken, screaming, in the throes of a nightmare. God. The idea of anyone seeing her like that made her sick.</p><p>It was bad enough Jensen had witnessed two meltdowns already.</p><p>She opened her eyes, though the papers still swam in her vision. Her head ached vilely, the product of sleepless nights. Instead of seeking rest, she\u2019d made herself stay awake, too afraid to slide into the blackness of her dreams. She was safe as long as she was awake and able to control her thoughts, her memories. Only when she slid into sleep did her past torment her.</p><p>Eventually she\u2019d have to sleep and hopefully by then she\u2019d be so exhausted that her body would shut down and she would sleep dreamlessly.</p> <p>If she were completely honest with herself, she\u2019d admit that she missed Jensen\u2019s presence in the office. With it just being her for the few days Jensen was gone, the office seemed bigger, so quiet. Intimidating. She hadn\u2019t realized until now just how safe she felt when he was just down the hall. Or in her office bugging her.</p><p>She imagined whatever had been between her and Jensen, or whatever it was he wanted, was impossible now. He\u2019d likely keep his distance from her, and who could blame him? Who wanted a stark raving lunatic to deal with?</p><p>She glanced at the clock, willing the hours to pass. Not so she could go home and exist in solitude, avoiding Chessy and her concerns. But she was counting the hours until Jensen returned.</p><p>Tomorrow. Which meant one more night where she\u2019d do whatever it took to stay awake. Exhaustion was heavy in her veins, bearing down on her shoulders and making her mind muggy and fuzzy.</p><p>She lay her head briefly on her desk, resting it on the piles of paperwork to sort through. Just a moment to close her eyes. It was all she needed.</p><p>She gave a soft sigh and let her eyelashes flutter closed only to fly open when she heard a noise at her office door. She whipped her head up, instantly regretting that action. The room spun dizzyingly around her as she drank in the sight of Jensen standing in her office door, a grim expression on his face.</p><p>Her heart sped up and it shamed her, the surge of utter relief she felt that he was back. A whole day early. She was positively weak with relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done to yourself?\u201d he asked, his voice hoarse with concern. \u201cJesus Christ, Kylie, have you even slept at all while I\u2019ve been gone?\u201d</p> <p>She rose defensively, standing straight up, her fingers clenched into tight balls on her desk.</p><p>She started to say she was just fine and that it was none of his business, but the room seemed to blacken around her, and she had the sudden urge to sit back down.</p><p>She heard Jensen\u2019s biting curse from across the room, seemingly a mile away. And then strangely, she found herself on the floor with no recollection of how she got there.</p><p>Her last conscious thought was Jensen\u2019s worried calling of her name. But blackness surrounded her, lulling her with its soft embrace, and she reached for it, because within it she found peace. Finally. Jensen was here. She was safe. She could let go now.</p><p>JENSEN quickly gathered Kylie into his arms, pulling her close, checking to make sure she was breathing. He suspected she\u2019d merely worked herself into exhaustion and probably hadn\u2019t slept the entire time he\u2019d been gone, but he couldn\u2019t be too certain.</p><p>The soft puffs of her exhalations, the slow rise and fall of her chest, soothed the raw edge of his temper\u2014and his worry.</p><p>She looked like hell, and yet she was still the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. Dark smudges seemed permanently imprinted below her eyes. Her face looked thinner, drawn. If he thought she looked fragile before, she looked even more so now.</p><p>She\u2019d reached that breaking point. The one he\u2019d feared so much. And now it was up to him to go in, take over, and make damn sure she got the care she needed.</p><p>He stood, bearing her slight weight with him. Uncaring of leaving the offices unlocked, he carried her into the parking garage and gently laid her in the backseat of his car. When he was sure she was comfortable, he stalked around to the driver\u2019s seat and roared the engine to life. He peeled out of the garage going as fast as safety allowed him.</p><p>He had only one direction in mind. His home. Not hers. Not this time. He\u2019d take her where he knew he could keep her safe, where he could be certain she got the rest she needed as well as the care. And she damn well wasn\u2019t going back into work for the rest of the week.</p><p>He could work from home and put out any fires that arose. If he knew Kylie, ever efficient Kylie, she\u2019d made certain that everything else that had cropped up had been taken care of. The rest could rot. Dash would be home this weekend and he could take over Monday morning. Kylie wasn\u2019t doing a damn thing for a long time if Jensen had any say. And he would.</p><p>Kylie had reached her breaking point and goddamn it but he\u2019d pushed her solidly over the edge. It horrified him, was still an ache in his gut, that he\u2019d reminded her of past hurts. It set his teeth on edge. He only wanted to make it right, however that had to be done. And he only knew one way to do that.</p><p>It meant pushing her, but in a different way. He only wanted to take care of her. To allow her to lean on someone else, something he was certain she\u2019d never done. She was a solitary figure, a reflection of himself in many ways. Two lonely, scarred souls. Maybe together they could heal.</p><p>Somehow he had to break past her barriers, follow the path to the very heart and soul of her and prove that she could trust him. That she could rely on him, that he\u2019d never willingly hurt her. Nothing in his current thoughts even alluded to sex. That could wait. Forever if necessary.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t about sex or making love. He couldn\u2019t very well lie and say that he didn\u2019t want her, that he didn\u2019t lie awake at night aching with need to make love to her. But she wasn\u2019t ready. And when the time did come, he knew he was going to have to do something he\u2019d never done with any other woman.</p><p>Relinquish control.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an entirely comfortable thought. It made him feel . . . vulnerable. But however vulnerable he felt, the emotion was tenfold for Kylie. For her he could and would make the ultimate sacrifice. She was worth it. He knew it to his bones.</p><p>Some things were just meant to be and he and Kylie were one of those things. He\u2019d recognized it the moment they\u2019d met. She\u2019d been unable to meet his gaze. She was understandably skittish around him. But something about her fragility and the iron core he saw, the resolve and strength in her even as fragile as she\u2019d seemed, just struck a chord with him.</p><p>Here was a woman who was meant for him and he hoped to hell he was meant for her.</p><p>He\u2019d never been a big believer in fate or destiny, but the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on Kylie he\u2019d realized that she was his destiny. The hell of it was whether he would be hers.</p><p>He pulled into his drive and quickly got out, opening the door to the backseat where Kylie still lay unconscious. He wondered if she\u2019d slept at all during his absence. He needed to call Chessy. He\u2019d touched base with her only once, the morning after when Chessy had told him she\u2019d spent the night and Kylie had awakened screaming from nightmares.</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly as the pain of that phone conversation hit him all over again. The knowledge that he\u2019d done that to her. Had pushed her too far too fast too soon. He\u2019d been remiss in not checking in more frequently with Chessy, but guilt had kept him from making another call. He\u2019d been a fool. It wasn\u2019t a mistake he\u2019d make again. Ever.</p><p>Not again. This time it would all be up to her. She was in the driver\u2019s seat except when it came to matters of her health. That he would solidly take over and he felt zero remorse for what he was embarking on. Kylie needed someone. And that someone was going to be him.</p><p>He gathered her gently in his arms and carried his precious bundle inside, kicking the door shut behind him. Bypassing the living room, he walked into his bedroom and eased her down on the bed.</p><p>She never even stirred when he pulled the covers from beneath her and then repositioned her so her head was resting on a pillow. He slipped off her shoes but left her clothed. He was in no way taking advantage of her weakened state and she\u2019d be freaked-out enough when she woke in a strange bed. He wanted no question in her mind that he\u2019d not so much as touched her.</p><p>He slid the covers up over her body and then tenderly pushed the strands of hair from her face, tucking them behind one ear.</p><p>For a long moment he simply stood there staring down at her, filled with the sense of rightness. She belonged here. In his bed. In his home. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but this was where she was the safest. Where he could protect her from whatever threatened her. He\u2019d move heaven and earth to ensure she felt protected.</p><p>Had she ever truly felt safe with anyone except her brother? He knew she had good friends, a tight circle of people, only a handful. But he wondered if any one of them ever truly saw to the heart of her. If she ever confided her darkest fears and secrets.</p><p>Everything he\u2019d learned about her had been from a third party. But he wanted her to trust him enough to share her past with him herself. Not because he had any morbid curiosity. What he did know sickened him. He simply wanted her trust and knew it wouldn\u2019t be given easily.</p><p>But she\u2019d already said that she trusted him on some level. Had said somewhat in bewilderment that she seemed to just blurt out things to him she wouldn\u2019t ordinarily confide. That had to mean something, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>Only time would tell. He was a patient man when the reward was worth it. He hadn\u2019t become the success he was by being impulsive or impatient. And he knew that Kylie would present the biggest challenge of his life. Be the ultimate test of his patience and endurance.</p><p>He\u2019d have to be strong enough for the both of them because she needed that above all else. And perhaps she would chase his own demons away. She\u2019d certainly challenge his entire lifestyle, his dominance, things he\u2019d ordinarily never surrender to any woman.</p><p>She required special handling. He knew this, acknowledged it. It was new territory for him and he didn\u2019t try to delude himself into thinking it would be easy. He needed control. He didn\u2019t just desire it. It wasn\u2019t some kink he enjoyed. It was a necessary component of his existence and yet he\u2019d give it up without a moment\u2019s thought for this fragile woman lying in his bed.</p><p>It was unnerving. He could admit that. Tendrils of fear clutched at him, because for the first time in his life he was contemplating giving up the one thing he held dear above all else. Control. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever do lightly. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d even ever considered until now.</p><p>Love was sacrifice. It was making the ultimate compromise.</p><p>Love? Was that what he felt for Kylie?</p><p>He shook his head in confusion. He wasn\u2019t at all sure what his feelings for this woman were. It was certainly too soon to be in love with her. Their relationship was tenuous at best. They had only a fledgling trust that had begun to build and that may have all been ruined on their last night together.</p><p>He certainly felt more for her than he\u2019d ever felt for another woman. That much he could acknowledge. But he\u2019d never considered himself in love with a woman before. To be so would have meant relinquishing control over his tightly held emotions. And he\u2019d never entertained such a thing. Until now. Until Kylie.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He was in deep. Way deep. And this was by far not a slam dunk. The path before him was long, winding and uncertain at best. It would be the biggest risk of his life. And it all came down to his earlier question. Was she worth it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even as he posed the question again, his answer was still the same.</p><p>Yeah, she was worth it. God only knew why but there it was. He couldn\u2019t simply walk away from her, no matter that it was the path of least resistance.</p><p>He was stuck, for lack of a better word. In between a rock and a hard place no doubt. His fate, his future, was in the hands of this delicate woman and the hell of it was she had no idea. No inkling that she had him so tied in knots.</p><p>He massaged his nape, weariness assailing him. He\u2019d wrapped things up in Dallas a day early, eager to be back, to see for himself how Kylie was faring. Now he realized he never should have left, no matter that this contract was huge for his company. She\u2019d needed him and he\u2019d failed her. Just as he\u2019d failed her their last night together.</p><p>That would all end now because going forward she was his primary concern.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>KYLIE climbed through the heavy veil of sleep, realizing at once that something was very different. Oddly, no panic registered. Just a sense of . . . well-being. She felt warm and safe.</p><p>She emitted a contented sigh and snuggled deeper into the strong embrace that surrounded her like the thickest blanket.</p><p>\u201cHey, you with me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, her eyelashes slowly fluttering open. Only to collide with a very familiar, very warm gaze.</p><p>Jensen?</p><p>She struggled to remember all that had happened. For that matter, where the heck was she?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, baby. You\u2019re safe. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>His murmur of reassurance calmed her but her brow furrowed in silent question.</p><p>\u201cYou collapsed at the office. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>More came into focus, and she blinked, realizing they were in bed. Together. And not her bed.</p><p>She pushed herself upward, surprised at the strength it took to perform such a simple function.</p><p>\u201cEasy. Don\u2019t move too fast,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cTake it nice and slow. Breathe for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust confused. Where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house. I brought you here. You worried the hell out of me, Kylie. When was the last time you slept? You were obviously running on fumes. Thank God I got there when I did.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around, taking in the masculine feel of the room. The furnishings. The colors and the huge bed they currently occupied. She was nestled up close to him, their legs entwined.</p><p>Immediately her gaze shot downward, and she was relieved to see she was fully clothed. Surely she\u2019d remember if they\u2019d had sex!</p><p>He nudged her chin upward with a gentle finger, his gaze sincere.</p> <p>\u201cNothing happened, baby. I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of you that way. You passed out at the office and I brought you here and put you to bed. You\u2019ve slept sixteen hours straight.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock and then horror. \u201cOh my God. I should be at work! What time is it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and his lips turned down into a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas. You aren\u2019t going near the office any time soon. What you\u2019re going to do is stay here and catch up on much-needed rest. You aren\u2019t going to so much as lift a finger for the next several days and that\u2019s not negotiable.\u201d</p><p>She had absolutely nothing to say about that. What could she? She stared at him in bewilderment. Why was she here? Why hadn\u2019t he washed his hands of her?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he murmured, his brow furrowing in concentration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering why you\u2019re here, or rather why I\u2019m here,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you didn\u2019t run as fast and as far away from me as possible after what happened.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened and he stroked a hand down her arm to rest on her hip. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, baby. And neither are you for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly want me after what happened,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI can and I do,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work a hell of a lot harder than that to scare me away. You and I are inevitable, Kylie. I\u2019ve accepted that. Now you have to as well.\u201d</p><p>Warmth rushed through her veins and with it, relief. Overwhelming, mind-boggling relief. She sagged against the pillow, her strength leaving her. Why was she so relieved? Shouldn\u2019t she be pissed? Shouldn\u2019t she be arguing the point? Convincing him that they weren\u2019t possible and that he should leave her alone?</p><p>What did it say that the only reaction she could conjure to his autocratic demand was . . . relief?</p><p>\u201cI seem to do nothing around you except freak out,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou have to be some kind of a masochist to sign up for more.\u201d</p><p>Humor glinted in those dark eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through it, baby. Together.\u201d</p><p>Longing like she\u2019d never experienced flooded her heart. And hope. Genuine and unfettered hope. He wasn\u2019t giving up on her. He was sticking it out, and he\u2019d seen her at her absolute worst. If he could get past that, he could get past anything, couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized just how much she\u2019d hoped for such a thing until now. She\u2019d braced herself for the inevitability of his rejection. She\u2019d known with absolute certainty that he\u2019d drop her like a bad habit after the ass she\u2019d made of herself on their date. And yet here he was, resolve shining in those beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cTogether,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Hope flared in his own eyes. Had he been as convinced that she\u2019d reject him as she had been that he\u2019d reject her?</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t slept since I left, but have you not eaten either?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to remember, to get through the fog of the last few days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOkay, you stay put. Don\u2019t even think about getting out of bed. I have a T-shirt you can change into and some sweat pants too. But that\u2019s it. Get up long enough to change if you like but then you get your ass back in bed and wait until I bring you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>He grinned and tousled her hair affectionately. \u201cI like that attitude, baby.\u201d</p><p>Then he pushed off the bed and she saw that he too was fully dressed. She was touched by the knowledge that he\u2019d taken such care to make sure she had no doubts as to what went on when he\u2019d brought her here.</p><p>The man had to have the patience of Job because God knew he was dealing with a complete head case.</p><p>She watched as he walked away and then glanced down to the end of the bed where the clothing he\u2019d set out for her was. She felt grubby and wanted a shower, but that might get her into trouble since he\u2019d been adamant that she stay in bed. And, well, the idea of going through the motions of taking a shower exhausted her. She was still tired and the idea of staying in bed certainly appealed. Breakfast in bed? Even better.</p><p>She hurriedly changed, not wanting to chance him returning and seeing her na**d. She tossed aside her work clothes and slid into the much more comfortable shirt and sweat pants.</p><p>They smelled of him. It was almost as good as having him wrapped around her. Almost but not quite. She slid back underneath the covers and inhaled deeply, savoring his scent on the pillow next to her.</p><p>It was a ridiculous thing to do but she quickly exchanged her pillow for his, glancing guiltily at the doorway to make sure he hadn\u2019t seen. But she wanted his pillow. Wanted his scent surrounding her.</p><p>She settled back down, closing her eyes, savoring the warmth and comfort of his bed, his pillow and his clothing. Him.</p><p>A few moments later, he came back into the bedroom carrying a tray. She hastily sat up, plumping her pillow behind her back as he set the tray in front of her.</p><p>Waffles and bacon. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cThis looks wonderful,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He scooted onto the bed beside her so they were shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEat up,\u201d he encouraged. \u201cI don\u2019t want a single bite left over.\u201d</p><p>She grinned as she swallowed a scrumptious bite. \u201cAdmit it. You love getting to boss me around. It\u2019s that whole dominant thing you have going on.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised at the ease with which she spoke of the matter. It surprised her as well. It should freak her out. Certainly everything else had. And yet she knew to her soul that this man would never willfully hurt her. She might not know much else, but she did know that. Maybe it made her a trusting fool, but she felt safe with him. He\u2019d seen her at her most vulnerable and he didn\u2019t lord it over her. He didn\u2019t try to press his obvious advantage. He treated her like she was precious. Breakable. With tenderness she didn\u2019t fully comprehend but that she savored wholly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn in time that you have all the power where I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said in a serious tone. \u201cAnd that I have none.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, the food stuck in her throat as she processed his declaration. Everything about him radiated authority and yet he was saying she had all the power? How was that even possible?</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>His gaze was intent, unfaltering, stroking over her face like sunshine. \u201cWhat it means is that you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat, baby. Whatever happens from here on out is up to you. It means that when or if we make love, you\u2019ll be in complete control and I will be at your mercy. It means that when it comes to you, I\u2019m not dominant, nor do I have any desire to be. I am, in effect, at your feet.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. How the hell was she even supposed to respond to that? Emotion knotted and welled in her throat and suddenly she felt like crying. Not because she was sad but because she was utterly overwhelmed by the magnitude of what he was offering her. This was not a man who made concessions like this lightly. Everything about him screamed dominant, alpha male. And yet he was willing to suppress what made him who he was for her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve this kind of gift. She wasn\u2019t worthy of it. And the fact that he was offering it to her destroyed any wall she would have erected between them. She was defenseless against such unselfishness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing I want you to say is that you\u2019ll stay here with me for the next several days. Let me take care of you. Let me work on building trust between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there an us?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want there to be,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cBut you have to want it too. If you only want it half as much as I do it\u2019s a starting point.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath until she was light-headed and then, before she could chicken out and tuck tail and run, just like she did in every other aspect of her life, she took the plunge.</p><p>\u201cYes and okay,\u201d she said, the words tumbling out.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cBe a little more specific, baby. I need to know what you\u2019re saying here. This is too important for me to make assumptions or to think you\u2019re saying something you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath and blew it out, steadying herself before inevitable meltdown occurred. \u201cYes I\u2019ll stay with you, and okay, I\u2019ll give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>The relief was so stark in his eyes that it was like a punch in the stomach. She hadn\u2019t realized how much he wanted this\u2014her. It was mind-boggling that they\u2019d gone from antagonists to potential lovers, or something more than just acquaintances. She couldn\u2019t quite make the leap to lovers in her mind because that night was still too bright in her mind.</p><p>He gently framed her face in his hands, turning her to face him. He stroked her cheekbones with his thumbs and then lowered his head, tenderly touching his lips to hers. He licked syrup from her lips in a light brush that sent a spark shooting through her veins.</p><p>Her body wanted him. Now her mind just had to follow suit. Her heart was in accord with her body. Now she just had to get her damn brain to stop freaking the f**k out every time things got heavy.</p><p>God, maybe she did need to see a shrink. She\u2019d never even entertained the thought. She\u2019d never had a solid reason to want to try and deal with her issues. But Jensen gave her that reason. He gave her hope. He gave her many things she\u2019d never thought she\u2019d have or even want to have.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean when you said, uhm, that if we made love that I would be in control?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>He stroked her face again, pushing her hair back as he stared into her eyes. \u201cIt means that if we decide to take that step that I will willingly put myself in a vulnerable position so you feel absolutely safe. Whatever that takes. But baby, it doesn\u2019t have to be now. It doesn\u2019t have to be soon. It will be whenever you\u2019re ready for it to happen. I don\u2019t want you to ever be pressured to offer me something you\u2019re not ready to give. We have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d wait that long?\u201d</p><p>She tried to keep the doubt from her voice, but knew she failed miserably. Still, he didn\u2019t look offended or angry at her skepticism. If anything his look grew even more tender.</p><p>\u201cFor the right woman, I\u2019d wait forever.\u201d</p><p>It came out as a solemn vow. There was absolutely no doubt in his voice and his conviction was unwavering.</p><p>She shook her head in wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. I really don\u2019t. I was so bitchy toward you. How could you possibly even like me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and placed his hand over her heart. \u201cBecause I could see through the prickly, protective barriers to the woman in here, and I liked what I saw. You didn\u2019t fool me for a minute, baby. Maybe others are more easily fooled or perhaps they can\u2019t be bothered to look beyond the exterior. That\u2019s not who I am, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cA lot, actually. And I know you don\u2019t think I trust you, but I do. I can\u2019t even explain it to myself. But I feel safe with you. I tell you things I don\u2019t tell other people.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you feel safe with me, baby, because you are. Always. Absolutely. I will do anything and everything in my power to always keep you safe. Not just physically but emotionally as well. And I\u2019m humbled by the fact that you\u2019ve given me your trust. It\u2019s a gift I don\u2019t take lightly. I\u2019ll do my best to ensure you never regret giving me that very precious gift.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and leaned back, her gaze still on him. She was absorbed in him. How quickly he\u2019d become her security blanket. How easily she found herself sharing things with him she\u2019d never share with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI missed you while you were gone,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI was counting the hours and minutes until you got back. I wouldn\u2019t let myself sleep after that first night. I was too afraid because I knew I\u2019d have nightmares and you weren\u2019t there. I didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>He picked up the tray and placed it on the floor on his side of the bed. Then he turned back to her and pulled her down into his arms until she was nestled against his side, her head resting on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI should have never left you,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let you down, baby. It won\u2019t happen again because from now on you come first. And I missed you too. I wrapped up things early so I could hurry home to you. I\u2019ve never had anyone to come home to. It was a nice feeling. And then when I saw you, my heart nearly stopped. You scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know I can be difficult. I don\u2019t want to be. I want to be better, Jensen. I can be with you. I feel it. For the first time, I feel like it will be okay. That I don\u2019t have to continue living like I have for so long. It\u2019s kind of scary and yet exciting all at the same time. I don\u2019t react to change very well as you\u2019ve probably noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re two peas in a pod, you and I,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cWe\u2019re more alike than you think. I understand you better than you think and in time you\u2019ll understand me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she said honestly.</p> <p>She turned her head up so she could see him.</p><p>\u201cYou said once that you had demons too. Will you tell me about them sometime?\u201d</p><p>He picked up her hand and brought her fingertips to his lips. \u201cOne day, yes. But not right now. I don\u2019t want anything to ruin right here and right now. You in my arms. Us just being. That\u2019s a conversation for another day and time.\u201d</p><p>She let it go because if he shared then she\u2019d have to share as well and she was no more eager to ruin the moment than he was. She nestled back into his arms and let out a sleepy yawn.</p><p>He stroked a hand over her hair, further lulling her to sleep.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a lot of sleep to catch up on. I\u2019ll wake you for a late lunch and then you can stay up until bedtime tonight. We\u2019ll stay in for dinner. Watch a movie. Whatever you want. But for now rest and know you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could fall in love with you so easily, Jensen,\u201d she said in barely above a whisper. \u201cThat scares me. I\u2019ve never allowed anyone to be in a position to hurt me. I\u2019m not sure I like it at all.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what establishing trust is all about. When you learn to trust in me fully, then the idea of loving me won\u2019t scare you so badly because then you\u2019ll know that I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>KYLIE watched as Jensen dressed for work Monday morning, indecision wracking her. This was a huge step in this trust thing she was working so hard at. The rest of last week and the weekend had been . . . beautiful. The best four days of her life. And she didn\u2019t say that lightly, though God knew it wouldn\u2019t take much to top her life up until now. Not that she was taking anything away from Jensen by acknowledging that, but she had to admit, she\u2019d lived a pretty sterile existence up to now. Going through the motions but not taking risks and not really . . . living.</p><p>There had been no freak outs, no meltdowns, nothing even resembling her epic meltdown on their first date. But then Jensen hadn\u2019t pressured her. He hadn\u2019t made any kind of move on her. Their interactions had consisted of a few affectionate kisses, hardly the passionate, breath-stealing kind. Lots of snuggling and hugging.</p><p>She liked the hugs the best. It sounded silly, but her life had been devoid of true affection. Sure, her girlfriends were touchyfeely with her but that had never extended to a man. Even Tate and Dash always treated her very gingerly, never crossing the boundaries, ever mindful of her \u201cissues.\u201d</p><p>And most notably, since Jensen had brought her here, to his home, and they slept together each night, her nightmares had eased. Just peaceful, dreamless sleep, safe in his arms. That told her more than anything that she belonged with him. Maybe it made him her security blanket, and while the idea of depending on anyone else in the past may have freaked her out, she found with him it didn\u2019t bother her. She\u2019d achieved something far more precious than anything else during the last several days together. She\u2019d achieved what she\u2019d never allowed herself to hope for. Peace.</p><p>This morning she\u2019d awakened, fully prepared to accompany Jensen into work, only he\u2019d shut her down cold. And he couldn\u2019t be swayed. Dash would be back in the office today. She knew the two men had talked the previous evening and had set up a meeting to discuss several matters. One of which concerned Kylie. She knew that much.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about being shut out. Not going to work. Not being there when she was being discussed. But Jensen had asked her to trust him in this. To remain at his home and be there when he returned from work. It was important to him and after all he\u2019d put up with from her, it seemed a reasonable request.</p><p>She just wished she weren\u2019t so anxious and worried over what the two men would be discussing. But Jensen had promised to fill her in and leave nothing out when he returned from work. He wanted them to venture out tonight. Have dinner out. Go on a real date outside their homes. It was a test, she was sure, one she felt capable of passing without issue. But then who really knew what the hell her brain would do at any given time. She\u2019d learned to trust Jensen perhaps, but she didn\u2019t fully trust herself. Not yet.</p><p>Jensen finished cinching his tie and then turned to where she was still lying in bed, wearing the pajamas they\u2019d gone to her house to collect, along with her other clothing. At least two weeks\u2019 worth by her estimate. He\u2019d told her to pack enough to stay awhile. It would appear he had no intention of allowing her out of his sight anytime soon. A fact that strangely didn\u2019t fire panic on all cylinders in her. Maybe she really was getting the hang of this whole trust thing.</p><p>He came to the bed and sat down on the edge, taking her hand and pulling her into his embrace. He kissed the top of her head and then framed her face as he\u2019d done so many times before. She\u2019d come to identify this as an affectionate gesture, one he seemed to favor, especially when he was being serious or tender.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m asking a lot,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cAnd I know this requires a lot of trust on your part. But trust me to handle things with Dash today. There\u2019s a lot I have to fill him in on, and the fact is, you still need to rest. You worked yourself into the ground last week and you still have dark circles under your eyes, though you\u2019re certainly starting to look a hell of a lot better than when I found you in your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m now a step above death warmed over. I feel so much better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheeky wench,\u201d he said with no heat. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I need to catch Dash up on and I\u2019d rather to do it when we\u2019re alone. That\u2019s no reflection on you. I\u2019ve promised to protect you and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Trust me in this, baby. Okay? I\u2019ll fill you in tonight and I won\u2019t leave a word out. I promise. Today I want you to spend resting, being lazy, doing absolutely nothing. Maybe catch up with Chessy and Joss since I\u2019m sure Chessy has filled her ears full of everything that happened while she was away on her honeymoon. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll both be coming at you, so prepare yourself for that. I know I haven\u2019t known your girls for a long time, but I know they can be ferocious when it comes to you, just as you\u2019re fiercely protective of them. So I imagine while I\u2019m tied up with Dash, they\u2019re going to double-team you and interrogate you about me.\u201d</p><p>He said the last with an arrogant grin as if he had every confidence that everything she would say about him would be good. And hell, it would. He was right about that much. She just wasn\u2019t sure how much she wanted to share, even with her closest girlfriends. Some things were meant to be kept private. To savor and hold secret just for a little while.</p><p>\u201cWill it make Dash angry, the decisions you made while he was gone?\u201d she asked nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to jeopardize your business relationship with him. Especially over me.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger to her lips to shush her. Then he followed his fingers with his lips, lightly kissing her. \u201cYou let me handle Dash. He\u2019s a reasonable guy or I wouldn\u2019t be in business with him. I\u2019m going to lay it all out to him and he\u2019ll agree with my assessment of your capabilities. I have no doubt about that. You\u2019ll get that raise, baby. I can guarantee it. And a promotion will be likely as well. And it won\u2019t be because I\u2019m giving you anything. Our relationship has nothing to do with your abilities. You\u2019ve earned what you\u2019ve got coming. Never doubt that. Business is business. What\u2019s between you and me is strictly personal and doesn\u2019t interfere with work. I don\u2019t make emotional decisions when it comes to business.\u201d</p><p>Feeling oddly comforted by that statement, she nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cIf you do go out, text me and let me know, okay? This isn\u2019t me being overbearing or monitoring your comings and goings. I\u2019d just like to know if you\u2019re okay, and if you need me for anything at all, I will not be pleased if you don\u2019t call me immediately. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, absurdly pleased over his concern. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and then stood, a regretful expression on his face. \u201cI hate to leave you. The last several days have been nice. Unfortunately it\u2019s back to the real world. But I\u2019ll be home at my usual time today. If I\u2019m running late for any reason I\u2019ll call so you know when to expect me. Dress casual for dinner. We\u2019ll go someplace comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek, giving her one last caress, and then he was gone, leaving her bereft of his presence.</p><p>The house was too quiet, silent in fact. She\u2019d grown accustomed to his presence. They\u2019d spent every minute of the last four days together. They\u2019d slept together in his bed, her in her pajamas and him in boxers and a T-shirt. He\u2019d been super careful not to in any way make it seem like he was pressuring her for anything at all. It only endeared him to her all the more.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she could see herself falling in love with him, but she was afraid she was already more than halfway there. Or maybe she already was. She struggled with the idea of separating genuine love with dependence. Or perhaps one was simply a by-product of the other. Who the hell knew? She\u2019d never been in love before. Had no idea what it felt like.</p><p>But if it meant being utterly content and happy in his presence and preferring his company to anyone else\u2019s, then yeah, she was definitely in love. Her fucked-up mind was the only obstacle she still had to overcome. It was simply too used to stepping in and overriding all her decisions. It had been in self-preservation mode for so many years that it knew no other way to be.</p><p>Maybe she should reach out to Chessy and Joss and not wait until they tracked her down. It would be a positive step in the right direction. To actually share a part of herself she usually reserved, even around her best friends.</p><p>This could be part of the \u201cnew her.\u201d Being more open. Open up and share as much as Chessy and Joss had shared with her.</p><p>Liking the idea, but more than a little nervous about actually going through with it, she got out of bed and went for her phone. Maybe a text to both of them. Set up lunch? It was a sad testament to just how inexperienced she was with taking the initiative that it took her five minutes to compose the text and another five to work up the nerve to actually send it.</p><p>Not wanting to sit there glued to her phone, she opted to shower, just in case they did take her up on her offer of getting together for lunch. At least she\u2019d be ready to go. And well, if they were otherwise occupied, she\u2019d get out and maybe do some grocery shopping. She and Jensen were eating out tonight, but he\u2019d made it clear he had no intention of her going back to her house anytime soon.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t really put a timeline on her staying with him. The last four days had been too comfortable and she was reluctant to pull back and potentially destroy the progress they\u2019d made. The progress she had made.</p><p>She could cook dinner for them tomorrow night. If he didn\u2019t allow her to go into work the next day she could have it ready for him when he got home. And if she did go to work, she could always cook for him when they both got home.</p><p>How easily she\u2019d given over so much control to Jensen, she mused as she got into the shower. More surprising was the fact she wasn\u2019t freaking out or melting down. Maybe she was making progress.</p><p>Their relationship, however tenuous, had strengthened over the past days. No, they hadn\u2019t even come close to true intimacy. Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. Just because they hadn\u2019t had sex didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t decided intimacy in their relationship. Perhaps more so than if they had made love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His statement of her being in absolute control intrigued her. It wasn\u2019t something that had ever occurred to her and she was curious as to whether it would make her feel less panicky, or perhaps she could prevent the inevitable meltdown if she had complete control of the situation.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t sure of how it would work exactly, but she planned to work up the courage to broach the subject with Jensen. Soon. Because she wanted to take that next step. She wanted it badly. But she didn\u2019t want a repeat of their last experience. One humiliating meltdown was enough. Another wouldn\u2019t likely endear her to him. At some point his patience would wear thin. And the last thing she wanted was to be a tease. Get him hopeful and worked up only to yank the rug out from under him. Or herself for that matter.</p><p>Maybe Chessy and Joss could give her some advice. That would certainly be something new. Her asking them for advice when it came to men and sex. They might never get over the shock of it!</p><p>When she got out of the shower, she had responses from both women. Lux Caf\u00e9. Noon. She smiled at their willingness to drop everything for her. Not that she ever doubted such a thing, but it wasn\u2019t usually her sounding the alarm. They\u2019d likely be rabid with curiosity. She was sure Chessy had been on the phone with Joss the minute Joss was back in town.</p> <p>No better way to set the record straight than to do it herself.</p><p>After puttering around Jensen\u2019s house, exploring more, learning more about his personality, she dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and then sent Jensen a quick text, remembering his request for her to keep in touch with him about her comings and goings.</p><p>Having lunch with the girls. I\u2019ll let you know when I get back home.</p><p>She faltered a bit as she hit Send, biting her lip in consternation. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have referred to his house as \u201chome.\u201d But it was too late now.</p><p>Her phone chimed almost immediately with Jensen\u2019s reply.</p> <p>Have fun and be careful. Call me if you need me.</p><p>Her smile was a little\u2014okay, a lot\u2014ridiculous over his expression of concern. The command for her to call him if she needed him. It gave her a measure of reassurance she\u2019d never experienced, the idea that he\u2019d come the minute she needed him.</p><p>She climbed into her car, a bite of sadness hitting her, the same as it always did when she got inside the car her brother had given her for her twenty-first birthday. She missed him. He\u2019d been her rock in so many ways. Life without him had been a huge adjustment. He\u2019d always been there for her. Steady. Unwavering. He was the only other person who not only knew, but shared the horror of her childhood.</p><p>When she arrived at the Caf\u00e9, predictably Chessy was already there and Joss was late. They teased her mercilessly about always being late. But neither of her friends ever minded waiting on her.</p><p>Joss was just a ray of sunshine and she brought warmth with her everywhere she went. There was no gentler and kinder a person to be found anywhere. Dash was very lucky she had such a forgiving nature, because he\u2019d very nearly lost her over his stupidity.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Chessy asked in concern, her eyes crinkled as she studied Kylie. \u201cYou look . . . better.\u201d</p> <p>Kylie smiled. \u201cI am. Let\u2019s go sit and wait for Joss. Then I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all everything.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s brows rose in surprise. Usually they had to pry any information out of Kylie and she was usually reluctant to offer it. Not this time. Kylie was turning over a new leaf and it was starting now. Perhaps it had started the moment Jensen entered her life.</p><p>Five minutes later, Joss breathlessly hurried up to the table, sliding into the booth next to Chessy.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d Joss said. \u201cI just lost track of time. Honeymoon brain, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m too used to doing nothing at all. I\u2019ve become quite lazy over the last two weeks!\u201d</p><p>Both women smiled at their friend. She was flushed with happiness, her eyes sparkling like twin diamonds.</p><p>\u201cI guess we don\u2019t have to ask how it went,\u201d Kylie drawled.</p><p>Joss blushed to the roots of her hair and grinned mischievously. \u201cIt went . . . well.\u201d</p><p>Chessy rolled her eyes. \u201cNow why do I believe that\u2019s a huge understatement?\u201d</p> <p>Joss turned her gaze on Kylie, her eyes bright with concern. \u201cHow are you, sweetie? Chessy told me what happened. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Kylie nodded, suffering only a hint of embarrassment over the fact her friends had discussed her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get y\u2019all\u2019s . . . advice,\u201d Kylie said uncomfortably.</p><p>Joss and Chessy exchanged quick surprised looks but they were also obviously delighted with Kylie\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Jensen,\u201d she blurted before she lost her courage and clammed up.</p><p>Joss\u2019s eyebrows shot up, but she couldn\u2019t have been that surprised if Chessy had told her about Kylie\u2019s epic meltdown and the fact that Jensen called her to come over. Or perhaps Chessy had glossed over the facts, waiting for Kylie to confide in Joss in her own time. She sent her a friend a look of gratitude and Chessy smiled warmly back as if to say, \u201cHey, I got your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sort of become . . . involved,\u201d Kylie said lamely. \u201cIn a good way, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Kylie!\u201d Joss exclaimed. \u201cYou have to catch me up on all the details. Are you happy? Do you like him?\u201d</p><p>Kylie sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. Really complicated. But I figured you two were in a position to give me some guidance here considering the lifestyle you both live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know Jensen is a Dominant,\u201d Joss murmured.</p><p>Kylie nodded. \u201cBut here\u2019s where it gets complicated. He swears that for me he\u2019ll give up complete control. That he\u2019ll deny that part of himself. For me. That when and if I\u2019m ready to make love, I\u2019ll have complete control because he doesn\u2019t want me to ever be afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Chessy breathed. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty heavy. I mean wow. That\u2019s huge, Kylie. Huge!\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded her fervent agreement. \u201cYou have to understand just how big that is, Kylie. Men like him don\u2019t just give up control. To anyone. I\u2019d say that speaks volumes about the way he feels about you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie was delighted to hear it. To have it confirmed. She\u2019d suspected, yes, but she didn\u2019t truly understand the enormity of his vow. These two women would. They were both committed to dominant men. Men they were submissive to.</p><p>\u201cI freaked out pretty bad on our first official date,\u201d Kylie said, though this was not news to Chessy. \u201cAll we were doing was kissing on the couch, but I just kind of shut down and then freaked completely out. Jensen was worried. I wanted him to leave and he finally did only because he worried he would do more damage by staying. But he called Chessy to come over because he refused to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like the real deal,\u201d Joss said softly. \u201cHe sounds like he cares a lot about you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Kylie murmured. \u201cI care about him. I may even love him. I\u2019m not sure yet. It\u2019s all very confusing. He had to leave on a business trip right after our date and I didn\u2019t sleep at all while he was gone. I don\u2019t feel safe when he\u2019s not there. And I hate that dependency. He came back a day early and I collapsed in the office. He brought me back to his house and has insisted on me staying ever since. I haven\u2019t been to work since last Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it looks like he\u2019s only willing to suppress his alpha tendencies in a few areas,\u201d Chessy observed, her eyes gleaming in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear myself say this, but I kind of like them. He\u2019s arrogant and bossy but he\u2019s so gentle with me. He makes me ache. He makes me want things I\u2019ve never wanted before,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>Joss reached for her hand and squeezed. \u201cThen go for it. Give him a chance. And if what he said is true and he\u2019s willing to give up control, then, honey, that is huge. It\u2019s not something a man like him would ever do lightly and I highly doubt he\u2019s ever made that offer to a woman before. Which makes you very special to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that,\u201d Kylie said ruefully. \u201cI have zero experience with the whole dominant/submissive thing. And he\u2019s admittedly a Dominant. All his relationships have been with submissive women. But he told me he doesn\u2019t want my physical surrender, that he\u2019d never bring the physical components of dominance and submission into our relationship. He wants my emotional surrender, and that I think is perhaps even scarier than the physical aspects of that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can certainly make you more vulnerable,\u201d Chessy agreed. \u201cBut you have to look at the payoff and decide if it\u2019s worth it. If he\u2019s worth it. Because evidently he\u2019s already considered his options and has decided that you\u2019re worth the sacrifice he\u2019ll make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Jensen\u2019s sacrifice more than most,\u201d Joss said quietly. \u201cI denied that part of myself for Carson because I knew he could never give me dominance. I loved him and I have no regrets, but there was always a part of me that was unfulfilled because submission was something I needed\u2014craved.\u201d</p><p>Kylie fell silent, pondering her friends\u2019 words and reactions. If they were to be believed, what he\u2019d offered her was huge. And maybe she\u2019d already recognized the magnitude of what he was offering her, but she\u2019d needed validation from two women who\u2019d know.</p><p>\u201cI want to try,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cFor the first time, I really want to try. I want what other women have. A normal life. Someone who loves and cares for me. Someone who won\u2019t run from my past like I have and someone who will protect me. And he fits the bill on all counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d Chessy said challengingly. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not saying you should rush into a physical relationship with him. But it sounds like the two of you are well on your way to something solid. I\u2019m happy for you, Kylie. I like Jensen a lot. Yes, he\u2019s alpha, but it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s very caring and sensitive to your needs. You can\u2019t ask for more than that.\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d Kylie admitted. \u201cMore scared than I\u2019ve ever been. But it\u2019s a different kind of fear. It\u2019s not him I\u2019m afraid of. Or having an actual relationship. I\u2019m afraid of screwing this up. Just like I\u2019ve screwed up everything else in my life.\u201d</p><p>Both Joss and Chessy frowned fiercely at her. \u201cYou are not a screwup,\u201d Joss chastised her. \u201cHoney, you have legitimate reasons to fear intimacy. And Jensen knows that. Give him a chance, but more importantly, give yourself a chance. Trust yourself and your instincts. You\u2019ll never know unless you give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>Kylie nodded slowly. \u201cI knew all this. I suppose I just needed to hear it from y\u2019all. Thanks. I really needed y\u2019all today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you haven\u2019t been there for us,\u201d Chessy snorted. \u201cBetween the three of us, we\u2019ve managed more emotional crises than a psych ward.\u201d</p><p>Joss and Kylie laughed, the mood relaxing as the three enjoyed their lunch. Kylie sat back, luxuriating in the feel of something new and delicious. The hope of something permanent and real.</p><p>All she had to do was reach out and take it. Jensen had put her solidly in the driver\u2019s seat. It was up to her to make the next move.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>JENSEN strode into Dash\u2019s office with a sense of purpose. Though the two men had conversed the evening before, Jensen hadn\u2019t shown his hand. Not yet. He\u2019d only said he needed to discuss important business matters with his partner the following morning.</p><p>This would perhaps be the first real test of their partnership. Jensen was prepared to dig in his heels solidly when it came to Kylie and it had nothing to do with his personal feelings for her. He\u2019d told her it was business and he hadn\u2019t lied. Kylie was smart, a go-getter, and she deserved to be a major component of the consulting business. Her talents were wasted in the capacity of an office manager only. Not that she didn\u2019t do a damn fine job, but she was destined for bigger and better things. If they didn\u2019t act to secure her, someone else eventually would. One day Kylie would reach the same conclusion that Jensen already had. That she was worth far more than an office manager. And in no way did he plan to lose Kylie. Professionally or personally.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Dash greeted when Jensen came through his door.</p><p>\u201cHow was the honeymoon?\u201d Jensen asked, obligated to inquire about the obvious before they moved on to business.</p><p>\u201cIt was great. Wish we were still there,\u201d Dash said wistfully. \u201cHow were things here? Any problems?\u201d</p><p>Jensen shook his head. \u201cNone at all. We secured the S&amp;G contract. Thanks in large part to Kylie.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s eyebrows rose as Jensen took a seat in front of Dash\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d Jensen said bluntly. \u201cI gave her the lead on this project. Gave her all the info I had and told her to come up with a plan. We met the night before to discuss and I agreed with every single one of her recommendations.\u201d</p><p>Dash sat in silence, absorbing his partner\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cIs there something I\u2019m missing here?\u201d Dash asked. \u201cBecause I feel like I\u2019m missing a huge piece of a puzzle. When I left, Kylie could hardly stand to be in the same room as you. And while I\u2019m gone you two partner and she takes the lead on a very important contract to this firm? And you let her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKylie is mine,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who knows it. But our relationship has nothing to do with her career prospects. I\u2019m perfectly capable of separating business and pleasure, and Kylie has a bright mind. She rose to the challenge beautifully and I intend to see that rewarded. I think we should consider giving her more responsibility and hiring a different office manager to take over Kylie\u2019s duties. Eventually she could make a partner. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dash shot him an inscrutable look. He made a V with his fingertips and rested his chin against them in a thoughtful manner.</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Kylie think about all of this? You?\u201d Dash amended.</p><p>\u201cAre we talking personally or professionally here?\u201d Jensen asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cPersonally. We\u2019re all very protective of Kylie. I don\u2019t want to see her get hurt. You are precisely the kind of man she doesn\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. She\u2019s mine,\u201d Jensen repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know. She\u2019s currently staying with me after working herself into the ground last week while I was gone. She collapsed in the office and I took her home so I could take care of her. God knows someone needed to. But if you think I in any way forced her, you\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s there willingly. I have every intention of keeping her out of work the remainder of this week as well. She\u2019s exhausted and she needs the break. And when she comes back, I want it to be in the capacity of more than our office manager. So that gives you a week to be looking for a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a demanding bastard,\u201d Dash mused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right decision for our company,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cShe landed us the S&amp;G contract. I have no doubt she\u2019ll be an asset if we turn her loose. I have every confidence in her abilities. She just has to find the same confidence in herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go along with you on this,\u201d Dash conceded. \u201cIf Kylie proves her mettle then we can certainly make her a partner. But you need to figure out if you can handle that if things don\u2019t work out for you . . . personally.\u201d</p><p>Jensen returned Dash\u2019s look unblinkingly. \u201cThey will work out. However, I\u2019d leave before ever making Kylie feel uncomfortable in her work environment. I will never do anything that hurts her. Period.\u201d</p><p>Dash let out a long breath. \u201cI hope to hell you know what you\u2019re getting into, man. Kylie . . . she\u2019s going to be a tough nut to crack. With reason. And she\u2019s not going to react well to your . . . dominance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her I\u2019m willing to make special concessions,\u201d Jensen said.</p><p>It was all he would say on the matter. He owed Dash at least some reassurance because Kylie was important to him and Joss. But this was all he\u2019d give him. What was between him and Kylie was private. Not to be shared. He was as possessive of their relationship as he was of her.</p><p>\u201cThen I wish you the best,\u201d Dash said sincerely. \u201cKylie deserves to be happy. I never thought I\u2019d say this but she may well have met her match in you. She needs someone as stubborn as she is. Someone who won\u2019t buckle or run at the first sign of adversity. She deserves someone who will stick it out and see her for the treasure she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that we agree,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cNow, what about a new office manager? I vote we start taking applications immediately.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>KYLIE was waiting anxiously when Jensen pulled into the drive. She\u2019d been anticipating his homecoming ever since she\u2019d returned from her lunch with the girls. She\u2019d been delighted when he\u2019d called and said he\u2019d be home earlier than usual.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing or if it was in any way indicative of how his talk with Dash had gone.</p><p>She met him at the door and all but threw herself into his arms. He seemed delighted by her spontaneous show of affection and caught her up against him. She took the initiative and kissed him. And not one of those gentle pecks he\u2019d been giving her. She devoured his mouth hungrily, licking over his lips and then delving inside when they parted.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said breathlessly when she finally pulled away. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a welcome home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she said without any discomfort. She could admit things to him that she\u2019d never admit to anyone else. She didn\u2019t feel as vulnerable and as bare with him.</p><p>She felt . . . safe.</p><p>It was a statement she\u2019d made to herself and to him over and over but it bore repeating because it was such a mind-boggling thing. She, who never felt safe with anyone, felt absolutely secure with Jensen.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her this time, long and leisurely. It sent warm shivers cascading over her body. Now that she\u2019d decided that she wanted to try to have a physical relationship with him, it was all that occupied her mind. She was bursting with hope and anticipation because this would be huge for her. Just as huge as it evidently was that he was offering to relinquish absolute control to her.</p><p>\u201cI got used to having you around the last four days,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He let out a groan. \u201cGod, baby, if you have any intention of us going out, you have to stop now because I\u2019m one second away from hauling you into the bedroom and tying my own self to the bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound joyous and free. How far had she come that they could actually joke about her hang-ups and she could laugh at herself? If she had any uncertainty about whether she loved this man, it was gone in an instant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go if you are,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cYou said casual, but I didn\u2019t want to go too casual.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her away as if noticing for the first time what she had on. She loved that he hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the outer trappings. He\u2019d only been focused on her. The woman. What was on the inside, no matter how twisted up she was there.</p><p>\u201cIf this is your definition of casual then I\u2019m dying to know what you consider not casual,\u201d he said, male appreciation evident in his tone.</p><p>She\u2019d donned a short cocktail dress, one that clipped just above her knees and bared the expanse of her legs. It was simple and could certainly qualify as casual. It was black and sleeveless with a modest neckline that only hinted at the curves of her breasts.</p><p>The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, were the heels. She was normally a flip-flop kind of girl and wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a pair of heels. But she was feeling brave and a little sassy and so, on her way home from lunch, she\u2019d stopped and bought a pair of spiked, blingy heels that she had to admit looked damn good on her. She just hoped like hell she didn\u2019t make an ass of herself by face-planting when she tried to walk in them.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to look good for you,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>He gathered her close again, careful to keep her from teetering on her heels. \u201cBaby, you look good to me no matter what you\u2019re wearing, but let me assure you. You look gorgeous. I\u2019m a lucky bastard to be seen with you. Let me change into something besides my work clothes and then I\u2019ll take you out. Think you can slow dance with those killer shoes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, taking in his appreciative stare, it stroking her feminine ego. She hadn\u2019t ever considered she had one until now.</p><p>\u201cIf you hold me close enough I won\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close, his breath whispering over her face. \u201cI\u2019ll never let you fall, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her heart clutched at the quiet vow and she knew he wouldn\u2019t break it. Literally and figuratively speaking, he\u2019d never let her fall. Not when he was around. She was stronger with him, because of him. She felt ready to take on the world because of this man\u2019s confidence in her.</p><p>She ached to tell him everything that was in her heart, but she knew they still had a long way to go. And it wouldn\u2019t be easy. They still had many obstacles to overcome, but for the first time she was optimistic about her chances of regaining control over her life. And she owed it partly to him. Hell, she owed it all to him.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t pushed her, if he hadn\u2019t been so determined, she\u2019d still be existing day to day, hiding from the world with her head in the sand.</p><p>Now she was going on a date. Another date, only this time she hoped for a better result. She wasn\u2019t foolish enough to think she\u2019d get there tonight. But she wanted to try. That was something, wasn\u2019t it? She wasn\u2019t afraid to try. Her only fear was failure. But she wasn\u2019t going to use that fear as an excuse not to go through with it. She\u2019d face her fears head-on and not allow them to rule her life any longer.</p><p>It took Jensen only a few minutes to change. He chose jeans and a simple polo that fit snugly over his strong shoulders and broad chest. It hugged him in all the right places, accentuating his lean, muscled physique.</p><p>And his smell. She wasn\u2019t even sure if he used cologne or perhaps aftershave. It wasn\u2019t overpowering but wholeheartedly masculine and rugged. She loved his scent.</p><p>They drove to a small jazz bar in the downtown area. A band played nightly and the lighting was low and romantic, only the mellow sounds of the music mixed with hushed tones of the patrons evident.</p><p>It screamed intimate and quiet. Cozy and perfect. An ideal prelude to what she hoped would be more. She was nervous and yet edgy with impatience and anticipation to see where the evening would take them. She planned to talk with Jensen, to query him further on the control issue and whether he was truly willing to go through with it. It was a testament to her will that she didn\u2019t question whether she was willing to go through with it.</p><p>Her heart wanted it. Her body wanted it. She just had to pray that her mind went along for the ride.</p><p>They ordered drinks and shared lingering glances over the rims of their glasses. After they placed their food order, Jensen rose and extended his hand down to Kylie.</p><p>\u201cTime to see how well you dance in those heels and how well I\u2019m able to hold you up,\u201d he said teasingly.</p><p>She went readily into his arms, absorbing the intense masculine warmth and strength his body offered. He wrapped himself around her so that she barely had room to move. Not that she minded a bit.</p><p>They stood, swaying slightly in rhythm to the music, her head tucked securely underneath Jensen\u2019s chin. She closed her eyes and leaned further into him, allowing him to hold her.</p><p>Her breath caught when she felt the firm imprint of his erection against her belly. Even underneath the denim of his jeans, his c**k was rigid and straining outward, bulging and pulsing strongly.</p><p>He let his hand drift up and down her back, stroking, caressing, his fingers whispering over her skin like a dream. She made a low contented sound in the back of her throat, a hum of pleasure that vibrated against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, baby.\u201d</p><p>The whispered words just against her ear sent shivers of need through her body.</p><p>She lifted her head and leaned up so she could return his whisper. He bent his head lower to dip his ear to her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me too.\u201d</p><p>His smile was instantaneous. Predatory. It should have scared the bejebus out of her, but it didn\u2019t. It was a smile that told her she was in trouble. The good kind.</p><p>He palmed her nape, his fingers curling around the slender column. Every feminine instinct was on high alert. Her body was taut with desire, her br**sts heavy and aching.</p><p>Then, holding her in place, he leaned down and pressed his lips to hers. He was infinitely tender, so exquisitely gentle that tears burned her eyelids. Nothing was more perfect than right here, right now. In his arms, the soft strains of jazz surrounding them.</p><p>Intimacy was a heavy cloak over them, enveloping them in its lulling embrace. She swayed in his arms, completely caught up in the moment. She wanted time to stand still. For the mood to never be broken.</p><p>He seemed as reluctant as she when he pulled away and glanced toward their table with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cDinner is here, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dinner?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>He smiled and kissed the corner of her mouth. \u201cCome. Let me feed my baby.\u201d</p><p>She was gripped by a ridiculous, giddy thrill over the endearment. His baby. As if she belonged to him and she was his to take care of.</p><p>She was acting like a stupid teenager barely in control of her hormones.</p><p>He led her back to the table where their entr\u00e9es awaited them. But Jensen slid her plate toward him while he edged his chair closer to hers. He cut into her steak before forking a bite to her lips.</p><p>At first she was embarrassed by the fact that she was a grown woman being fed by a man. She glanced hastily around, but no one was paying them the slightest attention. They were too wrapped up in their own environments and conversations.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Kylie. Let me feed you. I enjoy it very much.\u201d</p><p>Put that way, she felt shrewish to allow her brief discomfort to interfere in their ever-growing intimacy.</p><p>She forced herself to heed his dictate and relax, allowing him to continue the intimate act of feeding her each bite.</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he coaxed, his tone raspy.</p><p>She shook her head and then glanced down at his own untouched food. \u201cDo I get to feed you?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He looked startled and then pleased. \u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>She scooted forward and picked up the fork and knife to cut into his steak. Then she began feeding him bites, his gaze stroking her face the entire time.</p><p>What was at first an awkward experience for her was transformed into something decidedly intimate. The sensual haze between them was thick, tangible. Building like a thunderstorm, waiting only to be unleashed.</p><p>She wanted it. She wanted him. It was new for her, this desperate need for a man. She\u2019d never wanted to overcome her past as badly as she wanted to now. She\u2019d used it as a protective barrier, not wanting those barriers to ever be breached. But now she wanted to break them down herself. She didn\u2019t want him to do it for her. She wanted to own it. Wanted them to come down at her instigation.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go home?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She realized it could be unclear whose home she meant. But she\u2019d been staying with Jensen and she realized she had no desire to go back to her own house. It was where she\u2019d freaked out before. Maybe in Jensen\u2019s home, a place she already felt safe and secure, she would finally be able to overcome her demons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He pulled out several bills from his wallet and tossed them on the table next to their plates. Then he rose, holding out his hand to her. She took it, allowing him to pull her up next to him, and the two hurried out to his car.</p><p>The ride home was silent, but she found comfort in the thick tension between them. Their need was evident. Neither of them tried to hide it or make it something it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>When they pulled into his drive, she felt a moment\u2019s uncertainty, but quickly tamped it down. She was going ahead with this. She had questions. She wanted a much clearer picture of what he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>As soon as they entered the house, Kylie started toward the living room, leaving him to follow her lead. She reclined on the couch and then patted the spot beside her in silent invitation.</p><p>When he settled beside her, she turned, swallowing back her fears. With this man she could be herself. And with this man, maybe she could finally be whole again. Not again. For the first time in her life.</p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2014needed\u2014to ask you some things,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>His hand immediately went to her cheek, soft and reassuring, his touch like fire against her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything, darling. There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t talk about together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, encouraged by his sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI want . . .\u201d She sucked in a deep breath and plunged ahead. \u201cI want to try again. I mean with you. But I wanted to know exactly what you meant by giving me control.\u201d</p><p>Fire blazed in his eyes, heat that she could feel. Desire. Satisfaction. Relief.</p><p>\u201cI meant just that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want this\u2014me\u2014then what happens is you tie me to the bed, both hands above me, and I\u2019ll be yours to do with as you please. And by that, I mean as much or as little as you want. We take it slow. You see what you can handle. And we go from there. But baby, don\u2019t put pressure on yourself and don\u2019t get upset if you can\u2019t handle a lot right away. I\u2019m in no hurry. We have all the time in the world so I want you to take it slow and only do what you\u2019re comfortable doing.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged with relief. He sounded utterly sincere.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to try. I don\u2019t want to make you promises I can\u2019t keep, so for now let\u2019s just see what happens.\u201d</p><p>His smile was achingly gentle and understanding. \u201cI\u2019m yours to command, Kylie. And I don\u2019t make that offer lightly. Only for you. Always for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do I do next then?\u201d</p><p>He rose, extending his hand to hers, a gesture of support and solidarity.</p><p>\u201cWhat we do is take this to the bedroom and I\u2019ll get the necessary rope for you to tie me to the bed. The rest is entirely up to you, baby.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>KYLIE watched in abject fascination as Jensen calmly stripped himself of his clothing and then reached into one of his drawers for a length of rope.</p><p>He was beautiful. Raw masculinity emanated from him in waves. He was utterly perfect and he didn\u2019t seem at all abashed by his nudity. Or his huge erection straining upward to his abdomen.</p><p>No matter how hard she tried to look somewhere\u2014anywhere\u2014else, she couldn\u2019t force her gaze away from his jutting erection. And oddly it didn\u2019t terrify her. She was fascinated by it. It\u2014he\u2014was a thing of beauty.</p> <p>She blushed over the idiocy of considering a penis beautiful, but it belonged to a beautiful man so how could it be anything else? This man was without fault. He was physical perfection.</p><p>He turned to her, extending the rope. She took it nervously, unsure of what the hell she was supposed to do with it. But he took the lead, thank God. She may have supposed she was in control, but she was anything but. She was following his lead gratefully.</p><p>He crawled onto the bed and turned on his back, stretching as gracefully as a cat, his entire length exposed and vulnerable. Then he brought his arms over his head, placing his hands close to the spindles of his headboard.</p><p>\u201cTie me, baby,\u201d he said in a husky voice that sent shivers dancing down her spine. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m yours to do with as you wish.\u201d</p><p>Oh my. This delicious alpha male was hers for the taking. To do with whatever she wanted, and God did she want. She wanted so badly that it was a physical ache.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed and began coiling the rope around one wrist. Then she pulled it toward his other hand and secured that one as well. She tested the tautness of the rope even though she had no fears of him hurting her. But her mind needed reassurance. Her brain needed to know she was safe.</p><p>When she was finished, she sat back and let her gaze wander hungrily down his body. There was so much to look at. To touch. And taste. And suddenly she wanted it all. At the same time. He was a veritable feast laid out in front of a starving woman.</p><p>She touched his chest first. It seemed the safest place to start, and she let her hands roam over the wall of muscle, exploring the hair-roughened hollow and his taut abdomen.</p><p>His breath hissed out in a long exhalation the moment she touched him. He jerked and she yanked her hands away, worried she\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, baby. God, you feel so damn good. If you only knew how long I\u2019ve waited for you to touch me like this. Don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m yours to touch and explore however you want. It\u2019s all in your hands. I can guarantee there isn\u2019t a thing I won\u2019t love.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged by the raw intensity\u2014and honesty\u2014in his voice, she returned to his body, this time roaming over his shoulders and then back down his sides, growing closer to the place she most wanted to touch.</p><p>His erection was straining upward, resting against his belly. All she had to do was slide her fingers an inch closer and she\u2019d be touching him.</p><p>She shifted her weight so she could face him, wanting to see his reaction when she finally circled his huge c**k with her hands.</p><p>She trailed one finger up the underside where the plump vein was distended. He let out a moan and arched his h*ps upward to meet her caress. Growing bolder, she wrapped one hand around the base and gently tugged upward. When she got to the head, moisture beaded and slipped from the tip, coating her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you touching me,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful touching me. I keep wondering what the hell I did to deserve this. A goddess pleasuring me when I should be pleasuring you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there. I hope.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was serious. \u201cWe will, baby. We will. There\u2019s no hurry and I don\u2019t want you to ever feel pressured to give me something you can\u2019t. I\u2019ll wait because the end result is worth it. You\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>Her chest swelled, knotting with emotion. He made it sound so easy, and she supposed it was. Time. They had all they needed. He\u2019d been very clear about wanting her and waiting for as long as it took. Did he realize the enormity of such a gift?</p><p>She leaned down and pressed her lips to his belly, just an inch above where his c**k rested. He flinched and let out a gasp, giving her courage to touch him intimately with her mouth.</p><p>Carefully, she kissed the tip, just as she had his belly, but then grew bolder, flicking out her tongue to lick the head.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he choked out. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Feeling powerful, she took more control, sucking the tip into her mouth, holding him there for a long moment while she lapped at the p**cum seeping from the slit. Then she sucked him deep, enjoying his instant reaction.</p><p>She had no experience whatsoever, but her instincts took over and she let her hands roam as she continued her sensual assault with her mouth and tongue.</p><p>His chest heaved, his h*ps arching upward again, guiding his c**k deeper into her mouth. His arms strained against the ropes securing his wrists and his face was twisted in beautiful agony.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands around me, baby. I\u2019m about to come,\u201d he said raggedly.</p><p>She wrapped both hands around him, feeling the thick, rigid strength of his cock. Velvet over steel. She stroked up and down, tightening her grip. Then she leaned down to lap at his balls, liking the rugged feel of his sac on her tongue.</p><p>His cry split the silence. He erupted, his release spurting onto his belly, marking the tan skin with creamy ropes of liquid. She watched in fascination as the jets of s**en spilled onto his flesh and she gently continued stroking him until at last he began to soften in her grasp.</p><p>Watching him come had been heady, unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced before. It left her restless, edgy and unfulfilled. She ached. Her br**sts tingled and her cl*tpulsed between her thighs. But she had no idea how to gain her own release. Now that she\u2019d taken the leap, she was uncertain of what to do next. Or if she should do anything at all to assuage the edge of unfulfillment.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes, baby.\u201d</p><p>She yanked up her gaze in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in control,\u201d he reassured gently. \u201cBut you need relief. And I want to see your beautiful body. Remember, I\u2019m still tied. Now take off your clothes and get back on the bed with me. I want to see you come.\u201d</p><p>Shakily she got off the bed and did as he directed. Keeping her gaze averted, she slowly slipped out of her clothing, hesitating when she got to her bra and panties. It was almost as if she thought the bruises from decades ago would still show on her skin. She felt intensely vulnerable, but at the same time she was driven to follow his dictate.</p><p>She snuck a peek in Jensen\u2019s direction only to find warm understanding burning in his dark eyes. If he\u2019d looked at her any other way she likely would have chickened out. But it was that understanding that enabled her to go the rest of the way.</p><p>He saw to the heart of her. Knew how hard it was for her to bare herself in front of him. It made her all the more determined not to let her fears win.</p><p>Before she could back down, she yanked off her bra and pulled off her panties. Then she crawled back on the bed, kneeling beside him before finally meeting his gaze again.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPleasure yourself. Let me watch you make yourself come.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. For a moment she was at a complete loss.</p><p>\u201cCup your breasts. Hold them up for me and then touch your nipples. Figure out what feels good to you and then do more of that,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>Seduced by his husky tone and his eagerness for her to be pleased, she slowly slid her hands up her belly to cup her breasts, plumping them outward. She brushed her thumbs across the sensitive peaks, gasping at the electrical shock that seemed to jolt through her body.</p><p>\u201cNow imagine me sucking them,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cMy mouth around them, my tongue licking them.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and moaned, getting into the spirit of his seduction.</p><p>\u201cNow put your hand between your legs,\u201d he directed. \u201cSpread your folds, show me that pretty pussy. But keep your other hand on your breast and play with your nipple.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her eyes closed, not wanting to break the spell, she slipped one hand down her belly and in between her thighs. She shivered as her fingers slipped over her clit, and then, as he\u2019d directed, she spread herself, pulling upward so he could see.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTouch yourself, baby. Make yourself come. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>She let out a soft moan as she began to touch herself, finding the perfect rhythm. She arched upward, unable to sit still. She undulated her h*ps as she continued to exert pressure on her clit, rolling it beneath her middle finger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he encouraged. \u201cMake yourself feel good, Kylie. God, you\u2019re beautiful. So beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His voice was smooth and sensual, heightening her pleasure, taking her higher and higher, closer to the edge of bliss.</p><p>She could feel the stirrings of something truly wonderful. Her body tightened. Her br**sts grew even more sensitive. Every touch. Every breath. Her womb clenched, her pu**y clenched. And still she climbed even higher, getting closer and closer with every touch, with every word that came out of Jensen\u2019s mouth.</p><p>She threw back her head with abandon, feeling wild and exotic. This wasn\u2019t her. She\u2019d become someone else entirely. Someone sexy, a seductress. Someone in control of her sexuality.</p><p>Never had she felt so . . . free. Unburdened. Here, nothing could touch her. Nothing could hurt or frighten her. There was only her and Jensen. And her deepest, most intoxicating fantasies.</p><p>\u201cSo f**king beautiful,\u201d Jensen murmured.</p><p>She opened her eyes and locked gazes with him, suddenly unafraid and uninhibited. She wanted to share this with him.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby. Show me your pleasure. Let me taste it.\u201d</p><p>She slid her fingers inside her, capturing some of her moisture, and then she held out her fingers to his mouth. He sucked her finger inside, tugging at it with the suction. He licked her finger clean and let out a growl of satisfaction.</p><p>She quickly returned her fingers to her cl*tbecause she was close. So very close. And she didn\u2019t want to lose the edge.</p><p>Faster, harder. She exerted firmer pressure and then threw back her head again, finally reaching for it. Embracing it. Letting go.</p><p>She cried out, shivering violently as her orgasm rose and broke like a huge wave. She fell forward, panting, her palms bracing her on the bed.</p><p>And suddenly she wanted Jensen\u2019s arms around her. Wanted him touching her. Wanted his strength. Wanted to feel safe.</p><p>She tugged at his bonds, nearly too weak to untie the knots. As soon as one hand was free, he turned and worked the other hand loose, seemingly as desperate as she was to get his arms around her.</p><p>She dove into his embrace, uncaring that they were both na**d. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He\u2019d made the ultimate sacrifice. For her. He\u2019d never hurt her. She knew that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust hold me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you go,\u201d he vowed. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you as long as you want, Kylie. As long as you need. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>JENSEN lay awake, Kylie snuggled tightly against his body, content and as relaxed as he\u2019d ever been. He knew the enormity of what had happened tonight and he couldn\u2019t contain the thrill coursing through his veins. Kylie was his. He didn\u2019t fool himself into thinking this was a cure-all and that they didn\u2019t have plenty of obstacles still to overcome. But for the first time, he was at peace, and hope was alive in his heart and mind.</p> <p>He stroked a hand down the length of Kylie\u2019s body, simply enjoying the feel of her in his arms. Naked, beautiful, warm and sated.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor what you gave me tonight. I know it couldn\u2019t have been easy for you, for a man like you, I mean. But I\u2019ll never forget this, Jensen. I can\u2019t even put into words what this meant to me.\u201d</p><p>His chest tightened and he struggled to find the words around the knot in his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt was the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he said. And it was the absolute truth. Giving up control to this woman had been a no-brainer. She was worth every sacrifice. \u201cGiving control to you was worth every bit, Kylie. I don\u2019t want you to ever worry that I\u2019ll regret it or grow to resent you for it. I\u2019m willing to give you control for as long as you need. Forever, if that\u2019s what it takes for us to be together. If the end result is having you in my arms just like now, then I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to achieve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, shocking him to the core with her declaration. \u201cI know it\u2019s too soon. I\u2019ve battled with myself over whether what I was feeling was love. I\u2019ve made myself crazy worrying, but I don\u2019t want to worry anymore. I just want to feel, and my life has been a study in not feeling anything at all. Not risking being hurt by allowing myself to feel. But what I feel when I\u2019m with you is love. I\u2019m certain of it. It can\u2019t be anything else. Nothing else could feel this wonderful. I\u2019ve never loved anyone else. Not like this, I mean. Just Carson and Chessy and Joss, of course, but what I feel for you in no way compares to how I feel about them. It scares me but at the same time it just feels . . . right.\u201d</p> <p>He gathered her more tightly in his arms, closing his eyes at the sudden swell of emotion that punched a hole in his chest. The courage it must have taken for her to say those words, especially after taking such a huge leap by trusting him to be intimate with her, was mind-boggling.</p><p>He was awed by the precious gift lying in his arms. Overcome by the fact that this brave, courageous woman loved him. He didn\u2019t feel worthy of her love or her trust, but God, he wanted both. He wanted her with every breath in his body. He needed her like he needed air to breathe. She was the air he breathed. She\u2019d so quickly become his reason to be. And he knew he\u2019d never feel complete again without her. That he loved her unreservedly. That what he felt for her in no way came close to what he\u2019d felt for anyone else in his life.</p><p>He stroked her hair, trying to compose himself. He didn\u2019t want to mess this up. It was too important. She\u2019d placed her trust, her faith and her well-being solidly in his hands and he wouldn\u2019t fail her.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby. So much. If you believe nothing else, believe that. I think I\u2019ve loved you from the very first moment I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face up from where it was buried in his chest and met his gaze, tears shimmering in those beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Jensen? I know tonight was a huge step, but I know we have so many other issues to face. I don\u2019t want to ever cause problems between us. I want your love. I need it. I never thought I\u2019d want or need this connection to a man and it caught me by surprise. I was blindsided by you. You snuck up on me when I wasn\u2019t looking and suddenly you were there\u2014here,\u201d she amended, placing her hand over her heart. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess this up.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her furrowed brow, trying to ease the strain that was so evident. Her words and expression were so earnest. So heartbreakingly vulnerable. He never wanted her to feel fear when she was with him, but some things were out of his control. He, who was used to absolute control in all aspects of his life, had to accept that when it came to this woman he was in no way in control of anything at all.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said truthfully. \u201cBut nothing good or worthwhile is ever easy. We\u2019ll work at it together. United, we can conquer anything. I want you to have faith in that. And the other thing you need to know is that I\u2019m not going anywhere. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how difficult things may be, I\u2019m here to stay and I\u2019m never giving up on you or us.\u201d</p><p>Tears glittered more brightly, clinging to her eyelashes, and finally slid soundlessly down her cheeks. He thumbed one away with a gentle touch, his heart aching at the fear and uncertainty in both her eyes and words.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up either,\u201d she quietly vowed. \u201cDon\u2019t let me run, Jensen. Don\u2019t let me hide from you\u2014us. It\u2019s what I do best. When things get sticky, I retreat, I run, and I stick my head in the sand where I know it\u2019s safe. Don\u2019t give up on me. I\u2019ll try never to hurt you. I need you to believe that I want this. I want you and I want there to be an us.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, contentment ever growing in his soul. \u201cIf you run, I\u2019ll just come after you and drag you back to me. I won\u2019t let you get away, baby. Not unless that\u2019s truly what you want. I want you to be mine, but more than that, I want you to be happy and for you to feel safe. Always.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, visibly collecting herself, and when she reopened them they burned with earnestness. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The simple statement with such a wealth of emotion behind it was staggering. He felt humbled by the love and trust burning in her eyes. Never had he felt more unworthy than right here and now but he wasn\u2019t going to turn down such a precious gift. Ever.</p><p>He squeezed her tight, savoring her softness against his much harder body. \u201cI love you too, Kylie. We\u2019ll make it, okay? We\u2019ll get there. Just give us time.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze lowered but not before he saw the flicker of pain in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI feel like such a failure,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI know I can trust you and yet I couldn\u2019t even be intimate with you without tying you up. It sounds so ridiculous. Here I\u2019m saying I love you and I trust you and we didn\u2019t even achieve penetration. How does that not make me a huge hypocrite to say one thing and do something altogether different?\u201d</p><p>His heart turned over at the consternation in her voice. He nudged her chin up with his fingers, forcing her to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBaby, this is a huge leap forward for us\u2014you. There is no hurry and I don\u2019t want you beating yourself up over this. I\u2019m happy and you\u2019re happy. Nothing else matters. In time you\u2019ll trust me enough to let me make love to you. You\u2019ll trust yourself. Until then, you\u2019ll tie me to the bed each time until you feel confident enough to take the ultimate plunge.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down into a grimace. \u201cI wish I were as confident as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have enough confidence for both of us,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe will get there, Kylie. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. This will and should take time. It\u2019s not something we can take too lightly. You have to absolutely feel safe with me, because if we jump the gun, we can do far more damage by trying to rush things. I\u2019m perfectly content to leave things as they are until you\u2019re ready to take that final step. You don\u2019t have to apologize nor do you have to justify your fears. Not to me. Never to me. I love you and love is about doing whatever it takes to safeguard the one you love.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up, pressing her soft mouth to his. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you or your patience but I thank God for both. I never imagined feeling this way about anyone. It\u2019s scary and beautiful all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her back, slow and sweet, his tongue tasting her, lapping tenderly at her lips and tongue. Then he leaned back, simply savoring the connection between them. This moment when they both laid themselves bare. He didn\u2019t want this moment to end. Didn\u2019t want the outside world intruding on something so new and beautiful. Fragile and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cNot to change the subject but we didn\u2019t talk about my conversation with Dash and I promised you full disclosure. And I can\u2019t think of a better time to talk to you than when you\u2019re in my arms all soft and sweet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat does it say about me that Dash and my job were the absolute furthest things from my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think what it says about you is that you were too focused on me and, while that may make me an egotistical bastard, I like that you aren\u2019t thinking of anything else when you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again before settling back so she could see him. Her hair spilled over the pillow like satin. She was nestled on her side, her legs entwined with his. He was already sporting another hard-on, but he didn\u2019t try to hide it. He wanted her to know how much he wanted and desired her. How beautiful he found her.</p><p>\u201cSo what did Dash have to say? And what exactly did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand down her body, unable to keep from touching her as they conversed. There was something decidedly intimate about talking about even mundane topics in bed, wrapped around one another, a barrier to the outside world.</p><p>\u201cI told him to start looking for another office manager because your talents were wasted in that area. I told him I wanted you to have the rest of the week off. You need rest, but admittedly that\u2019s me being selfish because I like having you all to myself and I\u2019m not ready to let you go just yet or share you with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She looked pleased with his statement and not at all angry that he was basically making decisions for her when it came to her job. He had to tread a very fine line because even though he\u2019d given her control when it came to their lovemaking, it was only natural that his dominance asserted itself in other areas.</p><p>\u201cI also told him that you\u2019d landed the S&amp;G contract for us and that we needed to allow you to work more closely with us, and that in the future you\u2019d make an excellent partner in the business.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed even as delight shone in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did he take that?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHe took it well. He agreed to start looking for another office manager now. I told him that you needed to be able to focus more fully on other aspects of the business and wouldn\u2019t have time to juggle everything else we throw at you. You\u2019ll need someone yourself to help out, so in essence the new office manager will work for the three of us. Not just me and Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour confidence in me means the world to me, Jensen,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cIn time I hope to be able to see myself as you see me. I\u2019m working on it, but as you said, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at having his words thrown back at him. \u201cVery true, baby.\u201d</p><p>She hedged a bit, obviously struggling with what she asked next.</p><p>\u201cAnd does he know . . . about us?\u201d</p><p>Jensen nodded. \u201cI told him the truth. I told him you were mine.\u201d</p><p>She blinked as if weighing such a blunt declaration. Then a soft smile spread over her beautiful face, her eyes shining.</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI like the way it sounds when you say it. I\u2019ve never truly belonged to anyone. If anyone had told me that I\u2019d be happy with another man being so . . . possessive, I would have flatly denied it. I would have never believed that I\u2019d like it or allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said just as quietly. \u201cNever doubt that. And I protect what\u2019s mine. I\u2019m going to warn you now. I gave you control in the area of our lovemaking and I was happy to do so. But my . . . dominance, for lack of a better word, will assert itself in other ways. Some of which you may not like or that may frighten or overwhelm you. I don\u2019t say that to scare you. I\u2019m just being honest because I don\u2019t want it to catch you off guard or freak you out.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and studied him a long moment in silence.</p><p>\u201cI know how huge it was, you giving up control to me. I know it goes against everything that makes you who and what you are. I don\u2019t want you to ever think I don\u2019t know the magnitude of that. I do. Nor do I want you to ever think I don\u2019t cherish what you\u2019re giving me. And as you said, we\u2019ll get there. I have no doubt that we\u2019ll be able to work out any kinks in our relationship as long as you understand that there will most certainly be times we butt heads. I can be stubborn and I\u2019m used to doing things my own way. You know that. But I want this to work and I find I don\u2019t quite mind the idea of your dominance. At least in theory.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek in his palm and stroked his fingers over her jaw, pushing away silky strands of her hair. She leaned farther into him so their noses were only inches apart. Her eyes were earnest, burning with sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever change who and what you are for me. I never understood what Joss was talking about when she said she loved Carson too much to ever demand of him something he couldn\u2019t give her. But I understand now. Because I don\u2019t want you to change who you are for me. I love you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>His heart melted into a puddle right there on the bed. He kissed her again, deep, until they were both breathless and their pulses racing.</p><p>\u201cThe same goes for you, Kylie. I don\u2019t want you to ever change who or what you are for me because I love you just the way you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll have to find a way to coexist together, warts and all,\u201d she said cheekily.</p><p>\u201cBet your ass,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She yawned broadly, her eyes looking sleepy and contented.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, nestling her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSleep now, baby. I\u2019ll go into work late in the morning so we can have breakfast together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll cook dinner for us tomorrow when you get home from work.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead, contentment spreading rapidly through his veins to the very heart and soul of him.</p><p>He knew they likely had a rough road ahead of them, but optimism was bright in his heart. Kylie was his and he wasn\u2019t letting her go. They\u2019d get through whatever issues they had together.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>KYLIE hummed to herself as she brushed out her hair and applied her makeup. The week had flown by and strangely, she wasn\u2019t looking forward to going into work on Monday. She\u2019d enjoyed her time with Jensen too much. It had been just the two of them the entire week, settling into a comfortable routine.</p><p>Jensen went to work in the mornings after eating breakfast with her and he returned promptly at five. Though Kylie had spoken to both Joss and Chessy on the phone, she hadn\u2019t gone into detail about her first time being intimate with Jensen. It just hadn\u2019t felt right. It was private. Between her and Jensen, and she didn\u2019t want the rest of the world to know what went on in their bedroom or the sacrifices he was making for her.</p><p>He was a proud man and while she had confided his offer to her best friends, she wished now she hadn\u2019t. At the time she\u2019d needed the sounding board. A way to talk about her fears and perhaps get validation from her friends. But now she regretted confiding Jensen\u2019s gift to them. It was beautiful and precious, the most selfless gift she\u2019d ever received.</p><p>She immediately brightened when she heard the front door open, and she tossed aside the brush, giving herself a quick once-over before hurrying from Jensen\u2019s bedroom into the living room.</p><p>He\u2019d called earlier and told her they\u2019d eat out again tonight. Cattleman\u2019s was a pub and diner that offered great food in a casual environment. Kylie had eaten there a few times with Joss and Chessy before they\u2019d made the Lux Caf\u00e9 their permanent \u201cgo-to\u201d spot.</p><p>She was looking forward to another night out with him. They hadn\u2019t had sex since that first time a few nights earlier. He hadn\u2019t pushed and neither had she. Perhaps she feared having another freak-out moment and ruining what progress they\u2019d made. Who really knew?</p><p>What she did know was that she was solidly in love and not ha**g s*x had in no way impeded their deepening relationship. No need to rock the boat when they were floating along just fine.</p><p>Jensen\u2019s face lit up when he saw her. She loved that look. The same look he gave her every day when he came home from work. As if he couldn\u2019t wait to see her and she was the highlight of his day.</p><p>Her earlier thought that she wasn\u2019t looking forward to returning to work on Monday fled as she took in the fact that she\u2019d get to spend the entire day with him. They\u2019d ride in together and come home together. What could be better?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d he asked, his expression perplexed.</p><p>She shook herself from her thoughts and dove into his arms, hugging him to her.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was just rethinking something I thought earlier. Or rather unthinking it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her, his chest vibrating against her cheek. She closed her eyes and held on to him, savoring their closeness and the comfort he brought her by just . . . being. With her. Coming home to her and being so happy to see her each day.</p><p>\u201cThat made absolutely no sense,\u201d he said in amusement.</p> <p>She drew away with a smile, absorbing his gaze, drinking in the sight of him. All male, gorgeous and vibrant. She shivered at the intensity of his gaze and wondered if tonight would be the night they\u2019d make love again. But then it was all up to her, wasn\u2019t it? She called the shots, so all she had to do was say she wanted him and he would be at her disposal.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking earlier that I wasn\u2019t really looking forward to going back to work on Monday. I\u2019ve enjoyed this week so much. But then I realized that when I go back to work, I\u2019ll get to spend the entire day with you and not just see you in the mornings and afternoons. So I corrected the idea that I wasn\u2019t looking forward to work and decided that I\u2019m very much looking forward to getting to spend the entire day with you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glimmered in amusement and a satisfied smile curved his sensual lips. Lips she very much wanted on her. Her heart fluttered as she imagined allowing him to touch her. Would she be able to handle it? Her heart and body recognized the desire and echoed her yearning. Her mind was the only thing holding her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen the error of your ways. Although I won\u2019t lie. This week has been wonderful with you here, waiting for me to get home. I wasn\u2019t ready to share you with the rest of the world. Not yet. And I won\u2019t say that I\u2019ll be ready on Monday, but I\u2019ve held you back long enough. It\u2019s time to set you loose and let you go kick some ass. That I get to be there with you is just icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cNow, are you going to change so you can feed me? It\u2019s been a while since I ate at Cattleman\u2019s. I\u2019m looking forward to some good bar food and lots of carbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever let it be said that I denied my woman anything.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her quickly and then headed into the bedroom, leaving her to stare at his ass and have lustful thoughts.</p><p>Did it make her a moron that she got a ridiculous thrill from the words \u201cmy woman\u201d?</p><p>She shivered because, moron or not, the way he said it just hit all her girly buttons. She was left with a goofy grin, her hormones raging over that ass of his. God, she was turning into a squealing teenager about to go on her first date.</p><p>Deciding to be a bit, okay a lot, bold, she followed him into the bedroom, hoping for a peek while he was changing. Apparently she could add voyeurism to her growing list of things she\u2019d never imagined indulging in.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat when she entered to see him stripped down to his underwear. His back muscles rippled as he pulled a shirt over his shoulders and she shamelessly stood there, enjoying the view.</p><p>Her gaze drifted downward to the very noticeable bulge in his underwear. It indeed appeared as though he did look forward to coming home to her each day.</p><p>Had it been a version of hell the last few days of them not having sex? Had she merely teased him with their first foray into intimacy? She didn\u2019t like the idea of being some prick tease. It wasn\u2019t in her nature to lead a man on. Not that it was what she was doing exactly. But she didn\u2019t like the idea of him being unfulfilled.</p><p>He turned, his brow rising as he saw her standing in the doorway. Then he smiled as he reached for his pants.</p><p>\u201cIs this where I say \u2018busted\u2019?\u201d he asked with no remorse.</p><p>She shook her head, smiling back at him. \u201cNot at all. I . . . like . . . seeing that you want me. Unless that erection is for someone else?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAs if. Do you see any other gorgeous, desirable woman here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Don\u2019t even see one,\u201d she said, her cheeks growing warm with his compliment.</p><p>He scowled at her response and then strode over to where she stood, pulling her into his arms. She landed with a thud against his chest and he tipped her chin upward before crushing his mouth over hers.</p><p>He rubbed his groin against her belly so she\u2019d feel just how hard he was. She slid her hands between them, cupping his c**k through the denim of his jeans, and caressed him gently.</p><p>His moan was guttural, the sound of a male in desperate need. Tonight, come hell or high water, she was going to mount a charge. If she had her way, neither of them would be aching much longer.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>KYLIE and Jensen were seated at a table by the window at Cattleman\u2019s and Kylie was munching on an appetizer of nachos when an extremely handsome man walked up to their table.</p><p>Beside him was a gorgeous woman with brilliant blue eyes and midnight black hair. It was a striking contrast. The couple looked like a million dollars together and it was obvious the man had money.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he looked ostentatious, or he was one of those guys who openly flaunted his wealth. He just had a quiet authority about him and his clothing was designer, very expensive and looked very good on him. Then there was the rock the woman sported on her ring finger. It caught the light and shimmered, nearly blinding Kylie in the process.</p><p>Okay, maybe that was a slight exaggeration, but still. She wasn\u2019t wrong about this man\u2014and woman\u2014being wealthy. She\u2019d hung out in Carson\u2019s circles enough to know the real deal when she saw it. She was also trained to catch on to the wannabes, the ones who tried to make it look like they had more money and status than they had in reality.</p><p>\u201cJensen, it\u2019s good to see you,\u201d the man said as he approached.</p><p>As he stopped at their table, he pulled the woman to his side in a gesture that looked practiced and automatic. It was obvious this man was possessive of her. It was evident in his body language. And the way he looked at her spoke volumes.</p><p>Jensen glanced up, his expression easing with recognition. And then he smiled warmly at the couple and stood. Kylie sat there like a deer in the headlights, unsure if she should stand or not. But Jensen reached a hand down to her, collecting hers and squeezing as if to reassure her.</p><p>God she loved that about him. That he was always so mindful and protective of her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Damon. Serena,\u201d he said to the woman. Then he turned to Kylie, his eyes possessive, positively screaming to the world that she was his. \u201cI\u2019d like you both to meet Kylie. She\u2019s very special to me.\u201d</p><p>A surge of joy flooded her heart at the simple way he declared their relationship.</p><p>\u201cKylie, this is Damon Roche and his wife, Serena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Kylie,\u201d Damon said, charm evident in his voice. But so too was there that authority that she\u2019d noticed about him. There was something about him that fascinated Kylie but made her wary at the same time.</p><p>Dominance.</p><p>The word came silently to her, her instincts telling her unquestionably that this man was dominant. It seemed everyone around her was either dominant or submissive. The world seemed very small, indeed.</p><p>\u201cHello, Kylie,\u201d Serena said, a warm smile on her beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kylie said shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t keep you,\u201d Damon said to Jensen. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a while since I saw you last and I wanted to come over and say hello at least.\u201d</p><p>Jensen shook his hand and then leaned in to kiss Serena on the cheek. Kylie gave them a small wave as they turned and headed in the opposite direction. Then Jensen retook his seat and Kylie looked at him in question.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAcquaintances,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t known them long and met them through Dash.\u201d</p><p>A prickle of awareness stirred at her nape. Damon\u2019s name rang a sudden bell with her. Joss had mentioned him. If she wasn\u2019t mistaken, he was the owner of the place Joss had joined and intended to go to in her quest for dominance. And if Jensen knew him . . .</p><p>\u201cAre you a member there?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand her. He was ever blunt, a fact she appreciated. She never had to wonder where she stood with him or what he was thinking or feeling because he never held anything back with her.</p><p>Except his need for dominance.</p><p>She flinched at that reminder, still raw over the knowledge that he was denying a huge part of himself. For her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a member, yes. But as of yet I haven\u2019t participated and now I have no intention of ever doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChessy and Tate and Joss and Dash go there,\u201d Kylie murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been there when they were there. In fact, I\u2019ve only been twice, both times for the application process and to tour the facilities.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, wondering if she even wanted to know the answer to her next question. She knew of the lifestyle. She\u2019d heard enough of Chessy and Joss\u2019s conversations to have a good idea of just what went on there, but she\u2019d never gotten explicit details. She wasn\u2019t even sure why her curiosity was stirred.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly goes on there?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cI mean Chessy and Joss have talked about it but to be honest most of the time I shut them out because I didn\u2019t want to know. And I was worried sick about Joss when she first said she was going to start attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to know now?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJust curious, I suppose. I mean it\u2019s not that I\u2019m interested in going there. I guess I should drop it. I don\u2019t like to remind you of what you\u2019re being denied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKylie. Look at me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, meeting his gaze. His stare was intense and utterly focused on her. He radiated seriousness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being denied anything. I made a choice, one that I do not regret. I have no interest in The House any longer. What I want and what I need is right here in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Even though logically she knew all of this, relief still surged through her veins, leaving a tightness in her chest that was almost painful.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that, baby?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYes, I do, Jensen. But I won\u2019t lie. At times it worries me that you\u2019ve given up so much for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you should focus more on what I\u2019ve gained,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBecause from where I\u2019m standing, I haven\u2019t given up a damn thing, and I\u2019ve gained far more than I ever dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>Reassured by the sincerity of his words, she plunged ahead.</p><p>\u201cSo what does go on there?\u201d she asked with more confidence. Knowing didn\u2019t hurt her. It didn\u2019t involve her. It did nothing more than assuage her curiosity over the lifestyle her two best friends lived.</p><p>\u201cThe House is a place for people to indulge themselves in all manner of sexual fantasies. Pretty much everything goes. Within reason, of course. It\u2019s not only about dominance and submission. There are plenty of other fantasies that people delight in. It\u2019s a place where they can freely\u2014and safely\u2014indulge themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is it, like, public? I mean do the people who go there act these fantasies out in front of everyone else there?\u201d</p><p>It was a little mind-boggling to imagine Chessy and Joss doing whatever it was they did for everyone to see, and maybe a small part of her didn\u2019t want to imagine her friends in those kinds of situations. Definitely an occasion for brain bleach.</p><p>\u201cSome do. Some don\u2019t. The option is there for both,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThere is a common room where everything is public. But there are also private rooms, monitored by security so no one gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds . . . different,\u201d she said lamely, not knowing what else to say about something she had no understanding of. The mere idea of ha**g s*x in public gave her hives. She could barely muster the courage to do it in private much less for the world to see.</p><p>He chuckled lightly. \u201cIt is different. But not so very much for the people who go. To them it\u2019s the normal course of their sexuality. Whatever works. As long as it\u2019s sane and consensual, to each his own.\u201d</p><p>Well that certainly put her in her place. And perhaps she needed to not be so judgmental. Who was she to pass judgment on other people anyway? She had so many hang-ups that it would take a psychologist years to sort through, so it wasn\u2019t as if she could talk.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about,\u201d Jensen soothed. \u201cI would never dream of bringing you there. I have no desire for the place any longer. When I first met Dash and we spoke of it, it intrigued me, yes. I even pursued membership. But then I met you. Or rather I met you and then pursued the membership but then once I got it, I had no desire to go. I wanted . . . you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never understand why,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cBut I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t go and that you do want me, issues and all. You give me hope, Jensen. The first real hope I\u2019ve had in my entire life to enjoy a normal relationship. Or as normal as we\u2019ll ever be, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>The rueful note in her voice couldn\u2019t be disguised.</p><p>\u201cWho needs normal?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cNormal is how we define it, not others. So everyone\u2019s normal is different. Ours is what we make it. Besides, if not being with you means I\u2019m normal then f**k that. I\u2019d much rather be abnormal with you.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, her mood lightening. God, but with her plans for later, she was doing her level best to be a huge wet blanket. Or at the very least, sabotaging her own efforts for that normalcy she spoke of.</p><p>Their orders were delivered and Kylie found herself eating rapidly. She was occupied with the rest of the evening. Food was the very last thing on her mind. She glanced up to see that Jensen was finished and she spoke before she lost her nerve.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go home?\u201d she asked, eager to get on with her plans for the night.</p><p>A spark lit in his eyes. Recognition. Was she that obvious? Or perhaps she was merely that desperate. The thought amused her because she would have never described herself as desperate before meeting Jensen. Now all she could think about was getting him na**d and them being skin to skin.</p><p>An uproar close to the door had Kylie picking her head up to see what the ruckus was about. Her mouth twisted in distaste when she saw an obviously drunk\u2014and loud\u2014man being coaxed from the bar by his harried female companion.</p><p>She glanced away, not wanting anything to ruin her night.</p><p>Jensen paid the bill and then stood and took her hand, pulling her to her feet. He tucked her against his side and they walked to the door and into the night.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong until Jensen went rigid against her. She glanced up in the direction of where he was staring, startled when a low growl rumbled from his chest.</p><p>The couple she\u2019d noticed before had evidently taken their altercation into the parking lot. The man had his fist in the woman\u2019s hair and was yelling obscenities at her.</p> <p>Then to her utter horror, the man struck the woman with his fist, knocking her to the ground.</p><p>Jensen lunged for the man, knocking him flat with a well-aimed blow. The man went down. Hard. Kylie stood frozen, unable to react or move as Jensen bent over the fallen woman and helped her to her feet.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s heart was thundering against her chest and sweat beaded on her forehead. Nausea rose, sharp in her stomach, and she had to swallow back the urge to rid her stomach of its contents.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Jensen asked the woman in a gentle voice. \u201cLet me help you. I\u2019ll call the police and have this bastard locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the woman all but shrieked. \u201cPlease, just leave us alone. You\u2019ll only make it worse!\u201d</p><p>Her voice turned pleading. She grasped Jensen\u2019s hand and shook him, desperation in her eyes and words.</p><p>Jensen stared at her in shock and then glanced at where the man lay groaning on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to walk away after what he did to you?\u201d Jensen asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just go,\u201d the woman begged. \u201cI\u2019ll get him home. He didn\u2019t mean it. He\u2019s just drunk. He has no idea what he\u2019s doing. He won\u2019t even remember in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how the hell will you explain that bruise on your cheek?\u201d Jensen demanded.</p><p>The woman glanced in panic at the man who was trying to get to his feet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Okay? Just go, please. I\u2019ll deal with him. He didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Please just go. It\u2019ll be worse for me if you interfere.\u201d</p><p>Kylie found her feet and her tongue at last. She slid up behind Jensen and tucked her hand into his. He turned as if just realizing she was there. Darkness simmered in his eyes. Rage coiled and burned, his entire body bristling.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jensen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll hurt her more. She doesn\u2019t want you to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to her,\u201d the woman urged. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before. He\u2019ll regret it in the morning, if he even remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse,\u201d Jensen said flatly. \u201cYou should have his ass thrown in jail and swear out a restraining order against him.\u201d</p><p>Kylie tugged at his hand, desperate to get away before the situation escalated. The man was struggling to his feet and whirling, obviously looking for his companion. The woman he\u2019d just flattened with his fist.</p><p>The woman threw them one last desperate look and then went to the man\u2019s side, sliding up against him, supporting his weight.</p><p>Jensen swore violently under his breath. His entire body quivered against her. His fingers were squeezing hers so tightly that she realized how tenuous his hold on his control was.</p><p>She pulled once more, worried he\u2019d go after the man again. To her relief, this time he came with her. The entire way to his car, he kept glancing over his shoulder, worry evident in his gaze as he searched out the man and woman.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, that makes me sick,\u201d Jensen swore as he guided Kylie into the passenger seat.</p><p>Kylie stared out her window as the woman struggled to get the man in the passenger seat of their vehicle. Her heart clenched as she imagined the life this woman must lead. A life where she made excuses for her husband or boyfriend\u2019s abuse. She closed her eyes, only wanting to shut out the images bombarding her from all sides.</p><p>The evening lay in ruins, her earlier optimism fading rapidly.</p><p>The entire way home, silence lay heavy over the inside of the car. Jensen\u2019s hands were tightly curled around the steering wheel, his stare fixed ahead as he navigated through traffic. Several times she glanced his way but he never took his eyes from the road.</p><p>The tension was thick, a tangible cloak surrounding them, almost suffocating in its intensity. She\u2019d seen the terrible rage in Jensen\u2019s eyes and then . . . bleakness. So much grief and sorrow that it had overwhelmed her.</p><p>What darkness did he have in his past? They\u2019d only spoken briefly about it. He\u2019d hinted that he had his own demons to fight and the one time she\u2019d asked, he\u2019d steered her away from the conversation, saying he\u2019d tell her later.</p><p>Now she realized that she had to know. Now, not later.</p><p>She\u2019d been so absorbed in her own issues that she hadn\u2019t given any thought to his, an oversight she intended to correct immediately.</p><p>If he\u2019d open up to her.</p><p>She flinched because she hadn\u2019t opened up to him but here she was expecting him to bare his soul to her. He knew some of her past, but she knew nothing of his. And if they had any hope of moving forward, they not only had to put her demons to rest, but his as well. Starting now.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>JENSEN unlocked the door to his house and ushered Kylie in. He glanced sideways at her to see her face was drawn and pale. She had her arms hugged around herself and was rubbing her palms up and down her skin in agitation.</p><p>He swore under his breath because the night lay in ruins. He knew well what Kylie had planned, what she\u2019d likely been working her nerve up to do all week. And now? Who knew what kind of hell she was enduring after that asshole\u2019s behavior in the parking lot.</p><p>It went against every grain for him to just walk away when he damn well knew the bastard would hurt the woman again and again. He\u2019d continue to do it until she fought back, until she put a stop to it. But for Jensen to just walk away and pretend he hadn\u2019t witnessed what he did?</p><p>It made him sick.</p><p>His own demons came roaring to life, no longer contained by the barriers he\u2019d erected over the years. They were simmering just below the surface, scratching and clawing their way out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cJensen?\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s quiet voice shook him from his thoughts. He glanced at her again to see her studying him, her expression troubled.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>He nodded, unable to say anything in response.</p><p>She took his hand, surprising him with the way she seemed to be trying to soothe him. As if she weren\u2019t the one who\u2019d just revisited hell by watching in real time everything that had happened to her. Only what she\u2019d endured was far worse. Getting smacked in the face wasn\u2019t even scratching the surface of all that had been done to her.</p><p>\u201cCome into the bedroom,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cLet\u2019s get into bed and we\u2019ll talk there.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, simply wanting to hold her for a moment. To reassure himself that she was safe. That she was here with him and not a million miles away in another place and time.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head, inhaling the scent of her silky hair. She wrapped her arms around him, hugging him fiercely, as if again she was soothing him and not the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She drew away but kept ahold of his hand and then tugged him toward the bedroom. When they entered, she went to the drawer where most of her clothing was and pulled out a pair of pajamas.</p><p>She stripped efficiently, not at all bothered by the fact he could see her. He was relieved that for the most part she didn\u2019t seem too traumatized over the night\u2019s events. Perhaps he was the one reeling the most. Seeing the woman brutalized in the parking lot had brought back painful memories for him. A feeling of helplessness had gripped him when the woman had pleaded with him not to call the police.</p><p>God, he never wanted to feel that helplessness again.</p><p>His hands were shaking. He hadn\u2019t even realized it until Kylie came over to him and slid her hands into his, squeezing in a comforting manner.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you undressed and ready for bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood there while she undressed him piece by piece. She moved slowly and almost reverently, as if she\u2019d taken over the role of caregiver, one usually assigned to him. And yet he allowed it, savoring the sensation of having someone who loved him to care for him when he was vulnerable.</p><p>Only with this woman would he ever allow this side of himself to be exposed. With no one else had he ever felt secure enough to allow control out of his grasp.</p><p>When he was down to his underwear, she guided him toward the bed, pulling the covers back so they could get in.</p><p>As soon as they were both settled in, Kylie snuggled into his arms, pillowing her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened tonight, Jensen?\u201d she asked gently. \u201cAside from the obvious. I saw the look in your eyes. I saw more than anger or rage. I saw grief and . . . despair. You once told me that I wasn\u2019t the only one who struggled with the demons of their past. Will you tell me about them now?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes a moment, wondering just how much he should tell her. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to tell her or didn\u2019t trust her enough to share. He worried that it would bring back unpleasant memories for her if he related his own tormented childhood.</p><p>As if reaching into his mind and plucking out his thoughts, she cupped his jaw and smoothed her hand over his cheek.</p><p>\u201cTonight is about you,\u201d she said in a soft voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about me. For once, let me be the strong one for you. I\u2019ll listen. To whatever you tell me. And I\u2019ll never tell anyone else. You can trust me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his face in to her hand, kissing her palm. \u201cAh, Kylie, I trust you absolutely. I trust you more than anyone else. I just don\u2019t want to hurt you or bring back painful memories for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cNot tonight. Tonight I\u2019m here to listen. To be strong for you like you\u2019ve been strong for me.\u201d</p><p>God, but he loved this woman. The idea of not being with her ripped a hole in his heart. He never wanted to contemplate a life without her. Not now that he had her. She belonged to him, and he\u2019d never willingly let her go.</p><p>She touched his face again, lightly stroking the curve of his jaw.</p> <p>\u201cI love you. Remember that. Nothing you say will ever change that.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, wondering how he\u2019d gotten so damn lucky. Who would have ever thought he\u2019d meet his soul mate in a woman with whom sexual dominance wasn\u2019t possible. But then she\u2019d likely never pondered or entertained even for a moment becoming involved with a dominant man, so perhaps they were even.</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell that will always be the case,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, sincerity blazing in her eyes.</p><p>He sucked in a breath, taking the plunge. He wanted to get it over with. Like ripping a bandage off quickly.</p> <p>\u201cLike you I come from an abusive background. My father\u2014\u201d</p><p>He choked on the words, hating to give the man who\u2019d been such a monster the reverence of that title.</p><p>Sorrow filled her eyes. And understanding. But she remained silent, not interrupting him as he struggled with how to continue.</p><p>\u201cUnlike in your case, most of his abuse wasn\u2019t directed at me. I wish to hell it had been. That I could have dealt with. But he took out his rage on my mother and I was helpless to do anything but watch and then pick up the pieces afterward. I hate that feeling. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down Kylie\u2019s cheek, her grief as thick as his own. She understood all too well his feelings on the subject. She knew more than anyone else his pain and the wretchedness of his memories.</p><p>Her hand trembled against his cheek but she kept it there, a silent signal of her love and support.</p> <p>\u201cDid it ever stop?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Jensen closed his eyes, pain burning like fire in his chest. It was almost too much, going back to that time in his life. He hadn\u2019t opened that door in a very long time and now that it was flung wide, he couldn\u2019t keep it under control.</p><p>Images flashed in his mind, tumbling faster and faster until he was dizzy from it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGod, no. He was a bastard to the bitter end. The day he was diagnosed with terminal cancer I celebrated. Jesus. I was f**king thrilled that the old man was going to endure a painful death. I wished it on him. Time and time again, and all I could think when it happened was that God had answered my prayer. How twisted is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she defended. \u201cIt was justice. It was what he deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my mother. God, she sat with him until the bitter end. I never understood that. But when it was over, she cleaned out their bank accounts, gave me the money and told me to go and be happy. Be happy. As if it were that easy. She expected me to walk away and leave her, move on with my life and forget the hell he put us both through.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Jensen shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just leave her. I resented her for sticking by him through his illness, but I couldn\u2019t just walk away from her. I didn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t walk away at her first opportunity. Maybe I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>She\u2019d picked up on the fact that there was more.</p><p>He lay back, staring at the ceiling, feeling anger and . . . betrayal, a sense of betrayal. One he\u2019d never fully recognized until now. He felt betrayed by his mother, only now he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019d done the best thing she could have.</p><p>\u201cShe left,\u201d he said, trying to keep the bitterness from his words. \u201cSince I wouldn\u2019t just leave her and go on my way, she did.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock. Anger flickered in her eyes before she stifled it and blinked it away.</p><p>\u201cShe left? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>Jensen nodded. \u201cI never saw her or heard from her again. There was a time I searched for her. After college, when I landed a job and started making money. I wanted to see how she was doing. I wanted to give her back what she\u2019d given to me, because she was left with nothing. I always wondered how she managed. But she disappeared. I have no idea if she\u2019s alive or dead. In my darkest moments, I wonder if she didn\u2019t go away so she could die. If she perhaps didn\u2019t do the job herself. Maybe she was trying to spare me more pain. Who knows? I know that\u2019s a horrible thing to imagine, but I can\u2019t come up with another explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jensen,\u201d she said, her voice aching with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. How awful for you not to know. I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like. To need closure and have no possible way for you to achieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know that she\u2019s okay,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cThat maybe she\u2019s even happy. At times I think I\u2019ve made peace with it all, and at others, I recognize that I\u2019ll never fully be at peace over the entire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes I wonder if she blamed me,\u201d he said baldly. \u201cFor not protecting her. For allowing him to hurt her. If she hated me for it. For my weakness.\u201d</p><p>Kylie rose over him, her eyes stricken. \u201cJensen, no! You were just a child. You were the one who was supposed to be protected. By your father and your mother. It wasn\u2019t your job to protect her. You aren\u2019t to blame for what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could believe that,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cI just wish I could tell her I was sorry. She was a good woman. But she\u2019d been beaten down too many times. Her spirit was just broken. She was utterly defeated and in the end I just don\u2019t think she had anything left. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to see her that way. Maybe that\u2019s why she tried to get me to leave and when I didn\u2019t, she did. I guess I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and hugged him to her. He could feel dampness on her cheek. Her tears for him shining on her skin.</p><p>The very last thing he wanted was to cause her pain. To make her remember. He wrapped his arms around her, thrusting his fingers into her hair, just holding her close.</p><p>\u201cTwo wounded souls finding the light,\u201d she whispered against his neck. \u201cWe need each other, Jensen. We understand all too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do need you,\u201d he said, the words a benediction. \u201cSo much, baby. I can\u2019t even explain it to myself, how you mean so much to me in such a short time. I never believed in destiny before but you\u2019re clearly mine. Made for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were made for me,\u201d she said, rising above him again.</p><p>Her hair streamed over her shoulders, falling over his face, silken strands caressing his skin. Then she lowered her lips to his, breathing him in as she kissed him.</p><p>Warm and so very sweet. Soft and soothing. She sipped at him, tasting and then drinking deeply from him.</p><p>She hesitated for a brief moment, sorrow entering her gaze.</p><p>\u201cLet me get the rope.\u201d</p><p>Her words were more of an apology than a statement or declaration. She was apologizing for needing the goddamn rope. Didn\u2019t she know that he\u2019d tie himself to the bed for the rest of his life if that was the only way he could have her?</p><p>\u201cIn the drawer,\u201d he said, latching onto her gaze, telling her without words not to apologize. Not for this. Never for this.</p><p>She slid off the bed and returned a moment later with the rope and then very gently secured his wrists to the headboard. She wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze and it gutted him that she would feel shame for the way they made love.</p><p>\u201cKylie, baby, look at me, please.\u201d</p><p>She finished securing the last knot and then sat back on her heels, her gaze slowly drifting upward until it locked with his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with this. I need you to be okay with it too. And we don\u2019t have to do this right now. It\u2019s been a heavy night. I\u2019m just as happy to hold you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes going soft with love. Then she leaned down and kissed him, tugging at his bottom lip with a playful nip.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you right now,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201cI need to show you my love. Not just say it. You\u2019ve been so strong for me. It\u2019s my turn to be strong for you. To let you lean on me for once. Let me do this. For you. For us.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, his dick threatening to tear a hole in his underwear. He was desperate for her. He needed her. Wanted her touch. Her sweetness and her light. Tonight more than ever.</p><p>She brushed her mouth over his chin and down his neck, sliding over his chest and further, over his taut abdomen. He flinched, his muscles tightening as her tongue swept a path across his flesh.</p><p>She made love to him as sweetly with her mouth as he\u2019d ever been made love to. He was on fire for her, his need a desperate, tangible thing.</p><p>She hooked her fingers in the band of his underwear and gently tugged downward. His dick surged upward, bursting free of constraint. Already, moisture beaded and seeped from the tip. He had no control around her, given freely or not.</p><p>She licked a path upward on the underside of his erection and then back down again, swirling and lavishing sweetness over his balls. He pulled against his restraints, reaching for her even as he knew the impossibility of such an action. One day. One day he\u2019d touch her as she was touching him. He\u2019d caress and stroke the fire inside her to fever pitch.</p><p>She circled the head with her tongue and then sucked him deep into her mouth. His eyes rolled back into his head as pleasure exploded in his groin. Then she slid up, letting the tip fall free from her lips.</p><p>Her eyes glowing with resolve, she pulled her pajama top up and over her head, baring her br**sts to his avid gaze. He sucked in his breath, afraid to hope when she went for her bottoms.</p><p>It took her a moment to get free of the bottoms and then her panties followed suit, baring her completely.</p><p>He soaked in every inch of her skin, her curves and swells, a feast of feminine flesh that had him salivating with the need to taste and touch her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>There was fire and determination in her eyes. \u201cYes, I do. I want to. I need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time then,\u201d he gently urged. \u201cWe have all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to help me,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>His heart softened. She was trying so very hard and he never loved her more than at this moment.</p><p>\u201cStraddle me,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cPut my dick right in the V of your thighs. Let it rest against your belly. We\u2019ll take it nice and slow.\u201d</p><p>And then another thought occurred to him, one that had him swearing. They needed a goddamn condom. He was nearly blinded with the need to have her skin to skin, no barrier between them, but he\u2019d never force an unwanted pregnancy on her. Not when they had so much else to resolve in their relationship.</p><p>\u201cKylie, baby, are you protected? I have condoms in the drawer with the rope.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use one. Unless you want to, I mean. Is it okay?\u201d</p><p>Relief surged through his veins, leaving him weak and dizzy with it. \u201cYes, baby. I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s been a while for me.\u201d</p><p>She grinned crookedly. \u201cIt\u2019s been never for me.\u201d</p><p>Though he knew she wasn\u2019t physically a virgin, in all other ways she was in fact that very thing. The only thing she lacked was the fragile barrier but in every other aspect she was completely innocent.</p><p>How he wished things were different. That he could tenderly make love to her for her first experience. He wanted to show her how beautiful it could be with someone who loved her as much as he did. His only regret over her having control was that he couldn\u2019t give back to her all that she was giving to him.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he said, keeping his voice pitched low and soothing. \u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re ready for me, baby. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment, self-consciousness flickering across her face before she finally lowered one hand and slid it between her legs.</p><p>The backs of her knuckles brushed over his groin, her touch feather-light. She emitted a soft sigh as she began stroking herself. He ached to be the one touching her so intimately. His skin was on fire. It felt as though a thousand ants were racing just underneath the surface. He was restless and edgy, the thought of being inside her nearly catapulting him over the edge.</p><p>He sucked in his breath, determined to get a lock on his control. This had to be perfect for her. He\u2019d withhold his release until she found hers. He was determined.</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open and her eyes were drowsy and passion-laced. Almost a drugged, intoxicated look he was relieved to see. She was into it as much as he was.</p><p>She lifted her hand, her fingers glistening with moisture. It called to him, beckoning him to taste. This time he didn\u2019t have to ask. She took the initiative and extended her hand to him, sliding her finger over his lips.</p><p>He licked the tip, catching it and then sucking it into his mouth. He nibbled gently at it before letting it go.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cTell me what to do, Jensen. I want this to be perfect for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be anything else but perfect with you. Lift your h*ps up and guide me. Take me inside you but take it nice and easy. Go slowly until you get used to having me inside you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her bottom lip disappeared between her teeth as she shifted her weight up. She grasped the base of his dick and suddenly he was engulfed by her heat. Her silky softness was surrounding the head. He\u2019d never felt anything so goddamn perfect in his life.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he encouraged. \u201cTake more of me. Nice and slow.\u201d</p><p>She began lowering herself down, inch by exquisite inch, gliding like hot velvet, clutching at him like a fist. When she was halfway there, her eyes widened and she glanced down in consternation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is going to work,\u201d she said shakily.</p><p>He smiled, willing himself not to arch up into her. He wanted to bury himself as deeply as he could go, but he forced himself to breathe through the urge and remain still until she was able to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cIt will work. Touch yourself with your other hand. You need to be a little wetter. You\u2019re so tight, baby. God, you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, kneeling up astride him as she began to stroke her clit. She made a humming sound of pleasure and she closed her eyes. He felt the burst of dampness around his dick, felt her open, sucking him deeper.</p><p>She slid down another inch, causing them both to groan. He was almost there. So close.</p><p>And then she settled her full weight down on him, taking him completely.</p><p>She gasped, her eyes widening at the sudden fullness. It was overwhelming to him too. He clenched his jaw, fighting his release with every ounce of strength he possessed.</p><p>\u201cRide me, baby. Do what feels good to you. I want you to come. Touch yourself if you need to. Whatever you need. You\u2019re so beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen a more gorgeous sight than you astride me.\u201d</p><p>She moved restlessly, rocking forward and then back. After a few tentative movements, she found a comfortable rhythm and she began moving up and down, lifting herself up and then allowing herself to slide back down his erection.</p><p>His dick was coated with her honey. Slick with her arousal and his precum. Each time she took him deep, he was surrounded by the lush warmth of her pussy.</p><p>It was a sight to behold, this small, curvy woman perched atop his much larger frame. Her hair streamed over her shoulders, playing an erotic game of peek-a-boo with her nipples.</p><p>The idea that he was her first lover, the first man she\u2019d trusted enough to make love with, staggered him. He was humbled by such a precious gift. It was one he\u2019d cherish the rest of his life. One he\u2019d protect with his very life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d she said with a gasp. \u201cI want you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be with you, baby. Come for me. I\u2019ll catch you. Just let go.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, bracing her palms on his chest, and she began to move faster, taking him deep and hard. Her breaths were ragged, her face flushed with heat and arousal.</p><p>His release swelled, growing like an impending thunderstorm. He felt her convulse around him, squeezing him tightly as she cried out in the throes of her orgasm. It spurred his own. He was helpless to do anything but arch into her, over and over, his entrance made easier as his release coated her passageway.</p><p>His vision blurred. The room dimmed around him until there was only her. She was all he saw, all he felt, all he knew. His arms strained against the ropes holding him down. He reached for her, desperate to hold her, touch her.</p><p>She sagged forward, her chest heaving, her breaths coming in ragged spurts over his chest. He was still wedged firmly inside her, still hard, achingly so. He was hypersensitive, still pulsing, each little wiggle from her eliciting another wave of ecstasy.</p><p>He waited, his patience fraying. He waited for her to untie him so he could hold her. So he could touch her and share in the aftermath of something wild and beautiful and innocent.</p><p>Finally she lifted herself up, her br**sts hovering temptingly in his line of vision. They were, as she was, exquisite perfection, her ni**les a delicate pink. His mouth watered at the idea of tasting her. Of sucking the rigid peaks into his mouth.</p> <p>She reached over his head to pull at the bindings around his wrists. And when he was finally free, he wrapped his arms around her tightly, ignoring the stinging discomfort in his numb hands.</p><p>He rolled, bringing them to rest on their sides, him still penetrating her. He didn\u2019t pull free. He wanted to stay connected, to keep the intimacy thick around them.</p><p>He kissed her hungrily, his h*ps rocking back and forth against her. And then, realizing what he was doing, he stilled, an apology poised on his lips.</p><p>As if knowing what he was thinking, she put a finger to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and gathered her close. But he was careful to remain still inside her. He\u2019d vowed to give her absolute control. If and when they made love without him being restrained, it would be at her doing. Not his.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve never loved anyone more.\u201d</p><p>She nestled further into his embrace, her mouth pressed against the column of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Jensen. Thank you for sharing yourself with me tonight. For trusting me with your demons.\u201d</p><p>Left unsaid was that she had yet to confide her demons to him, but he didn\u2019t take it personally nor did it anger or disappoint him. What she\u2019d given him tonight was infinitely more precious. She\u2019d given him the gift of herself. That would always be enough for him.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>JENSEN came awake with a gasp, his heart thudding violently in his chest. Sweat poured down his forehead and he sat straight up, his pulse like a hammer in his ears. He immediately sought out Kylie, relief blowing sweet through his veins when he saw she was sleeping undisturbed beside him.</p><p>He eased back against the pillow, nausea sharp in his stomach. He blew his breath out through his nostrils and then sucked steadying air back in as he willed the violent images to go away.</p><p>He closed his eyes, as if that would shield him from the memories. Of his mother being beaten while he screamed and cried for his father to stop hurting his mama. Oh God, he just wanted it to go away. He wanted peace. He didn\u2019t want to be that little boy any longer, incapable of preventing a monster from abusing his mother.</p><p>He wished to hell he hadn\u2019t told Kylie of his past. That he\u2019d left it tightly covered, suppressed under years of practiced control. He clenched his hands, curling his fingers into tight fists before relaxing them again, flexing in an effort to relieve some of the horrible tension coiling through his body.</p><p>It sickened him, the memories. He wanted nothing more than to banish them from his mind forever. But it wasn\u2019t possible. He\u2019d opened the door and there was no going back. There was nothing more for him to do than to deal with it all over again and begin the painful process of suppression once more.</p><p>How could he ever be good for Kylie when he hadn\u2019t even been able to protect his own mother? How could she possibly trust in him after all he\u2019d told her?</p><p>He stared at her in the darkness, watching the soft rise and fall of her chest. He ached to touch her but he held back because violence still simmered in his consciousness and he didn\u2019t want that to touch her even peripherally. He wouldn\u2019t have her awaken and be frightened, didn\u2019t want her climbing from a nightmare and fearing his touch.</p><p>He turned his gaze back to the ceiling, giving up all hope of sleeping tonight. Pain burned brightly in his soul, the ache fiercer than it had been in a very long time. If baring one\u2019s soul was supposed to be so freeing then why did he feel imprisoned all over again?</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>KYLIE felt on top of the world Monday morning when she rode to work with Jensen. Optimism, an alien concept to her until now, simmered in her mind.</p><p>So she hadn\u2019t been able to make love to Jensen without him being tied to the bed. Yet. But they had made love! That was a huge step for her.</p><p>She was . . . happy. When was the last time she could say that and really mean it? Her old version of happiness was merely a shell, a code word for simply existing. It wasn\u2019t until she got involved with Jensen that she realized just how much of her life was passing her by while she kept her head firmly in the sand.</p><p>The weekend had been utter bliss. They hadn\u2019t made love again since Friday night, and both seemed reluctant to push too hard and too fast, but the intimacy had grown around them to such an extent that Kylie knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before they took the plunge again.</p><p>And maybe this time she\u2019d pluck up the courage not to tie Jensen up for the act.</p><p>She\u2019d been worried about Jensen after he\u2019d confided about his childhood to her, but other than being a little quieter than normal Saturday morning, he didn\u2019t seem to be much worse for the wear.</p><p>She\u2019d purposely kept the mood and tone light between them, not wanting him to go back to the blackness of his past. She\u2019d told him she loved him countless times and had been openly affectionate with him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t chosen to confide in him about her childhood, not because she didn\u2019t trust him, but because him confiding his had taken a huge toll on him emotionally and she hadn\u2019t wanted to add to it. In time, she\u2019d get around to it. When the moment was right. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to it, but neither was she avoiding it at all costs.</p><p>Dealing with it. That\u2019s what she was doing and would do. With Jensen\u2019s help. His love and support. What else could she ask for?</p><p>Toward noon, Dash stuck his head in her office.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked from the doorway.</p><p>She motioned him forward. \u201cOf course. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He sat in one of the chairs, the same one Jensen had occupied seemingly a lifetime ago when she\u2019d pondered getting rid of them. Now? She didn\u2019t mind the intrusion of either him or Dash in her office. Especially Jensen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good, Kylie. You look happy.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, discomfort crawling up her spine at the personal note the conversation took. But sincerity was clearly etched on Dash\u2019s handsome features so she shoved aside her instinct to clam up. It\u2019s what she would have done in the past, no doubt. But she was trying on the new Kylie for size. Someone who could open up more to her friends. To people in general.</p><p>She\u2019d never be the bubbly, friendly breath of fresh air that Chessy was. Nor would she ever be as sweet and loving as Joss. But they were rubbing off on her just as Jensen was, and she found herself more relaxed around her circle of friends. More willing to let her guard down. At the very least, she wanted to lose the bitchy, abrasive aspect of her personality. Things she\u2019d used as a defensive mechanism before.</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cJoss wanted me to invite you and Jensen over this Friday. Chessy and Tate will be coming too. Nothing fancy. She\u2019s itching to cook a good meal and have our friends over.\u201d</p><p>Heat surged into Kylie\u2019s cheeks and she dropped her gaze, ashamed of how her last trip to Dash\u2019s house had gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Kylie said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jensen would too. And Dash, I know I apologized to Joss, but I\u2019ve never really apologized to you for how I reacted when you told me Jensen was becoming your partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready forgotten,\u201d Dash said, his voice warm. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to hurt Joss. I was pretty pissed at the time, but I know your heart, Kylie. And I know you love Joss and would never intentionally hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be a better friend. A better person,\u201d she amended. \u201cI know I\u2019m not always easy to love.\u201d</p><p>She said the last with a grin, marveling that she could even joke about matters she was normally extremely sensitive about.</p><p>Dash chuckled. \u201cWell, neither am I. I think we all know that by now. But I also want to offer you an apology.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze again, her eyebrows rising in confusion. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work hard. Damn hard. And Jensen\u2019s right. You\u2019re more than capable of contributing more to this company than just your duties as our administrative assistant. I read over the proposal you prepared for the S&amp;G contract. I was very impressed.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, uncomfortable with the sincere praise. But extremely pleased as well.</p><p>\u201cThose were Jensen\u2019s ideas as well. I can\u2019t take the full credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s Jensen\u2019s job,\u201d Dash said dryly. \u201cI\u2019d expect as much from him. I\u2019m only sorry it took his prodding to wake me up to the fact that you would be an invaluable asset as a partner.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dash. I wouldn\u2019t have been ready before. I didn\u2019t have enough confidence in myself. But I will. I\u2019m working on it. I certainly won\u2019t turn down such an opportunity or challenge. But I don\u2019t want anything given to me that I haven\u2019t earned. And I want to earn your and Jensen\u2019s approval and eventually perhaps a partnership as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my approval, Kylie. You always have. You have my confidence as well and certainly Jensen\u2019s. He recognized your abilities right away, something I\u2019m ashamed to say I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good like that,\u201d she said with a soft smile, warmth flooding into her mind at the thought of Jensen and how much he believed in her when she wouldn\u2019t believe in herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy for you,\u201d Dash said, his voice going quieter. \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been easy for you since Carson died. I miss him too. He was my best friend. He\u2014and you\u2014are family.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the knot in her throat, proud of the way she maintained her composure when her brother was mentioned. She truly was making progress. She\u2019d come so far in just a few weeks. Thanks to Jensen.</p><p>She knew she couldn\u2019t fully credit him with her progress. She\u2019d done a lot on her own. She had to. No one could make her do so but herself. She had to be willing to move forward, and until recently she hadn\u2019t been. But Jensen had definitely kick-started her way down the path. Without him she\u2019d still be hiding from the world, going through the motions of each day and not living. Truly living. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do miss him,\u201d she said, a small ache in her chest. \u201cBut just like Joss did, I have to let him go. I can\u2019t stop living my life just because he lost his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say that, honey. Carson would have wanted you to be happy first and foremost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying. I\u2019ll get there eventually.\u201d</p><p>Jensen stuck his head in the door, a slight frown on his face as his gaze swept over Dash.</p> <p>\u201cAm I missing something? What are you doing in Kylie\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>Dash rolled his eyes. \u201cWe were talking. You know, having a conversation? Something coworkers frequently do on the job.\u201d</p><p>Jensen looked suspiciously at him and Kylie grinned, thrilled with the possessiveness that shone in Jensen\u2019s eyes. It was absurd for him to get touchy over Dash being in her office. The man was very happily married to her best friend. But still, she didn\u2019t mind that Jensen had obviously staked his claim.</p><p>\u201cI was telling Kylie that Joss wants you both to come over this Friday night,\u201d Dash said as Jensen ambled farther into her office.</p><p>Jensen leaned against Kylie\u2019s desk, slipping his hand over hers. Instant warmth invaded her skin where his fingers rested. She really had come a long way. If Jensen had ever come into her office and breached the professional relationship before as he was doing now, she would have kicked him in the balls.</p> <p>God, she was turning into a total girl. Like she couldn\u2019t exist without some man to save her. She inwardly winced at the thought. Just because Jensen was being so supportive didn\u2019t mean she wanted to turn into a helpless nitwit who couldn\u2019t do things for herself or exist without him.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to exist without him and therein lay the truth. Loving him, leaning on him, didn\u2019t mean she was helpless or hopelessly dependent on him. It just meant she was better with him.</p><p>Weren\u2019t all couples better because of their partner or spouse? If one was good, then two united against the world had to be even better. Or at least that\u2019s the way she viewed it, but she was hardly an expert on relationships given the extremes she\u2019d always gone to in order to avoid one.</p><p>\u201cChessy and Tate will be there,\u201d Dash continued. \u201cJoss wants to entertain y\u2019all at the house. Good food, good wine and good friends.\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled in pleasure over Dash\u2019s invitation, but what he did next endeared him to Kylie all the more. He didn\u2019t blindly accept Dash\u2019s invitation. Instead he turned to her, question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? You up for something like that?\u201d</p> <p>She took the initiative and laced her fingers more tightly around his. She loved him for curbing his dominant tendencies around her. For not jumping in, taking charge and making her decisions for her. And that, more than anything, told her how much he genuinely cared for her. To deny an intrinsic part of himself, a part that made him who he was, for her. Wow. She still couldn\u2019t fully comprehend the magnitude of loving someone enough to compromise to that degree.</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds like a great evening,\u201d she said, smiling up at him.</p><p>Jensen turned back to Dash. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see you there. What time? And does Joss want us to bring anything?\u201d</p><p>Dash rose, making it obvious he was returning to his own office and leaving Kylie and Jensen alone.</p><p>It should be awkward as hell that one of her bosses was leaving her office so she could be alone with her other boss. Oh well. She guessed any prickliness from her was truly gone. Who knew she could be so easygoing and accepting?</p><p>\u201cJust yourselves,\u201d Dash said. \u201cIf I know Joss she\u2019ll go completely overboard in the food department. She\u2019s already planning her menu. So I\u2019d come with an appetite if I were you.\u201d</p><p>With that he left Kylie\u2019s office and Jensen turned, leaning his behind against the edge of her desk so he faced her.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said gruffly, pulling her up and out of her seat to stand in between his thighs.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her, hugging her close. Then he pulled away, kissing her long and lingeringly. By the time he drew away, she was breathless, her face flushed and her hormones running amok.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cYou just saw me half an hour ago when you invited me to go to lunch with you!\u201d</p><p>His expression was utterly somber. \u201cIt was the longest thirty minutes of my life.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes but settled into his arms, leaning against his chest. She emitted a contented sigh, marveling at how light she felt. So much freer. The past wasn\u2019t weighing down on her, an unbearable pressure that she\u2019d lived with for so long.</p><p>Her dreams had been devoid of nightmares. Every night she went to bed with Jensen, a solid barrier to the outside world and to her past.</p><p>And he loved her.</p><p>Every day that passed, she became more convinced that they were in this for the long haul. She hated the thought of jinxing them with her newfound optimism and confidence, but for the first time she could look ahead and actually see a different future for herself than what she\u2019d always imagined.</p><p>A man who loved her, issues and all. Good friends. A challenging promotion.</p><p>Her life was finally coming together.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>KYLIE and Jensen got out of his car at Dash\u2019s and Joss\u2019s house and Jensen met her halfway around the hood, extending his hand out in an automatic gesture she loved. She slid her hand into his, giving it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>She wore a ridiculously goofy grin that was not typical of her at all. Good God, one might even say she was chipper. She shook her head at that thought. Maybe Chessy was rubbing off on her more than she realized.</p><p>Or perhaps she was just that damn happy.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Jensen said after he rang the doorbell.</p><p>His gaze stroked over her like a painter\u2019s brush, not missing a single inch in his perusal.</p><p>\u201cKnow what else I look like?\u201d she asked with that same goofy grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy.\u201d</p><p>There was a smugness to her voice that couldn\u2019t be missed. She felt positively cocky, and boy was that a novel feeling. Happy, confident and cocky? The world had to be coming to an end.</p><p>Jensen smiled warmly at her and then brushed his lips across hers, just as the door opened.</p><p>\u201cHey you two!\u201d Joss greeted, her face and eyes glowing with the same happiness Kylie was marveling over. \u201cCome in, come in. Now that y\u2019all have arrived we can start dinner!\u201d</p><p>Kylie stepped inside and pulled her sister-in-law into a hug. Joss seemed surprised and then delighted at Kylie\u2019s spontaneous show of affection. The old Kylie was reserved and rarely sought out physical contact. The new Kylie was going to work harder at letting her friends know what they meant to her.</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous, Joss. Marriage agrees with you so well,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>Jensen leaned in to kiss Joss\u2019s cheek. \u201cI have to agree with Kylie there. You look positively radiant. There\u2019s nothing more beautiful than a happy woman.\u201d</p><p>Joss flushed but seemed delighted with Jensen\u2019s compliment.</p><p>\u201cI agree wholeheartedly,\u201d Dash said as he walked to where the three stood.</p><p>He wrapped his arm around Joss, pulling her into his side. The love the two shared was so obvious, and before, it would have made Kylie uncomfortable. Seeing her friends so happy and in love had only reinforced the fact that she\u2019d never had that. Had thought she never would.</p><p>\u201cA happy woman is a beautiful woman indeed. I\u2019m just fortunate that I make her that way,\u201d Dash added with a smile.</p><p>They entered the living room where Chessy and Tate were sitting. Chessy rose and hurried over to hug Kylie.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing!\u201d Chessy exclaimed. \u201cAnd oh my God, look at your shoes! Someone get a camera and quick! This has to be documented. Kylie is wearing heels!\u201d</p><p>Laughter broke over the room. Jensen slid his arm around her, rubbing his hand up and down the bare expanse of her arm. She\u2019d worried she\u2019d be overdressed for the occasion. After all, they were merely going to Dash\u2019s and Joss\u2019s house for dinner. But now she was glad she made the effort.</p><p>She looked good. With no false modesty, she knew she looked her best. And now that she\u2019d made friends with her heels, she could actually walk without teetering precariously.</p><p>\u201cI do love those shoes,\u201d Joss said wistfully. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d</p><p>Dash groaned. \u201cThanks, Kylie. She\u2019ll break me now.\u201d</p><p>Joss elbowed him with a ferocious scowl and Kylie just laughed.</p><p>Joss certainly didn\u2019t need Dash\u2019s money. She had all that Carson had left her plus her share of the profits from the business. She, like Kylie, had inherited a portion of Dash\u2019s\u2014and now Jensen\u2019s\u2014consulting firm.</p><p>Kylie banked her share, not touching it. She used her paycheck for her bills and the necessities. It was invested and she rarely gave it any thought. But perhaps with her new outlook on life she would consider doing something fun with some of the proceeds. Maybe she and Jensen could take a trip somewhere.</p><p>There was suddenly so much she wanted to do and experience. Having a new lease on life made her look at everything so much differently now. She saw the world in color instead of a drab gray.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all go on in to the dining room,\u201d Joss said, motioning with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m going into the kitchen to start serving it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, honey,\u201d Dash said, following her.</p><p>Kylie sat next to Jensen at Joss\u2019s dinner table that seated twelve. Chessy and Tate sat across from them while Dash sat at the head of the table with a spot for Joss reserved on his right, next to Kylie.</p><p>As the food was placed on the table, several oohs and ahhs of appreciation sounded. Joss had outdone herself with tonight\u2019s feast. As Kylie glanced around the table, she realized that this was how it should be at holidays. Friends. No, not friends, family. She\u2019d spent so long focused on the fact that Carson was her only family and now that he was gone she had no one, she\u2019d lost sight of the fact that family was what you made it. This was her family now. Joss, Dash, Chessy and Tate. And Jensen.</p><p>Joss had baked Cornish hens with a delicious-smelling marinade. There were at least three casseroles, potatoes, vegetables and of course, a good bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cOh yummy! Gimme!\u201d Kylie said when Joss uncovered one of the casseroles to reveal Joss\u2019s homemade four-cheese macaroni.</p><p>\u201cWatch her, Jensen,\u201d Dash warned. \u201cShe gets territorial when it comes to Joss\u2019s mac and cheese. The rest of us have to fight her for whatever we get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send the leftovers home with you, Kylie,\u201d Joss soothed.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any leftovers after they all get done,\u201d Kylie groused.</p><p>\u201cI made an extra one for you,\u201d Joss whispered.</p><p>\u201cHey, I heard that!\u201d Chessy protested. \u201cWhat about me? Am I chopped liver over here or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made dessert for you,\u201d Joss said in a placating tone.</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes lit up in delight. \u201cOhhh please tell me you made your caramel pie.\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cAnd an extra for you to take home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if she agrees to share it with me,\u201d Tate said dryly.</p><p>Chessy sent him a mock scowl. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re a really good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, Joss. Where did you come up with all the time to fix all this?\u201d Kylie asked. \u201cThere\u2019s enough to feed an army here plus you made extras for me and Chessy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful, Joss,\u201d Jensen complimented after several bites. \u201cI think I\u2019m in heaven.\u201d</p><p>Several other praises were offered and Joss sat down, her face pink from all the compliments.</p><p>\u201cThis is excellent, honey. Thank you,\u201d Dash said, shooting his wife a smile that even made Kylie shiver.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d found love herself, she could view her friends and their relationships in a whole new light. No longer was she envious of them. She now shared in the wonder of being involved in an actual relationship. Being in love and all the newness that it brought.</p><p>She slipped her hand into Jensen\u2019s lap, resting her fingertips on his thigh. He reached down, switching his fork from his left hand to his right, and laced his fingers through hers, squeezing.</p><p>Contentment settled deep into Kylie\u2019s soul. Love was said to get better with age, and if that was true then Kylie looked forward to the days ahead. Because right now was pretty damn awesome. If it got better? She couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><p>They joked and talked through dinner. It was a noisy, happy occasion. The atmosphere was relaxed, and even Chessy seemed to be genuinely happy, her eyes sparkling with laughter and love.</p><p>Then Tate\u2019s cell phone rang and the light diminished from Chessy\u2019s eyes. She glanced away so no one would see, but Kylie had already witnessed the resignation in her friend\u2019s expression.</p><p>Kylie tried to tune out Tate\u2019s conversation, hoping it was nothing that would ruin the evening for Chessy. But it quickly became apparent that whatever the situation was, it required Tate\u2019s immediate attention.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t really get it. Kylie didn\u2019t understand the nuances of Tate\u2019s job as a financial advisor. One would think his would be a job that was only demanding during normal work hours. When the market and banks were open. Not late into the evening. What on earth could require his immediate attention and drag him away from his wife with such alarming frequency?</p><p>Doubt crept into Kylie\u2019s mind as she pondered the situation and the expression on her friend\u2019s face. No wonder Chessy had worried that he was having an affair. It wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility. Stage a call from a client demanding his attention and then he slips away for a few hours with another woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She really had to put a lid on her overactive imagination. Chessy needed support. Not validation for her suspicions.</p><p>With a grimace, Tate rose, glancing down the table at Dash.</p><p>\u201cCan you run Chessy home afterward?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long this will take.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow swamped Chessy\u2019s eyes. How could Tate not see how much he was hurting her? Could he really be that oblivious? Everyone else saw it. Even Jensen studied Tate with a frown, his gaze swinging back and forth between him and Chessy. There was concern in Jensen\u2019s eyes for Chessy and irritation for Tate.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dash said, though he was frowning too. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Joss and I will see her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Tate said. Then he leaned down and brushed his lips over Chessy\u2019s forehead. And lightly caressed one cheek with his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up for me, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Then he strode away leaving Chessy staring down at her plate.</p><p>The silence after his departure was pronounced and awkward. When Chessy did look up, there was humiliation in her eyes. And defeat.</p><p>Jensen and Dash exchanged quick frowns and Joss stared at Chessy with concern.</p> <p>Knowing the attention needed to be focused on someone other than Chessy, Kylie quickly scrambled for a conversation topic. Which was new to her, because she usually just sat back and observed or commented on what everyone else was talking about.</p><p>\u201cHow was y\u2019all\u2019s honeymoon?\u201d Kylie directed toward Joss and Dash.</p><p>Chessy sent her a look of gratitude and even tried to smile, but the light was thoroughly extinguished in her usually expressive, bubbly demeanor.</p><p>\u201cIt was wonderful,\u201d Joss said, though her gaze kept cutting back to Chessy. Then she looked directly at Kylie, one brow rising as if to say, \u201cWhat are we going to do about this?\u201d</p><p>Kylie grimaced and lifted one shoulder in a shrug. She had no idea what to do or say to make her friend feel better. How could she? The only person at this point who could make Chessy feel better was Tate.</p><p>\u201cThe beach was beautiful,\u201d Joss continued. \u201cAnd the food was delicious. Our room had a balcony that overlooked the ocean and at night we\u2019d lie in bed and listen to the waves. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever slept as well as I did for those two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou slept?\u201d Kylie asked in amusement. \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>Dash coughed as he put down his drink. Jensen chuckled and Joss looked shocked by Kylie\u2019s remark. Then she blushed madly and joined in Jensen\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well maybe I slept a little,\u201d Joss murmured.</p><p>Dash grinned and reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cWas the food good? I can\u2019t say I really remember much except you. Was there even a beach? My memory is a little hazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Joss squeaked out.</p><p>\u201cA beach sounds awesome right now,\u201d Kylie said wistfully.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d had her epiphany about living life and maybe enjoying some of the money she had invested, she\u2019d thought more and more about traveling. A vacation. Maybe more than one. Finally she had the courage to see some of the world beyond her sheltered existence. And she had someone to share it with.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d Joss said, seizing the opening. \u201cWhen have you ever taken a vacation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d Dash interjected.</p><p>Jensen studied her thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe we could both take a vacation soon.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s cheeks warmed with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Chessy looked even sadder. Tears glistened in her eyes but she looked away, hiding them from the rest of the table. Kylie\u2019s heart ached for her.</p><p>\u201cChessy, why don\u2019t you get Tate to go away on a vacation?\u201d Kylie asked, taking the bull by the horns.</p><p>They were in the company of friends. Trusted friends. There was no sense dodging the issue. Everyone knew. Everyone could see Chessy\u2019s pain. Hiding it didn\u2019t change it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never go,\u201d Chessy said dully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should arrange a kidnapping,\u201d Dash said thoughtfully.</p><p>Chessy grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019d kill me. He\u2019s working so hard to juggle his client load after his partner quit so unexpectedly. He\u2019s determined not to lose anyone. I\u2019m just going to have to ride it out and hope it doesn\u2019t stay like this forever.\u201d</p><p>Jensen cleared his throat and looked as though he were weighing whether he wanted to say something or not. Then he looked at Chessy, his eyes warm with concern and understanding.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried telling him how you feel, sweetheart? I know if the woman I loved came to me and told me she was unhappy, I\u2019d move heaven and earth to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s smile was sad and aching. Her eyes watered again but she looked at them all directly, no longer trying to hide her upset.</p><p>\u201cThank you all,\u201d she said, dodging the direct question Jensen had asked. \u201cI\u2019m just being a big baby. I don\u2019t want to be yet another burden on Tate when things are so crazy with work. I just have to be patient and supportive. Our anniversary is coming up and he\u2019s promised me a night out with no work.\u201d</p><p>Dash and Jensen didn\u2019t look convinced. Joss was obviously distressed to see Chessy so unhappy. It was just Joss\u2019s nature to want to help others. She was so giving and generous. Her heart was incredibly soft.</p><p>Recognizing that Chessy wanted to shift the topic off her and Tate, Kylie stood and picked up her plate.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Joss. I\u2019ll help you clear the table. We can have dessert in the living room, right?\u201d</p><p>Joss also stood and began collecting plates. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll get Dash to choose a good dessert wine and then I\u2019ll cut everyone a piece of pie.\u201d</p><p>As Kylie walked by Chessy, she leaned down and pressed a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Chessy,\u201d Kylie whispered. \u201cAnd you know I\u2019m here for you whenever you need me, right?\u201d</p><p>Chessy flashed Kylie a look of gratitude. \u201cThanks, sweetie. I really appreciate it. But I\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she amended.</p><p>Hoping her friend was right, Kylie continued on into the kitchen to unload her pile of plates. Joss followed behind a few moments later, her brow furrowed in consternation.</p><p>\u201cI hate to see her so unhappy,\u201d Joss said fiercely. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything we can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort of hitting Tate upside the head and asking him what the hell his problem is?\u201d Kylie said dryly.</p><p>Joss made a sound of disgust. \u201cYou know I love Tate to pieces, but right now he\u2019s as thick as a brick. I can\u2019t believe he can\u2019t see the misery in Chessy\u2019s eyes when everyone knows how bubbly and outgoing she always is. But she\u2019s only that way when she\u2019s happy. Chessy can\u2019t hide her feelings to save her life. When she\u2019s unhappy, it shows in every facet of her personality. And Tate can\u2019t see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likely doesn\u2019t want to see it,\u201d Kylie said quietly. \u201cBecause if he acknowledges that she\u2019s unhappy then he has to deal with the fact that he\u2019s made her that way. I think he knows. Deep down. But he\u2019s in denial. By pretending everything is normal, he doesn\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just seems so chickenshit,\u201d Joss muttered. \u201cI know he loves her. I know that. But gah! This is so not like him, Kylie! I\u2019ve never seen him this way. So distant. So willing to place Chessy second or even third in his priorities. In the past he\u2019s always been so solidly focused on her. The kind of relationship they have, he has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to know anything about the kind of relationship they share,\u201d Kylie said carefully. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve gleaned from y\u2019all, I\u2019d say he\u2019s falling down on the job as her Dominant. Haven\u2019t y\u2019all always said that it\u2019s the Dominant\u2019s duty to see to his submissive\u2019s every need? To put her first and above all else? Isn\u2019t he supposed to cherish her gift of submission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jensen said from the doorway to the kitchen. \u201cAbsolutely. Always. No question.\u201d</p><p>Kylie glanced up quickly. She hadn\u2019t noticed him coming in. She\u2019d been too absorbed in her conversation with Joss.</p><p>Jensen unloaded dishes from his arms and then picked Kylie\u2019s hand up, bringing it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to do all those things,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cAnd it would appear, at least right now, that he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Joss and I aren\u2019t the only two who see it,\u201d Kylie murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, you two know her better. And Tate as well. I\u2019m just an unbiased observer. But from what you\u2019ve told me and from what I witnessed tonight I would agree that Chessy is very unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed, closing her eyes. \u201cI wish I knew what to do.\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled gently at her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do except be there for her. Be her sounding board and her friend. Tate has to work this out between them. No one else can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help with the pie, Joss?\u201d Kylie asked.</p><p>Joss shook her head. \u201cYou go back to Chessy so she\u2019s not by herself. I\u2019ll bring in the plates and give her the biggest and first piece.\u201d</p><p>Kylie smiled at her friend. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Joss. I don\u2019t think I tell you often enough, but I love you.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s lips quivered and for a moment she was silent, as if composing herself. Stark emotion shone in Joss\u2019s eyes. Kylie felt a surge of guilt for not protecting her friendships better. Going forward she would absolutely. Joss and Chessy meant the world to her. It was time Kylie showed that and they knew it too.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Kylie. And I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re happy. Both of you,\u201d she said, including Jensen in her declaration.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Joss. Kylie makes me happy. I\u2019m a very lucky man.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity in his simple declaration hit her square in the heart and flooded her with profound happiness. She almost skipped to the living room. She was positively bouncing. Then as soon as her gaze landed on Chessy she felt guilt for being so disgustingly happy when her friend was so obviously miserable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel guilt for being happy, baby,\u201d Jensen murmured in her ear.</p><p>She swung her gaze upward, her mouth gaping. \u201cHow the hell do you do that?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDo what? Read your mind? It didn\u2019t take ESP to figure out what you were thinking. One minute you looked like you swallowed sunshine and as soon as you saw Chessy, your mouth drooped, you lost the smile and you looked guilty. Don\u2019t be, baby. You deserve to be happy and Chessy would be the first one to say so. She\u2019d never trade your happiness for her own.\u201d</p><p>Kylie shook her head in amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>Still shaking her head, Kylie went over to plop down beside Chessy. She wrapped her arm around her friend\u2019s shoulders and hugged her fiercely.</p><p>\u201cChin up, girlfriend. Isn\u2019t that what you always tell me? You always have such wonderful advice, so I\u2019m going to give you back some of what you\u2019ve always given me so freely. Don\u2019t let this get you down. You\u2019ll kick Tate\u2019s ass and then he\u2019ll grovel for your forgiveness, and you being you will forgive him and y\u2019all will live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>Chessy grinned. Some of the shadows lifted from her eyes and the sparkle was back. Kylie\u2019s heart surged with relief. This was Chessy. Not the shell of herself she\u2019d become lately. Chessy just . . . sparkled. But it was as Joss had said. She only sparkled when she was happy. Damn Tate\u2019s thick skull for not seeing his wife\u2019s unhappiness.</p><p>\u201cI swear you fall in love and then you become positively arrogant. I like it! It\u2019s so . . . you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the new me,\u201d Kylie said blithely. \u201cThe old me? Not so much. But she\u2019s gone now and I like the new me much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you both,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with the old you except you weren\u2019t happy. Now you are. That\u2019s the only difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, but I love you for saying so,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>Joss came sailing in and handed Chessy a plate with a huge piece of caramel pie. Dash appeared with two glasses of wine for Chessy and Kylie, and Chessy clinked her glass to Kylie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to kicking ass. Regardless of whose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>KYLIE\u2019S heart was a little heavier on the way home than when they\u2019d driven to Dash\u2019s and Joss\u2019s for dinner. But even concern for her friend couldn\u2019t dissipate her optimistic outlook on her future.</p><p>She slid her hand into Jensen\u2019s and rested them on the center console as he drove back to his\u2014their\u2014home. When had she started considering his home her own? She hadn\u2019t been back to her house more than a handful of times since Jensen had all but moved her into his house. Only to get clothes and other items she needed.</p><p>There had been absolutely no mention of her returning to her house. But neither had they directly addressed the issue of her moving in. Jensen had just hauled her into his house and informed her she was staying.</p><p>Wow, she really was mellowing with age and experience. Amusement gripped her as she imagined someone telling her a month ago that she and Jensen would be an item and that he\u2019d hauled her out of her office caveman-style and told her she wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>She would have laughed herself silly.</p><p>And yet, here she was, in love. Happy. Living with Jensen. Having sex.</p><p>She winced over the word sex. True, it was sex but it seemed a crass description of their lovemaking. She\u2019d never fully considered the difference between sex and \u201cmaking love.\u201d She\u2019d never had any reason to. And she certainly hadn\u2019t imagined herself having sex. With any man, but especially a man like Jensen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While her experience might be limited, she did know the difference between mindless sex and actually making love. It was silly of her to be having this argument, or rather, discussion with herself. The old Kylie wasn\u2019t into self-reflection or analysis and she certainly had never entertained the idea of making love.</p><p>And yet that was absolutely the right description for the intimacy she and Jensen had created. Sex was . . . Well, it was sex. Nothing more, nothing less. Making love involved so much more. Trust. Mutual respect. And well, love.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet, baby.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over to see Jensen give her a sideways glance as he turned into their neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said with a wry smile. \u201cI was pondering the differences between ha**g s*x and making love.\u201d</p><p>One of his eyebrows went up. \u201cDo tell. This sounds like an interesting conversation you were having with yourself.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m being silly and philosophical all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? Are you going to enlighten me or leave me ignorant of this epiphany you had?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand, enjoying just . . . being with him. Happy. She\u2019d never used the word happy so much in her entire life as she had these last weeks with Jensen.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that sex was not the right word for what we do,\u201d she said, a little embarrassed to get all \u201cgirly\u201d with him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t laugh, nor did he indicate she was in any way being silly. He squeezed her hand back and stroked his thumb over the back of her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time in my life I truly recognize the difference between ha**g s*x and making love.\u201d</p><p>Even as she said it, she wished she would have kept her mouth shut. She couldn\u2019t imagine him agreeing with her when both times he\u2019d been tied to the bed. Hardly the hallmark of traditional lovemaking. She was embarrassed and suddenly ashamed by the fact that she acknowledged her love for a man when she didn\u2019t trust him to make love to her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what is that look for?\u201d Jensen said quietly as he pulled into the drive and turned off the engine.</p><p>\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t said anything,\u201d she replied honestly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>There was obvious incredulity in his voice. He\u2019d turned sideways in his seat so he could see her more fully.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cBecause for all my declarations of love and trust, I haven\u2019t shown you either. Actions speak far louder than words and I doubt most people would consider you being tied to a bed \u2018making love.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just pissing me off,\u201d he said in a near growl.</p><p>She blinked, returning her gaze to him. He\u2019d never gotten angry with her. Oh, it was inevitable. What couple didn\u2019t argue or get pissed off at each other occasionally? But indeed he did look . . . pissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation in the f**king car,\u201d he said, opening his door. \u201cBut we are having it. Inside.\u201d</p><p>She hesitantly opened her door, instant agitation buzzing through her mind. Her heart fluttered and her pulse jumped up. As she got out, she swallowed back the fear that gripped her by the throat.</p> <p>She was being an idiot. No matter how angry Jensen became with her, he\u2019d never hurt her. She knew that. And yet at the first sign of his anger, her reaction had been one of wariness. Anger equaled violence in her world. The two had always gone hand in hand during her childhood. She hated arguing. Hated confrontations even though her prickly, bitchy persona would indicate differently.</p><p>Jensen waited for her in front of the car and she curled her fingers into her palms, wondering if she should reach for his hand. It\u2019s what she would have done anytime they\u2019d gone out and returned home. Only now she wasn\u2019t so certain even as she admonished herself for being such nitwit.</p><p>Jensen put his hand on her shoulder, his gaze intent as he stared down at her. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>There was such shocked recognition in his eyes that she flinched. She was making matters worse with every passing second.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. No, damn it, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head for emphasis but he didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t look at all like he believed her. Who could blame him? She\u2019d contradicted herself in just those few words she\u2019d spoken.</p><p>She closed her eyes and exhaled in a long rush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you, Jensen. I\u2019m afraid of anger. The repercussions of anger. It took me off guard. I haven\u2019t pissed you off yet, certainly not for lack of trying on my part,\u201d she said in disgust. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t expecting it. Had no time to steel myself or tell myself what an idiot I\u2019m being. Fear was my natural, instinctive reaction. I hate arguing. I hate confrontations. I\u2019d normally do anything at all to avoid them. And I know we\u2019ll argue. I don\u2019t expect us to be perfect. I don\u2019t even know why fear struck me the way it did. Well, I do know,\u201d she said, her voice trailing off.</p><p>\u201cCome inside with me, Kylie,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but also tender.</p><p>She glanced back up at him to see the warmth in his eyes. His sincerity. His love for her and his understanding.</p><p>He tugged her hand and guided her to the front door. Once inside, he directed her toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGet undressed for bed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk while I\u2019m holding you.\u201d</p><p>Relief fluttered through her throat and chest. They were okay. She was okay.</p><p>She changed into a pair of pajamas while he stripped down to his boxers. Then he climbed into bed, pulling back the covers and patting the spot beside him.</p><p>She went readily, snuggling up against his body. Her self-admonishment from earlier still rang in her mind. It was time to back her words with action. Prove to him that she did trust him. She could start by being more openly affectionate and willing to get close to him without coaxing.</p><p>\u201cNow, I want you to listen to me,\u201d he said in a firm voice.</p><p>He stroked one hand through her hair and then down her arm. His fingertips lightly grazed her skin, sending chill bumps dancing in their wake.</p><p>\u201cJust because my hands were tied to the bed during the act of our lovemaking, and yes, it is lovemaking, doesn\u2019t mean we had mindless sex. You gave me something very precious both times. Your trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that when I tied you up both times?\u201d she asked fretfully.</p><p>He squeezed her to him with one strong arm. \u201cBecause you went through with it. We made beautiful love. I came inside you. That\u2019s as beautiful as it gets, baby.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and deeply inhaled his scent, letting it surround and comfort her agitation.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI love you, Kylie. My love isn\u2019t conditional on how we have sex or if we have it for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by his body. \u201cI want to be normal, Jensen. I just don\u2019t know how to be.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, a slight ache in his voice. \u201cFuck normal. We\u2019ve already had this conversation and you already know my feelings on the subject.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes, enjoying him wrapped around her. Solid. So strong. Her rock.</p><p>For several long moments silence fell between them. A comfortable silence neither sought to end. And then she felt him tense slightly against her, as if he were preparing to say something.</p><p>She reared her head back, seeking out his gaze.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to talk to me, baby? About your past?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes swept her face intently, concern and love reflected in his expression.</p><p>Her breath hitched and her pulse sped up, as did her respirations. It was stupid, really. It was just words. Memories. They couldn\u2019t hurt her unless she let them.</p><p>And this was the last barrier between them. The last piece of the trust puzzle.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she quietly whispered. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her again and pressed an encouraging kiss on her forehead. \u201cTake your time. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She hugged his body to hers. It surprised her, that she wasn\u2019t on the verge of a panic attack over the idea of relating something so deeply personal. Something she had never confided in anyone. Not even Carson. She realized she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to unburden herself. Finally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d she said. Tears burned the edges of her eyes and she swallowed back the knot already forming in her throat.</p><p>\u201cAt the beginning. Or wherever you like. I\u2019m here to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always abusive,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t ever remember him not being. I can barely remember my mother, so I don\u2019t know if she was any better than he was. My feelings are influenced by the fact she left me and Carson with that asshole. How does a mother just leave like that?\u201d</p><p>Jensen tensed and she bit into her lip, sorry that she\u2019d made that remark so soon after Jensen had confided his own mother\u2019s desertion. She\u2019d never really considered just how much she and Jensen had in common. Two halves to a whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a distressed voice. The last thing she wanted was to pull Jensen back into his own past. Hers was bad enough.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, no. Don\u2019t apologize. You need to talk about this with someone who loves you. Someone who will listen. Tonight isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then squeezed her eyes tightly shut. The rest was . . . hard. Shame and a sense of degradation burned through her memories.</p><p>\u201cHe raped me for the first time when I was thirteen.\u201d</p><p>Jensen went rigid next to her. She curled her fingers into his chest, needing something solid, tangible. He slid his hand between them, splaying over hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd there was violence. So much violence,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNothing Carson and I ever did was right. When he was drunk, he always targeted Carson. But it was when he was completely sober that he directed his ire toward me. I could almost understand, well not really, but it would make more sense if he was just a mean drunk and he only became abusive when he was drinking. It was the vengeful targeting of me when he was fully cognizant of what he was doing that frightened me the most. It seemed so personal.</p><p>\u201cAt least with Carson it always seemed to be a case of Carson being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It\u2019s a sad testament that I felt safer as long as he was drinking.\u201d</p><p>Jensen kissed the top of her head, leaving his lips there pressed against her hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone this,\u201d she began. She started shaking, no longer able to keep the memories at bay. Manageable. They poured through her mind leaving inky darkness and pain in their wake.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Kylie?\u201d he gently coaxed. \u201cWhat haven\u2019t you ever told anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time when I seriously considered suicide.\u201d</p><p>Jensen sucked in his breath and then expelled it in long, shaky puffs. \u201cOh God, baby. I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry by yourself. Why have you never told anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it demonstrated just how weak I am,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cJust another shortcoming on my list. It was only the thought of leaving Carson behind by himself that kept me from doing it. Not that I didn\u2019t want to die. I did. So many times it would have been so easy to make it all stop. I was angry at my mom for leaving us and yet there I was thinking of doing the exact same thing to Carson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKylie, you aren\u2019t weak. It took a hell of a lot of courage and guts not to do it. To remain in that situation with no hope of getting out of it. You were just a child who thought you\u2019d never get out of your hell. I can\u2019t say I blame you for contemplating suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt broke Carson to know what our father was doing to me. I suppose he felt like you in some ways. Helpless to make it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling only too well,\u201d Jensen murmured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to discuss every sordid detail. There was no need to do that to either herself or Jensen. It was enough that he knew. That she\u2019d told him.</p><p>\u201cWhen and how did it end?\u201d Jensen asked, after her long silence.</p><p>\u201cCarson worked odd jobs and he saved up enough money for us to run. We left in the middle of the night while our father was passed out. I was so worried about Carson because our father had beaten him worse than usual. He had bruises, broken ribs. God only knows what else. But he got us out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Jensen asked softly. \u201cHow did you make it? How did you end up going to college, even?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were homeless for a while. While we had some money, we couldn\u2019t afford to use it for rent and who would rent something to two kids? We would have been turned over to the police and then sent back to our father. We had to eat and we used the money sparingly. Carson worked his way through college and I worked odd jobs to help. When he started working, he in turn helped me through college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you call yourself weak,\u201d Jensen said in bewilderment. \u201cHow could you ever think so? Do you even realize the kind of strength it took to survive, and then being homeless with no one to look out for you except each other? I don\u2019t know of many people who would have had that kind of resolve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see it the way you do,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave, courageous woman, Kylie. Never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby. Did you or Carson ever see him after that?\u201d</p><p>Kylie shook her head. \u201cNo, but Carson looked for him years later. I think he wanted revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame him,\u201d Jensen muttered. \u201cDid he find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never would say. I only found out because I saw the file he left open on his desk. When I asked him about it, well, you can imagine I freaked. That shouldn\u2019t surprise you. It\u2019s no wonder he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything. He likely worried I\u2019d go off my rocker and do something stupid. Who knows. Maybe I would have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut the kind of revenge Carson wanted wasn\u2019t the kind that would land you in jail on a manslaughter charge. He wouldn\u2019t have risked his marriage to Joss. He wanted to see if our father was living well because he wanted to ruin him. He wanted to take away everything he had, if he had anything at all. And he wanted our father to know who ruined him and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree that he shouldn\u2019t have given you the information,\u201d Jensen murmured. \u201cIt was your right and you wouldn\u2019t have done anything stupid. What Carson was negligent in realizing is that you might have gained some closure if you knew he wasn\u2019t a threat to you any longer.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. I think it\u2019s the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes. Like I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll pop up out of the blue. He could be dead by now for all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could find out for you if you ever truly wanted to know,\u201d Jensen said quietly.</p> <p>She froze, a curl of fear winding its way through her chest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day,\u201d she hedged. \u201cMaybe never. I just know I don\u2019t want to know right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, let me know. I\u2019ll make damn sure he knows nothing about you. And perhaps I can just verify whether Carson was successful in his quest for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>She felt . . . deflated . . . all of a sudden. Like a huge weight had been lifted, leaving her sagging. She was emotionally wrung out even though she\u2019d barely scratched the surface of her abuse. Maybe she\u2019d never tell Jensen the entirety of it. Or maybe one day she\u2019d be ready to completely rid herself of the poison that had infected her for so long.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome, baby. I love you. And I\u2019m so damn proud of you. Now you just have to be proud of yourself and see what a huge accomplishment it is for you to be where you are right now and for not letting your past overtake your future.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all that long ago that I was doing just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on yourself, Kylie. Lighten up. The only one knocking on you is you. Everyone else around you sees what I see. A resilient, fearless woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cFearless. Definitely at the top of the list of words I would have never used to describe myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen revise the damn list and remove all the derogatory words about you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She yawned, exhausted from the day\u2019s emotional events. \u201cMaybe we can make that list together one day. At the very top, the most important word to describe me, is loved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways. And you are loved, Kylie. By more than just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d she said, snuggling farther up against Jensen.</p><p>\u201cThink you can sleep?\u201d he asked, concern in his voice. \u201cI worry what this will do for you. I know what it did to me when I told you of my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re here, I can sleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>He hugged her to him. \u201cThen sleep, baby. I\u2019ll hold you for as long as you want me to.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>FEARS of Kylie being tormented by nightmares kept Jensen up long after Kylie settled into a fitful sleep. And when he finally followed suit, it wasn\u2019t Kylie who had nightmares.</p><p>Jensen stood, paralyzed, unable to move, unable to do anything but stare as his father struck Kylie again and again. His dreams, often of his mother being abused while Jensen was unable to prevent it, were now of Kylie in his mother\u2019s stead.</p> <p>He was watching through the eyes of an adult but trapped by a child\u2019s limitations.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cOh God, no. Stop hurting her. Please.\u201d</p><p>His father lifted his head and stared directly at Jensen, his mouth twisted into a cruel smile. \u201cYou\u2019re worthless. You can\u2019t protect her. You\u2019ve failed her just like you failed your idiot mother.\u201d</p><p>And then Kylie called his name. It was a plea for help, one he couldn\u2019t ignore even in his dream.</p><p>Finally, finally he was able to move. No longer was he encased by lead. No longer was he in the body of the child he was. He let out a roar and launched himself at his father as his adult self with all the strength he\u2019d lacked when he was just a boy.</p><p>He knocked his father away and then lunged for him, wrapping his hands around his father\u2019s throat. He\u2019d stop him this time. He\u2019d never hurt another woman. Jensen was no longer the helpless child he\u2019d been for so many years.</p><p>All his hatred and anger poured from him in black waves, giving him even more strength.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t fail his mother this time. He wouldn\u2019t fail Kylie.</p><p>He squeezed, watching his father\u2019s face go purple, his eyes bulging at the strain.</p><p>Kylie called out to him again, her voice desperate. Hoarse sounding. She was pleading with him. To stop?</p><p>Shock froze him. Why would Kylie beg for his father\u2019s life?</p><p>This time when she said his name, it was barely distinguishable and was accompanied by a whimper of pain. He struggled through the haze of the nightmare, confused by Kylie\u2019s actions.</p><p>And then, as if he\u2019d been doused by cold water, he roused from sleep.</p><p>Horror swept through him with agonizing speed. His hand was wrapped around Kylie\u2019s neck, his fingers digging into her skin. Tears streamed down her face as she struggled helplessly in his grasp. Desperately pulling at the hand around her neck.</p><p>Oh God, he was going to be sick.</p><p>He released her instantly and she fell away, holding her throat and gasping for breath. She coughed and choked, hunched over, her hair in disarray around her shoulders. She huddled on the very edge of the bed, pulling her legs up to her chest protectively. She rocked back and forth, her broken sobs ripped horrific wounds in his soul. Wounds he might never recover from. How could he?</p><p>\u201cKylie!\u201d</p><p>His agonizing cry of her name sounded much like a noise a wounded animal would make.</p><p>What had he done? How could he have done something so horrible? He\u2019d become the very monster both their fathers were.</p><p>\u201cKylie, oh my God, are you all right, baby?\u201d</p><p>He hovered over her, still shaking from the dream. He was afraid to touch her, but he had to offer her comfort.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, tears wetting his cheeks as he rocked her back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he choked out. \u201cOh God, baby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Despair settled over him, turning everything to black. Sorrow and regret weighed him down, hammering into his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d done the one thing he\u2019d sworn never to do. He\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>He was no better than his father. All the things he\u2019d said, all the things he\u2019d never imagined doing to another human being now battered him. The whispers in his mind, the ghosts from his past, taunted him. Mocked him and told him what a hypocrite he was.</p><p>He closed his eyes, his thoughts bleak as he realized the magnitude of what he\u2019d done. As he realized the consequences of what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Tears blurred his vision. Grief for what he\u2019d lost in the space of a few moments.</p><p>He had to let her go.</p><p>Kylie was stiff in his arms. She hadn\u2019t made a sound other than the low whimpers of fear. He wondered if she was even capable of speech after he\u2019d nearly choked her to death.</p><p>She\u2019d wear bruises tomorrow. Marks that he\u2019d put there.</p><p>He would never forgive himself for this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Kylie whispered.</p><p>Her hoarse words jerked him to awareness, away from the blackness of his thoughts.</p><p>He loosened his hold on her and pulled away, not meeting her gaze. He couldn\u2019t. There was nothing to say, no apology sincere enough for what he\u2019d done. No way for him to make this right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack your things and then I\u2019ll take you home,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Kylie flinched and her head flew up so he could see her wide, frightened eyes. Only now confusion had replaced the fear and uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He winced every time she spoke. She could barely talk in a loud enough tone for him to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home,\u201d he said, his gaze sliding away from her. He couldn\u2019t sit here and look at what he\u2019d lost. Couldn\u2019t face what he\u2019d done. It was a knife to his heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Her voice trembled and tears crowded her eyes, making them go glossy and wet.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be together, Kylie.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant the words to come out so forcefully. Or with such heat. But he was dying slowly, with every breath. All his pain came out in those damning words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving up on us?\u201d</p><p>The hurt in her voice poured more salt on his exposed wound.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jensen. And you\u2019re just quitting? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Kylie. Look at what I did,\u201d he all but roared. \u201cHow can you even consider being with a man like me? I could have killed you\u2014I tried to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose in his throat. God, she was trying to rationalize his behavior. His thoughts went to the woman he and Kylie had seen in the parking lot the other night. How she\u2019d explained away her husband or boyfriend\u2019s actions. And now Kylie was doing the same thing for him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t allow it. She deserved better than him.</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself, Kylie,\u201d he said in a cold voice. \u201cListen to you explain away my abuse. How you rationalize it. Get dressed while I get your stuff together. I\u2019ll take you home tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me,\u201d Kylie whispered, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cYou promised . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what did I promise?\u201d Jensen demanded. \u201cI promised never to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie turned away, presenting her shoulder to him. A shoulder that heaved with her quiet sobs as she began to dress.</p><p>It took Jensen half an hour to pack up all of Kylie\u2019s belongings. He shoved them into the trunk of his car and then went back for Kylie, who was now sitting on the sofa in the living room.</p><p>Her face was pale, her eyes red and ravaged by tears. Her hair was in disarray, tousled not only from sleep but from what he\u2019d done. His fingerprints shone on her neck, a stark reminder of how close he\u2019d come to killing her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>Kylie rose shakily on her feet. She still wouldn\u2019t look at him, something he was glad for. He had enough regret for both of them.</p><p>He got into the driver\u2019s seat as she slid in on the passenger side. The drive to her house was silent, the quiet oppressive and stifling. With every minute that ticked by his sorrow and self-loathing grew until he was certain he would be consumed with it.</p><p>He finally pulled into Kylie\u2019s driveway. He got out and headed to his trunk to retrieve all of her things. Stuff she\u2019d brought to his house. Stuff he\u2019d gotten used to being strewn all over his house.</p><p>He set everything inside her door, wanting to get this over with as quickly as possible. When he turned to go back to his car he nearly collided with Kylie. He put his hands on her shoulders to steady her and she wrenched herself from his grasp.</p><p>With a sigh, he headed toward his car, turning his back on her for good.</p><p>\u201cI would have never given up on us like you\u2019re doing,\u201d she called out.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, the accusation halting him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Kylie. Don\u2019t make it even harder than this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>He closed his eyes as his wounds began to bleed all over again. \u201cI love you too, Kylie, and that\u2019s why I have to go.\u201d</p><p>He fled toward his car, not waiting for her response. He couldn\u2019t take any more. He had to get away before he completely fell apart.</p><p>The drive home was a blur. Images of Kylie with his hand wrapped around her neck bombarded him left and right until he was dizzy. The huge knot in his gut grew.</p><p>He\u2019d never love another woman. Not the way he loved Kylie.</p><p>As soon as he pulled into his driveway, he threw open the door, bolted out and heaved his guts all over the front yard.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>KYLIE watched the sun creep over the horizon as she sat in a chair on her back deck, wrapped in a blanket. It was plenty warm, and yet a bone-deep chill had settled in. She had the fleeting thought that she might never be warm again.</p><p>Jensen gave her warmth with his smiles, his tenderness, his love. And now it and he were gone.</p><p>She wished she could muster the emotional strength to hate him. But all she could see was the desolation and horror in his eyes. The loathing and self-recrimination for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>She rubbed absently at her still sore throat where the bruises, shaped into fingerprints, had spread across her skin.</p><p>He could have killed her.</p><p>It was what he said and what she\u2019d pondered and yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe it. As soon as he\u2019d come out of the dream, he\u2019d released her. He wouldn\u2019t consciously ever hurt her. She believed that with all her heart. So why didn\u2019t he?</p><p>He\u2019d nagged at her about her self-confidence and yet he appeared not to have any himself. Or at least when it came to her.</p><p>She sighed and stared down at the paper in front of her. Her resignation letter, addressed to Dash. She wouldn\u2019t stick the knife deeper by including Jensen in her resignation.</p><p>Her laptop and phone lay on the table next to the letter. She\u2019d spent most of the night Googling and looking up mortgage companies and Realtors. She didn\u2019t need to get a mortgage. She had enough invested to buy a house with plenty left over. Besides, who would give her a mortgage when she was unemployed?</p><p>It was hours yet before any of the businesses would open. She hesitated a moment as the idea gripped her. She should go now and place the letter on Dash\u2019s desk. Before he or Jensen would come in this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The weekend was a blur. She\u2019d done nothing but lie in bed, covers up to her chin. In between bouts of crying. She hadn\u2019t eaten, hadn\u2019t slept. She\u2019d barely managed the feat of dragging herself to the bathroom to take care of the essentials.</p><p>Then her mind had sprung into recovery mode. She couldn\u2019t hide in her house forever. People got their hearts broken every day. She wasn\u2019t special in that regard. Life went on. The question was whether she was going to move on or be like she\u2019d always been in the past. Timid. Afraid. Stick her head back in the sand, adopting the mantra of \u201cignorance is bliss.\u201d</p><p>She knew two things. One, she couldn\u2019t continue working for Dash and Jensen. And two, she needed to move. It was an idea she\u2019d entertained in the past, but she\u2019d never wanted to expend the energy to do it.</p><p>Now the letter was typed, and she had the phone number of a local real estate company. It was time to act and to stop being so passive when it came to her life.</p> <p>Her muscles protested as she hauled herself to her feet. But she pushed back the discomfort, picked up the letter and went back inside the house to get dressed and grab her keys to the office.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, she placed the letter on Dash\u2019s desk along with today\u2019s to-do list. She felt a brief moment of guilt for doing this to Dash. He\u2019d never been anything but patient and understanding with her. He was a dream to work for. And quitting abruptly when they hadn\u2019t yet found her replacement wasn\u2019t fair to him. But she couldn\u2019t come in to work where Jensen would be and pretend her heart hadn\u2019t just been destroyed.</p><p>She then walked into her office and began packing up her belongings and personal effects.</p><p>When she was done, she turned, taking one last glance at the business her brother had built. The place she\u2019d worked ever since graduating college. Yes, she was good at her job. She would have made a damn good partner too. But there were other jobs out there. It was time to cut ties and let go and move on.</p><p>Carson was gone. He wasn\u2019t ever coming back. She wouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s burden any longer.</p> <p>With a sigh, she trudged toward the elevator. In the lobby, she waved at the night guard who looked at her curiously as she hoisted the box she was holding higher so she wouldn\u2019t drop it.</p><p>When she got home, she left the box in her car, uncaring if it came in or not. All she wanted was to go back to bed and stay there for a week. Maybe she would. Or at least until word spread about what happened and Chessy and Joss hunted her down.</p><p>She should call them. Tell them herself. But she couldn\u2019t make herself do it. There was nothing her friends could do anyway, other than give her a shoulder to cry on and tell her it was okay and that there were other fish in the sea.</p><p>Yeah, whatever.</p><p>She might not have a ton of experience in love and relationships, but even she knew that she\u2019d never find another love like Jensen.</p><p>She walked past the things Jensen had carried back into her house and into the kitchen. She glanced at the bottle of wine on the counter and shrugged. Why not?</p> <p>She poured herself a generous glass and started for the bedroom when she turned back and grabbed the bottle. It would save her a trip back later, and once she got into her bed, she wasn\u2019t coming back out for anyone.</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>\u201cYOU mind telling me what the hell this is about?\u201d Dash bellowed.</p><p>Jensen looked up tiredly as Dash waved a piece of paper in front of his nose. Jensen was in no mood for guessing games. He hadn\u2019t slept since Friday night. He had a hangover from hell, after doing something he never did. He\u2019d gotten rip-roaring drunk, and he\u2019d stayed that way the entire weekend.</p><p>Just more evidence that he was more like his father than he thought. Apparently the apple didn\u2019t fall too far from the tree.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you look like shit,\u201d Dash said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Jensen growled.</p><p>\u201cShe quit,\u201d Dash bit out as he put his hands on Jensen\u2019s desk and leaned forward.</p> <p>He shoved the letter of resignation where Jensen couldn\u2019t help but see it.</p><p>Despair blanketed Jensen, suffocating him. Blackness swirled, drowning him in sorrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her,\u201d Jensen said bleakly. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I\u2019d never do anything to make her go. I can work out of another office and leave the two of you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss went by her house today, worried sick when I told her Kylie had resigned. Kylie wasn\u2019t home. No one knows where the f**k she is. And she\u2019s put her goddamn house up for sale,\u201d Dash roared. \u201cWhat the f**k did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>Jensen closed his eyes. Tears burned his eyelids like acid.</p><p>\u201cI hurt her,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI swore I never would.\u201d</p><p>Dash sent him a puzzled look. \u201cHurt as in how?\u201d</p><p>Jensen shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that you not let her do this. Tell her I\u2019m cleared out. Do whatever you have to. I\u2019ll clean out my desk today. She can have my office or remain in hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, am I even going to have a business after all this?\u201d Dash demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a f**k about the goddamn business,\u201d Jensen growled. \u201cAll I care about is Kylie.\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cFor someone who says he hurt her, I\u2019d say you still care an awful lot about what she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care,\u201d Jensen raged. \u201cI love her. I\u2019ll never goddamn love anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the f**k are you here and not over there at her feet begging for forgiveness?\u201d Dash roared back.</p><p>Jensen surged to his feet, planting his palms down on the desk. He leaned forward so he was eye to eye with Dash.</p><p>\u201cBecause some things are unforgivable,\u201d Jensen choked out. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be taken back, can\u2019t be redone. No matter if she forgives me\u2014she likely would. I can\u2019t forgive myself. Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed. \u201cYeah, man. I get that. But Jensen? Here\u2019s a clue for you. You said you hurt her. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing now?\u201d</p><p>Jensen sank back into his chair and ran a hand through his hair. God, he was so tired. He wanted one night where he wasn\u2019t swallowed by the demons of his past. When he wasn\u2019t seeing his hands around Kylie\u2019s throat or hearing her calling his name.</p><p>He just wanted . . . peace. Was it too much to ask for?</p><p>But then how could he ever truly be at peace when the woman he loved was gone from his arms?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her quit, Dash,\u201d Jensen said, his weariness evident in his every word. \u201cWhatever you have to do in order to convince her. Do it. I\u2019ll be out by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>KYLIE patiently sat and listened to the dozen voice mail messages from Chessy, Joss and Dash. She sipped the strong coffee as she sat in the small caf\u00e9 in the neighborhood she was house hunting in.</p><p>Amazing how much more productive she was when she wasn\u2019t shitfaced drunk from all the wine she\u2019d consumed this week.</p><p>The lightbulb had gone on when she discovered she was completely out of wine. Then she\u2019d surveyed the bottles littering her kitchen in disgust. Enough of that already. A week was long enough to wallow in her misery. It was time to get on with the rest of her life.</p><p>She cringed when she listened to Dash\u2019s message. Jensen had cleared out his office and would be working out of another. Dash wanted Kylie to get her ass back to work and to call Joss before she lost her mind.</p><p>Guilt crept over her. She\u2019d avoided her friends\u2014everyone\u2014for the entire week. She\u2019d listened to the incessant ringing of the doorbell and the pounding. She bet the pounding came from Chessy. She was rather persistent when she put her mind to something. But the alcohol haze had made it impossible for her to do anything more than lie sprawled on her bed staring up at the ceiling, praying Joss and Chessy would give up and go away.</p><p>Though her house had gone on the market Monday, it wouldn\u2019t start showing until the following Monday. That\u2014and the realization of how much wine she\u2019d consumed\u2014had given her sufficient motivation to sober up and get her ass out of the house.</p><p>She listened to the rest of the messages but winced when she heard Joss begging her to call. There were tears in Joss\u2019s voice. Dash would kill Kylie for upsetting Joss this way. And she couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>She had to face them at some point. She couldn\u2019t hide forever. Jensen wasn\u2019t an integral component of her circle of friends. He\u2019d mainly become a part through Kylie. So it wasn\u2019t as if she had to worry about running across Jensen when she visited with her friends. She may have lost him, but she\u2019d be damned if she lost her friends too.</p><p>Her head ached vilely, the result of all the wine she\u2019d drunk. She could barely even remember the last five days.</p><p>What she wanted to do was run by the store, stock up on more wine and then retreat to her house and drink. A lot.</p><p>But what she needed to do was text Joss and Chessy and get it over with.</p><p>Sighing, she typed in a quick message to both.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to come over and spill. Any chance wine could be involved?</p><p>She hit Send and set her phone back on the small table. She knew she looked like hell. She\u2019d received more than one cursory stare by the other customers in the caf\u00e9. How was she supposed to look when she\u2019d been dumped by the man she loved and then spent the rest of the week in an alcoholic stupor?</p><p>Her phone chimed and she hesitantly reached for it.</p><p>Get your ass to my house stat. And yes, wine will be here. Can you come now?</p><p>That was from Joss. Before she could respond, Chessy chimed in.</p><p>I\u2019m coming right over! Give me fifteen at the most. Joss, you got enough wine or you want me to bring some?</p><p>Kylie smiled, some of the weight shifting from her heart.</p><p>I\u2019ve got it covered. Just get over here!</p><p>She punched in her response and hit Send.</p><p>I\u2019m on my way. Twenty minutes, depending on traffic.</p><p>She grabbed her keys, downed the last of her coffee and then headed for the door.</p><p>She was terrified. She wouldn\u2019t lie to herself about that. The idea of pouring out all of her despair to anyone made her stomach tighten. But she had to remember her promise to herself about being more open with her friends. Her best friends. They weren\u2019t just anyone. They were special.</p><p>She drove in tense silence. She\u2019d nearly put her fist through the dash when one of those sappy breakup songs started playing on her satellite radio. Silence, however unbearable, was still preferable to listening to her problems being sung in real time.</p><p>Twenty-two interminable minutes later, Kylie pulled into Joss\u2019s driveway and sat there a long moment, mustering the courage to go in. If she didn\u2019t get out soon, Chessy and Joss would both come out and drag her in by her hair.</p><p>She made herself get out of the car and walk to the door. She was almost there when the door flew open. Dash. Double ugh. Facing the girls was bad enough. Facing her boss too? Why hadn\u2019t she made it clear to Joss that this was a girls-only event?</p><p>Dash\u2019s stare was fixed on her and as she drew closer, he paled.</p><p>\u201cHe said he hurt you but I thought he meant emotionally,\u201d Dash said through clenched teeth. \u201cWhat the f**k did he do to you, Kylie? I\u2019ll kill him for this.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fluttered upward in an effort to hide the bruising on her throat. But it was too late. Dash had seen the marks on her pale skin.</p><p>Joss flew around Dash and plowed into Kylie just as she reached the top step. She wrapped her arms around Kylie and hugged her for dear life.</p><p>Kylie glanced up at Dash over Joss\u2019s shoulder to see him smoldering with rage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what is it then?\u201d Dash asked in an icy tone.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Dash. She\u2019ll tell me and Chessy and then if anyone needs their ass kicked we\u2019ll sic you on it,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>Kylie nearly wilted in relief. God she loved her friends. Why had she avoided them all week? She could have been here days ago, wrapped in the love and support of her best friends instead of being at home drunk off her ass, alone and miserable.</p><p>Joss took Kylie by the hand and dragged her past Dash and into the house. Dash didn\u2019t look pleased, but he bit back any response and allowed Joss to have her way. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cStay out of our hair for a while, darling,\u201d Joss called back to Dash. \u201cThis is girls\u2019 night and the girls\u2019 code is \u2018what happens in the circle stays in the circle\u2019 and \u2018no men allowed.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dash rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the bedroom watching TV. But I expect a report later. I\u2019m not letting it drop, Joss. If that son of a bitch put his hands on her, I\u2019ll take him apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when he gets all alpha,\u201d Joss whispered to Kylie. \u201cIt makes me want to go jump his bones right now.\u201d</p><p>Kylie groaned. \u201cSeriously, Joss? I just got dumped and you\u2019re taunting me with Dash\u2019s alpha maleness. So not fair.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s face wrinkled in sympathy. \u201cHe ended it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no talking until y\u2019all get in here so I can hear,\u201d Chessy complained as the two women entered the living room.</p><p>Chessy rose from her perch on the couch and ran over, throwing her arms around Kylie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever scare us like that again,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cJoss and I were so worried, Kylie. What happened, sweetie? You look terrible!\u201d</p><p>Then she backed away, her gaze drifting over Kylie\u2019s face and neck. Joss and Chessy both gasped.</p><p>\u201cDid he do that to you?\u201d Chessy choked out.</p><p>Kylie sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a really long story, guys. Can we sit down and open a bottle\u2014or three\u2014of wine? I\u2019m going to need it for this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cComing right up,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>\u201cI need at least three glasses in me before the bloodletting starts,\u201d Kylie muttered.</p><p>\u201cThen drink up and make it fast because we want every single detail,\u201d Chessy warned.</p><p>Joss returned a moment later, a bottle of wine in both hands. Glasses were already sitting on the coffee table. Joss poured, filling all the glasses, and then she handed one to Kylie.</p> <p>She drank thirstily, draining the glass in seconds. Joss arched one eyebrow but quickly poured Kylie another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s times like these that I wonder if we shouldn\u2019t have something a little stronger,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>\u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to get shitfaced, I suggest we raid Dash\u2019s liquor cabinet,\u201d Chessy said.</p><p>Joss frowned. \u201cIf we are getting shitfaced, then neither of you is leaving tonight. I\u2019ll give your keys to Dash and you\u2019ll have to go through him before you leave.\u201d</p><p>Kylie and Chessy groaned, but gave up their keys. Joss left to give them to Dash and then returned to the living room.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so what shall it be?\u201d Joss asked dramatically as she opened the liquor cabinet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the old saying?\u201d Chessy mused. \u201cBeer before liquor, never sicker? Liquor before beer, never fear? Does that apply to wine as well?\u201d</p><p>Kylie frowned. She was already fuzzy from the two hastily downed glasses of wine she\u2019d had. \u201cWould wine be substituted for beer or liquor? And does that mean I\u2019m going to puke my brains out because I drank liquor after wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, we\u2019ll all be puking our brains out later,\u201d Chessy said dryly. \u201cCome on, Joss. Just pick something so we can move on.\u201d</p><p>Joss shrugged and then reached in, pulling out two bottles of liquor. She plunked them down on the coffee table and then retrieved shot glasses from the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI vote we pour them all now,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cIf we\u2019re pouring after imbibing a lot, we\u2019re going to totally make a mess in Joss\u2019s living room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cPour them up, Joss.\u201d</p><p>Joss carefully lined up a dozen shot glasses and then began filling them all.</p><p>Chessy picked two up and handed one to Kylie. She handed the other to Joss and then retrieved another from the coffee table for herself. She held up her glass to Joss and Kylie.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to men are assholes,\u201d Chessy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink as long as we exclude Dash from that statement,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>Chessy rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s been an as**ole before. And he\u2019ll be one again before it\u2019s all over with. Just drink with us, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed and then they clinked their glasses together.</p> <p>Then they tossed the alcohol back.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes watered, her nose burned, and she nearly choked as fire ripped down her throat and into her belly.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s horrible!\u201d Kylie sputtered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink it because it\u2019s good,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cYou drink it for what it does. Give her another, Joss. We have to loosen up her tongue.\u201d</p><p>Joss thrust another glass into Kylie\u2019s hand and then Joss and Chessy directed her to drink it.</p><p>The second went down a little better than the first. Thank God.</p><p>She leaned back against the couch so her stomach would settle and to allow the alcohol to take control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the week shitfaced,\u201d Kylie admitted.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, I wish you would have answered your damn door,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cYou should never have to drink alone. I\u2019m more than willing to be your drinking buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kylie said lamely. \u201cI had to work some things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike quitting your job and putting your house up for sale?\u201d Joss demanded.</p><p>Kylie winced. \u201cYeah, those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth happened, Kylie? And how the hell did you get those bruises?\u201d Chessy asked.</p><p>Kylie closed her eyes, trying to hold the tears at bay. They burned her eyelids. She thought she\u2019d cried herself out and that she didn\u2019t have any more tears to shed. Apparently she was wrong.</p><p>Joss and Chessy descended, each taking a position on either side of her. Chessy wrapped one arm around her while Joss gently pushed Kylie\u2019s hair from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us, Kylie. We\u2019ve been so worried,\u201d Joss said in her sweet, loving voice.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me on purpose,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cHe\u2019d never do that. I know it but he doesn\u2019t. Or at least he doesn\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense, hon. Slow down and start from the beginning,\u201d Chessy prompted.</p><p>Kylie sighed but did as her friends asked. She spilled the entire sorry tale starting from when she confided her past to Jensen to the present. She didn\u2019t spare herself any in the telling. She told them she\u2019d spent the week in the wine bottle crying her eyes out.</p><p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Joss breathed. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one for sure, sweetie. Poor Jensen. I can\u2019t imagine how he felt when he woke up to see his hands wrapped around your neck. Dash would die if he ever did something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cJensen would never do anything to hurt me. It was a dream\u2014a nightmare. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. But he just shut me out. He couldn\u2019t dump me fast enough. How the hell do you convince someone they\u2019re wrong if they won\u2019t stick around to talk to you about it?\u201d</p><p>They were all silent for a moment and Chessy reached for the bottle, pouring them each another shot.</p><p>Kylie gratefully downed it, hoping for the numbness to settle in soon. A balm to the ache in her soul. At least for a little while she\u2019d feel nothing but the warm buzz of alcohol. And to think she\u2019d always loathed the idea of getting drunk. This week had taught her a lot about her old ideas and ways.</p><p>She handed her glass to Chessy and motioned for another.</p><p>By the time the fourth shot had been consumed, Kylie was definitely feeling the effects. So why the hell was she still crying and sniffling like an idiot?</p><p>She flopped back onto the couch again and stared up at the ceiling, waiting for it to spin.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d Kylie said, despair creeping into her voice once more. \u201cI\u2019ve never been an optimist. I was conditioned at a very young age to expect the worst. It\u2019s certainly all I ever received. And yet I didn\u2019t see this coming and I should have. I was so sure that Jensen was the one. I was so caught up in the joy of overcoming so much and being able to be in a relationship that I never even gave thought to the idea that we wouldn\u2019t be together. And that was so stupid of me. Maybe later I\u2019ll be able to blame it on being in love for the first time in my life. No wonder I never dated. Who the hell would want to go through this every time you split up with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Chessy muttered.</p><p>Kylie turned her head so she could see her friend, even though at the moment there were two Chessys.</p><p>\u201cHow are you and Tate?\u201d</p><p>Chessy made a face. \u201cFine. Not fine. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel guilt for being so damn happy,\u201d Joss said mournfully.</p><p>Kylie reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t. You deserve to be happy. You\u2019ve certainly had your share of hell.\u201d</p><p>They drank another shot. And then another for the hell of it. Somewhere in the midst of finishing the first bottle, they ended up on the floor in front of the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cDo you know your ceiling is spinning?\u201d Chessy asked Joss.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the ceiling. It\u2019s your brain,\u201d Kylie said sagely.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about Jensen?\u201d Joss said, pushing the topic back to Kylie\u2019s situation.</p><p>Anger surged through Kylie. It was the first time she\u2019d felt pissed. Really pissed. She\u2019d experienced a lot of varying emotions the last week. Mostly sadness, grief, but not true anger.</p><p>It hit her like a freight train, clouding her mind until all she saw was red.</p><p>How dare he just give up on them? He was willing to put up with her issues and give her as long as it took to get over them. To work through them. Did he expect her to back off the minute his issues overrode hers?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed,\u201d Kylie said, though it sounded like it came from someone else across the room.</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d Chessy said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Joss said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWait. What are we pissed about?\u201d Chessy asked in a puzzled tone.</p><p>\u201cJensen,\u201d Kylie supplied.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d Chessy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat gives him the right to just give up on us like that?\u201d Kylie demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Joss encouraged.</p><p>\u201cHe was all willing to tie himself to the bed for me. To give me as long as it took to work past my issues. Does he expect me to tuck tail and run the minute his issues rear their head?\u201d</p><p>Kylie sat straight up and promptly regretted it. The room spun crazily around her and she had to close her eyes so she wouldn\u2019t throw up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she exclaimed when she got her bearings. \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d Joss and Chessy chorused.</p><p>Kylie smacked herself on the forehead and then sagged backward with a groan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be careful there,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cYou may knock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to share your epiphany with us?\u201d Joss prompted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tie his ass to the bed,\u201d Kylie announced. \u201cWait. First I\u2019m going to make him make love to me. Without the damn rope. But after? When we\u2019re ready to go to sleep? That\u2019s when I\u2019ll tie him up,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cBut that could just be the alcohol talking. You\u2019re going to have to explain, hon. I\u2019m a little stupid when I\u2019m drinking.\u201d</p><p>Joss and Kylie both chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHe made this big deal out of me tying him to the bed when we make love. So I\u2019d know he couldn\u2019t hurt me. So I\u2019d know I was safe. Okay, so the reason he dumped me, or at least the reason he gave me for dumping me, was because he was afraid of hurting me. So if I tie him to the bed while he\u2019s asleep and he has a nightmare, voila! He can\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said smugly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a f**king genius,\u201d Chessy said in admiration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>\u201cUh, maybe we should let up on the alcohol,\u201d Chessy advised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to sober up now,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>Kylie pushed herself upward again, holding herself up with one hand so she didn\u2019t keel over onto Chessy.</p><p>\u201cBecause when I sober up, I\u2019m going over to his house. If he thinks he can just dump me for my own good and make me miserable in the process, he\u2019s got another think coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, ladies? Not to interrupt what has to be scintillating conversation, but do you realize what time it is, that you\u2019ve been drinking for the last several hours and that you\u2019re all lying on the floor?\u201d</p><p>Heads turned in the direction of Dash\u2019s voice. Joss sent him a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d she said in a dreamy voice. \u201cHave you come to take me to bed?\u201d</p><p>Dash chuckled. \u201cSince I don\u2019t imagine any of you are going to make it to bed unless I carry you, I think it\u2019s safe to say I have come to take you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Kylie scowled. \u201cI can\u2019t go to bed now. I have a seduction to plan. Hey, Dash. You\u2019re a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to f**k so,\u201d Dash said in amusement.</p><p>She pointed a finger at him. \u201cSo if a woman throws herself at you\u2014naked\u2014you\u2019re not going to say no, right?\u201d</p><p>Dash chuckled. \u201cI think that depends on which woman throws herself at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Joss said. \u201cI\u2019ll kick someone\u2019s ass if they ever throw themselves at you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, honey. It\u2019s not going to happen. Now, are you girls done for the night? Kylie, perhaps you should get some rest so, uh, your seduction plan doesn\u2019t go awry. You may also want to revisit the issue when you\u2019re sober. You may decide that was the alcohol talking.\u201d</p><p>Kylie made a face. \u201cWhat a downer you are, Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed. \u201cAre y\u2019all ready for bed? Chessy, you and Kylie can share the guest bed. It\u2019s a queen so y\u2019all will have plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>Chessy said glumly, \u201cI spend so many nights alone these days that having someone in bed with me will be a novelty. Even if it is just Kylie.\u201d</p><p>Dash leaned over Kylie and slid his arms underneath her body. He hoisted her up, and her stomach lurched. Oh God, please, please don\u2019t let her puke all over Dash. There was only so much humiliation she could take.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Kylie settled in. I think she\u2019s a little more shitfaced than the two of you are,\u201d he said to Joss. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to get the rest of you once I get Kylie to bed.\u201d</p><p>Joss waved her hand in the air like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. And why would she? She had a wonderful husband who loved her to pieces.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t love Joss so much it would be so easy to hate her.</p><p>Dash walked into the guest bedroom and deposited Kylie onto the bed. Then he went into the bathroom and returned with a plastic basin that he set on the floor beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cIf you need to puke, just lean over the bed,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou might have trouble getting to the bathroom in time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Dash,\u201d she murmured. \u201cJoss is such a lucky bitch.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s chuckle was the last thing she heard before it was lights-out and she was out cold.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>KYLIE\u2019S head felt like someone had hit her with a sledgehammer. Her mouth was dry and the mere thought of alcohol made her want to vomit.</p><p>At the time it had seemed like a good idea. Now? Not so much.</p><p>Dash had let them all sleep in and when they got up and stumbled into the kitchen looking like death warmed over, Dash served them breakfast and some foul-tasting concoction he swore would cure a hangover.</p><p>He so lied.</p><p>She slowly got out of her car, glancing over again for the reassurance that Jensen was here because his car was. Lucky for her, she still had a key, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about his doing what she had done and not answering the door.</p><p>It was Saturday. No work. And it was early enough that Jensen could still be in bed.</p><p>That thought considerably cheered her. It would certainly make her planned seduction easier to pull off.</p><p>She shook her head at that crazy thought. Her a seductress? Someone was probably laughing their ass off in heaven over that.</p><p>She paused at his front door and waffled on whether to use the key or knock.</p><p>The element of surprise was important, so the key it was.</p><p>She slid it into the lock, trying to make as little noise as possible. Then she eased the door open and peered inside.</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>When she got to the entrance to the living room, she froze, taking in the scene before her.</p><p>Jensen was sprawled on the couch, head back, either sound asleep or passed out. Judging by the bottles lying around, passed out was probably a good bet.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t such a familiar sight, Kylie might have mustered some outrage.</p><p>How pitiful they both were. Obviously miserable apart. It was a damn good thing one of them had sense. This crap was going to end right now.</p><p>\u201cJensen. Jensen!\u201d she said louder. \u201cWake your ass up.\u201d</p><p>She walked closer and then bent down to get in his face. \u201cWake up, Jensen!\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fluttered sluggishly and then he seemed to realize who was standing over him in his living room.</p><p>\u201cDream,\u201d he muttered. \u201cToo much to drink. Fuck me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dream. More like a nightmare, but we\u2019ll work on that,\u201d Kylie said in amusement.</p><p>He blinked again and then rubbed an arm across his eyes. Then he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Good to see you too, Jensen. How\u2019s life been treating you? Wait, don\u2019t answer that. I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty obvious judging by all the empty liquor bottles.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in closer so she was right over his face and she scowled big.</p><p>\u201cSo help me God, if you aren\u2019t able to get it up because you\u2019re too hungover, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth fell open and she caught a whiff of his breath. Okay, she could work with his. It wasn\u2019t too strong, so she imagined it had been hours since he drank. Possibly even last night and then he\u2019d slept it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Jensen demanded. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be here. We\u2019re over, Kylie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d she said with a sneer. \u201cYou might even convince yourself before it\u2019s over. But I know it\u2019s a lie and you damn well know it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asked in bewilderment.</p><p>She touched his cheek and stared him directly in the eye so he\u2019d see how serious she was.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Jensen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s not you I don\u2019t trust. It\u2019s me. Goddamn it, Kylie, why are you making this so f**king hard? Was it so you could see how miserable I am? Well, take a good look. This is me without you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted on the spot. The aching vulnerability in his voice undid her.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cProve what?\u201d</p><p>He was sounding more irritated by the minute and she had to act fast before he threw her out of his house. Again.</p><p>\u201cThat you trust me,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to prove. I trust you more than anyone else on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come into the bedroom with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Kylie. Please don\u2019t ask me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to trust me, Jensen. You said you did. Now show me. Please,\u201d she added, the word sounding strangled.</p><p>\u201cFine. We go into the bedroom. Then will you leave me the f**k alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so desperate to get rid of me, Jensen? Does your version of love mean forgetting someone you love, or supposedly love, so quickly?\u201d</p><p>He surged up from the couch, his eyes glittering dangerously. Before? Such an action would have her terrified and dissolving into a panic attack. But now? She was so relieved to have at least a part of the old Jensen back and not this pathetic, grieving man who\u2019d drunk himself into oblivion.</p><p>She\u2019d done the same. If she hadn\u2019t had her head stuck so far up her ass she could have had her epiphany a hell of a lot sooner and neither one of them would have had to be miserable all damn week.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever question my love for you,\u201d he seethed. \u201cIt\u2019s because I love you that I want you as far away from me as possible.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring that particular outburst, and happy to have him on his feet so she didn\u2019t have to try and get him up by herself, she took his hand and led him toward the bedroom.</p><p>When they got there, she turned, placing her hands on his chest and looking him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cRemember what you said. About trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Jensen said in a tight voice.</p><p>She nodded and then turned back toward the bed and began stripping out of her clothes. She whispered a short prayer that this worked out the way she hoped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Kylie? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off, his mouth falling open when she turned to him, fully nude.</p><p>He closed his eyes and let out a groan. \u201cWhy are you torturing me like this?\u201d</p><p>She slid her fingers down his chest and down to the fly of his jeans. Then she leaned up and pressed her mouth to his.</p><p>At first, he didn\u2019t respond. He held himself rigidly as she explored his mouth. Then his lips parted, a rush of air escaping. Slowly his arms crept around her, anchoring her in place.</p><p>She ripped her mouth away, gulping for breath. Then she kissed the lobe of his ear and whispered softly, \u201cMake love to me, Jensen. Really make love to me. No rope. Just you and me.\u201d</p><p>A groan escaped his mouth. The sound seemed to come from his very soul. It was a sound of agony\u2014and need.</p><p>\u201cYou said you trusted me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cGive me this, Jensen. Trust me. Make love to me.\u201d</p><p>He walked her backward toward the bed, ripping at his own clothing until he was as na**d as she was. He certainly wanted her. His body couldn\u2019t lie about that. No matter what he said or thought, he was as desperate for her as she was for him.</p><p>The backs of her legs bumped into the bed and then she toppled back, landing on the mattress with him on top of her.</p><p>\u201cBe sure this is what you want, baby,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it at any time, say stop. I\u2019ll stop, no matter how hard it is.\u201d</p><p>She stroked a hand over his face, tracing the hard lines of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop, Jensen.\u201d</p><p>He let out a groan and then dipped his head to kiss her. He kissed her hungrily, all of his need pouring out in a heated rush. His body was hard and heavy on top of her and she reveled in the feel.</p><p>His erection was lodged between her legs. She could feel him hard and pulsing against her clit. She shifted restlessly, wanting, needing. She didn\u2019t want to wait. She wanted him inside her. She wanted to feel complete and whole for the first time in a week.</p><p>\u201cJensen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMake love to me. Now, please.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her demand and kissed a line down her body. He licked and tongued her nipples, coaxing them to aching, straining peaks. He took his time, tasting and sucking until she was out of her mind with need.</p><p>Then he continued down her body, stopping at her navel to tease and torment her with his tongue. Her fingers dug into his shoulders and she pushed him downward, hoping he\u2019d get the point.</p><p>He laughed softly but complied with her silent request. He pressed a kiss to the top of her curls at the apex of her legs. Her thighs automatically loosened and spread, inviting him to explore her most sensitive region.</p><p>He petted and stroked with his fingers before finally spreading her soft folds. His breath huffed out, making her twitch. Her entire body tightened in anticipation, waiting for when he would give her what she wanted.</p><p>Then his tongue flicked over her cl*tand she arched up, a gasp escaping her lips. He lapped again before gently sucking the nub into his mouth.</p><p>She moaned helplessly. Sobs spilled from her throat. Desperate sobs of need. So much need. She\u2019d missed him. Never had she felt this kind of connection to another human being. She was lost without him. She had an ache in her soul only he could assuage.</p><p>He put his mouth over her entrance and then slid his tongue inside, f**king in and out of her with his tongue. He kissed and sucked until she was mindless. She called his name over and over, a broken plea for him to make love to her a litany on her tongue.</p><p>Finally, finally, he rose above her, fitting his body to hers as he stared down at her with those intense dark eyes. She searched his gaze for what he was feeling. If he was as desperate as she was. If he\u2019d missed her even half as much as she\u2019d missed him.</p><p>What she saw burning in the depths of those eyes took her breath away and filled her with hope.</p><p>She saw love. Still love. It hadn\u2019t left. He still loved her. They could work this out. He loved her and she loved him. She refused to countenance any other possibility.</p><p>They belonged together.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jensen asked, still poised at the rim of her entrance.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI want you, Jensen. I\u2019ve been so lonely and empty without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby. Me too. If you only knew how miserable I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do something about it,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMake us both whole again.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her in his arms, holding her close just as he pressed inward. She moaned in delight as he pushed even further. She tilted her h*ps upward as much as she could, inviting him deeper.</p><p>His entire body was tense. His muscles coiled and twitched with the agony of holding back his control.</p><p>She dug her nails into his shoulders and then lifted her head to whisper in his ear, \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me, Jensen. I trust you. I love you. Don\u2019t hold back. Not with me. Show me who you really are. Because that\u2019s the person I love.\u201d</p><p>Her words shattered what control he had. An agonized groan tore from his mouth just as he thrust forward, sinking himself as deeply as he could go.</p><p>His body arched over hers, cupped protectively over and around her. He held her tightly, their bodies undulating in perfect rhythm. She lifted her legs to wrap around him, holding him close to her so no distance separated them.</p><p>He rose and then sank, over and over, her body clutching greedily at him each time he withdrew. She was slick around him, there was no doubt that she wanted him every bit as much as he wanted her.</p><p>Their passion grew to a fever pitch. It was quick. But then they\u2019d been without one another for far too long. Their bodies and souls were on fire. Two halves to a whole, finally back together. She would never let him go. No matter what he said or what he tried to do, she wouldn\u2019t let him go. If she had to follow him to the ends of the earth, he was hers and she wasn\u2019t letting go. Never.</p><p>She kissed him desperately, her rising orgasm making her crazy with need. Their mouths worked hot over one another\u2019s, tongues sliding deep, dueling and then tasting. The sounds of their bodies and mouths slapping together were the only sounds in the room. They moved as one in perfect synchronicity.</p><p>They were one.</p><p>Better together than alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you there, baby?\u201d Jensen asked gruffly. \u201cI want you there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said, expelling a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m there. Take us both over, Jensen.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand between them, sliding his thumb over her cl*tas he thrust hard and deep. A kaleidoscope of color and feeling exploded in her vision and through her body.</p><p>Her gaze locked with his, not wanting to miss a single thing in his eyes as he orgasmed. The eyes didn\u2019t lie. They were an open window to his soul.</p><p>And what she saw in those dark depths filled her with joy and relief.</p><p>He loved her. He wanted her. He missed her with his every breath.</p><p>He wrapped himself around her and then hurled them both over the edge, carrying her as they fell. She felt like a leaf in autumn, windblown and scattered here and there. Blowing with the wind.</p><p>She drifted slowly downward, dizzy and content, until she settled back onto the bed, Jensen\u2019s warm body covering hers protectively.</p><p>He buried his head in her neck and she could feel him trying to catch up, his breaths ragged, his chest heaving.</p><p>She ran her hands up and down his back, idly caressing him as he pulsed deeply within her. Finally, she felt complete. After so many days of being lost she was finally home. Right where she belonged.</p><p>But she still had one thing left to do.</p><p>She turned, trying to move Jensen\u2019s weight off her and to the side. When he realized her intent, he swiftly rolled them both onto their sides.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby, was I hurting you?\u201d he asked in concern.</p><p>She put a finger to his lips to shush him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his inquisitive look, she crawled out of bed, her heart beating violently. This was the moment of truth. If he refused her, she didn\u2019t know what to do. This had to work. She had to convince him of her faith.</p><p>She pulled the rope out of his drawer and returned to the bed, ignoring his look of confusion. Before she could chicken out and before he realized what she was doing, she quickly looped the rope around his left hand and secured it to the bed.</p><p>Satisfied with the knot, she settled back onto the bed and curled back up against him, utterly sated and content. And she waited for the inevitable question to come.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Kylie?\u201d Jensen asked, a perplexed look knitting his forehead.</p><p>She breathed out a deep breath and looked him directly in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo one trusts you more than I do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to trust yourself with me. I don\u2019t need you tied to the bed in order to make love to you. I just proved that to you and myself. However, I propose that at least until you are as certain as I am about you never hurting me, that we tie you to the bed while we sleep. That way even if you have a nightmare, you can\u2019t possibly hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Jensen looked utterly overcome. Tears glittered brightly in his eyes. Eyes full of love and . . . relief.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said in a choked voice.</p> <p>She snuggled into his arms and he threw his right arm around her, holding her as tightly as he could. He buried his face in her hair and his body shook. Tears burned her own eyes as she held on to him fiercely. Relief was so profound that she was weak with it. They were going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said rawly. \u201cI love you so much, Kylie. I\u2019ll never love anyone as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He finally let her go only enough so he could see her face. She reached up to wipe the tears from his face and he did the same to her.</p><p>\u201cYou really think this can work?\u201d he asked hesitantly. \u201cYou have to understand, Kylie. That night . . . Oh God, that night was the best and worst night of my life. The best because you trusted me enough to open up about your past. And then the worst . . . You can\u2019t imagine how I felt when I woke up to see my hand around your neck, to know I was hurting you, something I\u2019d sworn never to do. It sickened me. All I could think about was getting you as far away from me as possible so I could never hurt you again. I\u2019d die before ever doing that, baby.\u201d</p><p>She stroked his face lovingly. \u201cOh yes, this will work. We\u2019ll make it work. We\u2019ll do what we have to do.\u201d She sucked in her breath and gathered her courage. \u201cYou once told me I should get help, and you were right. But I think . . .\u201d She let out another long breath. \u201cI think we should both get help\u2014counseling\u2014together. We\u2019ll work through it together. Take it one day at a time. And we\u2019ll see how things play out. But what I won\u2019t do is stay away from you over some ridiculous fear of you hurting me. I only feel safe when I\u2019m with you. I know you\u2019d never purposely hurt me, Jensen. Now you have to believe it too.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her hand, pulled it to his lips and pressed a kiss into her palm. His breath puffed out erratically over her hand as he tried to regain his composure to respond.</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever had as much faith in me as you,\u201d he said, his voice breaking with emotion.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one has ever believed in me as much as you do,\u201d she returned. \u201cIt only stands to reason that since we\u2019re both such fucked-up individuals that we stick together and be fucked-up together. We understand each other, Jensen. Who else would ever understand us and love us as much as we do?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, relief rolling off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cI like that. Fucked-up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we back together then?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>He squeezed her tightly and then kissed her on the mouth. \u201cHell yes we\u2019re back together. I guess I just needed you to kick my ass for me. And I agree. I think we would both benefit from counseling. I don\u2019t want to ever be in a position to hurt you again, so I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that.\u201d</p><p>Relief surged through her heart and soul until she was weak with it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only better when I\u2019m with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou make me believe, Jensen. You make me believe I can have a normal life and a normal relationship. You make me have so much hope for the future. But only with you. I don\u2019t want those things except with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I found you,\u201d Jensen said in awe. \u201cYou\u2019re so f**king perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed a lot for me, Jensen. The unselfishness of your actions still blows me away. You denied an essential part of yourself for me. How can I do anything but fight for you\u2014for us\u2014with my dying breath?\u201d</p><p>He gently caressed her face, love glittering warmly in his eyes. \u201cIt was no sacrifice, Kylie. The reason I was never willing to give up control before was because I\u2019d never met a woman who made me want to. I want to do this for you. It\u2019s an honor and a gift and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I will always put you and your needs above my own. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, her heart swelling until she felt near to bursting.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby. Thank God you had enough strength and resolve for both of us. Thank God you didn\u2019t give up on us as I was willing to do. This last week has been the most miserable of my entire life. I never want to go through the pain of losing you again.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced wryly. \u201cI have a confession to make. There are as many empty wine bottles in my house as there are liquor bottles here. And well, Chessy, Joss and I put a serious dent in Dash\u2019s liquor cabinet last night. I\u2019m as hungover as you are, maybe even more.\u201d</p><p>Pain filled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. In my effort not to hurt you, I only hurt you more. I\u2019m sorry for that. If you give me the chance, I\u2019ll prove to you that I\u2019ll never willingly hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFor both of us. It\u2019s in the past. Now all we can look forward to is a future brighter than the sun. Giving in to you was the best thing I ever did and I\u2019ll never regret a single minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way, baby.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew more serious as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cCan you tolerate my dominant ways? Because they will assert themselves, Kylie. When it comes to you and your protection and care I simply don\u2019t know any other way to be. But in bed? I will always give you control for as long as you need it. But when we\u2019re out of bed, I\u2019ll want to take over. Can you handle that?\u201d</p><p>Her heart softened at the uncertainty in his eyes. \u201cOh yeah, I can handle that,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI like your bossy ways. You and they have grown on me. And one day . . .\u201d She sucked in a breath before plunging ahead. \u201cOne day I hope to give you control when we\u2019re in bed.\u201d</p><p>Fire lit in his eyes. He caressed her cheek with his free hand. \u201cIf that ever happens, just know that I will cherish you and treat you with the utmost care and tenderness. I never want to make you regret giving me such a precious gift.\u201d</p><p>Their mouths met, their tongues tangled and Jensen rolled to his back, taking Kylie with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes gleamed and he kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bound and helpless so I think it\u2019s time you took full advantage of your man and made love to him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound joyous and carefree. So much love filled her heart, banishing the darkness of the past week. Jensen was hers and she was his. They still had a lot to work through, but she knew in her heart that they\u2019d get through it together.</p><p>With his love, she could be the person she\u2019d always wanted to be and have the life she\u2019d always wanted to live. What could be better than that?</p><p>And then she proceeded to do exactly as Jensen had asked. She made love to her man. </p> </body></html>"]
