Alarmed, he eased back, but before he could try again, there was a bang that made him jerk by reflex, smacking his head against the Perspex. It hadn\u2019t been a bullet, though; the off tyre had blown, and a sickening tilt looped them off the runway, bumping and jolting into the grass.</p><p>There was a strong smell of petrol, and Jerry popped the Spitfire\u2019s hood and hopped out in panic, envisioning imminent incineration, just as the last plane of Green flight roared past him and took wing, its engine fading to a buzz within seconds.</p><p>A mechanic was pelting down from the hangar to see what the trouble was, but Jerry\u2019d already opened Dolly\u2019s belly and the trouble was plain: the fuel line was punctured. Well, thank Christ he hadn\u2019t got into the air with it, that was one thing, but he grabbed the line to see how bad the puncture was, and it came apart in his hands and soaked his sleeve nearly to the shoulder with high-test petrol. Good job the mechanic hadn\u2019t come loping up with a lit cigarette in his mouth.</p> <p>He rolled out from under the plane, sneezing, and Gregory the mechanic stepped over him.</p><p>\u2018Not flying her today, mate,\u2019 Greg said, squatting down to look up into the engine, and shaking his head at what he saw.</p><p>\u2018Aye, tell me something I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He held his soaked sleeve gingerly away from his body. \u2018How long to fix her?\u2019</p><p>Greg shrugged, eyes squinted against the cold wind as he surveyed Dolly\u2019s guts.</p><p>\u2018Half an hour for the tyre. You\u2019ll maybe have her back up tomorrow, if the fuel line\u2019s the only engine trouble. Anything else we should be looking at?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Aye, the left wing-gun trigger sticks sometimes. Gie\u2019 us a bit o\u2019 grease, maybe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll see what the canteen\u2019s got in the way of leftover dripping. You best hit the showers, Mac. You\u2019re turning blue.\u2019</p><p>He was shivering, right enough, the rapidly evaporating petrol wicking his body heat away like candlesmoke. Still, he lingered for a moment, watching as the mechanic poked and prodded, whistling through his teeth.</p><p>\u2018Go on, then,\u2019 Greg said in feigned exasperation, backing out of the engine and seeing Jerry still there. \u2018I\u2019ll take good care of her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, I know. I just\u2014aye, thanks.\u2019 Adrenaline from the aborted flight was still surging through him, thwarted reflexes making him twitch. He walked away, suppressing the urge to look back over his shoulder at his wounded plane.</p><p>Jerry came out of the pilots\u2019 WC half an hour later, eyes stinging with soap and petrol, backbone knotted. Half his mind was on Dolly, the other half with his mates. Blue and Green were up this morning, Red and Yellow resting. Green flight would be out over Flamborough Head by now, hunting.</p> <p>He swallowed, still restless, dry-mouthed by proxy, and went to fetch a cup of tea from the canteen. That was a mistake; he heard the gremlins laughing as soon as he walked in and saw Sailor Malan.</p><p>Malan was Group Captain and a decent bloke overall. South African, a great tactician\u2014and the most ferocious, most persistent air fighter Jerry\u2019d seen yet. Rat terriers weren\u2019t in it. Which was why he felt a beetle skitter briefly down his spine when Malan\u2019s deep-set eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u2018Lieutenant!\u2019 Malan rose from his seat, smiling. \u2018The very man I had in mind!\u2019</p><p>The Devil he had, Jerry thought, arranging his face into a look of respectful expectancy. Malan couldn\u2019t have heard about Dolly\u2019s spot of bother yet, and without that, Jerry would have scrambled with A squadron on their way to hunt 109s over Flamborough Head. Malan hadn\u2019t been looking for Jerry; he just thought he\u2019d do, for whatever job was up. And the fact that the Group Captain had called him by his rank, rather than his name, meant it probably wasn\u2019t a job anyone would volunteer for.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to worry about what that might be, though; Malan was introducing the other man, a tallish chap in army uniform with dark hair and a pleasant, if sharp, look about him. Eyes like a good sheepdog\u2019s, he thought, nodding in reply to Captain Randall\u2019s greeting. Kindly, maybe, but he won\u2019t miss much.</p><p>\u2018Randall\u2019s come over from Ops at Ealing,\u2019 Sailor was saying over his shoulder. He hadn\u2019t waited for them to exchange polite chat, but was already leading them out across the tarmac, heading for the Flight Command offices. Jerry grimaced and followed, casting a longing glance downfield at Dolly, who was being towed ignominiously into the hangar. The rag doll painted on her nose was blurred, the black curls partially dissolved by weather and spilled petrol. Well, he\u2019d touch it up later, when he\u2019d heard the details of whatever horrible job the stranger had brought.</p><p>His gaze rested resentfully on Randall\u2019s neck, and the man turned suddenly, glancing back over his shoulder as though he\u2019d felt the stress of Jerry\u2019s regard. Jerry felt a qualm in the pit of his stomach, as half-recognised observations\u2014the lack of insignia on the uniform, that air of confidence peculiar to men who kept secrets\u2014gelled with the look in the stranger\u2019s eye.</p><p>Ops at Ealing, my Aunt Fanny, he thought. He wasn\u2019t even surprised, as Sailor waved Randall through the door, to hear the Group Captain lean close and murmur in his ear, \u2018Careful\u2014he\u2019s a funny bugger.\u2019</p> <p>Jerry nodded, stomach tightening. Malan didn\u2019t mean Captain Randall was either humorous or a Freemason. \u2018Funny bugger\u2019 in this context meant only one thing. MI6.</p><p>Captain Randall was from the secret arm of British Intelligence. He made no bones about it, once Malan had deposited them in a vacant office and left them to it.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re wanting a pilot\u2014a good pilot,\u2019 he added with a faint smile, \u2018to fly solo reconnaissance. A new project. Very special.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Solo? Where?\u2019 Jerry asked warily. Spitfires normally flew in four-plane flights, or in larger configurations, all the way up to an entire squadron, sixteen planes. In formation, they could cover one another to some extent against the heavier Heinkels and Messerschmitts. But they seldom flew alone by choice.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll tell you that a bit later. First\u2014are you fit, do you think?\u2019</p><p>Jerry reared back a bit at that, stung. What did this bloody boffin think he\u2014Then he caught a glance at his reflection in the windowpane. Eyes red as a mad boar\u2019s, his wet hair sticking up in spikes, a fresh red bruise spreading on his forehead, and his blouson stuck to him in damp patches where he hadn\u2019t bothered to dry off before dressing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Extremely fit,\u2019 he snapped. \u2018Sir.\u2019</p><p>Randall lifted a hand half an inch, dismissing the need for sirs.</p><p>\u2018I meant your knee,\u2019 he said mildly.</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Jerry said, disconcerted. \u2018That. Aye, it\u2019s fine.\u2019</p> <p>He\u2019d taken two bullets through his right knee a year before, when he\u2019d dived after a 109 and neglected to see another one that popped out of nowhere behind him and peppered his arse.</p><p>On fire, but terrified of bailing out into a sky filled with smoke, bullets, and random explosions, he\u2019d ridden his burning plane down, both of them screaming as they fell out of the sky, Dolly I\u2019s metal skin so hot it had seared his left forearm through his jacket, his right foot squelching in the blood that filled his boot as he stamped the pedal. Made it, though, and had been on the sick-and-hurt list for two months. He still limped very noticeably, but he didn\u2019t regret his smashed patella; he\u2019d had his second month\u2019s sick leave at home\u2014and wee Roger had come along nine months later.</p><p>He smiled broadly at the thought of his lad, and Randall smiled back in involuntary response.</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\u2019re all right to fly a long mission, then?\u2019</p><p>Jerry shrugged. \u2018How long can it be in a Spitfire? Unless you\u2019ve thought up a way to refuel in the air.\u2019 He\u2019d meant that as a joke, and was further disconcerted to see Randall\u2019s lips purse a little, as though thinking whether to tell him they had.</p> <p>\u2018It is a Spitfire ye mean me to fly?\u2019 he asked, suddenly uncertain. Christ, what if it was one of the experimental birds they heard about now and again? His skin prickled with a combination of fear and excitement. But Randall nodded.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yes, certainly. Nothing else is manoeuvrable enough, and there may be a good bit of ducking and dodging. What we\u2019ve done is to take a Spitfire II, remove one pair of wing guns, and refit it with a pair of cameras.\u2019</p><p>\u2018One pair?\u2019</p><p>Again, that slight pursing of lips before Randall replied.</p><p>\u2018You might need the second pair of guns.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. Aye. Well, then ...\u2019</p> <p>The immediate notion, as Randall explained it, was for Jerry to go to Northumberland, where he\u2019d spend two weeks being trained in the use of the wing cameras, taking pictures of selected bits of landscape at different altitudes. And where he\u2019d work with a support team who were meant to be trained in keeping the cameras functioning in bad weather. They\u2019d teach him how to get the film out without ruining it, just in case he had to. After which ...</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t tell you yet exactly where you\u2019ll be going,\u2019 Randall said. His manner through the conversation had been intent, but friendly, joking now and then. Now all trace of joviality had vanished; he was dead serious. \u2018Eastern Europe is all I can say just now.\u2019</p><p>Jerry felt his inside hollow out a little and took a deep breath to fill the empty space. He could say no. But he\u2019d signed up to be an RAF flier, and that\u2019s what he was.</p><p>\u2018Aye, right. Will I\u2014maybe see my wife once, before I go, then?\u2019</p><p>Randall\u2019s face softened a little at that, and Jerry saw the Captain\u2019s thumb touch his own gold wedding ring in reflex.</p><p>\u2018I think that can be arranged.\u2019</p><p>Marjorie MacKenzie\u2014Dolly, to her husband\u2014opened the blackout curtains. No more than an inch ... well, two inches. It wouldn\u2019t matter; the inside of the little flat was dark as the inside of a coal scuttle. London outside was equally dark; she knew the curtains were open only because she felt the cold glass of the window through the narrow crack. She leaned close, breathing on the glass, and felt the moisture of her breath condense, cool near her face. Couldn\u2019t see the mist, but felt the squeak of her fingertip on the glass as she quickly drew a small heart there, the letter J inside.</p><p>It faded at once, of course, but that didn\u2019t matter; the charm would be there when the light came in, invisible but there, standing between her husband and the sky.</p> <p>When the light came, it would fall just so, across his pillow. She\u2019d see his sleeping face in the light: the jackstraw hair, the fading bruise on his temple, the deep-set eyes, closed in innocence. He looked so young, asleep. Almost as young as he really was. Only twenty-two; too young to have such lines in his face. She touched the corner of her mouth but couldn\u2019t feel the crease the mirror showed her\u2014her mouth was swollen, tender, and the ball of her thumb ran across her lower lip, lightly, to and fro.</p><p>What else, what else? What more could she do for him? He\u2019d left her with something of himself. Perhaps there would be another baby\u2014something he gave her, but something she gave him, as well. Another baby. Another child to raise alone?</p><p>\u2018Even so,\u2019 she whispered, her mouth tightening, face raw from hours of stubbled kissing; neither of them had been able to wait for him to shave. \u2018Even so.\u2019</p><p>At least he\u2019d got to see Roger. Hold his little boy\u2014and have said little boy sick up milk all down the back of his shirt. Jerry\u2019d yelped in surprise, but hadn\u2019t let her take Roger back; he\u2019d held his son and petted him until the wee mannie fell asleep, only then laying him down in his basket and stripping off the stained shirt before coming to her.</p><p>It was cold in the room, and she hugged herself. She was wearing nothing but Jerry\u2019s string vest\u2014he thought she looked erotic in it, \u2018lewd,\u2019 he said, approving, his Highland accent making the word sound really dirty\u2014and the thought made her smile. The thin cotton clung to her br**sts, true enough, and her ni**les poked out something scandalous, if only from the chill.</p><p>She wanted to go crawl in next to him, longing for his warmth, longing to keep touching him for as long as they had. He\u2019d need to go at eight, to catch the train back; it would barely be light then. Some puritanical impulse of denial kept her hovering there, though, cold and wakeful in the dark. She felt as though if she denied herself, her desire, offered that denial as sacrifice, it would strengthen the magic, help to keep him safe and bring him back. God knew what a minister would say to that bit of superstition, and her tingling mouth twisted in self-mockery. And doubt.</p><p>Still, she sat in the dark, waiting for the cold blue light of the dawn that would take him.</p><p>Baby Roger put an end to her dithering, though; babies did. He rustled in his basket, making the little waking-up grunts that presaged an outraged roar at the discovery of a wet nappy and an empty stomach, and she hurried across the tiny room to his basket, br**sts swinging heavy, already letting down her milk. She wanted to keep him from waking Jerry, but stubbed her toe on the spindly chair, and sent it over with a bang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was an explosion of bedclothes as Jerry sprang up with a loud \u2018FUCK!\u2019 that drowned her own muffled \u2018Damn!\u2019 and Roger topped them both with a shriek like an air-raid siren. Like clockwork, old Mrs Munns in the next flat thumped indignantly on the thin wall.</p><p>Jerry\u2019s naked shape crossed the room in a bound. He pounded furiously on the partition with his fist, making the wallboard quiver and boom like a drum. He paused, fist still raised, waiting. Roger had stopped screeching, impressed by the racket.</p><p>Dead silence from the other side of the wall, and Marjorie pressed her mouth against Roger\u2019s round little head to muffle her giggling. He smelled of baby scent and fresh pee, and she cuddled him like a large hot-water bottle, his immediate warmth and need making her notions of watching over her men in the lonely cold seem silly.</p><p>Jerry gave a satisfied grunt and came across to her.</p> <p>\u2018Ha,\u2019 he said, and kissed her.</p><p>\u2018What d\u2019ye think you are?\u2019 she whispered, leaning into him. \u2018A gorilla?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he whispered back, taking her hand and pressing it against him. \u2018Want to see my banana?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dzie dobry.\u2019</p><p>Jerry halted in the act of lowering himself into a chair, and stared at a smiling Frank Randall.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, aye,\u2019 he said. \u2018Like that, is it? Niech sie pan odpierdoli.\u2019 It meant, \u2018Fuck off, sir,\u2019 in formal Polish, and Randall, taken by surprise, broke out laughing.</p><p>\u2018Like that,\u2019 he agreed. He had a wodge of papers with him, official forms, all sorts, the bumf, as the pilots called it\u2014Jerry recognised the one you signed that named who your pension went to, and the one about what to do with your body if there was one and anyone had time to bother. He\u2019d done all that when he signed up, but they made you do it again, if you went on special service. He ignored the forms, though, eyes fixed instead on the maps Randall had brought.</p><p>\u2018And here\u2019s me thinkin\u2019 you and Malan picked me for my bonny face,\u2019 he drawled, exaggerating his accent. He sat and leaned back, affecting casualness. \u2018It is Poland, then?\u2019 So it hadn\u2019t been coincidence, after all\u2014or only the coincidence of Dolly\u2019s mishap sending him into the building early. In a way, that was comforting; it wasn\u2019t the bloody Hand of Fate tapping him on the shoulder by puncturing the fuel line. The Hand of Fate had been in it a good bit earlier, putting him in Green flight with Andrej Kolodziewicz.</p><p>Andrej was a real guid yin, a good friend. He\u2019d copped it a month before, spiralling up away from a Messerschmitt. Maybe he\u2019d been blinded by the sun, maybe just looking over the wrong shoulder. Left wing shot to hell, and he\u2019d spiralled right back down and into the ground. Jerry hadn\u2019t seen the crash, but he\u2019d heard about it. And got drunk on vodka with Andrej\u2019s brother after.</p><p>\u2018Poland,\u2019 Randall agreed. \u2018Malan says you can carry on a conversation in Polish. That true?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can order a drink, start a fight, or ask directions. Any of that of use?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The last one might be,\u2019 Randall said, very dry. \u2018But we\u2019ll hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u2019</p><p>The MI6 agent had pushed aside the forms and unrolled the maps. Despite himself, Jerry leaned forward, drawn as by a magnet. They were official maps, but with markings made by hand\u2014circles, X\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s like this,\u2019 Randall said, flattening the maps with both hands. \u2018The Nazis have had labour camps in Poland for the last two years, but it\u2019s not common knowledge among the public, either home or abroad. It would be very helpful to the war effort if it were common knowledge. Not just the camps\u2019 existence, but the kind of thing that goes on there.\u2019 A shadow crossed the dark, lean face\u2014anger, Jerry thought, intrigued. Apparently, Mr. MI6 knew what kind of thing went on there, and he wondered how.</p><p>\u2018If we want it widely known and widely talked about\u2014and we do\u2014we need documentary evidence,\u2019 Randall said matter-of-factly. \u2018Photographs.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019d be four of them, he said, four Spitfire pilots. A flight\u2014but they wouldn\u2019t fly together. Each one of them would have a specific target, geographically separate, but all to be hit on the same day.</p><p>\u2018The camps are guarded, but not with anti-aircraft ordnance. There are towers, though; machine-guns.\u2019 And Jerry didn\u2019t need telling that a machine-gun was just as effective in someone\u2019s hands as it was from an enemy plane. To take the sort of pictures Randall wanted would mean coming in low\u2014low enough to risk being shot from the towers. His only advantage would be the benefit of surprise; the guards might spot him, but they wouldn\u2019t be expecting him to come diving out of the sky for a low pass just above the camp.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t try for more than one pass, unless the cameras malfunction. Better to have fewer pictures than none at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 He\u2019d reverted to \u2018sir,\u2019 as Group Captain Malan was present at the meeting, silent but listening intently. Got to keep up appearances.</p> <p>\u2018Here\u2019s the list of the targets you\u2019ll practise on in Northumberland. Get as close as you think reasonable, without risking\u2014\u2019 Randall\u2019s face did change at that, breaking into a wry smile. \u2018Get as close as you can manage with a chance of coming back, all right? The cameras may be worth even more than you are.\u2019</p><p>That got a faint chuckle from Malan. Pilots\u2014especially trained pilots\u2014were valuable. The RAF had plenty of planes now, but nowhere near enough pilots to fly them.</p><p>He\u2019d be taught to use the wing cameras and to unload the film safely. If he was shot down but was still alive and the plane didn\u2019t burn, he was to get the film out and try to get it back over the border.</p><p>\u2018Hence the Polish.\u2019 Randall ran a hand through his hair, and gave Jerry a crooked smile. \u2018If you have to walk out, you may need to ask directions.\u2019 They had two Polish-speaking pilots, he said\u2014one Pole and a Hungarian who\u2019d volunteered, and an Englishman with a few words of the language, like Jerry.</p><p>\u2018And it is a volunteer mission, let me reiterate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, I know,\u2019 Jerry said irritably. \u2018Said I\u2019d go, didn\u2019t I? Sir.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did.\u2019 Randall looked at him for a moment, dark eyes unreadable, then lowered his gaze to the maps again. \u2018Thanks,\u2019 he said softly.</p><p>The canopy snicked shut over his head. It was a dank, damp Northumberland day, and his breath condensed on the inside of the Perspex hood within seconds. He leaned forward to wipe it away, emitting a sharp yelp as several strands of his hair were ripped out. He\u2019d forgotten to duck. Again. He shoved the canopy release with a muttered oath and the light brown strands that had caught in the seam where the Perspex closed flew away, caughtup by the wind. He closed the canopy again, crouching, and waiting for the signal for takeoff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The signalman wig-wagged him, and he turned up the throttle, feeling the plane begin to move.</p><p>He touched his pocket automatically, whispering, \u2018Love you, Dolly,\u2019 under his breath. Everyone had his little rituals, those last few moments before takeoff. For Jerry MacKenzie, it was his wife\u2019s face and his lucky stone that usually settled the worms in his belly. She\u2019d found it in a rocky hill on the Isle of Lewis, where they\u2019d spent their brief honeymoon\u2014a rough sapphire, she said, very rare.</p><p>\u2018Like you,\u2019 he\u2019d said, and kissed her.</p><p>No need for worms just the now, but it wasn\u2019t a ritual if you only did it sometimes, was it? And even if it wasn\u2019t going to be combat today, he\u2019d need to be paying attention.</p> <p>He went up in slow circles, getting the feel of the new plane, sniffing to get her scent. He wished they\u2019d let him fly Dolly II, her seat stained with his sweat, the familiar dent in the console where he\u2019d slammed his fist in exultation at a kill\u2014but they\u2019d already modified this one with the wing cameras and the latest thing in night sights. It didn\u2019t do to get attached to the planes, anyway; they were almost as fragile as the men flying them, though the parts could be reused.</p><p>No matter; he\u2019d sneaked out to the hangar the evening before and done a quick rag doll on the nose to make it his. He\u2019d know Dolly III well enough by the time they went into Poland.</p><p>He dived, pulled up sharp, and did Dutch rolls for a bit, wig-wagging through the cloud layer, then complete rolls and Immelmanns, all the while reciting Malan\u2019s Rules to focus his mind and keep from getting airsick.</p><p>The Rules were posted in every RAF barracks now: the Ten Commandments, the fliers called them\u2014and not as a joke.</p><p>TEN OF MY RULES FOR AIR FIGHTING, the poster said in bold black type. Jerry knew them by heart.</p> <p>\u2018Wait until you see the whites of his eyes,\u2019 he chanted under his breath. \u2018Fire short bursts of one to two seconds only when your sights are definitely \u201cON.\u201d \u2019 He glanced at his sights, suffering a moment\u2019s disorientation. The camera wizard had relocated them. Shite.</p><p>\u2018Whilst shooting, think of nothing else, brace the whole of your body: have both hands on the stick: concentrate on your ring sight.\u2019 Well, away to f**k, then. The buttons that operated the camera weren\u2019t on the stick; they were on a box connected to a wire that ran out the window; the box itself was strapped to his knee. He\u2019d be bloody looking out the window anyway, not using sights\u2014unless things went wrong and he had to use the guns. In which case ...</p><p>\u2018Always keep a sharp lookout. \u201cKeep your finger out.\u201d \u2019 Aye, right, that one was still good.</p><p>\u2018Height gives you the initiative.\u2019 Not in this case. He\u2019d be flying low, under the radar, and not be looking for a fight. Always the chance one might find him, though. If any German craft found him flying solo in Poland, his best chance was likely to head straight for the sun and fall in. That thought made him smile.</p><p>\u2018Always turn and face the attack.\u2019 He snorted and flexed his bad knee, which ached with the cold. Aye, if you saw it coming in time.</p><p>\u2018Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.\u2019 He\u2019d learnt that one fast. His body often was moving before his brain had even notified his consciousness that he\u2019d seen something. Nothing to see just now, nor did he expect to, but he kept looking by reflex.</p> <p>\u2018Never fly straight and level for more than thirty seconds in the combat area.\u2019 Definitely out. Straight and level was just what he was going to have to do. And slowly.</p><p>\u2018When diving to attack, always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as a top guard.\u2019 Irrelevant; he wouldn\u2019t have a formation\u2014and that was a thought that gave him the cold grue. He\u2019d be completely alone, no help coming if he got into bother.</p><p>\u2018INITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.\u2019 Yeah, they did. What meant something in reconnaissance? Stealth, Speed, and Bloody Good Luck, more like. He took a deep breath, and dived, shouting the last of the Ten Commandments so it echoed in his Perspex shell.</p><p>\u2018Go in quickly\u2014Punch hard\u2014GET OUT!\u2019</p><p>Rubbernecking, they called it, but Jerry usually ended a day\u2019s flying feeling as though he\u2019d been cast in concrete from the shoulder blades up. He bent his head forward now, ferociously massaging the base of his skull to ease the growing ache. He\u2019d been practising since dawn, and it was nearly teatime. Ball bearings, set, for the use of pilots, one, he thought. Ought to add that to the standard equipment list. He shook his head like a wet dog, hunched his shoulders, groaning, then resumed the sector-by-sector scan of the sky around him that every pilot did religiously, three hundred and sixty degrees, every moment in the air. All the live ones, anyway.</p><p>Dolly\u2019d given him a white silk scarf as a parting present. He didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d managed the money for it and she wouldn\u2019t let him ask, just settled it round his neck inside his flight jacket. Somebody\u2019d told her the Spitfire pilots all wore them, to save the constant collar chafing, and she meant him to have one. It felt nice, he\u2019d admit that. Made him think of her touch when she\u2019d put it on him. He pushed the thought hastily aside; the last thing he could afford to do was start thinking about his wife, if he ever hoped to get back to her. And he did mean to get back to her.</p><p>Where was that bugger? Had he given up?</p><p>No, he\u2019d not; a dark spot popped out from behind a bank of cloud just over his left shoulder and dived for his tail. Jerry turned, a hard, high spiral, up and into the same clouds, the other after him like stink on shite. They played at dodgem for a few moments, in and out of the drifting clouds\u2014he had the advantage in altitude, could play the coming-out-of-the-sun trick, if there was any sun, but it was autumn in Northumberland and there hadn\u2019t been any sun in days ...</p> <p>Gone. He heard the buzzing of the other plane, faintly, for a moment\u2014or thought he had. Hard to tell above the dull roar of his own engine. Gone, though; he wasn\u2019t where Jerry\u2019d expected him to be.</p><p>\u2018Oh, like that, is it?\u2019 He kept on looking, ten degrees of sky every second; it was the only way to be sure you didn\u2019t miss any\u2014A glimpse of something dark, and his heart jerked along with his hand. Up and away. It was gone then, the black speck, but he went on climbing, slowly now, looking. Wouldn\u2019t do to get too low, and he wanted to keep the altitude ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cloud was thin here, drifting waves of mist, but getting thicker. He saw a solid-looking bank of cloud moving slowly in from the west, but still a good distance away. It was cold, too; his face was chilled. He might be picking up ice if he went too hi\u2014There.</p><p>The other plane, closer and higher than he\u2019d expected. The other pilot spotted him at the same moment and came roaring down on him, too close to avoid. He didn\u2019t try.</p><p>\u2018Aye, wait for it, ye wee bugger,\u2019 he murmured, hand tight on the stick. One second, two, almost on him\u2014and he buried the stick in his balls, jerked it hard left, turned neatly over, and went off in a long, looping series of barrel rolls that put him right away out of range.</p><p>His radio crackled and he heard Paul Rakoczy chortling through his hairy nose.</p> <p>\u2018Kurwa twoja mac! Where you learn that, you Scotch f**ker?\u2019</p><p>\u2018At my mammy\u2019s tit, dupek,\u2019 he replied, grinning. \u2018Buy me a drink, and I\u2019ll teach it to ye.\u2019</p><p>A burst of static obscured the end of an obscene Polish remark, and Rakoczy flew off with a wig-wag of farewell. Ah, well. Enough skylarking, then; back to the f**king cameras.</p><p>Jerry rolled his head, worked his shoulders and stretched as well as could be managed in the confines of a II\u2019s cockpit\u2014it had minor improvements over the Spitfire I, but roominess wasn\u2019t one of them\u2014had a glance at the wings for ice\u2014no, that was all right\u2014and turned farther inland.</p><p>It was too soon to worry over it, but his right hand found the trigger that operated the cameras. His fingers twiddled anxiously over the buttons, checking, rechecking. He was getting used to them, but they didn\u2019t work like the gun triggers; he didn\u2019t have them wired in to his reflexes yet. Didn\u2019t like the feeling, either. Tiny things, like typewriter keys, not the snug feel of the gun triggers.</p> <p>He\u2019d had the left-handed ones only since yesterday; before that, he\u2019d been flying a plane with the buttons on the right. Much discussion with Flight and the MI6 button-boffin, whether it was better to stay with the right, as he\u2019d had practice already, or change for the sake of his cack-handedness. When they\u2019d finally got round to asking him which he wanted, it had been too late in the day to fix it straight off. So he\u2019d been given a couple of hours\u2019 extra flying time today, to mess about with the new fix-up.</p><p>Right, there it was. The bumpy grey line that cut through the yellowing fields of Northumberland like a perforation, same as you might tear the countryside along it, separating north from south as neat as tearing a piece of paper. Bet the emperor Hadrian wished it was that easy, he thought, grinning, as he swooped down along the line of the ancient wall.</p><p>The cameras made a loud clunk-clunk noise when they fired. Clunk-clunk, clunk-clunk! Okay, sashay out, bank over, come down ... clunk-clunk, clunk-clunk ... He didn\u2019t like the noise, not the same satisfaction as the vicious short Brrpt! of his wing guns. Made him feel wrong, like something gone with the engine ... Aye, there it was coming up, his goal for the moment.</p><p>Mile-castle 37.</p><p>A stone rectangle, attached to Hadrian\u2019s Wall like a snail on a leaf. The old Roman legions had made these small, neat forts to house the garrisons that guarded the wall. Nothing left now but the outline of the foundation, but it made a good target.</p><p>He circled once, calculating, then dived and roared over it at an altitude of maybe fifty feet, cameras clunking like an army of stampeding robots. Pulled up sharp and hared off, circling high and fast, pulling out to run for the imagined border, circling up again ... and all the time his heart thumped and the sweat ran down his sides, imagining what it would be like when the real day came.</p> <p>Mid-afternoon, it would be, like this. The winter light just going, but still enough to see clearly. He\u2019d circle, find an angle that would let him cross the whole camp and please God, one that would let him come out of the sun. And then he\u2019d go in.</p><p>One pass, Randall had said. Don\u2019t risk more than one, unless the cameras malfunction.</p><p>The bloody things did malfunction, roughly every third pass. The buttons were slippery under his fingers. Sometimes they worked on the next try; sometimes they didn\u2019t.</p><p>If they didn\u2019t work on the first pass over the camp, or didn\u2019t work often enough, he\u2019d have to try again.</p><p>\u2018Niech to szlag,\u2019 he muttered, Fuck the Devil, and pressed the buttons again, one-two, one-two. \u2018Gentle but firm, like you\u2019d do it to a lady\u2019s privates,\u2019 the boffin had told him, illustrating a brisk twiddle. He\u2019d never thought of doing that ... Would Dolly like it? he wondered. And where exactly did you do it? Aye, well, women did come with a button, maybe that was it\u2014but then, two fingers? ... Clunk-clunk. Clunk-clunk. Crunch.</p><p>He reverted to English profanity, and smashed both buttons with his fist. One camera answered with a startled clunk! but the other was silent.</p><p>He poked the button again and again, to no effect. \u2018Bloody f**king arse-buggering ...\u2019 He thought vaguely that he\u2019d have to stop swearing once this was over and he was home again\u2014bad example for the lad.</p><p>\u2018FUCK!\u2019 he bellowed, and ripping the strap free of his leg, he picked up the box and hammered it on the edge of the seat, then slammed it back onto his thigh\u2014visibly dented, he saw with grim satisfaction\u2014and pressed the balky button.</p> <p>Clunk, the camera answered meekly.</p><p>\u2018Aye, well, then, just you remember that!\u2019 he said, and, puffing in righteous indignation, gave the buttons a good jabbing.</p><p>He\u2019d not been paying attention during this small temper-tantrum, but had been circling upward\u2014standard default for a Spitfire flier. He started back down for a fresh pass at the mile-castle, but within a minute or two, began to hear a knocking sound from the engine.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 he said, and gave it more throttle. The knocking got louder; he could feel it vibrating through the fuselage. Then there was a loud clang! from the engine compartment right by his knee, and with horror he saw tiny droplets of oil spatter on the Perspex in front of his face. The engine stopped.</p><p>\u2018Bloody, bloody ...\u2019 He was too busy to find another word. His lovely agile fighter had suddenly become a very clumsy glider. He was going down and the only question was whether he\u2019d find a relatively flat spot to crash in.</p><p>His hand groped automatically for the landing gear but then drew back\u2014no time, belly landing, where was the bottom? Jesus, he\u2019d been distracted, hadn\u2019t seen that solid bank of cloud move in; it must have come faster than he ... Thoughts flitted through his mind, too fast for words. He glanced at the altimeter, but what it told him was of limited use, because he didn\u2019t know what the ground under him was like: crags, flat meadow, water? He hoped and prayed for a road, a grassy flat spot, anything short of\u2014God, he was at five hundred feet and still in cloud! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Christ!\u2019</p><p>The ground appeared in a sudden burst of yellow and brown. He jerked the nose up, saw the rocks of a crag dead ahead, swerved, stalled, nose-dived, pulled back, pulled back, not enough, Oh, God\u2014</p><p>His first conscious thought was that he should have radioed base when the engine went.</p><p>\u2018Stupid f**ker,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best. Clot-heid.\u2019</p> <p>He seemed to be lying on his side. That didn\u2019t seem right. He felt cautiously with one hand\u2014grass and mud. What, had he been thrown clear of the plane?</p><p>He had. His head hurt badly, his knee much worse. He had to sit down on the matted wet grass for a bit, unable to think through the waves of pain that squeezed his head with each heartbeat.</p><p>It was nearly dark, and rising mist surrounded him. He breathed deep, sniffing the dank, cold air. It smelt of rot and old mangelwurzels\u2014but what it didn\u2019t smell of was petrol and burning fuselage.</p><p>Right. Maybe she hadn\u2019t caught fire when she crashed, then. If not, and if her radio was still working ...</p><p>He staggered to his feet, nearly losing his balance from a sudden attack of vertigo, and turned in a slow circle, peering into the mist. There was nothing but mist to his left and behind him, but to his right, he made out two or three large, bulky shapes, standing upright.</p> <p>Making his way slowly across the lumpy ground, he found that they were stones. Remnants of one of those prehistoric sites that littered the ground in northern Britain. Only three of the big stones were still standing, but he could see a few more, fallen or pushed over, lying like bodies in the darkening fog. He paused to vomit, holding on to one of the stones. Christ, his head was like to split! And he had a terrible buzzing in his ears ... He pawed vaguely at his ear, thinking somehow he\u2019d left his headset on, but felt nothing but a cold, wet ear.</p><p>He closed his eyes again, breathing hard, and leaned against the stone for support. The static in his ears was getting worse, accompanied by a sort of whine. Had he burst an eardrum? He forced himself to open his eyes, and was rewarded with the sight of a large, dark irregular shape, well beyond the remains of the stone circle. Dolly!</p><p>The plane was barely visible, fading into the swirling dark, but that\u2019s what it had to be. Mostly intact, it looked like, though very much nose-down with her tail in the air\u2014she must have ploughed into the earth. He staggered on the rock-strewn ground, feeling the vertigo set in again, with a vengeance. He waved his arms, trying to keep his balance, but his head spun, and Christ, the bloody noise in his head ... He couldn\u2019t think, oh, Jesus, he felt as if his bones were dissolv\u2014</p><p>It was full dark when he came to himself, but the clouds had broken and a three-quarter moon shone in the deep black of a country sky. He moved, and groaned. Every bone in his body hurt\u2014but none was broken. That was something, he told himself. His clothes were sodden with damp, he was starving, and his knee was so stiff he couldn\u2019t straighten his right leg all the way, but that was all right; he thought he could make shift to hobble as far as a road.</p><p>Oh, wait. Radio. Yes, he\u2019d forgotten. If Dolly\u2019s radio were intact, he could ...</p><p>He stared blankly at the open ground before him. He\u2019d have sworn it was\u2014but he must have got turned round in the dark and fog\u2014no.</p> <p>He turned quite round, three times, before he stopped, afraid of becoming dizzy again. The plane was gone.</p><p>It was gone. He was sure it had lain about fifty feet beyond that one stone, the tallest one; he\u2019d taken note of it as a marker, to keep his bearings. He walked out to the spot where he was sure Dolly had come down, walked slowly round the stones in a wide circle, glancing to one side and then the other in growing confusion.</p><p>Not only was the plane gone, it didn\u2019t seem ever to have been there. There was no trace, no furrow in the thick meadow grass, let alone the kind of gouge in the earth that such a crash would have made. Had he been imagining its presence? Wishful thinking?</p><p>He shook his head to clear it\u2014but in fact, it was clear. The buzzing and whining in his ears had stopped, and while he still had bruises and a mild headache, he was feeling much better. He walked slowly back around the stones, still looking, a growing sense of deep cold curling through his wame. It wasn\u2019t f**king there.</p><p>He woke in the morning without the slightest notion where he was. He was curled up on grass; that much came dimly to him\u2014he could smell it. Grass that cattle had been grazing, because there was a large cow pat just by him, and fresh enough to smell that, too. He stretched out a leg, cautious. Then an arm. Rolled onto his back, and felt a hair better for having something solid under him, though the sky overhead was a dizzy void.</p><p>It was a soft, pale blue void, too. Not a trace of cloud.</p><p>How long ...? A jolt of alarm brought him up onto his knees, but a bright yellow stab of pain behind his eyes sat him down again, moaning and cursing breathlessly.</p><p>Once more. He waited \u2019til his breath was coming steady, then risked cracking one eye open.</p> <p>Well, it was certainly still Northumbria, the northern part, where England\u2019s billowing fields crash onto the inhospitable rocks of Scotland. He recognised the rolling hills, covered with sere grass and punctuated by towering rocks that shot straight up into sudden toothy crags. He swallowed, and rubbed both hands hard over his head and face, assuring himself he was still real. He didn\u2019t feel real. Even after he\u2019d taken a careful count of fingers, toes, and private bits\u2014counting the last twice, just in case\u2014he still felt that something important had been misplaced, torn off somehow, and left behind.</p><p>His ears still rang, rather like they did after an especially active trip. Why, though? What had he heard?</p><p>He found that he could move a little more easily now, and managed to look all round the sky, sector by sector. Nothing up there. No memory of anything up there. And yet the inside of his head buzzed and jangled, and the flesh on his body rippled with agitation. He chafed his arms, hard, to make it go.</p><p>Horripilation. That\u2019s the proper word for gooseflesh; Dolly\u2019d told him that. She kept a little notebook and wrote down words she came across in her reading; she was a great one for the reading. She\u2019d already got wee Roger sitting in her lap to be read to after tea, round-eyed as Bonzo at the coloured pictures in his rag book.</p><p>Thought of his family got him up onto his feet, swaying, but all right now, better, yes, definitely better, though he still felt as though his skin didn\u2019t quite fit. The plane, where was that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked round him. No plane was visible. Anywhere. Then it came back to him, with a lurch of the stomach. Real, it was real. He\u2019d been sure in the night that he was dreaming or hallucinating, had lain down to recover himself, and must have fallen asleep. But he was awake now, no mistake; there was a bug of some kind down his back, and he slapped viciously to try to squash it.</p><p>His heart was pounding unpleasantly and his palms were sweating. He wiped them on his trousers and scanned the landscape. It wasn\u2019t flat, but neither did it offer much concealment. No trees, no bosky dells. There was a small lake off in the distance\u2014he caught the shine of water\u2014but if he\u2019d ditched in water, surely to God he\u2019d be wet?</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d been unconscious long enough to dry out, he thought. Maybe he\u2019d imagined that he\u2019d seen the plane near the stones. Surely he couldn\u2019t have walked this far from the lake and forgotten it? He\u2019d started walking toward the lake, out of sheer inability to think of anything more useful to do. Clearly time had passed; the sky had cleared like magic. Well, they\u2019d have little trouble finding him, at least; they knew he was near the wall. A truck should be along soon; he couldn\u2019t be more than two hours from the airfield.</p><p>\u2018And a good thing, too,\u2019 he muttered. He\u2019d picked an especially godforsaken spot to crash\u2014there wasn\u2019t a farmhouse or a paddock anywhere in sight, not so much as a sniff of chimney smoke.</p> <p>His head was becoming clearer now. He\u2019d circle the lake\u2014just in case\u2014then head for the road. Might meet the support crew coming in.</p><p>\u2018And tell them I\u2019ve lost the bloody plane?\u2019 he asked himself aloud. \u2018Aye, right. Come on, ye wee idjit, think! Now, where did ye see it last?\u2019</p><p>He walked for a long time. Slowly, because of the knee, but that began to feel easier after a while. His mind was not feeling easier. There was something wrong with the countryside. Granted, Northumbria was a ragged sort of place, but not this ragged. He\u2019d found a road\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the B road he\u2019d seen from the air. It was a dirt track, pocked with stones and showing signs of being much travelled by hooved animals with a heavily fibrous diet.</p><p>Wished he hadn\u2019t thought of diet. His wame was flapping against his backbone. Thinking about breakfast was better than thinking about other things, though, and for a time, he amused himself by envisioning the powdered eggs and soggy toast he\u2019d have got in the mess, then going on to the lavish breakfasts of his youth in the Highlands: huge bowls of steaming parritch, slices of black pudding fried in lard, bannocks with marmalade, gallons of hot, strong tea ...</p><p>An hour later, he found Hadrian\u2019s Wall. Hard to miss, even grown over with grass and all-sorts like it was. It marched stolidly along, just like the Roman legions who\u2019d built it, stubbornly workmanlike, a grey seam stitching its way up hill and down dale, dividing the peaceful fields to the south from those marauding buggers up north. He grinned at the thought and sat down on the wall\u2014it was less than a yard high, just here\u2014to massage his knee.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t found the plane, or anything else, and was beginning to doubt his own sense of reality. He\u2019d seen a fox, any number of rabbits, and a pheasant that\u2019d nearly given him heart failure by bursting out from right under his feet. No people at all, though, and that was giving him a queer feeling in his water.</p><p>Aye, there was a war on, right enough, and many of the menfolk were gone, but the farmhouses hadn\u2019t been sacrificed to the war effort, had they? The women were running the farms, feeding the nation, all that\u2014he\u2019d heard the PM on the radio praising them for it only last week. So where the bloody hell was everybody?</p><p>The sun was getting low in the sky when at last he saw a house. It was flush against the wall, and struck him as somehow familiar, though he knew he\u2019d never seen it before. Stone-built and squat, but quite large, with a ratty-looking thatch. There was smoke coming from the chimney, though, and he limped toward it as fast as he could go.</p><p>There was a person outside\u2014a woman in a ratty long dress and an apron, feeding chickens. He shouted, and she looked up, her mouth falling open at the sight of him.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, breathless from hurry. \u2018I\u2019ve had a crash. I need help. Are ye on the phone, maybe?\u2019</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She dropped the basket of chicken feed and ran right away, round the corner of the house. He sighed in exasperation. Well, maybe she\u2019d gone to fetch her husband. He didn\u2019t see any sign of a vehicle, not so much as a tractor, but maybe the man was\u2014</p> <p>The man was tall, stringy, bearded, and snaggletoothed. He was also dressed in a dirty shirt and baggy short pants that showed his hairy legs and bare feet\u2014and accompanied by two other men in similar comic attire. Jerry instantly interpreted the looks on their faces, and didn\u2019t stay to laugh.</p><p>\u2018Hey, nay problem, mate,\u2019 he said, backing up, hands out. \u2018I\u2019m off, right?\u2019</p><p>They kept coming, slowly, spreading out to surround him. He hadn\u2019t liked the looks of them to start with, and was liking them less by the second. Hungry, they looked, with a speculative glitter in their eyes.</p><p>One of them said something to him, a question of some kind, but the Northumbrian accent was too thick for him to catch more than a word. \u2018Who\u2019 was the word, and he hastily pulled his dog tags from the neck of his blouson, waving the red and green disks at them. One of the men smiled, but not in a nice way.</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, still backing up. \u2018I didna mean to\u2014\u2019</p><p>The man in the lead reached out a horny hand and took hold of Jerry\u2019s forearm. He jerked back, but the man, instead of letting go, punched him in the belly.</p><p>He could feel his mouth opening and shutting like a fish\u2019s, but no air came in. He flailed wildly, but they all were on him then. They were calling out to each other, and he didn\u2019t understand a word, but the intent was plain as the nose he managed to butt with his head.</p><p>It was the only blow he landed. Within two minutes, he\u2019d been efficiently beaten into pudding, had his pockets rifled, been stripped of his jacket and dog tags, been frog-marched down the road and heaved bodily down a steep, rocky slope.</p> <p>He rolled, bouncing from one outcrop to the next, until he managed to fling out an arm and grab on to a scrubby thornbush. He came to a scraping halt and lay with his face in a clump of heather, panting and thinking incongruously of taking Dolly to the pictures, just before he\u2019d joined up. They\u2019d seen The Wizard of Oz, and he was beginning to feel creepily like the lass in that film\u2014maybe it was the resemblance of the Northumbrians to scarecrows and lions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018At least the f**king lion spoke English,\u2019 he muttered, sitting up. \u2018Jesus, now what?\u2019</p><p>It occurred to him that it might be a good time to stop cursing and start praying.</p><p>London, two years later</p><p>She\u2019d been home from her work no more than five minutes. Just time to meet Roger\u2019s mad charge across the floor, shrieking \u2018MUMMY!,\u2019 she pretending to be staggered by his impact\u2014not so much a pretence; he was getting big. Just time to call out to her own mum, hear the muffled reply from the kitchen, sniff hopefully for the comforting smell of tea, and catch a tantalising whiff of tinned sardines that made her mouth water\u2014a rare treat.</p> <p>Just time to sit down for what seemed the first time in days, and take off her high-heeled shoes, relief washing over her feet like seawater when the tide comes in. She noticed with dismay the hole in the heel of her stocking, though. Her last pair, too. She was just undoing her garter, thinking that she\u2019d have to start using leg-tan like Maisie, drawing a careful seam up the back of each leg with an eyebrow pencil, when there came a knock at the door.</p><p>\u2018Mrs MacKenzie?\u2019 The man who stood at the door of her mother\u2019s flat was tall, a dark silhouette in the dimness of the hall, but she knew at once he was a soldier.</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019 She couldn\u2019t help the leap of her heart, the clench of her stomach. She tried frantically to damp it down, deny it, the hope that had sprung up like a struck match. A mistake. There\u2019d been a mistake. He hadn\u2019t been killed, he\u2019d been lost somehow, maybe captured, and now they\u2019d found hi\u2014Then she saw the small box in the soldier\u2019s hand and her legs gave way under her.</p><p>Her vision sparkled at the edges, and the stranger\u2019s face swam above her, blurred with concern. She could hear, though\u2014hear her mum rush through from the kitchen, slippers slapping in her haste, voice raised in agitation. Heard the man\u2019s name, Captain Randall, Frank Randall. Hear Roger\u2019s small, husky voice warm in her ear, saying \u2018Mummy? Mummy?\u2019 in confusion.</p><p>Then she was on the swaybacked davenport, holding a cup of hot water that smelt of tea\u2014they could change the tea leaves only once a week, and this was Friday, she thought irrelevantly. He should have come on Sunday, her mum was saying, they could have given him a decent cuppa. But perhaps he didn\u2019t work on Sundays?</p> <p>Her mum had put Captain Randall in the best chair, near the electric fire, and had switched on two bars as a sign of hospitality. Her mother was chatting with the Captain, holding Roger in her lap. Her son was more interested in the little box sitting on the tiny piecrust table; he kept reaching for it, but his grandmother wouldn\u2019t let him have it. Marjorie recognised the intent look on his face. He wouldn\u2019t throw a fit\u2014he hardly ever did\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t give up, either.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look a lot like his father, save when he wanted something badly. She pulled herself up a bit, shaking her head to clear the dizziness, and Roger looked up at her, distracted by her movement. For an instant, she saw Jerry look out of his eyes, and the world swam afresh. She closed her own, though, and gulped her tea, scalding as it was.</p><p>Mum and Captain Randall had been talking politely, giving her time to recover herself. Did he have children of his own? Mum asked.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he said, with what might have been a wistful look at wee Roger. \u2018Not yet. I haven\u2019t seen my wife in two years.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Better late than never,\u2019 said a sharp voice, and she was surprised to discover that it was hers. She put down the cup, pulled up the loose stocking that had puddled round her ankle, and fixed Captain Randall with a look. \u2018What have you brought me?\u2019 she said, trying for a tone of calm dignity. Didn\u2019t work; she sounded brittle as broken glass, even to her own ears.</p><p>Captain Randall eyed her cautiously, but took up the little box and held it out to her.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s Lieutenant MacKenzie\u2019s,\u2019 he said. \u2018An MID oakleaf cluster. Awarded posthumously for\u2014\u2019</p><p>With an effort, she pushed herself away, back into the cushions, shaking her head.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really, Marjorie!\u2019 Her mother was shocked.</p><p>\u2018And I don\u2019t like that word. Pos\u2014 posth\u2014 don\u2019t say it.\u2019</p><p>She couldn\u2019t overcome the notion that Jerry was somehow inside the box\u2014a notion that seemed dreadful at one moment, comforting the next. Captain Randall set it down, very slowly, as though it might blow up.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t say it,\u2019 he said gently. \u2018May I say, though ... I knew him. Your husband. Very briefly, but I did know him. I came myself, because I wanted to say to you how very brave he was.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brave.\u2019 The word was like a pebble in her mouth. She wished she could spit it at him.</p> <p>\u2018Of course he was,\u2019 her mother said firmly. \u2018Hear that, Roger? Your dad was a good man, and he was a brave one. You won\u2019t forget that.\u2019</p><p>Roger was paying no attention, struggling to get down. His gran set him reluctantly on the floor and he lurched over to Captain Randall, taking a firm grip on the Captain\u2019s freshly creased trousers with both hands\u2014hands greasy, she saw, with sardine oil and toast crumbs. The Captain\u2019s lips twitched, but he didn\u2019t try to detach Roger, just patted his head.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s a good boy, then?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>\u2018Fith,\u2019 Roger said firmly. \u2018Fith!\u2019</p><p>Marjorie felt an incongruous impulse to laugh at the Captain\u2019s puzzled expression, though it didn\u2019t touch the stone in her heart.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s his new word,\u2019 she said. \u2018 \u201cFish.\u201d He can\u2019t say \u201csardine.\u201d \u2019</p><p>\u2018Thar ... DEEM!\u2019 Roger said, glaring at her. \u2018Fitttthhhhh!\u2019</p><p>The Captain laughed out loud, and pulling out a handkerchief, carefully wiped the spittle off Roger\u2019s face, casually going on to wipe the grubby little paws as well.</p><p>\u2018Of course it\u2019s a fish,\u2019 he assured Roger. \u2018You\u2019re a clever lad. And a big help to your mummy, I\u2019m sure. Here, I\u2019ve brought you something for your tea.\u2019 He groped in the pocket of his coat and pulled out a small pot of jam. Strawberry jam. Marjorie\u2019s salivary glands contracted painfully. With the sugar rationing, she hadn\u2019t tasted jam in ...</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a great help,\u2019 her mother put in stoutly, determined to keep the conversation on a proper plane despite her daughter\u2019s peculiar behaviour. She avoided Marjorie\u2019s eyes. \u2018A lovely boy.

He was\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brave. You told me.\u2019 Suddenly something snapped. It was her half-hooked garter, but the pop of it made her sit up straight, fists clenched in the thin fabric of her skirt. \u2018Brave,\u2019 she repeated. \u2018They\u2019re all brave, aren\u2019t they? Every single one. Even you\u2014or are you?\u2019</p><p>She heard her mother\u2019s gasp, but went on anyway, reckless.</p><p>\u2018You all have to be brave and noble and\u2014and\u2014perfect, don\u2019t you? Because if you were weak, if there were any cracks, if anyone looked like being not quite the thing, you know\u2014well, it might all fall apart, mightn\u2019t it? So none of you will, will you? Or if somebody did, the rest of you would cover it up. You won\u2019t ever not do something, no matter what it is, because you can\u2019t not do it; all the other chaps would think the worse of you, wouldn\u2019t they, and we can\u2019t have that, oh, no, we can\u2019t have that!\u2019</p> <p>Captain Randall was looking at her intently, his eyes dark with concern. Probably thought she was a nutter\u2014probably she was, but what did it matter?</p><p>\u2018Marjie, Marjie, love,\u2019 her mother was murmuring, horribly embarrassed. \u2018You oughtn\u2019t to say such things to\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You made him do it, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 She was on her feet now, looming over the Captain, making him look up at her. \u2018He told me. He told me about you. You came and asked him to do\u2014whatever it was that got him killed. Oh, don\u2019t trouble yourself, he didn\u2019t tell me your bloody precious secrets\u2014not him, he wouldn\u2019t do that. He was a flier.\u2019 She was panting with rage and had to stop to draw breath. Roger, she saw dimly, had shrunk into himself and was clinging to the Captain\u2019s leg; Randall put an arm about the boy automatically, as though to shelter him from his mother\u2019s wrath. With an effort she made herself stop shouting, and, to her horror, felt tears begin to course down her face.</p><p>\u2018And now you come and bring me\u2014and bring me ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Marjie.\u2019 Her mother came up close beside her, her body warm and soft and comforting in her worn old pinny. She thrust a tea towel into Marjorie\u2019s hands, then moved between her daughter and the enemy, solid as a battleship.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s kind of you to\u2019ve brought us this, Captain,\u2019 Marjorie heard her saying, and felt her move away, bending to pick up the little box. Marjorie sat down blindly, pressing the tea towel to her face, hiding.</p><p>\u2018Here, Roger, look. See how it opens? See how pretty? It\u2019s called\u2014what did you say it was again, Captain? Oh, oakleaf cluster. Yes, that\u2019s right. Can you say \u201cmedal,\u201d Roger? Mehdul. This is your dad\u2019s medal.\u2019</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t say anything. Probably scared stiff, poor little chap. She had to pull herself together. But she\u2019d gone too far. She couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u2018He cried when he left me.\u2019 She muttered the secret into the folds of the tea towel. \u2018He didn\u2019t want to go.\u2019 Her shoulders heaved with a convulsive, unexpected sob, and she pressed the towel hard against her eyes, whispering to herself, \u2018You said you\u2019d come back, Jerry, you said you\u2019d come back.\u2019</p><p>She stayed hidden behind her flour-sacking fortress, while renewed offers of tea were made and, to her vague surprise, accepted. She\u2019d thought Captain Randall would seize the chance of her retreat to make his own. But he stayed, chatting calmly with her mother, talking slowly to Roger while her mother fetched the tea, ignoring her embarrassing performance entirely, keeping up a quiet, companionable presence in the shabby room.</p><p>The rattle and bustle of the tea tray\u2019s arrival gave her the opportunity to drop her cloth fa\u00e7ade, and she meekly accepted a slice of toast spread with a thin scrape of margarine and a delectable spoonful of the strawberry jam.</p> <p>\u2018There, now,\u2019 her mother said, looking on with approval. \u2018You\u2019ll not have eaten anything since breakfast, I daresay. Enough to give anyone the wambles.\u2019</p><p>Marjorie shot her mother a look, but in fact it was true; she hadn\u2019t had any luncheon because Maisie was off with \u2018female trouble\u2019\u2014a condition that afflicted her roughly every other week\u2014and she\u2019d had to mind the shop all day.</p><p>Conversation flowed comfortably around her, a soothing stream past an immoveable rock. Even Roger relaxed with the introduction of jam. He\u2019d never tasted any before, and sniffed it curiously, took a cautious lick\u2014and then took an enormous bite that left a red smear on his nose, his moss-green eyes round with wonder and delight. The little box, now open, sat on the piecrust table, but no one spoke of it or looked in that direction.</p><p>After a decent interval, Captain Randall got up to go, giving Roger a shiny sixpence in parting. Feeling it the least she could do, Marjorie got up to see him out. Her stockings spiralled down her legs, and she kicked them off with contempt, walking bare-legged to the door. She heard her mother sigh behind her.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 she said, opening the door for him. \u2018I ... appreciate\u2014\u2019</p><p>To her surprise, he stopped her, putting a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve no particular right to say this to you\u2014but I will,\u2019 he said, low-voiced. \u2018You\u2019re right; they\u2019re not all brave. Most of them\u2014of us\u2014we\u2019re just ... there, and we do our best. Most of the time,\u2019 he added, and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly, though she couldn\u2019t tell whether it was in humour or bitterness.</p><p>\u2018But your husband\u2014\u2019 He closed his eyes for a moment and said, \u2018The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.\u2019 He did that, every day, for a long time.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You sent him, though,\u2019 she said, her voice as low as his. \u2018You did.\u2019</p><p>His smile was bleak.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve done such things every day ... for a long time.\u2019</p><p>The door closed quietly behind him, and she stood there swaying, eyes closed, feeling the draft come under it, chilling her bare feet. It was well into the autumn now, and the dark was smudging the windows, though it was just past teatime.</p><p>I\u2019ve done what I do every day for a long time, too, she thought. But they don\u2019t call it brave when you don\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>Her mother was moving through the flat, muttering to herself as she closed the curtains. Or not so much to herself.</p><p>\u2018He liked her. Anyone could see that. So kind, coming himself to bring the medal and all. And how does she act? Like a cat that\u2019s had its tail stepped on, all claws and caterwauling, that\u2019s how.

Her mother turned round, squat, solid, implacable.</p><p>\u2018You need a man, Marjorie. And little Rog needs a father.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He has a father,\u2019 she said through her teeth. \u2018Captain Randall has a wife. And I don\u2019t need anyone.\u2019</p><p>Anyone but Jerry.</p> <p>Northumbria</p><p>He licked his lips at the smell. Hot pastry, steaming, juicy meat. There was a row of fat little pasties ranged along the sill, covered with a clean cloth in case of birds, but showing plump and rounded through it, the odd spot of gravy soaking through the napkin.</p><p>His mouth watered so fiercely that his salivary glands ached and he had to massage the underside of his jaw to ease the pain.</p><p>It was the first house he\u2019d seen in two days. Once he\u2019d got out of the ravine, he\u2019d circled well away from the mile-castle and eventually struck a small cluster of cottages, where the people were no more understandable, but did give him some food. That had lasted him a little while; beyond that, he\u2019d been surviving on what he could glean from hedges and the odd vegetable patch. He\u2019d found another hamlet, but the folk there had driven him away.</p><p>Once he\u2019d got enough of a grip of himself to think clearly, it became obvious that he needed to go back to the standing stones. Whatever had happened to him had happened there, and if he really was somewhere in the past\u2014and hard as he\u2019d tried to find some alternative explanation, none was forthcoming\u2014then his only chance of getting back where he belonged seemed to lie there, too.</p> <p>He\u2019d come well away from the drover\u2019s track, though, seeking food, and as the few people he met didn\u2019t understand him any more than he understood them, he\u2019d had some difficulty in finding his way back to the wall. He thought he was quite close, now, though\u2014the ragged country was beginning to seem familiar, though perhaps that was only delusion.</p><p>Everything else had faded into unimportance, though, when he smelt food.</p><p>He circled the house at a cautious distance, checking for dogs. No dog. Aye, fine, then. He chose an approach from the side, out of view of any of the few windows. Darted swiftly from bush to ploughshare to midden to house, and plastered himself against the grey stone wall, breathing hard\u2014and breathing in that delicious, savoury aroma. Shite, he was drooling. He wiped his sleeve hastily across his mouth, slithered round the corner, and reached out a hand.</p><p>As it happened, the farmstead did boast a dog, which had been attending its absent master in the barn. Both these worthies returning unexpectedly at this point, the dog at once spotted what it assumed to be jiggery-pokery taking place, and gave tongue in an altogether proper manner. Alerted in turn to felonious activity on his premises, the householder instantly joined the affray, armed with a wooden spade, with which he batted Jerry over the head.</p><p>As he staggered back against the wall of the house, he had just wit enough left to notice that the farmwife\u2014now sticking out of her window and shrieking like the Glasgow Express\u2014had knocked one of the pasties to the ground, where it was being devoured by the dog, who wore an expression of piety and rewarded virtue that Jerry found really offensive.</p><p>Then the farmer hit him again, and he stopped being offended.</p> <p>It was a well-built byre, the stones fitted carefully and mortared. He wore himself out with shouting and kicking at the door until his gammy leg gave way and he collapsed onto the earthen floor.</p><p>\u2018Now bloody what?\u2019 he muttered. He was damp with sweat from his effort, but it was cold in the byre, with that penetrating damp cold peculiar to the British Isles, that seeps into your bones and makes the joints ache. His knee would give him fits in the morning. The air was saturated with the scent of manure and chilled urine. \u2018Why would the bloody Jerries want the damn place?\u2019 he said, and, sitting up, huddled into his shirt. It was going to be a frigging long night.</p><p>He got up onto his hands and knees and felt carefully round inside the byre, but there was nothing even faintly edible\u2014only a scurf of mouldy hay. Not even the rats would have that; the inside of the place was empty as a drum and silent as a church.</p><p>What had happened to the cows? he wondered. Dead of a plague, eaten, sold? Or maybe just not yet back from the summer pastures\u2014though it was late in the year for that, surely.</p><p>He sat down again, back against the door, as the wood was marginally less cold than the stone walls. He\u2019d thought about being captured in battle, made prisoner by the Germans\u2014they all had, now and then, though chaps mostly didn\u2019t talk about it. He thought about POW camps, and those camps in Poland, the ones he\u2019d been meant to photograph. Were they as bleak as this? Stupid thing to think of, really.</p><p>But he\u2019d got to pass the time \u2019til morning one way or another, and there were lots of things he\u2019d rather not think about just now. Like what would happen once morning came. He didn\u2019t think breakfast in bed was going to be part of it.</p><p>The wind was rising. Whining past the corners of the cow byre with a keening noise that set his teeth on edge. He still had his silk scarf; it had slipped down inside his shirt when the bandits in the mile-castle had attacked him. He fished it out now and wrapped it round his neck, for comfort, if not warmth.</p><p>He\u2019d brought Dolly breakfast in bed now and then. She woke up slow and sleepy, and he loved the way she scooped her tangled curly black hair off her face, peering out slit-eyed, like a small, sweet mole blinking in the light. He\u2019d sit her up and put the tray on the table beside her, and then he\u2019d shuck his own clothes and crawl in bed, too, cuddling close to her soft, warm skin. Sometimes sliding down in the bed, and her pretending not to notice, sipping tea or putting marmite on her toast while he burrowed under the covers and found his way up through the cottony layers of sheets and nightie. He loved the smell of her, always, but especially when he\u2019d made love to her the night before, and she bore the strong, musky scent of him between her legs.</p> <p>He shifted a little, roused by the memory, but the subsequent thought\u2014that he might never see her again\u2014quelled him at once.</p><p>Still thinking of Dolly, though, he put his hand automatically to his pocket, and was alarmed to find no lump there. He slapped at his thigh, but failed to find the small, hard bulge of the sapphire. Could he have put it in the other pocket by mistake? He delved urgently, shoving both hands deep into his pockets. No stone\u2014but there was something in his right-hand pocket. Something powdery, almost greasy ... what the devil?</p><p>He brought his fingers out, peering as closely at them as he could, but it was too dark to see more than a vague outline of his hand, let alone anything on it. He rubbed his fingers gingerly together; it felt something like the thick soot that builds up inside a chimney. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 he whispered, and put his fingers to his nose. There was a distinct smell of combustion. Not petrolish at all, but a scent of burning so intense he could taste it on the back of his tongue. Like something out of a volcano. What in the name of God Almighty could burn a rock and leave the man who carried it alive?</p><p>The sort of thing he\u2019d met among the standing stones, that was what.</p><p>He\u2019d been doing all right with the not feeling too afraid until now, but ... he swallowed hard, and sat down again, quietly.</p><p>\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep,\u2019 he whispered to the knees of his trousers. \u2018I pray the Lord my soul to keep ...\u2019</p> <p>He did in fact sleep eventually, in spite of the cold, from simple exhaustion. He was dreaming about wee Roger, who for some reason was a grown man now, but still holding his tiny blue bear, minuscule in a broad-palmed grasp. His son was speaking to him in Gaelic, saying something urgent that he couldn\u2019t understand, and he was growing frustrated, telling Roger over and over for Christ\u2019s sake to speak English, couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Then he heard another voice through the fog of sleep and realised that someone was in fact talking somewhere close by.</p><p>He jerked awake, struggling to grasp what was being said and failing utterly. It took him several seconds to realise that whoever was speaking\u2014there seemed to be two voices, hissing and muttering in argument\u2014really was speaking in Gaelic.</p><p>He had only a smattering of it himself; his mother had had it, but\u2014he was moving before he could complete the thought, panicked at the notion that potential assistance might get away.</p><p>\u2018Hoy!\u2019 he bellowed, scrambling\u2014or trying to scramble\u2014to his feet. His much-abused knee wasn\u2019t having any, though, and gave way the instant he put weight on it, catapulting him face-first toward the door.</p> <p>He twisted as he fell and hit it with his shoulder. The booming thud put paid to the argument; the voices fell silent at once.</p><p>\u2018Help! Help me!\u2019 he shouted, pounding on the door. \u2018Help!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will ye for God\u2019s sake hush your noise?\u2019 said a low, annoyed voice on the other side of the door. \u2018Ye want to have them all down on us? Here, then, bring the light closer.\u2019</p><p>This last seemed to be addressed to the voice\u2019s companion, for a faint glow shone through the gap at the bottom of the door. There was a scraping noise as the bolt was drawn, and a faint grunt of effort, then a thunk! as the bolt was set down against the wall. The door swung open, and Jerry blinked in a sudden shaft of light as the slide of a lantern grated open.</p><p>He turned his head aside and closed his eyes for an instant, deliberate, as he would if flying at night and momentarily blinded by a flare or by the glow of his own exhaust. When he opened them again, the two men were in the cow byre with him, looking him over with open curiosity.</p><p>Biggish buggers, both of them, taller and broader than he was. One fair, one black-haired as Lucifer. They didn\u2019t look much alike, and yet he had the feeling that they might be related\u2014some fleeting glimpse of bone, a similarity of expression, maybe.</p> <p>\u2018What\u2019s your name, mate?\u2019 said the dark chap, softly. Jerry felt the nip of wariness at his nape, even as he felt a thrill in the pit of his stomach. It was regular speech, perfectly understandable. A Scots accent, but\u2014</p><p>\u2018MacKenzie, J. W.,\u2019 he said, straightening up to attention. \u2018Lieutenant, Royal Air Force. Service number\u2014\u2019</p><p>An indescribable expression flitted across the dark bloke\u2019s face. An urge to laugh, of all bloody things, and a flare of excitement in his eyes\u2014really striking eyes, a vivid green that flashed suddenly in the light. None of that mattered to Jerry; what was important was that the man plainly knew. He knew.</p><p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 he asked, urgent. \u2018Where d\u2019ye come from?\u2019</p><p>The two exchanged an unfathomable glance, and the other answered.</p><p>\u2018Inverness.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ye know what I mean!\u2019 He took a deep breath. \u2018When?\u2019</p><p>The two strangers were much of an age, but the fair one had plainly had a harder life; his face was deeply weathered and lined.</p> <p>\u2018A lang way from you,\u2019 he said quietly, and, despite his own agitation, Jerry heard the note of desolation in his voice. \u2018From now. Lost.\u2019</p><p>Lost. Oh, God. But still\u2014</p><p>\u2018Jesus. And where are we now? Wh-when?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Northumbria,\u2019 the dark man answered briefly, \u2018and I don\u2019t bloody know for sure. Look, there\u2019s no time. If anyone hears us\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, right. Let\u2019s go, then.\u2019</p><p>The air outside was wonderful after the smells of the cow byre, cold and full of dying heather and turned earth. He thought he could even smell the moon, a faint green sickle above the horizon; he tasted cheese at the thought, and his mouth watered. He wiped a trickle of saliva away and hurried after his rescuers, hobbling as fast as he could.</p><p>The farmhouse was black, a squatty black blot on the landscape. The dark bloke grabbed him by the arm as he was about to go past it, quickly licked a finger, and held it up to test the wind.</p><p>\u2018The dogs,\u2019 he explained in a whisper. \u2018This way.\u2019</p><p>They circled the farmhouse at a cautious distance, and found themselves stumbling through a ploughed field. Clods burst under Jerry\u2019s boots as he hurried to keep up, lurching on his bad knee with every step.</p><p>\u2018Where we going?\u2019 he panted, when he thought it safe to speak.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re taking ye back to the stones near the lake,\u2019 the dark man said tersely. \u2018That has to be where ye came through.\u2019 The fair one just snorted, as though this wasn\u2019t his notion\u2014but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Hope flared up in Jerry like a bonfire. They knew what the stones were, how it worked. They\u2019d show him how to get back!</p><p>\u2018How\u2014how did ye find me?\u2019 He could hardly breathe, such a pace they kept up, but he had to know. The lantern was shut and he couldn\u2019t see their faces, but the dark man made a muffled sound that might have been a laugh.</p><p>\u2018I met an auld wifie wearing your dog tags. Very proud of them, she was.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ye\u2019ve got them?\u2019 Jerry gasped.</p><p>\u2018Nay, she wouldna give them up.\u2019 It was the fair man, sounding definitely amused. \u2018Told us where she\u2019d got them, though, and we followed your trail backward. Hey!\u2019 He caught Jerry\u2019s elbow, just as his foot twisted out from under him. The sound of a barking dog broke the night\u2014some way away, but distinct. The fair man\u2019s hand clenched tight on his arm. \u2018Come on, then\u2014hurry!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jerry had a bad stitch in his side, and his knee was all but useless by the time the little group of stones came in sight, a pale huddle in the light of the waning moon. Still, he was surprised at how near the stones were to the farmhouse; he must have circled round more than he thought in his wanderings.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 said the dark man, coming to an abrupt halt. \u2018This is where we leave you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ye do?\u2019 Jerry panted. \u2018But\u2014but you\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018When ye came ... through. Did ye have anything on you? A gemstone, any jewellery?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Aye,\u2019 Jerry said, bewildered. \u2018I had a raw sapphire in my pocket. But it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like it burnt up,\u2019 the blond man finished for him, grim-voiced. \u2018Aye. Well, so?\u2019 This last was clearly addressed to the dark man, who hesitated. Jerry couldn\u2019t see his face, but his whole body spoke of indecision. He wasn\u2019t one to dither, though\u2014he stuck a hand into the leather pouch at his waist, pulled something out, and pressed it into Jerry\u2019s hand. It was faintly warm from the man\u2019s body, and hard in his palm. A small stone of some kind. Faceted, like the stone in a ring.</p><p>\u2018Take this; it\u2019s a good one. When ye go through,\u2019 the dark man was speaking urgently to him, \u2018think about your wife, about Marjorie. Think hard; see her in your mind\u2019s eye, and walk straight through. Whatever the hell ye do, though, don\u2019t think about your son. Just your wife.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Jerry was gob-smacked. \u2018How the bloody hell do you know my wife\u2019s name? And where\u2019ve ye heard about my son?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 the man said, and Jerry saw the motion as he turned his head to look back over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u2018Damn,\u2019 said the fair one, softly. \u2018They\u2019re coming. There\u2019s a light.\u2019</p><p>There was: a single light, bobbing evenly over the ground, as it would if someone carried it. But look as he might, Jerry could see no one behind it, and a violent shiver ran over him.</p><p>\u2018Tannasg,\u2019 said the other man under his breath. Jerry knew that word well enough\u2014spirit, it meant. And usually an ill-disposed one. A haunt.</p><p>\u2018Aye, maybe.\u2019 The dark man\u2019s voice was calm. \u2018And maybe not. It\u2019s near Samhain, after all. Either way, ye need to go, man, and now. Remember, think of your wife.\u2019</p><p>Jerry swallowed, his hand closing tight around the stone.</p><p>\u2018Aye. Aye ... right. Thanks, then,\u2019 he added awkwardly, and heard the breath of a rueful laugh from the dark man.</p> <p>\u2018Nay bother, mate,\u2019 he said. And with that, they were both off, making their way across the stubbled meadow, two lumbering shapes in the moonlight.</p><p>Heart thumping in his ears, Jerry turned toward the stones. They looked just like they\u2019d looked before. Just stones. But the echo of what he\u2019d heard in there ... He swallowed. It wasn\u2019t like there was much choice.</p><p>\u2018Dolly,\u2019 he whispered, trying to summon up a vision of his wife. \u2018Dolly. Dolly, help me!\u2019</p><p>He took a hesitant step towards the stones. Another. One more. Then nearly bit his tongue off as a hand clamped down on his shoulder. He whirled, fist up, but the dark man\u2019s other hand seized his wrist.</p><p>\u2018I love you,\u2019 the dark man said, his voice fierce. Then he was gone again, with the shoof-shoof sounds of boots in dry grass, leaving Jerry with his mouth agape.</p><p>He caught the other man\u2019s voice from the darkness, irritated, half-amused. He spoke differently from the dark man, a much thicker accent, but Jerry understood him without difficulty.</p><p>\u2018Why did ye tell him a daft thing like that?\u2019</p><p>And the dark one\u2019s reply, soft-spoken, in a tone that terrified him more than anything had so far.</p> <p>\u2018Because he isn\u2019t going to make it back. It\u2019s the only chance I\u2019ll ever have. Come on.\u2019</p><p>The day was dawning when he came to himself again, and the world was quiet. No birds sang, and the air was cold with the chill of November and winter coming on. When he could stand up, he went to look, shaky as a newborn lamb.</p><p>The plane wasn\u2019t there, but there was still a deep gouge in the earth where it had been. Not raw earth, though; furred over with grass and meadow plants\u2014not just furred, he saw, limping over to have a closer look. Matted. Dead stalks from earlier years\u2019 growth.</p><p>If he\u2019d been where he thought he\u2019d been, if he\u2019d truly gone ... back ... then he\u2019d come forward again, but not to the same place he\u2019d left. How long? A year, two? He sat down on the grass, too drained to stand up any longer. He felt as though he\u2019d walked every second of the time between then and now.</p><p>He\u2019d done what the green-eyed stranger had said. Concentrated fiercely on Dolly. But he hadn\u2019t been able to keep from thinking of wee Roger, not altogether. How could he? The picture he had most vividly of Dolly was her holding the lad, close against her breast; that\u2019s what he\u2019d seen. And yet he\u2019d made it. He thought he\u2019d made it. Maybe.</p><p>What might have happened? he wondered. There hadn\u2019t been time to ask. There\u2019d been no time to hesitate, either; more lights had come bobbing across the dark, with uncouth Northumbrian shouts behind them, hunting him, and he\u2019d hurled himself into the midst of the standing stones and things went pear-shaped again, even worse. He hoped the strangers who\u2019d rescued him had got away.</p><p>Lost, the fair man had said, and even now, the word went through him like a bit of jagged metal. He swallowed.</p><p>He thought he wasn\u2019t where he had been, but was he still lost, himself? Where was he now? Or rather, when?</p><p>He stayed for a bit, gathering his strength. In a few minutes, though, he heard a familiar sound\u2014the low growl of engines, and the swish of tyres on asphalt. He swallowed hard, and, standing up, turned away from the stones, toward the road.</p><p>He was lucky\u2014for once, he thought wryly. There was a line of troop transports passing, and he swung aboard one without difficulty. The soldiers looked startled at his appearance\u2014he was rumpled and stained, bruised and torn about and with a two-week beard\u2014but they instantly assumed he\u2019d been off on a tear and was now trying to sneak back to his base without being detected. They laughed and nudged him knowingly, but were sympathetic, and when he confessed he was skint, they had a quick whip-round for enough cash to buy a train ticket from Salisbury, where the transport was headed.</p><p>He did his best to smile and go along with the ragging, but soon enough they tired of him and turned to their own conversations, and he was allowed to sit, swaying on the bench, feeling the thrum of the engine through his legs, surrounded by the comfortable presence of comrades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hey, mate,\u2019 he said casually to the young soldier beside him. \u2018What year is it?\u2019</p><p>The boy\u2014he couldn\u2019t be more than seventeen, and Jerry felt the weight of the five years between them as though they were fifty\u2014looked at him wide-eyed, then whooped with laughter.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019ve you been having to drink, Dad? Bring any away with you?\u2019</p><p>That led to more ragging, and he didn\u2019t try asking again.</p> <p>Did it matter?</p><p>He remembered almost nothing of the journey from Salisbury to London. People looked at him oddly, but no one tried to stop him. It didn\u2019t matter; nothing mattered but getting to Dolly. Everything else could wait.</p><p>London was a shock. There was bomb damage everywhere. Streets were scattered with shattered glass from shop windows, glinting in the pale sun, other streets blocked off by barriers. Here and there a stark black notice: Do Not Enter\u2014UNEXPLODED BOMB.</p><p>He made his way from Saint Pancras on foot, needing to see, his heart rising into his throat fit to choke him as he did see what had been done. After a while, he stopped seeing the details, perceiving bomb craters and debris only as blocks to his progress, things stopping him from reaching home.</p><p>And then he did reach home.</p> <p>The rubble had been pushed off the street into a heap, but not taken away. Great blackened lumps of shattered stone and concrete lay like a cairn where Montrose Terrace had once stood.</p><p>All the blood in his heart stopped dead, congealed by the sight. He groped, pawing mindlessly for the wrought-iron railing to keep himself from falling, but it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Of course not, his mind said, quite calmly. It\u2019s gone for the war, hasn\u2019t it? Melted down, made into planes. Bombs.</p><p>His knee gave way without warning, and he fell, landing hard on both knees, not feeling the impact, the crunch of pain from his badly mended kneecap quite drowned out by the blunt, small voice inside his head.</p><p>Too late. Ye went too far.</p><p>\u2018Mr MacKenzie, Mr MacKenzie!\u2019 He blinked at the blurred thing above him, not understanding what it was. Something tugged at him, though, and he breathed, the rush of air in his chest ragged and strange.</p> <p>\u2018Sit up, Mr MacKenzie, do.\u2019 The anxious voice was still there, and hands\u2014yes, it was hands\u2014tugging at his arm. He shook his head, screwed his eyes shut hard, then opened them again, and the round thing became the houndlike face of old Mr Wardlaw, who kept the corner shop.</p><p>\u2018Ah, there you are.\u2019 The old man\u2019s voice was relieved, and the wrinkles in his baggy old face relaxed their anxious lines. \u2018Had a bad turn, did you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2014\u2019 Speech was beyond him, but he flapped his hand at the wreckage. He didn\u2019t think he was crying, but his face was wet. The wrinkles in Wardlaw\u2019s face creased deeper in concern, then the old grocer realised what he meant, and his face lit up.</p><p>\u2018Oh, dear!\u2019 he said. \u2018Oh, no! No, no, no\u2014they\u2019re all right, sir, your family\u2019s all right! Did you hear me?\u2019 he asked anxiously. \u2018Can you breathe? Had I best fetch you some salts, do you think?\u2019</p><p>It took Jerry several tries to make it to his feet, hampered both by his knee and by Mr Wardlaw\u2019s fumbling attempts to help him, but by the time he\u2019d got all the way up, he\u2019d regained the power of speech.</p><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 he gasped. \u2018Where are they?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why\u2014your missus took the little boy and went to stay with her mother, sometime after you left. I don\u2019t recall quite where she said ...\u2019 Mr Wardlaw turned, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the river. \u2018Camberwell, was it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bethnal Green.\u2019 Jerry\u2019s mind had come back, though it felt still as though it was a pebble rolling round the rim of some bottomless abyss, its balance uncertain. He tried to dust himself off, but his hands were shaking. \u2018She lives in Bethnal Green. You\u2019re sure\u2014you\u2019re sure, man?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, yes.\u2019 The grocer was altogether relieved, smiling and nodding so hard that his jowls trembled. \u2018She left\u2014must be more than a year ago, soon after she\u2014soon after she ...\u2019 The old man\u2019s smile faded abruptly and his mouth slowly opened, a flabby dark hole of horror.</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019re dead, Mr MacKenzie,\u2019 he whispered, backing away, hands held up before him. \u2018Oh, God. You\u2019re dead.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The f**k I am, the f**k I am, the f**k I am!\u2019 He caught sight of a woman\u2019s startled face and stopped abruptly, gulping air like a landed fish. He\u2019d been weaving down the shattered street, fists pumping, limping and staggering, muttering his private motto under his breath like the Hail Marys of a rosary. Maybe not as far under his breath as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>He stopped, leaning against the marble front of the Bank of England, panting. He was streaming with sweat and the right leg of his trousers was heavily streaked with dried blood from the fall. His knee was throbbing in time with his heart, his face, his hands, his thoughts. They\u2019re alive. So am I.</p><p>The woman he\u2019d startled was down the street, talking to a policeman; she turned, pointing at him. He straightened up at once, squaring his shoulders. Braced his knee and gritted his teeth, forcing it to bear his weight as he strode down the street, officerlike. The very last thing he wanted just now was to be taken up as drunk.</p><p>He marched past the policeman, nodding politely, touching his forehead in lieu of cap. The policeman looked taken aback, made to speak but couldn\u2019t quite decide what to say, and a moment later, Jerry was round the corner and away.</p><p>It was getting dark. There weren\u2019t many cabs in this area at the best of times\u2014none at all, now, and he hadn\u2019t any money, anyway. The Tube. If the lines were open, it was the fastest way to Bethnal Green. And surely he could cadge the fare from someone. Somehow. He went back to limping, grimly determined. He had to reach Bethnal Green by dark.</p><p>It was so much changed. Like the rest of London. Houses damaged, halfway repaired, abandoned, others no more than a blackened depression or a heap of rubble. The air was thick with cold dust, stone dust, and the smells of paraffin and cooking grease, the brutal, acrid smell of cordite.</p><p>Half the streets had no signs, and he wasn\u2019t so familiar with Bethnal Green to begin with. He\u2019d visited Dolly\u2019s mother just twice, once when they went to tell her they\u2019d run off and got married\u2014she hadn\u2019t been best pleased, Mrs Wakefield, but she\u2019d put a good face on it, even if the face had a lemon-sucking look to it.</p><p>The second time had been when he signed up with the RAF; he\u2019d gone alone to tell her, to ask her to look after Dolly while he was gone. Dolly\u2019s mother had gone white. She knew as well as he did what the life expectancy was for fliers. But she\u2019d told him she was proud of him, and held his hand tight for a long moment before she let him leave, saying only, \u2018Come back, Jeremiah. She needs you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He soldiered on, skirting craters in the street, asking his way. It was nearly full dark, now; he couldn\u2019t be on the streets much longer. His anxiety began to ease a little as he started to see things he knew, though. Close, he was getting close.</p><p>And then the sirens began, and people began to pour out of the houses.</p><p>He was being buffeted by the crowd, borne down the street as much by their barely controlled panic as by their physical impact. There was shouting, people calling for separated family members, wardens bellowing directions, waving their torches, their flat, white helmets pale as mushrooms in the gloom. Above it, through it, the air-raid siren pierced him like a sharpened wire, thrust him down the street on its spike, ramming him into others likewise skewered by fright.</p><p>The tide of it swept round the next corner, and he saw the red circle with its blue line over the entrance to the Tube station, lit up by a warden\u2019s flashlight. He was sucked in, propelled through sudden bright lights, hurtling down the stair, the next, onto a platform, deep into the earth, into safety. And all the time the whoop and moan of the sirens still filling the air, barely muffled by the dirt above.</p> <p>There were wardens moving among the crowd, pushing people back against the walls, into the tunnels, away from the edge of the track. He brushed up against a woman with two toddlers, picked one\u2014a little girl with round eyes and a blue teddy bear\u2014out of her arms and turned his shoulder into the crowd, making a way for them. He found a small space in a tunnel-mouth, pushed the woman into it, and gave her back the little girl. Her mouth moved in thanks, but he couldn\u2019t hear her above the noise of the crowd, the sirens, the creaking, the\u2014</p><p>A sudden monstrous thud from above shook the station, and the whole crowd was struck silent, every eye on the high arched ceiling above them.</p><p>The tiles were white, and as they looked, a dark crack appeared suddenly between two rows of them. A gasp rose from the crowd, louder than the sirens. The crack seemed to stop, to hesitate\u2014and then it zigzagged suddenly, parting the tiles, in different directions.</p><p>He looked down from the growing crack, to see who was below it\u2014the people still on the stair. The crowd at the bottom was too thick to move, everyone stopped still by horror. And then he saw her, partway up the stair.</p><p>Dolly. She\u2019s cut her hair, he thought. It was short and curly, black as soot\u2014black as the hair of the little boy she held in her arms, close against her, sheltering him. Her face was set, jaw clenched. And then she turned a bit, and saw him.</p> <p>Her face went blank for an instant and then flared like a lit match, with a radiant joy that struck him in the heart and flamed through his being.</p><p>There was a much louder thud! from above, and a scream of terror rose from the crowd, louder, much louder than the sirens. Despite the shrieking, he could hear the fine rattle, like rain, as dirt began to pour from the crack above. He shoved with all his might, but couldn\u2019t get past, couldn\u2019t reach them. Dolly looked up, and he saw her jaw set hard again, her eyes ablaze with determination. She shoved the man in front of her, who stumbled and fell down a step, squashing into the people in front of him. She swung Roger down into the little space she\u2019d made, and with a twist of her shoulders and the heave of her whole body, hurled the little boy up, over the rail\u2014toward Jerry.</p><p>He saw what she was doing and was already leaning, pushing forward, straining to reach ... The boy struck him high in the chest like a lump of concrete, little head smashing painfully into Jerry\u2019s face, knocking his head back. He had one arm round the child, falling back on the people behind him, struggling to find his footing, get a firmer hold\u2014and then something gave way in the crowd around him, he staggered into an open space, and then his knee gave way and he plunged over the lip of the track.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear the crack of his head against the rail or the screams of the people above; it was all lost in a roar like the end of the world as the roof over the stair fell in.</p><p>The little boy was still as death, but he wasn\u2019t dead; Jerry could feel his heartbeat, thumping fast against his own chest. It was all he could feel. Poor little bugger must have had his wind knocked out.</p><p>People had stopped screaming, but there was still shouting, calling out. There was a strange silence underneath all the racket. His blood had stopped pounding through his head, his own heart no longer hammering. Perhaps that was it.</p> <p>The silence underneath felt alive, somehow. Peaceful, but like sunlight on water, moving, glittering. He could still hear the noises above the silence, feet running, anxious voices, bangs and creakings\u2014but he was sinking gently into the silence; the noises grew distant, though he could still hear voices.</p><p>\u2018Is that one\u2014?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nay, he\u2019s gone\u2014look at his head, poor chap, caved in something horrid. The boy\u2019s well enough, I think, just bumps and scratches. Here, lad, come up ... no, no, let go, now. It\u2019s all right, just let go. Let me pick you up, yes, that\u2019s good, it\u2019s all right now, hush, hush, there\u2019s a good boy ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018What a look on that bloke\u2019s face. I never saw anything like\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Here, take the little chap. I\u2019ll see if the bloke\u2019s got any identification.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on, big man, yeah, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, come with me. Hush, now, it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right ... is that your daddy, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No tags, no service book. Funny, that. He\u2019s RAF, though, isn\u2019t he? AWOL, d\u2019ye think?\u2019</p><p>He could hear Dolly laughing at that, felt her hand stroke his hair. He smiled and turned his head to see her smiling back, the radiant joy spreading round her like rings in shining water ...</p> <p>\u2018Rafe! The rest of it\u2019s going! Run! Run!</p><p>To the RAF flyers: \u201cNever have so many owed so much to so few.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
