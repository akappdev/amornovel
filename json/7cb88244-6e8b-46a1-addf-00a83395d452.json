The four girls had vanished from the unit dragging thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment with them and causing quite a commotion. The staff was frantic, desperate to find them before word of their disappearance leaked out. The only person not concerned was the man who held their futures in his hands. He insisted that the restless, mischievous adolescents had not escaped. They were pulling just another silly prank, no doubt orchestrated by Olivia MacKenzie, the ringleader. From the minute he\u2019d looked into those gorgeous, sparkling blue eyes, he\u2019d known she was going to be a troublemaker and a fighter.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. Olivia gave the other Pips\u2014Samantha Pearson, Jane Weston, and Collins Davenport\u2014strength and a voice. Until she\u2019d entered the program, the girls had been sullen, lethargic, and even borderline suicidal. And who could blame them? They spent most of their days in forced isolation, locked away from family and friends and the rest of the world. Members of the staff were constantly telling them how fortunate they were to have been chosen for the experimental program. Nurse Charlotte even insisted they were blessed.</p><p>The girls scoffed at the notion. All of them had a disease that, thus far, no drug had been able to conquer, and none of them felt the least bit fortunate to be human pincushions, subjected to a tremendous and sometimes unbearable amount of agony. The Pips were forbidden to call the wonder drug cocktail that was pumped into their veins poison, but that\u2019s what all of them believed it was. Excruciating pain followed each infusion, and by evening their bodies were covered with blisters from the tops of their heads to the bottoms of their feet. No, none of them felt blessed.</p> <p>Though the youngest of the group, Olivia was the strongest and the toughest, and she had quickly stepped into the role of protector. Once she had gained her new friends\u2019 trust, she began to chip away at the boredom and, more importantly, the anger and the fear.</p><p>Pranks were Olivia\u2019s specialty. Within two weeks of her arrival, the nurses and the doctors grew hesitant to open their lockers for fear of what was going to jump out at them. Nurse Charlotte developed a twitch in her left eyelid after a rubber snake sprang at her, delighting the Pips to no end.</p><p>As the girls became more fearless, their repertoire of mischief grew. Each had a favorite trick.</p><p>Jane, the artistic one in the group, had a flare for design. She could sit for hours with a notepad and pencil drawing shapes, then connecting them into beautiful mosaics. She loved symmetry and color, so when the others suggested they TP the nurses\u2019 station, she objected. She thought that would be too crass. Instead, she decorated the space from ceiling to floor with streamers of every color of the rainbow.</p><p>Samantha, or Sam as she was called by her friends, was the adventurer. She was unafraid of risk, but she wasn\u2019t reckless. She went about each of the pranks methodically. Every situation was patiently examined and carefully planned to achieve the desired result. It took her a week to collect enough lime Jell-O to fill all the specimen cups. After warming them in the nurses\u2019 microwave for a few seconds, she slipped the little beakers of green liquid onto the lab cart and sent them downstairs for analysis. The girls laughed for days remembering the sight of the red-faced nurse on the phone apologizing and trying to explain the mishap to the lab tech.</p> <p>Olivia had found it easy to bring Jane and Sam into the fun, but Collins had been more of a challenge. Because she was the most sensitive, it took her the longest to conquer her depression; but once she did, she was game for anything. Olivia designated her to be the decoy in their adventures. When the girls wanted to slip by the staff unnoticed, Olivia would send Collins to distract them. She was blessed with a sweet nature and a soft Southern accent that drew people to her, so when a teardrop or two would fall down her cheek, everyone would rush to console her. Once the tears began to flow, they\u2019d huddle around her and give her their full and undivided attention. A couple of faint sobs, and she had them\u2014especially the men\u2014eating out of her hands. Little did her sympathetic audience know, the other three Pips were behind them, strategically placing furry fake spiders in unexpected spots.</p><p>In an attempt to keep the Pips calm and in their beds, their specialist, Dr. Andre Pardieu, gave each of them a deck of cards and took the time one afternoon to teach them how to play poker. They were quick learners. By the end of the month the Pips had taken him for more than three hundred dollars. They used the cash to buy pizzas and cake for Nurse Kathleen\u2019s birthday and a few other fun items to torment the staff.</p><p>After spending several weeks in the hospital, the Pips fell into a routine. Monday was poison cocktail day, and they were too sick to play any pranks. Tuesday, they were still too ill to do more than lift their heads off their pillows, but by nightfall the blisters would disappear, and they would begin to feel human again. They decided that Wednesday would be orange wig day; Thursday would always be freak-out-the-nurses day, and on Friday, as a compliment to their doctor\u2014they all had a crush on him\u2014they would speak his native tongue, French, which was a real trick considering the fact that only Olivia understood the language. Weekends were spent on target practice with their water guns, working jigsaw puzzles, and doing crosswords. Olivia\u2019s aunt Emma was what Dr. Pardieu called a coconspirator. She sent Olivia the water guns and wigs and other novelties. Whatever her niece requested, she got.</p><p>Dr. Pardieu also had a routine. Each morning when he walked into the unit, he greeted the girls the same way: \u201cBonjour, mes petites pipsqueaks.\u201d</p><p>And they responded, \u201cBonjour, Docteur Pardieu.\u201d</p><p>Olivia came up with a new idea one Thursday. After the doctor had made his rounds, she suggested a game of hide-and-seek to torment the nurses. She had broken into an empty storage closet the week before and discovered the rectangular room had enough space to fit all of them. It was at the end of the newly constructed south wing, which would be dedicated and opened for patients the next month.</p> <p>The girls crept down the hall behind Olivia and slipped into the dark closet. They sat on the floor with their backs against the walls, two facing two, and stayed quiet while they strained to listen for every sound. The scent of disinfectant hung in the air around them. They could hear the supervisor calling their names as she clipped along the gray-and-white tile floor, her rubber-soled shoes squeaking with each step. When the sound faded, Olivia reached up and switched on the light.</p><p>All of them squinted against the sudden brightness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d Sam whispered, trying to stifle her laughter.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t stay here,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to keep looking for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOf course we want her to look for us. That\u2019s how we roll.\u201d</p><p>Jane was the most law-abiding of the four and whispered, \u201cWhat if she calls the police? We could get into serious trouble.\u201d She was twisting the tube on her IV while she fretted.</p><p>Sam rolled her eyes. \u201cShe won\u2019t call the police,\u201d she said. \u201cYou worry too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could call our parents,\u201d Jane suggested then.</p> <p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cMy mother has caller ID. As soon as she sees it\u2019s the hospital calling, she won\u2019t pick up. My disease is too stressful for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Mom has trouble coping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your father think?\u201d Collins asked the question. \u201cHe\u2019s never come to visit you,\u201d she remarked, a tinge of sympathy in her voice as she reached over and patted Olivia\u2019s hand. The girls could always count on Collins for emotional support.</p><p>\u201cNone of her family has visited,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re busy,\u201d Olivia answered with an indifferent shrug. \u201cMom flies back and forth between our homes in San Francisco and New York City. My parents have a strange marriage,\u201d she added, sounding very grown-up. \u201cMom adores him. She\u2019s . . . dramatic about it. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. She doesn\u2019t have room for anything else in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr anyone else,\u201d Collins said. Like daughters, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d Sam asked again.</p><p>\u201cOh, he likes the adoration. At least he used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean how does he cope with your illness? Is it too stressful for him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He ignores it. Sometimes I think he pretends I\u2019m at a sleepover. He used to call every week to see how I was doing. The last time I talked to him he asked me if I was having a nice time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Sam asked. She couldn\u2019t comprehend anyone being so oblivious. Her own family had taken her illness pretty hard, especially her four older brothers. Though they constantly reminded her that she was tough and could whip this thing, she knew on the inside they were worried.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Olivia insisted. \u201cHe loses track of time. At least that\u2019s what my sister, Natalie, tells me. She\u2019s always defending Mom and Dad. Nat would come see me if she could, but she\u2019s finishing college, and by the time she got off the plane here, she\u2019d have to turn around and go back. She\u2019s ten years older than I am,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t called here in a while, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very busy, too,\u201d Olivia responded.</p><p>\u201cI talked to your sister once,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYou were getting x-rayed and couldn\u2019t come to the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know this is the first time you\u2019ve talked so openly about your family?\u201d Jane remarked.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Collins asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s embarrassing. I\u2019m tired of making excuses for them,\u201d she blurted. \u201cMy family\u2019s dysfunctional. You\u2019re right, Sam. None of them has come to see me, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. Do you?\u201d</p><p>All three girls shook their heads. \u201cExactly,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAunt Emma is the only normal one. She doesn\u2019t like my father much, but I think it\u2019s because of the way my mother acts around him. Emma tries to hide how she feels when she talks to me, but I know. Once I heard her tell my mother she thought my father was shrewd with money but he was a nincompoop when it came to his family. She also said he was one of the most charismatic men she\u2019d ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Collins asked. \u201cThat he\u2019s smooth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolished, charming,\u201d Jane suggested. \u201cCharismatic isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt made it sound bad. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be listening to the conversation, so I couldn\u2019t ask her what she meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any charismatic men or women,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d</p><p>Olivia decided to change the subject. She wanted to talk about something else for a while. \u201cIf I get to grow up, I think I\u2019d like to catch criminals. No matter how talented and clever they might be, eventually they all make mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they always get caught.\u201d</p><p>If-I-get-to-grow-up was a morbid game the girls played every now and then, though never in front of Dr. Pardieu, because they knew he would make them stop. Each time Olivia played, she changed what she wanted to become if she got to grow up. Last week she thought she wanted to become a chef. The week before that she was certain she wanted to become a physician just like Dr. Pardieu. The week before that she was determined to become a newscaster.</p><p>\u201cYou could become a detective or an FBI agent,\u201d Collins said enthusiastically. \u201cIt would be cool to carry a gun. Maybe I\u2019ll become an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a klutz, Collins,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou\u2019d shoot yourself. And besides, you\u2019d probably cry every time you had to talk to a crime victim.\u201d</p><p>Her friend wasn\u2019t offended. \u201cI probably would,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIf I get to grow up, I\u2019m going to become\u2014\u201d Sam began.</p><p>\u201cA pilot,\u201d the other three Pips said in unison.</p><p>\u201cYes, a pilot,\u201d Sam agreed.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Sam, don\u2019t you ever think about any other careers?\u201d Jane asked, clearly exasperated. \u201cWhy are you so stuck on being a pilot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Sam began. \u201cMy grandfather was a pilot; my father is a pilot; my four brothers are pilots . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that means you have to be a pilot?\u201d Collins asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my blood,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI have to fly.\u201d</p><p>No one argued with her. Then Jane said, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have this horrible disease, we probably would never have met. Each one of us lives on a different side of the United States. Sam lives in Alaska; Olivia lives in California; Collins lives in Louisiana, and I live in upstate New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think fate would have pulled us together, no matter what,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been nice if it hadn\u2019t been a terminal disease that brought us together,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>Collins drew her knees to her chest. \u201cMy bum\u2019s getting cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>The girls shifted to get closer to one another for warmth.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak for a few minutes, and then Olivia broke the silence. \u201cAunt Emma thinks my father is going to leave my mother. She thinks that\u2019s the real reason he purchased the apartment in Manhattan.\u201d She had been worrying about the possibility that her parents would split up, and now that she\u2019d told her friends about her family, she decided to tell them the rest. She felt closer to the Pips than anyone. Maybe it was because of what they were all going through together: shared laughter and shared pain.</p><p>\u201cDivorce?\u201d Collins asked in a bare whisper, as though the word would sting if she said it any louder.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cIt will be a real nightmare if it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would your aunt give you such a worry?\u201d Sam wanted to know. \u201cYou have enough to deal with. You don\u2019t need any more problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I came here I made my aunt promise me she wouldn\u2019t keep anything from me, but I know she does sometimes. I want to know what\u2019s going on back home . . . the good and the bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce isn\u2019t such a big deal,\u201d Jane commented with a shrug. \u201cYou\u2019ll get through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of callous,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest. My parents fought all the time. Everything got better once the divorce was final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they fight about?\u201d Collins wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cMy big brother, Logan, mostly,\u201d she said. \u201cLogan was getting into all sorts of trouble with drugs and alcohol. It\u2019s a miracle he graduated from high school. Mom protected him, made excuses for him. Dad cut him off, refused to give him any more money, but Mom would sneak some to him. Dad got sick of fighting all the time and left. That gave Logan the freedom to do what he wanted, and my mom would just give in. He even talked her into trying to up the value on my life insurance policy. Ghoulish, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cWho gets the money if you die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, yes, it\u2019s ghoulish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe insurance company wouldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m a bad risk,\u201d Jane said.</p> <p>\u201cYou should stay alive just to spite your brother,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI plan to,\u201d she replied, smiling. \u201cSo, you see, Olivia, my family is as wacked as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Olivia argued. \u201cI could tell you stories that would turn your hair gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any hair, remember? The wonder drugs made it all fall out,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWe were already bald from the chemo when we got here,\u201d Collins reminded them. She gently brushed her fingertips across her bare forehead as though sweeping a stray lock into place. Exaggerating the lilt of her Southern accent, she said, \u201cSo you\u2019re going to have to take my word when I tell you I had the most fabulous blond hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, Olivia, and Sam could all be movie stars,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cSo could you,\u201d Olivia countered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so thin and pale. I have these dark circles under my eyes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Olivia wouldn\u2019t let her continue. \u201cThe medicine has just been rougher on you than the rest of us. When it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll see your beautiful self again.\u201d</p><p>Jane wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cBut Collins has blond hair and blue eyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous blond hair,\u201d Collins interrupted, smiling.</p> <p>Jane rolled her eyes, then continued on. \u201cOlivia, your eyes are such an intense, brilliant color of blue, so I\u2019m guessing your hair is blond, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cDark auburn,\u201d she corrected. \u201cYou\u2019ve got pretty hazel eyes, I\u2019ll bet your hair is light brown, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, you\u2019re the easy one,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYour eyes are green, so I think you\u2019re a natural redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to have dark brown hair, almost black,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over . . . if we make it . . .\u201d Jane began.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it.\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice was emphatic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to die yet,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Collins whispered. \u201cI have too much living to do, and I haven\u2019t even gotten started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will you three still be my best friends?\u201d Tears sprang into Jane\u2019s sunken eyes. There was no question that she was the most frail member of the group. Her pale skin looked almost translucent. Her voice was weak as she added, \u201cNo matter where we end up, no matter what we\u2019re doing . . . okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the others responded.</p><p>They made fists and gently tapped one another\u2019s knuckles to seal the promise.</p><p>\u201cFriends forever,\u201d Sam whispered.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cTill death do us part.\u201d</p><p>ONE</p><p>TWELVE YEARS LATER</p><p>Olivia MacKenzie was certain she would have been offered the job if she hadn\u2019t punched the boss during the interview. But knocking the man senseless turned out to be a real deal breaker.</p><p>The CEO of one of the largest investment firms in the country, Eric Jorguson, was now being questioned by an FBI agent. He wasn\u2019t cooperating. The agent had taken Jorguson to the opposite side of the terrace and was trying to get him to calm down and answer his questions. Jorguson was busy screaming at Olivia, threatening to have her killed and also to sue her because she\u2019d broken his jaw. She hadn\u2019t done any such thing, of course. The man was exaggerating. She\u2019d smashed his nose in, not his jaw. A waiter wearing the name tag TERRY pinned to his black vest stood next to her trying to soothe what he referred to as her extreme case of nerves. She wanted to punch him, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in shock,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s why you look so calm. The guy tears your dress and gropes you, and it\u2019s only natural for you to go into shock. Don\u2019t you think? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not crying and carrying on.\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d Now please leave me alone, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cHey, look,\u201d Terry said. \u201cThey\u2019re arresting Jorguson\u2019s bodyguard. What\u2019s the guy doing with a bodyguard, I wonder.\u201d A few seconds later he answered his own question. \u201cHe must need one. Especially if he attacks other women the way he attacked you. You think you\u2019d like to go out with me sometime?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to ease the rejection. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in shock, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia was angry, not hysterical. She stood by the table with her arms folded across her waist as she patiently waited for the FBI agent to get to her. She had been told it wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Terry tried twice more to engage her in conversation. She was polite but firm each time he attempted to get personal.</p><p>She watched the agents while she tried to figure out how she had gotten into this bizarre situation. Job hunting wasn\u2019t supposed to be dangerous. She had already interviewed with three other Fortune 500 companies without incident. Before she had gone to those interviews, however, she had done quite a bit of research. She didn\u2019t have that luxury with Jorguson Investments. Because the position had just become available, she\u2019d had less than a day to study the company\u2019s prospectus. She should have looked more closely before she agreed to the preliminary interview. Should have, could have, she lamented.</p><p>She hated job hunting and all the inane interviews, especially since she really liked her current job and the people she worked with. But there was talk of cutbacks. Serious talk, and according to some of the other employees, Olivia didn\u2019t have seniority. She would be one of the first laid off. It was important to her that she stay in her current job until she accomplished what she had set out to do, but it didn\u2019t look like that was going to happen. The only constant in Olivia\u2019s life right now was the mortgage. It had to be paid, no matter what, which was why she had to have job options.</p><p>She had gone to the office an hour earlier than usual this morning, finished two case files by noon, and headed over to Seraphina, a lovely restaurant with a stunning view. The five-star restaurant overlooked a manicured terrace, with tables strategically placed under a canopy of tree branches. Beyond was the river. Lunch was going to be a treat. She\u2019d never dined at Seraphina because of the expense, but she\u2019d heard that the food was wonderful. Grossly overpriced, but wonderful. No peanut butter and jelly sandwich today.</p><p>The hostess showed her to a table on the south side of the terrace. It was such a beautiful day with just a slight nip in the air, perfect for lunch outside.</p><p>The preliminary interview with Xavier Cannon, the company\u2019s lead attorney, had gone well, she thought, but he hadn\u2019t answered some of her more pressing questions and had suggested instead that she ask Jorguson. Cannon also mentioned that, if Jorguson liked her, he would offer her the job during lunch.</p><p>Jorguson was waiting for her. She spotted him across the busy terrace. He held an open folder in his hand and was reading a paper inside it. As she drew closer she could see that it was her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>For about twenty seconds she thought he was quite a charmer and a rather distinguished-looking man. He was tall and thin and had a bright, white smile.</p><p>He stood and shook her hand. \u201cBring the lady a drink,\u201d he snapped impatiently to a passing waiter.</p><p>\u201cIced tea, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>The waiter had already moved her chair for her, and she sat before Jorguson could come around the table to assist her.</p><p>Jorguson\u2019s cell phone rang, and without offering an apology or an excuse for the interruption, he turned his back to her and answered. His voice was low and angry. Whoever he was talking to was getting a dressing-down. His vocabulary was crude.</p><p>So much for charming, she thought. She tried to focus on her surroundings while she waited. The linen tablecloth draped all the way to the ground, and in the center of the round table was a crystal bowl of fresh-cut flowers in every color. She looked around her and smiled. It was a really pretty day.</p><p>Jorguson finished his call. He slipped the phone into his suit jacket and gave her his full attention, but the way he was staring at her quickly made her uncomfortable. She was about to ask him if something was wrong when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re stunning. Absolutely stunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful,\u201d he said then. \u201cXavier mentioned how pretty you were, but I still didn\u2019t expect . . . that is to say, I wasn\u2019t prepared . . .\u201d</p><p>Olivia was horrified by his close scrutiny. His leering inspection made her skin crawl. Jorguson wasn\u2019t just unprofessional; he was also creepy. She opened her linen napkin and placed it in her lap. She tried to turn his attention so he would stop gawking at her.</p><p>Typically she would have waited for him to lead the questioning, but the awkward silence and his inappropriate behavior compelled her to speak first.</p><p>\u201cThis morning I had a few minutes, and I pulled up your prospectus. Your company is quite impressive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was a note that last year you were investigated by the FBI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rudely cut her off with a wave of his hand. \u201cYes, but of course nothing came of it. It was simple harassment.\u201d He continued, \u201cThey didn\u2019t like some of my clients and wanted to make trouble, which was ridiculous. I should have sued, but I didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p><p>Sue the FBI? Was he serious or just trying to impress her with his power. His arrogance was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brand-new attorney, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two people ranked higher than you on the bar. I cannot tell you how remarkable that is. Still, you don\u2019t have much experience with contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHow did you find out about my scores? That\u2019s confidential\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand in the air again, dismissing her question. The gesture irritated her. She admitted then that pretty much everything about the man irritated her.</p><p>\u201cThere were quite a few others who applied for the position, and most of them have more experience than you, but when I discovered you were Robert MacKenzie\u2019s daughter, I moved you to the top of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my father?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her surprise.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who\u2019s anyone knows who your father is,\u201d he replied. \u201cI know people who have invested in your father\u2019s Trinity Fund and have made a handsome profit. Very impressive,\u201d he stated with a nod. \u201cI\u2019m considering adding the fund to my own portfolio. No one plays the market like your father does. He seems to have a knack for choosing the right investments. If you\u2019re half as clever as he is, you\u2019ll go far, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t given time to respond. He\u2019d already moved on. \u201cYou\u2019ll be wonderful working with our clients. With that smile of yours, you could get them to sign anything. Oh yes, they\u2019ll be as dazzled by you as I am,\u201d he gushed. \u201cAnd I have several powerful clients. Xavier will guide you. Now then, what questions do you have for me? I have a potential client meeting me here at one, so this will have to be a quick lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the SEC investigate when\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cNo, the SEC will never investigate me,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI\u2019m protected there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re protected? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a friend, and he has assured me . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou have a friend at the Securities and Exchange Commission?\u201d</p><p>Color crept up his neck. His eyes darted to the left, then to the right. Was he checking to make sure no one was listening to the conversation?</p><p>He leaned into the table and lowered his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have any worries there. As I just said, I won\u2019t be investigated, and since you\u2019re going to be working closely with me, I don\u2019t want you to be concerned.\u201d</p><p>Working closely with him? That thought made her cringe.</p><p>\u201cAbout this friend . . .\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNo more questions about the SEC,\u201d he snapped. He wasn\u2019t looking into her eyes now. He was staring at her chest. The longer he stared, the more indignant she became. She considered snapping her fingers several times in front of his eyes to get his attention but, wanting to remain composed and professional, decided to ask a question about the investments he\u2019d made.</p><p>Jorguson was slick; she\u2019d give him that much. He danced around each question but never really gave her any satisfactory answers.</p><p>The topic eventually returned to the SEC. \u201cWho is your contact?\u201d she asked, wondering if he would tell her. He was so smug and arrogant, she thought there was a good chance he might. She also wanted him to assure her that everything he did was legal, and she thought it was odd that he hadn\u2019t offered any such affirmation.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know? That\u2019s confidential information.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her chest again. She folded her napkin, smiled at Terry the waiter when he placed her iced tea in front of her, and handed him her menu.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be staying for lunch.\u201d</p><p>The waiter hesitated, then took her menu, glanced at Jorguson, and walked away.</p><p>Olivia was disheartened. The salary at Jorguson Investments was good, really good, but it had taken less than five minutes to know she couldn\u2019t work for this man.</p><p>What a waste of time, she thought. And money. She could have worn one of her old suits, but she\u2019d wanted to stand out, so she bought a new dress. It was expensive, too. She loved the fit and the color, a deep emerald-green silk. It had a high V-neck, so there was no need to wear a necklace. Diamond stud earrings, which were so tiny you could barely see the sparkle, and a watch were her only jewelry. She wore her hair down around her shoulders and had taken the time to use a curling iron.</p><p>Olivia looked at Jorguson. The degenerate was still staring at her chest. And for this she had curled her hair?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d she said.</p><p>She tried to stand. Jorguson suddenly bolted upright, grabbed the top of her dress, and ripped it apart. The silk material tore, exposing her collarbone and part of her black bra.</p><p>Appalled, she slapped Jorguson\u2019s hands away. \u201cWhat do you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing a wire? You are, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you asked me who my contact was. That investigation stalled, sweetheart. It\u2019s not going anywhere. The FBI\u2019s been after me for two years now, and they\u2019ve got nothing. I know for a fact they\u2019re following me. They won\u2019t ever get anything on me. They like to go after successful entrepreneurs. I\u2019m an honest businessman,\u201d he shouted into her chest. \u201cNow where\u2019s the damn wire? I know it\u2019s in there somewhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia was so shocked by his behavior, she bounced between disbelief and outrage. She shoved his hands away, pulled her top together, and said, \u201cIf you try to touch me again, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>He tried again, and she retaliated. She heard a crunching sound when she punched him and felt a good deal of satisfaction. It was short-lived. A giant of a man with a thick neck and bald head appeared out of nowhere. He was wearing a tailored black suit, but he looked like a thug. He was at the other end of the terrace and heading toward her. As Jorguson was screaming and holding his nose with one hand, he was waving to the big man and pointing at Olivia with the other.</p><p>\u201cMartin, see what she did to me?\u201d he howled. \u201cGet her, get her.\u201d</p><p>Get her? Was he twelve? Olivia could feel her face turning red. She kept her attention centered on the bodyguard as she jumped to her feet. His suit jacket opened, and she saw a gun. He hadn\u2019t reached for it, though, and was glancing around to see how many people were watching.</p> <p>She was in trouble, all right. She thought about taking off one of her stiletto heels and using that as a weapon, but she decided she could do more damage with it on. She spied Terry watching from the doorway with a cell phone to his ear. She hoped he was calling the police.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a permit to carry that gun?\u201d she demanded of the bodyguard, trying to make her voice sound as mean as possible. Now, why, in God\u2019s name, had she asked that? What did she care if he had a permit or not? She was slowly slipping her hand inside her purse to get to her pepper spray. She couldn\u2019t find it and realized then that, when she\u2019d changed purses, she\u2019d left the spray at home on her bedside table. A lot of good it would do her there.</p><p>The thug named Martin, zigzagging around the tables, was getting closer. The man was built like a sumo wrestler. Olivia figured she was on her own. The other diners were already beginning to scatter. She stepped back from the table, dropped her purse into the chair, and waited for the man to reach her. If he touched her, she\u2019d kick him where it mattered most, and if he blocked her, she\u2019d go for his knee or his midsection.</p><p>Jorguson, holding his bloody nose, was backing away but still pointing at her and shouting. \u201cHow dare you touch me. You\u2019re going to be sorry. I know people who will hurt you. You don\u2019t hit me and get away with it. Don\u2019t you know who I am and what I can do? One phone call is all it will take,\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead woman, Olivia MacKenzie. Do you hear me? A dead woman.\u201d</p><p>Of course she\u2019d heard him. She thought everyone within a ten-block area had heard him. She refused to give him any satisfaction by reacting, though, and that was probably why he was becoming more outrageous with his threats.</p> <p>Her attention remained centered on the bodyguard. She thought he would do his best to intimidate her in front of his employer, maybe even try to get her to apologize to Jorguson\u2014hell would freeze before she\u2019d do that\u2014but he surely wouldn\u2019t touch her. Not in front of all these people.</p><p>Or maybe he wouldn\u2019t care who was watching. Jorguson had shouted his intent to have her killed. Would this bodyguard try to top that crazy threat?</p><p>There was a wall of windows in the restaurant facing the river, and diners were crammed together, their faces plastered to the glass. Some had their cell phones glued to their ears; others were using the cell phone cameras to record the incident . . . for YouTube, no doubt. Certainly, most of them had witnessed Jorguson ripping her dress and then screaming after she\u2019d punched him. The man had howled like an outraged hyena. Surely they\u2019d heard his ridiculous threats, too.</p><p>The bodyguard took Jorguson\u2019s orders to \u201cget her\u201d to heart. He lunged. He grabbed her upper arm and twisted as he jerked her toward him. Pain shot up into her neck and down to her fingers. His grip was strong enough to break her bone.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at the crowd before turning back to her. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>A woman rushed out of the restaurant shouting, \u201cYou leave her alone.\u201d At the same time, two men in business suits ran past the woman to help Olivia.</p> <p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she demanded as she slammed the heel of her shoe into the top of his foot.</p><p>He grunted and let go. Olivia got in a solid kick, and he doubled over. But not for long. He quickly recovered and, roaring several grossly unflattering names at her, straightened and reached for his gun. His face was now bloodred.</p><p>Good Lord, was he going to shoot her? The look in his eyes suggested that he might. Apparently, Martin had forgotten his audience, or he no longer cared he was being watched. His impulse control had vanished. He had the most hateful look on his face as he pulled the gun from the waistband of his pants. The two businessmen coming to her aid stopped when they spotted the weapon.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he snarled as he lunged.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She threw a twelve-dollar glass of iced tea at him. He ducked.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d He spit the word and tried to grab her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you. Now get away from me.\u201d</p><p>The gun seemed to be growing in his hand. She backed away from him, and that infuriated him even more. He came at her once more, and before she could protect herself, he backhanded her. He struck the side of her face, his knuckles clipping her jaw. It was a hard hit and hurt like hell. The blow threw her backward, but even as she was falling, she didn\u2019t take her eyes off the gun.</p> <p>She landed on her backside, winced from the impact on her tailbone, and quickly staggered to her feet.</p><p>She understood what the expression \u201cseeing stars\u201d meant. Dazed, she tried to back away.</p><p>The thug raised his gun again, and suddenly he was gone. Olivia saw a blur fly past her, tackling the bodyguard to the ground. The gun went one way, and the thug went the other, landing hard. Within seconds her rescuer had the man facedown on the grass and was putting handcuffs on him while reading him his rights. When he was finished, he motioned to another man wearing a badge and gun who was rushing across the terrace.</p><p>With one of his knees pressed against the bodyguard\u2019s spine, the rescuer turned toward her. She suddenly felt lightheaded. She could have sworn she saw an ethereal glow radiating all around him and the sound of a singing choir echoing overhead. She closed her eyes and shook her head. The blow to her jaw must be making her hallucinate. When she opened her eyes again, the vision and the choir were gone, but the man was still there, looking up at her with beautiful hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked as he hauled the bodyguard to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOlivia MacKenzie,\u201d she answered. She sounded bewildered, but she couldn\u2019t help that. The last few minutes had been hair-raising, and she was having trouble forming a clear thought.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAgent Grayson Kincaid. FBI. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard finally found his voice. \u201cI was protecting my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a Glock?\u201d Kincaid asked. \u201cAnd against an unarmed woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kicked me.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile turned his expression. \u201cYeah, I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou attacked her,\u201d Kincaid snapped. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d be real quiet right now.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard ignored the suggestion. \u201cMr. Jorguson has known for a long time that the FBI has been tailing him and listening in on his private conversations. What you\u2019re doing is illegal, but you people don\u2019t play by the rules, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>Another agent grabbed hold of the bodyguard\u2019s arm and led him away. He didn\u2019t go peacefully. He was shouting for a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ronan,\u201d Kincaid shouted.</p><p>The agent dragging the bodyguard away turned back. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see it?\u201d</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cOh yeah, I saw it all. After I put this clown in the back of the car, I\u2019ll go get Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced around the terrace. In all the commotion she hadn\u2019t seen him slip away.</p><p>Kincaid nodded, then turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cThe gun is under the table,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>He walked over to her, and she flinched when he reached out to touch her. Frowning, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just want to see how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her protest. He gently pushed her hair away from the side of her face. \u201cYour cheek\u2019s okay, but he really clipped your jaw. It\u2019s already starting to swell. You need to put ice on it. Maybe I should take you to the emergency room, have a physician look at your arm, too. I saw the way he twisted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ll ice it,\u201d she promised when he looked like he wanted to argue.</p><p>He took a step back and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get to him faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got here before he shot me. He really was going to shoot me, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d She was still astounded by the possibility and getting madder by the second.</p><p>\u201cHe might have tried,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully nonchalant about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken him down before he shot you.\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone rang. She checked the number, then sent the call to voice mail. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a man rounding the corner of the building and glaring at her. He stormed toward her, just as Kincaid bent to retrieve the bodyguard\u2019s gun.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d the man shouted.</p><p>Since he was wearing a gun and badge, she knew he was also FBI. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined a perfectly good sting. Were you wearing a wire? Did you get anything we could use? No, I didn\u2019t think so. You weren\u2019t supposed to be here until one. We weren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>The agent screaming at her was an older man, late fifties, she guessed. His face was bright red, and his anger could light fires.</p><p>He moved closer until he was all but touching her, but she refused to be intimidated. \u201cStop yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not with the FBI,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>\u201cHow . . .\u201d The confused agent took a step back. He looked at Olivia, then at Kincaid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know if she was. Your undercover woman hasn\u2019t shown up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months\u2019 planning,\u201d the agent muttered. He pointed at Olivia. \u201cAre you wearing a wire? Jorguson seems to think you are. Are you with a newspaper or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoole, leave her the hell alone,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>Poole was staring at her chest. Uh-oh. Olivia knew where this was going.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to look for a wire, be advised. I\u2019ll punch you, too,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Distraught to have his investigation fall apart, Agent Poole stepped closer and said, \u201cListen, you. Don\u2019t threaten me. I could make your life a nightmare.\u201d He put his hand in front of her face and unfolded three fingers as he said, \u201cI\u2019m F . . . B . . . I.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It wasn\u2019t the reaction he expected. \u201cYou want to talk nightmares?\u201d she said. She put her hand up to his face and unfolded her three fingers. \u201cI\u2019m I . . . R . . . S.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>Olivia was still waiting with Terry the waiter by her side. He tried several more pickup lines, and when none of them worked, he finally shrugged and went back into the restaurant.</p><p>Agent Kincaid had told Olivia to stay put until he and the other agents dealt with Jorguson and his bodyguard. He hoped by the time they returned to her Agent Poole would have calmed down. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. Poole\u2019s expression bordered on homicidal. His eyes bulged, his jaw dropped, and his face contorted in a scowl. Had Kincaid not been so angry with him for deliberately ignoring orders, he might have laughed.</p><p>It was apparent that Poole still didn\u2019t want to believe that Olivia was just an innocent bystander. He planted his hands on the table and leaned forward. \u201cSomeone tipped you off that we were running this operation, right? You\u2019re with a newspaper or one of those trashy television shows, aren\u2019t you? Are you doing an expos\u00e9 on Jorguson or something? If you are, I\u2019ll shut you down,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>\u201cIRS,\u201d she quietly repeated.</p><p>\u201cI want proof.\u201d</p><p>She reached into her purse and pulled out an oblong laminated card. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>Kincaid thought she sounded almost cheerful, which didn\u2019t make any sense considering what she had just been through. She should have been on her last nerve, but Olivia MacKenzie\u2019s calm demeanor was impressive . . . not to mention her stunning beauty. Her eyes were a clear violet blue. Her complexion was flawless, and her lips were lush and full. From what he could see, her body was just about perfect, too. Full breasts, narrow waist, and long, shapely legs. It was one hell of a challenge not to stare at her. He hadn\u2019t experienced a reaction like this since he was a teenager.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Olivia said. She snatched her ID from Agent Poole and slipped it into her purse. Then she tried to leave. \u201cGood luck with Jorguson and Martin.\u201d She turned toward the parking lot, but Kincaid stopped her by grabbing hold of her hand. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet?\u201d she repeated, looking up at him. \u201cI really should return to work, and I\u2019m going to have to go home and change clothes first.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her protest, he gave Poole his full attention. \u201cShut this down and go back to the office,\u201d he said, his voice decisive and abrupt. \u201cYou and I need to have a word as soon as I\u2019m finished here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take?\u201d Poole demanded.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Poole gave Olivia one last glare and took off.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like I just ruined his life,\u201d Olivia remarked.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do at the IRS?\u201d</p><p>She could hear a smile in his voice. \u201cPretty much,\u201d she agreed. She tugged her hand away from his and asked, \u201cWhere exactly are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>He took her hand again and pulled her along toward the restaurant doors. She gave up on protesting. She could have argued, but she didn\u2019t think anything she said would matter. Agent Kincaid looked like the kind of man who was used to getting his way. The air of authority about him was a bit daunting, and she had the feeling he wasn\u2019t going to let her go anywhere until he was finished with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was being awfully familiar with her, holding her hand. Was he making sure she wouldn\u2019t bolt? The onlookers who were beginning to return to their tables parted to let them pass.</p><p>Five minutes later she was sitting alone at a table in a private dining room, waiting for Agent Kincaid to come back. A waiter had brought her a glass of ice water. She reached into her purse and retrieved her inhaler. All the commotion on the terrace had made her a little short-winded. She had been treated with some powerful drugs when she was a child, and one of the side effects was a touch of asthma. She never went anywhere without her inhaler.</p><p>She decided to call her boss, Royal Thurman, to let him know she was going to be late. He wouldn\u2019t really care, she knew, but it was the courteous thing to do. His phone went to voice mail, and she had just finished leaving a message when another call came in. She didn\u2019t recognize the number, but as soon as she heard the loathsome voice, she thought she knew who it was. Carl Simmons, her father\u2019s attorney, was on the line threatening her again.</p><p>\u201cYou were told to stop interfering,\u201d he said in a muffled whisper. \u201cThis is your last warning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d she demanded, knowing full well Carl wouldn\u2019t tell her. Still, there was always the hope his temper would get the better of him, and he\u2019d let it slip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forcing us to silence you. Do you want to get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can threaten me all you want. I\u2019m not going to stop.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t wait for a response. She ended the call and placed her phone on the table just as Agent Kincaid walked into the room. He had a small plastic bag with him.</p><p>Her hands were shaking. The phone call had gotten to her, but she didn\u2019t want the agent to notice, so she put her hands in her lap. He pulled out a chair, sat down facing her, and handed her the bag of ice. Then he asked her to tell him what led up to Jorguson\u2019s attack.</p> <p>She held the bag against the left side of her jaw while she talked. Twice during her explanation she put the bag down, and each time, he picked it up and put it back in her hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to hear any of Jorguson\u2019s threats, Agent Kincaid?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCall me Grayson,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, no, I didn\u2019t hear the threats. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>She repeated what Jorguson had shouted and added, \u201cHe was furious and out of control. \u2018One phone call and you\u2019re a dead woman.\u2019 He actually shouted that. He didn\u2019t seem to care who was listening. You and the other agents were planning to catch him today, weren\u2019t you? I\u2019m guessing I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and somehow that really botched up your plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right plan to begin with,\u201d Grayson admitted.</p><p>She could hear the irritation in his voice and surmised that the fault for the fiasco lay at the feet of Agent Poole, though Grayson wasn\u2019t going to say it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens to Jorguson now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking him in. We\u2019re not through talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure his lawyers are already on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many lawyers he has circling him. Jorguson isn\u2019t going anywhere until I\u2019m finished with him. Can you recall what he said to you?\u201d</p><p>She repeated everything she remembered of the conversation and added, \u201cYou might want to ask him who his friend at the SEC is. I doubt he\u2019ll tell you, but it\u2019s worth a shot. I\u2019m not even sure he was telling the truth. He\u2019s a braggart and very full of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson knew you worked for the IRS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe he thought I was out to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me if you were?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer the question, but said, \u201cDo you think I would have interviewed for a position in his company if I were investigating him?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other questions, Grayson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have your phone number. If I think of anything else, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d He handed her his card and added, \u201cAnd if you remember anything pertinent, you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d she agreed. She laid the bag of ice on the table and stood to leave. With a sigh she said, \u201cToo bad Jorguson couldn\u2019t have waited until after lunch to attack me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a shame,\u201d he said with a smile. He handed the ice back to her. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI was just kidding. I should go. I\u2019ve got so much to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? I\u2019m sure you must be, and I am, so let\u2019s eat. You took a hit for the FBI. The least we can do is offer you lunch. If you like seafood, the chowder\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you eat here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was torn. She loved seafood chowder. Really loved it. If the iced tea was twelve dollars a glass, she could only imagine what the chowder cost. She would insist on paying for her own meal, so the question was, did she want to spend a small fortune on lunch? No, she should go home, change her clothes, and eat a peanut butter sandwich. It would be dry because she was out of strawberry jam. Come to think of it, she was out of bread, too. And she really wanted chowder, now that Grayson had mentioned it.</p><p>Nope, she was going to be practical. Money didn\u2019t grow on trees, according to her mother, even though as a child, Olivia never once thought that it did.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much coaxing to get her to stay, especially after Grayson argued that it would be a professional courtesy.</p><p>Grayson removed his suit jacket, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice how broad his shoulders were and how muscular he was. He was certainly in shape, and she wondered how often he worked out to stay so fit. Dark brown hair and deeply tanned skin, he looked as though he\u2019d just stepped out of an ad in a sports magazine. She also noticed how impeccably dressed he was. His suit was definitely designer label. The cut and fit were perfect. Probably Armani or Prada, she guessed. His shirt was crisp, and his tie had a subdued design in a dark hue. For such a big man, he certainly wore his clothes well.</p><p>By comparison she was a mess. After she gave the waiter her order, she went to the ladies\u2019 room to freshen up and got a good look at herself in the mirror. She had grass in her hair and a gaping tear in the top of her dress. If that weren\u2019t enough, the left side of her jaw was already turning purple. She looked as though she\u2019d been in a barroom brawl.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much she could do to improve her appearance. She brushed her hair, put on some lip gloss, and tried to stop feeling embarrassed. Why did she care what Grayson thought about her appearance? After today, she probably would never see him again. She already knew he was out of her league. She had very little experience with men, but she had a feeling that Agent Grayson Kincaid was the James Bond of the FBI: a gorgeous man who loved women. Olivia knew she had no business judging him without knowing anything about him. She\u2019d bet a month\u2019s salary she was right, though.</p><p>She returned to the table, and while they waited for their orders, they talked about living in D.C., and he asked her several questions about her work. He seemed genuinely interested. By the end of lunch she was over her bout of nerves and was glad she had stayed. Once she tasted the chowder, she stopped obsessing about the cost. It was worth the price. She sat back, crossed one leg over the other, and asked, \u201cDid you grow up around here?\u201d She was curious to know if he would share any personal information.</p><p>\u201cNo, the family lived in Boston until I was in my teens. Then, because of my father\u2019s business, we moved to Washington, D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou travel a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to, before I joined the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver been to Europe?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes. What about you? Have you traveled much?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in San Francisco and D.C. Except for a few business trips, that\u2019s it. No, wait,\u201d she added. \u201cI went to Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ski?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. One of my best friends went through the Air Force Academy. I attended her graduation. Samantha\u2019s a pilot. She flies those sleek little jets now.\u201d</p><p>A waiter cleared the table while another placed fresh glasses of iced tea and dessert menus in front of them. His eyes were on Olivia, and he nearly knocked her glass over. She grabbed it before it spilled.</p><p>Grayson understood. It was difficult not to stare at her. He waited until they were alone again and then asked, \u201cWhat about you? Where did you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco until I was eleven. Then I moved to D.C. I\u2019ve been here ever since.\u201d</p><p>When he frowned, she realized the little slip she\u2019d made. She hadn\u2019t included her family when she told him she\u2019d moved. Maybe he hadn\u2019t noticed and was frowning about something altogether different. She hoped so. She didn\u2019t want to talk about those first years in D.C. It was too personal and too painful to relive, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to talk about her odd family.</p><p>Grayson\u2019s phone beeped, indicating he had a message. Olivia smiled. The distraction was just what she needed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you check it? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt can wait. You said you moved to D.C. Just you?\u201d</p><p>She pretended not to understand. \u201cD.C.\u2019s my home now. The crime\u2019s a problem and you have to be so careful, but I love the energy. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention family. You moved alone?\u201d</p><p>So much for distracting him. Grayson was an FBI agent, she reminded herself. Guess he was trained not to be distracted.</p><p>\u201cYes, I moved here without family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were just eleven years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly felt as though she was being interrogated, and she didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>\u201cBoarding school?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sure. Why not? \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Grayson knew he was making her uncomfortable, but he couldn\u2019t figure out why. What was she hiding? Olivia checked the time and reached for her purse. He didn\u2019t want her to leave just yet. He took a drink and casually asked, \u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised her. \u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ever gotten close?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and relaxed. \u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re FBI. You could find out anything you wanted to know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It wouldn\u2019t be as much fun, though.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had a beautiful smile. She thought he might be flirting with her now, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. She wasn\u2019t good at this. It was peculiar. Less than two minutes ago she couldn\u2019t wait to get out of here, and now she wanted to stay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the IRS,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could find out all about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. I can only work on the cases I\u2019m assigned,\u201d she said, and before he could pose another question, she asked, \u201cHow did you end up in the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished law school and didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. None of the offers appealed to me. My cousin, Sam Kincaid, worked for the FBI. His specialty is languages,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s also an attorney, and he thought I\u2019d be a good fit. Turns out he was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA law degree would certainly give you a leg up in the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cOkay, now it\u2019s my turn. How did a nice girl like you end up working for the IRS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring my third year of law school, I worked as a law clerk for Judge Bowen because I wanted to get as much experience as I could in family law. After I passed the bar, my goals changed, and I decided to learn about investigative work and tax law. I\u2019m now an attorney with the IRS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attorney, huh?\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he was surprised, but he was. He had pictured her sitting in a cubicle somewhere checking tax returns.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t everyone in Washington an attorney? I think it\u2019s a prerequisite to living here.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s about right.\u201d</p><p>The waiter presented the check inside a black leather folder. When she argued that she should pay the bill, Grayson slipped his American Express card inside.</p><p>\u201cNext time you\u2019re attacked during an interview, you can pay for lunch.\u201d</p><p>The likelihood of such a thing happening was ridiculous, but she decided to be gracious and thanked him.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you interviewing with Jorguson\u2019s company?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCutbacks, and since I\u2019m one of the newer employees, I have to assume I\u2019ll be one of the first to go. I was exploring other options,\u201d she explained. \u201cI hope I can stay with the IRS a little longer, though. I have a goal to accomplish there. I\u2019m learning so much about how to investigate financial crimes. I hound the investigators with all my questions. They\u2019ve been very patient with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stay with the IRS permanently if you could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would. When I first started, I wanted to learn and then move on. My primary interest is children\u2019s advocacy, but I now know I can\u2019t do that full-time because I\u2019d burn out too quickly. Working for the IRS is a nice balance. I had assumed the work would be boring, but as it turns out, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your goal at the IRS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d she dismissed with a shrug.</p><p>Grayson tilted his head and studied her, wondering what he was missing. Olivia was being evasive, and he felt that she was leaving out an important detail. She reminded him of his nephew, Henry. Talking to the eight-year-old took endurance, and getting the full story was nearly impossible.</p><p>He leaned forward. Olivia instinctively folded her hands in her lap and waited. She hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed how tense she was. She knew he wasn\u2019t through questioning her, and she also knew she was confusing him. Too late, she realized she shouldn\u2019t have mentioned anything personal, especially her goal.</p><p>\u201cLet me recap,\u201d he began, sounding very much like a professor now.</p><p>\u201cYou want to recap?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the laughter in her voice. \u201cYes, I do. You said you enjoy working at the IRS. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>She slowly nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming the cutbacks don\u2019t come, you\u2019d stay with the IRS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after you accomplish your goal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about children\u2019s advocacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing some work on weekends and evenings when necessary for Judge Bowen and Judge Thorpe. It can get intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this goal of yours legal?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Grayson suddenly realized how much he was enjoying this bizarre conversation. He liked being with her. When she smiled, a dimple appeared in her right cheek, and her eyes fairly sparkled. Damn, she was pretty. Everything about her appealed to him. Whatever perfume she was wearing was a real turn-on. It was so feminine and sexy. So were her legs.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me what your goal is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gave him the sweetest smile she could muster. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p> <p>To his credit, Grayson didn\u2019t pressure her to explain. She wondered how he would have reacted if she\u2019d oh-so-casually said, \u201cMy goal? I want to put my father in prison . . . or die trying.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe the \u201cor die trying\u201d was a little over the top, but she was more certain than ever that she had to do something to stop him.</p><p>Everyone has a breaking point, and Olivia would never forget the night several months ago when she\u2019d reached hers. She had just passed the bar and wanted to celebrate with her aunt Emma. The day hadn\u2019t started out great. In fact, it was hellish. It was a Saturday, she remembered, and there were a hundred things she\u2019d wanted to get done before nightfall. Unfortunately the best-laid plans . . .</p><p>She had overslept a full hour because she forgot to set her alarm on her iPhone; her right front tire had blown out while she was driving sixty miles per hour on the highway; she had tripped over a small pothole she hadn\u2019t noticed when she was crossing the street, skinning both knees; and the strap on her favorite purse had snapped. The most upsetting offense of all: the leather on her brand-new shoes got scuffed. Needless to say, by five o\u2019clock she wasn\u2019t in the best of moods.</p><p>Emma would fix that. Just being around her aunt made everything better. Olivia changed her clothes and headed over to Emma\u2019s gorgeous colonial house to have dinner with her. Her aunt was such a sweet, loving woman; she had a knack for making everyone she was with feel good. Olivia would leave her frustrations and worries at the door, and she knew that by the time she sat down to a delicious dinner prepared by Emma\u2019s longtime cook, Mary, she\u2019d be laughing and having a fine time, listening as Emma regaled her with the most wonderful stories about her travels around the world. Whenever she spoke of her late husband, Daniel, her voice would soften and sometimes her eyes would get misty with her memories. After all these years, Emma\u2019s love hadn\u2019t waned, and some of the stories she told were so romantic.</p><p>Olivia missed her uncle very much. He was a kind and generous man, and though he was an extremely successful businessman with tremendous demands on his time, he never left any doubt that Emma came first. It was obvious to everyone who knew them that they were crazy about each other. While Olivia knew better than to wish for marriage and happily ever after, she loved listening to her aunt talk about him and their life together.</p> <p>Olivia arrived at Emma\u2019s house at dusk. She drove through the gates and up the long driveway that circled in front of the three-story Georgian mansion. A dark sedan sat parked near the steps that led to the main door. Olivia didn\u2019t recognize the car, and as she got closer she could see the figure of a man sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. She had to pass the car to reach her usual parking space behind the house, and when she was a few yards away, she recognized the man. He was Carl Simmons, her father\u2019s attorney. He was looking down at his phone and didn\u2019t turn his head or look in her direction. Olivia felt a knot forming in her stomach. If Carl Simmons was here, that meant her father was inside with Emma. She hadn\u2019t counted on running into her father tonight, and she didn\u2019t look forward to the encounter. She pulled around the house and parked outside the garage as was her habit when she had lived with Emma. She entered through the back door, and as soon as she walked into the kitchen, she could hear raised voices. The housekeeper, a robust woman named Harriet, looked relieved to see her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Harriet put her finger over her lips in an unspoken command to keep silent, then motioned for Olivia to follow her into the laundry room. She pulled the door shut behind her and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so thankful you\u2019re here. Mary certainly got hold of you quickly, didn\u2019t she? She only just went upstairs to get her phone so she could text you.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Olivia\u2019s phone beeped, indicating she had just received a text.</p><p>\u201cNo, I stopped by to have dinner with all of you. I heard shouting when I came into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fight,\u201d Harriet said, nodding for emphasis. \u201cA big one. Your father and your aunt are having it out. Something terrible happened and Emma is enraged. Mary and I have never seen her like this. And your father is getting meaner and meaner. He threatened her, Olivia, and he\u2019s saying such terrible things about your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fight\u2019s about my mother?\u201d she asked, trying to understand.</p><p>Harriet shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but your father dragged your mother into it. From what I overheard, it\u2019s about some charity that lost money.\u201d</p> <p>The poor housekeeper was beside herself with worry. She kept folding and refolding a dish towel. \u201cEmma never raises her voice,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo you can see how serious this situation is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cHarriet, you said my father threatened Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. Something to do with your mother. Whatever it was upset Emma.\u201d</p><p>Olivia opened the door. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go in now and see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I offer a suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d listen at the door to find out what\u2019s going on. Once Emma sees you, she\u2019ll stop the argument, and you\u2019ll never know what it was about.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was right. Since Olivia was a little girl, Emma had tried to shield her from any unpleasant family conflicts. Even though Olivia was an adult now, Emma continued to protect her.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t like the idea of eavesdropping on a private conversation, but she thought she just might linger at the door for a few minutes to get the gist of the argument. That wouldn\u2019t be considered eavesdropping, would it? Of course it would, she admitted. But right or wrong, she was still going to do it.</p><p>As it turned out, she couldn\u2019t lean against the door because Mary had gotten there first. That didn\u2019t matter, though. Olivia could hear every word from down the hallway.</p><p>Her father\u2019s voice was furious. \u201cIf you try to make trouble, I\u2019ll leave Deborah, and you know what that will do to her. She says she can\u2019t live without me. Shall we find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Emma challenged. \u201cLeave my sister. You\u2019ve made the threat to divorce her how many times now? I\u2019m not giving you any more money to stay with her. I made that mistake years ago, and I won\u2019t make it again. My sister may be a fool but she deserves better, and if she can\u2019t see it, then she\u2019ll have to wallow in self-pity when you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Deborah does anything crazy, it will be on your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting she might harm herself? What do you suppose that will do to your reputation, Robert? Investors want stable managers, and they don\u2019t like scandal. Tell me,\u201d she continued, \u201cdid you ever love Deborah?\u201d</p><p>Olivia stopped a few feet from the door. Mary, Emma\u2019s cook for the past twelve years, a sturdy German woman who always wore her silver-gray hair pulled back in a tidy bun, stood in front of her, unaware that she\u2019d approached. Looking embarrassed to be listening in on a conversation that had become so personal, Mary turned to leave and saw Olivia standing behind her. After giving her a sympathetic smile and a pat on the arm, Mary went down the hall toward the kitchen. Olivia stepped up to the door. It was open a crack and the voices were loud and clear. She waited for her father\u2019s answer to Emma\u2019s question, but she didn\u2019t hear one.</p><p>Then Emma asked, \u201cAre you capable of loving anyone but yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question\u2019s ridiculous. You still haven\u2019t told me what you plan to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Jeff Wilcox?\u201d Emma asked. \u201cThat depends on you. Are you going to stand by and do nothing while Jeff goes to prison because of your lies?\u201d</p><p>Olivia leaned forward and peeked into her aunt\u2019s study through the tiny opening in the doorway. She saw her father pick up a magazine from the desk and flip through it nonchalantly as he responded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. Stand by and do nothing. I didn\u2019t put a gun to his head and force him to give me the money and make the investments for his charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, if I had known that he was going to do that, I would have put a stop to it immediately. If Daniel were alive, he would never have let Jeff get involved with you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia recognized the name. Jeff Wilcox had been her uncle Daniel\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He was the son of close personal friends of her aunt and uncle, and when he had graduated from college, he had gone to work for Daniel. Olivia was away at school at that time, but she remembered seeing Jeff at a couple of gatherings. She\u2019d heard her aunt and uncle speak of him many times. From what they said, he was a courteous and easygoing young man who often expressed his gratitude for the opportunity her uncle had given him and the kindnesses shown to him by her aunt. Shortly after her uncle died, she\u2019d heard that Jeff had taken a position with a charitable organization.</p><p>\u201cHe knew there were risks,\u201d she heard her father say.</p><p>\u201cYou set him up,\u201d Emma cried. Olivia had never heard her aunt so upset. \u201cYou lied to him. He would never have invested the charity\u2019s funds if he had any inkling that they weren\u2019t safe. I know Jeff. He\u2019s honest and decent. He has a wife and a new baby now. He wouldn\u2019t risk that. Have you no conscience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did what he asked,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault if his board of directors thought he misappropriated the funds. I offered him several investment strategies, and he made the final decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecisions based on the lies you told him,\u201d Emma countered.</p><p>\u201cWilcox isn\u2019t such an upstanding citizen,\u201d he snapped. \u201cGreed was his downfall. He demanded a fee from me for investing the charity\u2019s funds, and I\u2019ve got the signed papers to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies, all lies,\u201d she cried out. \u201cJeff would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his word against mine,\u201d her father snapped. \u201cAnd when the authorities investigate, they\u2019ll see that the evidence is on my side. The documents clearly show that there were risks with the investments and no guarantees. Documents that he signed, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had heard enough. She took a deep breath, opened the door, and walked inside. Neither Emma nor her father noticed her. They stood with their backs to the door. The window was on her father\u2019s right and she could see his reflection. His eyes were cold and his jaw was clinched.</p><p>\u201cHow much did Jeff Wilcox give you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Robert MacKenzie turned to her, the contemptuous scowl gone, replaced by a dazzling smile. She\u2019d been told that women adored him and that, if he hadn\u2019t decided to go into the Wall Street world, he could have made millions as a movie star. Tall and fit, with thick silver-tipped hair and eyes as blue as hers, he was considered devastatingly handsome, but it was his charm that captured his clients. Men believed they were in his inner circle, and women thought he wanted them in his bed. He had never cheated on his wife, though, for to do so would diminish his carefully constructed persona. He had learned to use all of his attributes to captivate and to hypnotize. Besides, money was far more important and arousing than sex. Very few people knew the real Robert MacKenzie, the devil hiding beneath the angel\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling. How long have you been standing there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d she lied. \u201cI just heard you talking about Jeff Wilcox. What have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Your aunt was misinformed,\u201d he said, shaking his head and never letting the smile fade. \u201cAs usual,\u201d he added. He walked over to her, put his hands on her shoulders, and leaned down to kiss her on her cheek. \u201cHow are you feeling? Are you taking your medicine every day?\u201d</p><p>It always came back to her health. She believed it was her father\u2019s way of reminding her that she was flawed in his eyes. He knew how to manipulate her and make her feel inferior. When she was younger, it had worked, but no longer.</p><p>Olivia looked at Emma to gauge her reaction. Her aunt\u2019s gaze was locked on Robert, and her face was flushed with anger.</p><p>Olivia stepped back, then walked over to stand next to her aunt in a show of loyalty. \u201cFather, I haven\u2019t had to take medicine for years. You know that.\u201d Turning to Emma, she said, \u201cTell me about Jeff Wilcox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer that,\u201d Robert ordered. \u201cOlivia doesn\u2019t need to concern herself with business matters, especially in her weakened condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop\u2014\u201d Olivia began to protest.</p><p>Her father cut her off when he said to Emma, \u201cMy daughter is so starved for affection, she\u2019ll believe anything you say, Emma, and she\u2019ll try to help because you\u2019ve shown her that you care. If you get her involved in this, the stress could prove to be too much for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Robert, your daughter has grown up and is quite healthy. Stop trying to make her an invalid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Jeff,\u201d Olivia repeated. She folded her arms and leaned back against the desk, leaving no doubt that she wasn\u2019t going to budge until she got an explanation.</p><p>Her father refused to respond. Emma didn\u2019t have any such qualms. \u201cJeff became the manager of the Walden Foundation. They help the indigent and the homeless by providing housing and job programs. They\u2019ve had a tremendously successful track record. The man who started the charity had, himself, been homeless and had been helped by a kind stranger. When Walden\u2019s luck turned, he vowed he would help others, and he started the charitable foundation. He died several years ago, but he left thirty-two million dollars for his charity to continue, and Jeff was brought in as its director. The position was perfect for Jeff. He always wanted to do work that would make a real difference in the world. And he was doing a great job I understand . . . until he met your father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJeff gave him the money to invest,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s gone,\u201d she concluded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cAll of it squandered in risky investments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe risks were clearly explained,\u201d her father argued.</p><p>Emma ignored his protest and continued, \u201cThe board of directors had allowed Jeff autonomy to make these investments because he had given them assurances that everything was in secure funds. Of course, when the investments went under, they called for an investigation. Your father had guaranteed that all of the investments were protected and had the highest ratings possible, and Jeff, being the trusting and decent man that he is, believed him.\u201d She shot Robert a look of contempt.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s father shook his head and smiled condescendingly at her. \u201cHe was lying, Emma. The papers he signed clearly show he was made aware of the risks.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned back to Olivia. \u201cThe prosecutors are involved now. They\u2019re claiming that Jeff not only mishandled the money but also that he did it knowingly and with the intent of lining his own pockets. If there\u2019s a trial and he\u2019s convicted, he could go to prison and be taken away from his wife and his baby\u2014all for something I know he didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to her father. \u201cHow much did you make on these investments?\u201d</p> <p>Her father gave a slight shrug and answered, \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to keep people from making stupid decisions. If Wilcox had chosen to invest in my Trinity Fund, he wouldn\u2019t be in this mess, but he insisted on another route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Olivia insisted.</p><p>\u201cMy five percent commission for the transactions was a low fee, considering the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you walked away with over a million and a half, and Jeff Wilcox faces prison\u2014not to mention the charity that is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wasted enough time talking about this,\u201d her father said as he began making his way to the door. \u201cI have to be back in New York for an event tonight.\u201d</p><p>Olivia could barely control her anger. Her chest was tight, and she desperately needed to use her inhaler, but she didn\u2019t dare in front of him. It would be one more thing to mock, and it would prove to him that she was, indeed, inferior.</p> <p>She had known that her father\u2019s business activities were suspect in the past, but it was as though she was seeing him without a filter for the first time. Even his attire seemed disingenuous, with his hand-tailored suit and his handsome cashmere scarf draped around his neck. Olivia watched him slip on a black wool coat that was impeccably cut and a perfect fit.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He said as he put on one leather glove and reached for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cThis has to stop. You can\u2019t continue to hurt people this way.\u201d</p><p>Her father turned back to her with a compassionate smile. \u201cGet some rest, Olivia. You look pale. That terrible disease you have . . . it\u2019s lurking under your skin . . . waiting. You never know when it could come back.\u201d He left without saying good-bye.</p><p>Monday morning, Olivia applied for a job with the IRS.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking,\u201d Olivia told Jane. \u201cAgent Kincaid asked me how I ended up working for the IRS, and once I started explaining . . . it got away from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you tell him you\u2019re investigating your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I went on and on about reaching my goal, and he naturally wanted to know what the goal was. I wouldn\u2019t tell him, of course. I barely know the man. He has to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>The two women were sitting side by side in beige leather recliners in what they called the Dracula room of St. Paul\u2019s Hospital. Olivia was giving blood her friend would receive the following afternoon.</p><p>Dressed in black silk pajamas and a hot-pink robe, birthday gifts from Sam and Collins, Jane had come down from her hospital room to keep Olivia company. Jane\u2019s long honey-brown hair was up in a ponytail and she looked pale, terribly pale. Dr. Pardieu had ordered the blood transfusion and had told Jane that it would help immensely. It had in the past, he reminded her, and there was no reason to think it wouldn\u2019t help now.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t care what other people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cBut Grayson\u2019s . . . different. I do care what he thinks about me, and honest to Pete, I don\u2019t have the faintest idea why.\u201d She sounded bewildered.</p><p>\u201cGrayson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Grayson Kincaid. He told me to call him Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said and was surprised by the stab of disappointment she felt. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else. Did I mention that Jorguson told me he admires my father and that he knows people who have done quite well investing in his fund?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must not have heard that you\u2019re trying to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he have heard? Every time I make an inquiry or lodge a complaint, it\u2019s squelched. No one\u2019s calling me back, the SEC . . .\u201d She took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, but I\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me everything that happened at the interview,\u201d Jane said. \u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Since Jane was looking so sickly, Olivia decided to accommodate her, and by the time she was finished, Jane had a stitch in her side from laughing so hard.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You asked Jorguson\u2019s bodyguard if he had a permit to carry a gun? The man\u2019s pointing a . . . what did you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Glock. Agent Kincaid called it a Glock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then, he\u2019s pointing a fancy Glock at you, and you want to know if he has a permit?\u201d Jane thought, given the circumstances, the question was hilarious, and she couldn\u2019t stop laughing.</p><p>Olivia handed her a tissue to wipe the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI watch way too much television, don\u2019t I? On all those police shows the detectives ask the criminals if they have permits. I was trying to think of something to say to get him to stop coming toward me. It\u2019s illegal for him to even carry the gun. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t point that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you scared?\u201d</p><p>If an outsider had asked her that question, she probably would have pretended that it was no big deal, she hadn\u2019t been scared at all. She wanted people to think she was a tough, no-nonsense kind of woman. Only Jane and the other Pips knew the real Olivia. They understood her vulnerability because they were just like her.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I was scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was also so astonished by his behavior I could barely think what to do, and I was angry, really angry. People shouldn\u2019t bring guns to five-star restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a rule?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cIt sounded like one, didn\u2019t it? I guess I just didn\u2019t want to die in such a lame way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting shot during an interview is a lame way to die.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI can think of better ways. Don\u2019t laugh at me. I\u2019m giving you my blood, which happens to have antibodies you need, so be nice to me.\u201d</p><p>A nurse came into the room to check Olivia\u2019s IV. After saying hello, Jane switched to French as she continued the conversation. Because of their crush on Dr. Pardieu, all the Pips eventually had become fluent in his language. It was their way of saying thank you to him for saving them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always nice to you,\u201d Jane said. Then, in the blink of an eye, she became melancholy. \u201cWhat if the transfusion doesn\u2019t work this time? What if I don\u2019t feel better and I have to start chemo again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe transfusion will work,\u201d Olivia assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real contradiction, you know that?\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou\u2019re such an optimist with everyone, but when it comes to yourself, you only see the negative.\u201d</p><p>Dismissing her criticism, Olivia responded, \u201cThe transfusion helped in the past, and there\u2019s no reason to think it won\u2019t help now. You\u2019re just a little anemic, that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t stop trusting Dr. Pardieu. He\u2019s taken good care of all of us.\u201d</p><p>Jane was in the mood to feel sorry for herself. \u201cBut you and Collins and Sam have all been cured. I\u2019m the only one struggling after all this time. I don\u2019t understand it. I was feeling great until a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in remission,\u201d she corrected. \u201cNot cured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu said you\u2019re safe now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd none of you have had any symptoms for years. I\u2019m the difficult one.\u201d Jane knew she sounded pitiful, but she didn\u2019t care. She usually tried to be the positive, upbeat one, but she knew she didn\u2019t have to put up any shields with Olivia or the other Pips. She could cry like a three-year-old if she wanted to and not worry that any of them would think less of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been difficult,\u201d Olivia said, smiling. \u201cSam says you can be a real pain in the . . .\u201d</p><p>Jane burst into laughter. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not going to get any \u2018there, there, you poor thing\u2019 from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you ever get any of that from me?\u201d She shifted position in the recliner and winced when the needle moved ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Dr. Pardieu isn\u2019t worried . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever lied to any of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact, he\u2019s been brutally honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if he isn\u2019t worried . . .\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled because she realized she was actually feeling much better. A little whining wasn\u2019t such a bad thing after all. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have to do another round of chemo, I\u2019m going to participate in the art show at the Scripts Gallery. The artists have to be there,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ll have four paintings on display. Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and sell one or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you low on funds? I could give you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got more money than I know what to do with from my mom\u2019s life insurance. I\u2019m just saying, getting paid for my work is validation. I want you to come to the gallery, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know when and where, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2019s going to try to come to the show, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s out of rehab?\u201d Olivia\u2019s surprise was evident in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing really well this time. He seems serious about his sobriety. He\u2019s going to meetings every single day, and he\u2019s trying to make amends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe comes to see me every evening on his way home from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan has a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working as a mechanic at Roger\u2019s Rent-A-Car company. He helps out at the counter, too. Logan says the owner is giving him more responsibility, and he doesn\u2019t want to let him down. He worries about me. He never used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was too drunk and too stoned to worry about anyone.\u201d She saw Jane\u2019s expression and hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was true, but not any longer. He brings me carryout and told me that when I get home, he\u2019ll come over and cook for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe rehab worked this time,\u201d Olivia said, though she didn\u2019t hold out much hope. Jane was an eternal optimist. Olivia wasn\u2019t. Logan hadn\u2019t gone willingly; rehab had been court mandated. Jane\u2019s older brother had been a mess for as long as Olivia had known Jane. He drank alcohol like water, and his drug of choice was cocaine.</p><p>She hoped for Jane\u2019s sake that Logan had decided to change his life. She was about to ask another question about Logan when he walked into the room. He was tall, gaunt, and painfully thin, but there was a light in his eyes Olivia hadn\u2019t seen before. He put his finger to his lips to let Olivia know he didn\u2019t want her to say anything, then quietly snuck up behind Jane. He leaned down and whispered, \u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>Jane jumped. \u201cLogan, will you stop doing that,\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy you think it\u2019s funny to scare people is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHi, Olivia. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He turned to Jane then. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over this hospital looking for you. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s giving me her blood,\u201d Jane said. \u201cShe\u2019s keeping me alive with her antibodies.\u201d She realized she shouldn\u2019t have joked when she saw Logan\u2019s expression. He looked stricken. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to protect me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019re sick. Always tell me the truth, okay? I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s anemic, that\u2019s all,\u201d Olivia said, trying to help Jane downplay her illness.</p><p>\u201cAnd your blood will make her better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Jane said and then hastened to change the subject. \u201cWhat about the art show? Did you get permission?\u201d Turning to Olivia she explained, \u201cLogan has a nine o\u2019clock curfew at the halfway house.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned. \u201cYes, I got permission. I can stay out until ten thirty.\u201d He leaned down and kissed Jane on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got a meeting in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jane waited until Logan had left the room and then said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cI think he\u2019s on the right track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too. He\u2019s different now in a good way. He\u2019s been clean and sober over a hundred and twenty days. That\u2019s the longest he\u2019s ever gone,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t hanging out with all those losers anymore. I wish Mom were alive to see his recovery.\u201d</p><p>Jane took a breath. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re through talking about my brother. I\u2019ve got really funny news to tell you. You\u2019ll never guess what Collins did. I\u2019m not supposed to tell you because she wants to, but you need to be warned so you won\u2019t laugh the way I did. She was furious with me. I couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d she added. \u201cI swear you\u2019ll never, ever guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took the exam and she passed. Aced the interviews, too. In fact, they actually recruited her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI,\u201d Jane said. \u201cCollins has decided to become an FBI agent. It\u2019s kind of ironic, don\u2019t you think?

It was a mistake,\u201d Olivia argued. \u201cCollins in the FBI\u2014that\u2019s a good one.\u201d She laughed. Miss Sensitivity an agent? Not possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Can you picture it? Collins carrying a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDibs on telling Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already tried,\u201d she said. \u201cI got voice mail. She\u2019ll get back to me when she can.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia\u2019s cell phone rang, interrupting their conversation. Before she looked at the iPhone screen, she checked her watch.</p><p>\u201cTalk about a pain in the backside,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cNatalie\u2019s right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s on time? On time for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been calling every night for the past five nights at exactly seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better answer it. You may explain after you talk to her . . . if you want to explain . . . unless it\u2019s private . . .\u201d</p> <p>Exasperated, Olivia said, \u201cYou know I tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded. \u201cI know. I was being sensitive. It\u2019s a new thing I\u2019m trying. Now answer your damned phone. I want to hear what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t want to talk to her sister, but she knew that, if she didn\u2019t answer the call now, Natalie would continue to phone her every fifteen minutes until she got hold of her. Her sister was as tenacious as a junkyard dog, and in some instances just as mean.</p><p>\u201cHello, Natalie. What\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>Her sister wasn\u2019t in the mood to be chatty. \u201cDid you talk to Aunt Emma yet?\u201d</p><p>Olivia counted to five before she answered the question, hoping to get rid of some of her anger before she spoke. It didn\u2019t help. \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d Her voice was emphatic.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s home from London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Natalie\u2019s long, drawn-out sigh over the phone. \u201cDon\u2019t you care about our mother?\u201d</p><p>Here comes the drama, Olivia thought. She really wasn\u2019t in the mood to put up with Natalie\u2019s antics tonight. She\u2019d had enough drama today.</p><p>\u201cIs Mother there with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I speak with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the other line talking to our father . . . you know, Robert MacKenzie, the man you\u2019ve been ignoring.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia couldn\u2019t resist a bit of sarcasm. \u201cI thought I was ignoring our mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude,\u201d Natalie snapped.</p><p>Olivia vowed she wouldn\u2019t let her sister goad her into an argument, no matter how abrasive she became, and so she remained silent.</p><p>Another sigh, then Natalie said, \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you talk to Aunt Emma and convince her to come to our father\u2019s birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis birthday isn\u2019t for several months,\u201d Olivia stated.</p><p>\u201cThese big celebrations take time. It\u2019s going to be an amazing event,\u201d she said, enthusiasm lacing her words. \u201cOne of Dad\u2019s assistants booked the grand ballroom at the Morgan Hotel over a year ago, and we\u2019re expecting as many as three hundred guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred for a birthday party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Amazing was obviously Natalie\u2019s word of the day. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazing. But here\u2019s my question. Dad lives in Manhattan. Why is he having a birthday party in Washington, D.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s going to be another party in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo birthday parties?\u201d she asked and began to laugh. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little narcissistic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t want to exclude anyone, and all those men and women who invested in the MacKenzie Trinity Fund want to celebrate with him. He\u2019s made them all rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting they were already rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Dad\u2019s a financial genius, and he has more than doubled their investments. So many of his investors live in D.C., and that\u2019s why he decided to throw a party there, too. There\u2019s going to be at least three senators and twice that many congressmen attending the party and a couple of ambassadors, too.\u201d Natalie sounded starstruck.</p><p>\u201cWas every investor invited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That would have made the number of guests well over a thousand. Just the high-income investors were invited. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like it will be,\u201d she said to placate her sister.</p><p>\u201cSo you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Emma has to be there,\u201d she cried out. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, pay attention. You know how important Emma is. And powerful. How many boards do you think she\u2019s on? And she\u2019s a huge patron of the arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on three boards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an influential member of society,\u201d Natalie said. She sounded calmer now, more in control. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t attend the birthday party, it will be noticed. People will talk, and Mother will be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Aunt Emma cares what people say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mother does,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThis is tearing her apart. She can\u2019t stand the rift. It\u2019s terrible that Emma won\u2019t talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it was our mother who started the silent treatment when Emma told her she\u2019d changed her trust. Our mother and father aren\u2019t getting any of her money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d Natalie insisted. \u201cShe\u2019s just happy that you and I are still beneficiaries. We\u2019ll both get large sums when Emma\u2019s gone, and I will gladly hand it over to our father to invest. Unlike you, I\u2019m loyal.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s callous and mercenary attitude was making Olivia sick. \u201cWasn\u2019t the money you got from Uncle Daniel\u2019s trust enough, Natalie? Now you can\u2019t wait to get your hands on more?\u201d</p><p>Olivia heard Natalie\u2019s husband, George, in the background telling her to hand him her phone. Then he was on the line.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, George Anderson here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, George. She knows your last name,\u201d Natalie said.</p><p>\u201cWe understand your aunt Emma joins you for dinner every Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s in town,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you cook for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t cook, George. We go out.\u201d She knew she was irritating him with her interruptions, and she couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cAt one of the dinners, perhaps you could mention your father\u2019s birthday party and request that she attend. Is that so difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently it is,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sarcastic,\u201d he chided. He turned away from the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s no reasoning with her, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>Her sister came back on the line. \u201cWho cares who started the silent treatment. Emma needs to do the right thing and call Mother,\u201d she said in a near shout. \u201cAnd by the way,\u201d she continued on a rant now, \u201cshame on you, Olivia. Do you realize how cruel you\u2019re being to the family? If you don\u2019t show up for the party either, how would it look? It wouldn\u2019t just be hurtful, it would be disloyal.\u201d</p><p>Olivia muted the phone. \u201cNatalie wants to know if I realize how hurtful I\u2019m being to the family.\u201d</p><p>Jane put her hand out, palm up, and wiggled her fingers. \u201cLet me talk to her. Come on, give me the phone.\u201d Jane\u2019s face wasn\u2019t pale now. In the space of a few seconds, her complexion turned bright pink. \u201cI\u2019ll set the record straight.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. Jane had always been her champion. She hit the mute button again and said to Natalie, \u201cAunt Emma has a mind of her own. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019ll do anything for you because she feels . . .\u201d</p><p>Natalie had suddenly stopped. Olivia\u2019s determination not to get pulled into an argument flew out the window. \u201cShe feels what?\u201d she demanded angrily. \u201cGo ahead, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cShe feels sorry for you. She always has, ever since you got sick. Why do you think she moved to D.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because she loved me and knew the rest of you had pretty much written me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma wanted me to have a home to go to when I was released from the hospital. And she wanted me to have at least one visitor when I got out of isolation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do like to dredge up the past, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia closed her eyes. She couldn\u2019t do this anymore.</p><p>\u201cNatalie, do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give her sister time to argue. She disconnected the call, dropped her phone into her purse, and turned to Jane to tell her what Natalie wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she so hell-bent on getting your aunt Emma to attend the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Natalie, everyone who matters in D.C. society knows who Emma is, and if she isn\u2019t at the party, it will be noticed, and that will embarrass my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Natalie working for your father now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe\u2019s just helping out with the birthday parties. She and her husband, George, still run that Internet company. From what I understand, it\u2019s doing quite well. They sell everything from shoes to kitchen sinks. They have so many people working for them, they can afford to take time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs George a believer, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cA believer? Do you mean under my father\u2019s charismatic spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. According to Natalie, our father has doubled their money. She boasts that they could retire now if they wanted.\u201d</p><p>The nurse walked into the room carrying a glass of orange juice. She handed the drink to Olivia and unhooked the IV.</p><p>\u201cYou know the drill,\u201d she said. \u201cDrink all the orange juice, sit back, and relax. If you feel dizzy, push the call button.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s cell phone rang. Certain it was Natalie calling again with a renewed attack, she didn\u2019t bother to look at the screen.</p><p>Her greeting wasn\u2019t very polite. \u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy. You know that? Absolutely crazy.\u201d</p><p>A deep male voice responded. \u201cYeah? Good to know.\u201d</p><p>Agent Grayson Kincaid was on the line.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Grayson had spent the rest of his afternoon putting out fires caused by the Jorguson debacle, but as busy as he was, he couldn\u2019t get Olivia MacKenzie out of his head, and that irritated the hell out of him. His response to her didn\u2019t make any sense. After all, he\u2019d been with the woman for only an hour. It was purely a physical reaction, he reasoned. She had a beautiful face, an amazing smile, an incredible body. He would have to be a eunuch not to notice or react.</p><p>He sat at his desk reading through a file and cross-checking it with the data on his computer screen, but every now and then she\u2019d pop into his thoughts. Disgusted with his lack of focus, he shook his head in an attempt to clear it and started over again on page one.</p><p>Agent Ronan Conrad knocked on his door, opened it, and leaned in. \u201cHave you got a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Come in.\u201d</p><p>The office was claustrophobic. Ronan had to shut the door in order to pull out the one chair so that he could sit. In the process he banged his knee on the metal desk.</p><p>It was a cold, uninviting space. The gray walls were bare, and there weren\u2019t any personal items, like family photos or mementos, on the desk. The only window was the size of a postage stamp.</p><p>\u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with the place,\u201d Ronan said, grinning.</p><p>The two men were good friends. They had gone through training together and had been assigned to the same team now for four years. Their work ethic and dedication were very similar, though their backgrounds couldn\u2019t have been more different. Ronan grew up in a large working-class family in the inner city. He attended a state university on an athletic scholarship and upon graduation entered the Marines. After serving several years on a special ops team, he returned home to attend graduate school and was recruited by the FBI.</p><p>Grayson, on the other hand, had been dealt a different hand. He was born into a family of wealth and prestige, and in the D.C. area was considered a blue blood. He entered the academy after earning his law degree at Princeton. His inheritance from a trust fund handed down by his grandfather was substantial, but Grayson had made several wise investments and had turned a large fortune into an even larger fortune. If the truth be known, he didn\u2019t need to work for a living.</p><p>Coming from two such dissimilar circumstances, one would assume that the two men would be worlds apart, but the opposite was true. They had bonded after the first couple of weeks of training. Ronan initially had his doubts when he\u2019d learned of Grayson\u2019s privileged background, but his opinion quickly changed. There wasn\u2019t anyone in their class who trained harder or studied longer. Grayson excelled at every test the academy threw at him, and soon a friendly rivalry developed between the two friends, each one pushing the other to a higher level. By the time they graduated from the academy, both men had won the admiration and respect of the instructors and all the other trainees.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like filling in for Pensky?\u201d Ronan asked, crossing his arms and leaning his chair back on two legs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back Monday, thank God. I hate being cooped up in this office. I feel like I\u2019m in a tomb.\u201d</p><p>Ronan looked around the room. \u201cI think the utility closet is bigger,\u201d he remarked. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d Grayson asked. He rolled his shoulders to work out the stiffness. He\u2019d been leaning over the file folders for hours now.</p><p>\u201cWord is, the job is yours if you want it. Pensky\u2019s going to retire next year. Maybe sooner.\u201d</p><p>Grayson shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you end up getting custody of your nephew, you probably won\u2019t want to be running all over the country. Pensky\u2019s job would be perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping my brother will step up and start acting like a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Grayson. You know that\u2019s not gonna happen. At least not anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Ronan had known Grayson\u2019s brother, Devin, almost as long as he\u2019d known Grayson. He\u2019d met him shortly after graduating from the academy. Devin had the same upbringing as Grayson, but the two brothers were polar opposites. Grayson had a strong work ethic and a fierce sense of duty and loyalty to family, but Devin was irresponsible and self-centered. Since his wife\u2019s death several years ago, he had become quite the jet-setter. He liked the action in Monte Carlo and Dubai, and he loved women. He was the ultimate playboy and, sadly, often forgot he had a son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ronan knew it was difficult for his friend to talk about his family, and he doubted anyone else in the office knew about the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky your brother isn\u2019t dragging Henry all over Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Henry still living with your father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered and then abruptly changed the subject. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the Harrison investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to report. Those brothers are crazy, plain crazy. I enjoyed arresting them, and I have to admit I wish they had resisted. I would have loved to punch all three of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they in lockup?\u201d</p><p>Ronan nodded. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not going anywhere. They were denied bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bail? That\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter you dropped the case in my lap\u2014why are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s exactly what I did. It\u2019s called payback.\u201d</p><p>Ronan looked surprised, then conceded. \u201cYeah, okay. I guess I deserved it after the Brody case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess? Do you know how many interviews I had to do with those freaky cult members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it was hilarious,\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know how you did it. One day you\u2019re running the investigation, and the next it\u2019s on my desk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took finesse,\u201d Ronan boasted. \u201cSomeday I\u2019ll teach you a few of my tricks.\u201d Turning serious, he asked, \u201cWhat about Poole? Have you talked to him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he agreed to a transfer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t really give him a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t detail his latest screwup in his personnel file. Of course, his superior will, but I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t add fuel to the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too soft, Grayson,\u201d Ronan said with feigned disgust. \u201cI almost got that out with a straight face. You\u2019re a hard-ass, just like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Jorguson? Have you heard anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not yet. The only reason we got dragged into the middle of the investigation was because of that hothead, Poole,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>Grayson disagreed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t dragged into the investigation. We were doing a favor for Agent Huntsman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoole was told to shut down the operation, and he completely ignored the order. That\u2019s about the third or fourth time he\u2019s disregarded Huntsman\u2019s instructions, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cHe should be fired or forced to retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Huntsman\u2019s call, not ours, but I agree with you. Poole needs to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we made it to the restaurant when we did,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Poole would have gotten to the bodyguard before he hurt Olivia MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remembered her name.\u201d</p><p>Ronan nodded. \u201cI remember everything about her,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even speak to her. You interviewed her. What\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drop-dead gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Grayson smiled. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuntsman doesn\u2019t have the evidence to prove Jorguson is laundering money for some of his clients, so he\u2019s decided to do some pushing. I helped him get statements from six strong witnesses who saw Jorguson attack MacKenzie at the restaurant, and we have the cell phone video. Huntsman hasn\u2019t contacted her yet to find out if she\u2019ll testify. He\u2019s charging him with battery. It\u2019s not much but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grayson interrupted. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only charge, Huntsman has to know it will never get to court. Jorguson\u2019s attorneys will either get it thrown out or plea it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they will,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut Huntsman is going to keep them busy, flood them with paper. I honestly don\u2019t know what he hopes to accomplish,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s frustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Ronan agreed.</p><p>\u201cI just finished my report and sent it over to him, and when he reads it, he\u2019ll realize there\u2019s a better way to go after Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat better way?\u201d Ronan wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cApparently Poole didn\u2019t mention Olivia\u2019s occupation to Huntsman. He was probably embarrassed because he couldn\u2019t intimidate her.\u201d Thinking about it made him smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cOlivia MacKenzie works for the IRS. Therefore, Jorguson attacked . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn IRS agent.\u201d He laughed. \u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet. Huntsman\u2019s going to love it. Did Jorguson know? Of course he did. He was interviewing her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact MacKenzie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Grayson heard how eager he sounded and quickly added, \u201cI want to get out of this office. I can\u2019t breathe in here.\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d been smooth, but Ronan wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cSo you are, in fact, interested in her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in helping Huntsman nail Jorguson. I already interviewed Olivia, and I think I should finish it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA phone call would probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I should do it in person.\u201d</p><p>Ronan stood. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get her phone number for you, and you can set up a time to meet.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Grayson said, \u201cI\u2019ve already got it programmed in my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not interested,\u201d Ronan said as he strolled out of the office.</p><p>Grayson could hear his laughter through the door.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Grayson wanted to meet with Olivia to discuss the Jorguson investigation, at her convenience, he insisted, as long as it was Saturday at five o\u2019clock. It was the only time he had available, he explained, and he wanted to get this all tied up before Monday.</p><p>\u201cThere are some discrepancies I\u2019d like to go over as soon as possible regarding the incident with Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscrepancies? How could there be any discrepancies? There were at least twenty people watching,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of those people were recording with their phones. And just for the record, Agent Kincaid, it wasn\u2019t an incident. It was an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, placating her. \u201cJorguson\u2019s attorneys are calling it the alleged incident, and Jorguson\u2019s version of what happened is quite different from yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d He heard her sigh. \u201cOlivia?\u201d he said after a long minute of silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>He liked the way she said his name. She dragged it out so he\u2019d hear her frustration. He smiled in reaction. \u201cFive o\u2019clock. I can either come to you, or we could meet somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to meet Saturday night?\u201d she questioned. Didn\u2019t the agent have a life outside of the office?</p><p>\u201cEarly Saturday night,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>Ah, so he did have plans, probably a late date, she speculated as she took another sip of the orange juice the nurse had given her.</p><p>Jane was checking messages on her phone and wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThree o\u2019clock works better for me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m tied up until four thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it will have to wait until Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Can\u2019t you be a little flexible? I have plans, and I can\u2019t change them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plans?\u201d</p><p>He sounded suspicious. Was he simply curious, or didn\u2019t he believe her? Olivia pictured Grayson tackling that horrible bodyguard, saving her from certain harm, and she decided the least she could do in return was cooperate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to a formal affair,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to get ready and be at the Hamilton Hotel by seven thirty. If clearing up discrepancies will only take ten or fifteen minutes, then fine, we\u2019ll meet at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could take longer than that. What\u2019s the formal affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Capitol League Benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Saturday night? I thought it was next weekend.\u201d Grayson had received an invitation and had respectfully declined, but he had also made a substantial donation to the charity because he believed it was a good cause.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re planning to attend?\u201d</p><p>He thought about it for a second or two, then said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She felt a little burst of pleasure that took her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we could meet at the hotel. It shouldn\u2019t take all that long to discuss Jorguson\u2019s blatant lies, should it? Unless you have plans . . . or if you have a date and it would be rude to leave her while you discussed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson\u2019s lies?\u201d</p><p>She could hear the amusement in his voice. \u201cYes. Do you have a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally. I\u2019m working, remember? The Jorguson investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you have a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI sound boring, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, there isn\u2019t anything boring about you,\u201d he said, and before she could respond to the compliment, he asked, \u201cWere you planning to go alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My aunt is being honored at the event, and I promised her I\u2019d attend. I was planning to meet her there. Unlike us, she has a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is your aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I drive you to the hotel? We can talk on the way there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen . . . I might as well . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked when he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI might as well take you home after . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call, turned back to his desk, and noticed Ronan standing in the doorway. He didn\u2019t ask him if he had listened to the awkward conversation. The look on his face told Grayson he had.</p><p>\u201cMan, that was painful,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Grayson shrugged. \u201cDamned if I know.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Olivia told Jane about her conversation with Grayson while she wheeled her friend back up to her hospital room.</p><p>Always the artist, Jane asked, \u201cGive me a visual. What does he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tall, well over six feet, and he has dark hair, a really great mouth, and a firm jaw. Good bone structure . . . you know, patrician,\u201d she explained. \u201cHis eyes are intriguing. Now that I think about it, he\u2019s very sexy and quite handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised. Didn\u2019t you think he was handsome when you met him?\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and she backed the wheelchair in, then waited for Jane to push the eighth-floor button. \u201cYes, I did think he was nice-looking, but . . . you know . . . he\u2019s FBI . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I want to paint him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, you would. He wouldn\u2019t let you, though. From the little I know about him, I think he\u2019d be mortified if you even suggested it. He\u2019s an agent, very straitlaced and professional. So, of course, a relationship is out of the question. He\u2019s interesting, though. Very sophisticated. No rough edges. Aunt Emma would like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going out with him tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to the Capitol League Benefit. He\u2019s going to drive me there and drive me back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he go inside with you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cOf course he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got yourself a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a date,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt\u2019s work related. We\u2019ll be discussing the Jorguson investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pushed the wheelchair into Jane\u2019s room and parked it in the corner while Jane got back into bed. There were two thick books on her bedside table, a biography and a book about addiction recovery. On top of the volumes was an AA pamphlet. Jane was obviously taking her brother\u2019s new sobriety seriously, and Olivia knew that her friend would do anything she could to help Logan stay on the right path.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t want her to be disappointed again. She decided not to mention the reading material or bring up the fact that Logan\u2019s addiction wasn\u2019t just alcohol but also cocaine. Maybe AA would work for that recovery, too. For Jane\u2019s sake, she hoped it would.</p><p>Olivia stood at the foot of the bed and waited for Jane to get settled. Her arms folded across her chest, she was frowning at her friend as her thoughts went back to their conversation about Grayson Kincaid.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jane asked when she noticed how serious Olivia looked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want tomorrow night to be romantic. How crazy would it be for me to get involved with him? Even assuming he would be interested . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he would be interested. How could he not? You\u2019re fairly intelligent, somewhat sweet when you aren\u2019t being bitchy, and beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitchy? Fairly intelligent?\u201d</p><p>Jane laughed. \u201cOnly you would focus on the negatives. I did say beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, because as soon as my father is arrested . . . if I ever find the evidence to get him arrested . . . I\u2019ll become a leper. No one in this city will want to be seen with a MacKenzie. My family will call me a traitor, and, in fact, that\u2019s what I am. They can\u2019t be surprised by what\u2019s coming, though. I\u2019ve pleaded with Natalie and her mule-headed husband, George, and my mother\u2014who, by the way, is a completely lost cause\u2014to get their money out of my father\u2019s investment firm, but no one will listen to me. I don\u2019t want to hurt them, but I don\u2019t know what else to do. If he continues, he\u2019ll not only ruin them, he\u2019ll destroy the lives of hundreds of other innocent people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have any solid evidence yet?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia admitted. \u201cBut I know I\u2019m right. My entire life I\u2019ve seen how my father operates. He\u2019s very charming. He has a way of getting people to believe he\u2019s the most sincere and candid person they\u2019ve ever met, and he looks very successful, so when he presents an investment opportunity, they trust him. Sometimes I think he actually believes what he tells them. It\u2019s almost like a compulsion and he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wished she could look away and let things play out, but she couldn\u2019t. She knew what was coming and she couldn\u2019t just stand by as more and more people got sucked in. She\u2019d seen it happen before. When she was young, she knew her father was different from other dads, but it wasn\u2019t until she was older that she realized what he was and finally could see what he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>One of his first ventures was in oil. He had convinced hundreds of people that geologists had discovered incredibly rich oil deposits off the coast of Texas. All he needed was enough money to invest in the drilling equipment to extract it. People gave him millions because he assured them that they were taking a small risk. He made them believe they were going to make a hundred times what they\u2019d put in. People were greedy. No one knew how much drilling actually went on, but within a year he announced that the wells had come up dry; the geologists were mistaken. The investors walked away with a loss, but somehow Olivia\u2019s father moved on to bigger and better.</p> <p>He formed another company a couple of years later. This time he invested in technology. He managed to find enough people to believe that he had collected a group of engineers who were on the verge of developing a revolutionary battery, one that would solve all the country\u2019s energy problems. That turned out to be a flop, too, but while the investors lost every dime and the company went under, her father\u2019s lifestyle became more lavish.</p><p>Those were just a couple of his so-called business ventures. Now he\u2019d gotten even bigger. With his new firm, he\u2019d collected massive amounts of capital from investors, big and small, with promises of phenomenal returns. Somehow he\u2019d convinced them that their money was safe, but there was no way he could maintain the big profits he\u2019d been claiming.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way he could be legitimate this time?\u201d Jane wondered.</p><p>Olivia thought about Jeff Wilcox facing prison because of her father\u2019s lies. How many more were there? She shook her head. \u201cNo, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. I try to warn people, but until I find proof, no one will pay any attention to me.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cActually, that\u2019s not quite true. My father\u2019s law firm, Simmons, Simmons and Falcon\u2014or as I like to call them, Slimeball, Slimeball and Slimeball\u2014did get wind of what I\u2019m trying to do, and they\u2019re trying to stop me. They sent a nasty threatening letter. If I don\u2019t desist with what they called my insane and inflammatory accusations, they\u2019ll have me arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what charges?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have any. It\u2019s all bogus. I haven\u2019t done anything illegal. They\u2019re just trying to scare me. If they were to try to sue me, they\u2019d have to let me see my father\u2019s financials, and trust me, Jane, they\u2019d kill me before they\u2019d let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, Olivia. Don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should all be in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go after them. Just don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get killed.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Olivia was ready by six thirty Saturday night and spent the next half hour catching up on e-mails. She wore a black floor-length gown. The silk hugged the curves of her body, but it wasn\u2019t obscene, by any means. The scooped neck showed a little cleavage, nothing that would have men ogling, she thought. Her neck was bare, and her only jewelry was a pair of teardrop diamond earrings that her aunt Emma had given her for her birthday. Her hair was swept up in a cluster of curls. A few tendrils escaped at the base of her neck.</p><p>Grayson was five minutes early. She opened the door and stood there staring up at him, speechless. The man was even more sexy in a tux. James Bond, all right, she thought. No, she corrected. Better.</p><p>Neither of them moved for a few seconds, and then Grayson said, \u201cYou look nice.\u201d He sounded hoarse.</p><p>\u201cThank you. So do you,\u201d she said as she stepped back. \u201cPlease, come inside. I\u2019ll just get my purse and wrap.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into a small foyer and followed her into the living room. Olivia lived in an upscale neighborhood on the edge of Georgetown. The building was old, the third-floor apartment was spacious and comfortable. Tall arched windows and worn hardwood floors were the backdrop for her overstuffed sofa and two matching chairs. The walls had been painted a pale blue, the windows were trimmed in white, and the furniture was a soft yellow color. A black square coffee table sat in front of the sofa with a stack of books on one side and a white vase filled with fresh daisies in the center. Colorful rugs brightened the area.</p><p>He noticed a pair of worn tennis shoes under the coffee table and a pair of flats in the doorway of a small room off the living area that Olivia obviously used as an office. Her laptop sat on an old, dark cherrywood desk that had been beautifully restored. Bookcases flanked the desk, the shelves bowed from the heavy books.</p> <p>Grayson was an armchair architect at heart and appreciated the unique features of these older buildings. He would have loved to see the rest of the apartment.</p><p>Olivia came back into the living room and noticed Grayson staring at her ceilings. He caught her watching and said, \u201cI like the moldings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too. That\u2019s one of the reasons I bought the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen-foot-high ceilings? That\u2019s rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet it gets cold in here in the winter, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked when he noticed the old-fashioned radiators.</p><p>She pointed to the afghan draped over a chair. \u201cI wrap up in that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHow many bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne large, one small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, both are quite spacious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the kitchen been remodeled?\u201d</p><p>Puzzled by his interest, she answered. \u201cYes, the whole building was remodeled a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over two years. Are you interested in the neighborhood? Thinking about moving?\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t explain that he bought buildings, renovated them, and either sold them or rented them out. It was an expensive, yet profitable, hobby.</p><p>\u201cJust curious. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>He took the key from her and locked the deadbolt on their way out. Neither said another word until they were in his car and on their way.</p><p>\u201cTell me what Jorguson is saying happened,\u201d she began.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou attacked him.\u201d</p><p>She was properly outraged. \u201cThat is absolutely not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Huntsman has been after Jorguson for some time. He wants to know if you\u2019ll testify should he take him to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said without hesitation. \u201cBut do you really think it will get that far?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThose were the exact words my partner, Agent Conrad, said. Jorguson knew you worked for the IRS, so, in fact, he attacked a representative of the IRS, didn\u2019t he? It\u2019s my understanding the Internal Revenue Service doesn\u2019t like it when one of their own is assaulted.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuntsman wants to push this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help in any way that I can,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cHow much research did you do before your interview with Jorguson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery little,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the time. A big mistake on my part. I never should have gone to the interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson\u2019s client list is filled with real bad . . .\u201d He started to say \u201casses\u201d but substituted \u201cpeople\u201d instead.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBad people? You sound like one of my kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids I represent. When we had lunch, I thought I mentioned I do some work on the side for Judge Bowen and Judge Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did mention it. It just jarred me to hear you call them your kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they\u2019re in trouble, they are my kids. In most cases, I\u2019m all they have.\u201d Her voice had turned serious, passionate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about these bad people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson Investments is legit as far as Huntsman can tell; however, some of his clients have brought in copious amounts of cash. One in particular, Gretta Keene, was very active. Her base was in Belgium but she operated in the United States for several years. The federal government took action a few months ago to have her deported. She disappeared before that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s all the money coming from? Drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other endeavors, we suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me go out on a limb here. If and when I talk to Agent Huntsman, he\u2019s going to tell me Jorguson is money laundering for either the mob or perhaps one of the drug cartels.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She switched gears. \u201cDid you talk to Jorguson about his threat to have me killed? \u2018One phone call and you\u2019re a dead woman.\u2019 I believe those were his very words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe denied threatening you. When I mentioned the number of people who heard him, he said they were all mistaken. While he was spewing his ridiculous lies, his two attorneys\u2019 heads were nodding up and down like they were bobbing for apples. We happened to have a video from one of the waiters\u2019 cell phones and played it for him.\u201d He grinned as he added, \u201cHis expression was priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet he changed his story then.\u201d</p><p>Grayson nodded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, he did. The alleged incident was all a big misunderstanding, and he was bluffing when he pretended to threaten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe actually said he pretended to threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d love it if you would come work for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of seeing that pervert every single day sends shivers down my spine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d stopped at a red light, and Grayson glanced over at her with a warm smile. Olivia was suddenly tongue-tied, and her heart skipped a beat. She didn\u2019t know what to make of her physical reaction to him. She was usually so professional and composed, and this was a business evening, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer his question.</p><p>The light turned green, but Grayson didn\u2019t notice. When Olivia had turned in her seat to face him, the slit in her gown exposed part of her thigh. Her skin was golden, and he wondered if the rest of her was as flawless. The driver behind them honked, and Grayson\u2019s gaze was pulled back to his driving.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to the Hamilton?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. It only just opened a couple of months ago. I\u2019ve stayed at the one in Boston. It\u2019s beautiful and quite elegant. Have you been to this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have. Aiden Hamilton threw a party a couple of weeks before the grand opening. I\u2019ve known Aiden and his family for some time now. My cousin, Sam, helped on a case for Aiden\u2019s brother-in-law, Alec, and he introduced us. Sam and Alec are both FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran into a lot of old friends I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. I was ready to take my date home when Alec suggested we play a little poker. I got home at six the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her home and came back for the game. She wasn\u2019t happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you win any money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden decided to join us, so, no. When he plays, he wins. I lost the girlfriend and a lot of money. Had fun, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too broken up about the girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relationship wasn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, hey, it was poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she didn\u2019t understand. I do,\u201d she said. \u201cI love poker.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYeah? You really like to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I am.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see about that.\u201d</p><p>They pulled into the circle drive in front of the hotel, ending the conversation. Two attendants rushed forward to open their doors. Grayson\u2019s BMW was whisked away by the valet, and he took hold of Olivia\u2019s arm and walked by her side up the wide steps to the entrance.</p><p>The Hamilton Hotel faced Pennsylvania, a busy and noisy street, but as soon as they walked through the doors, Olivia felt as though she\u2019d entered another world. There was a perfect blend of old-world charm and sleek contemporary touches. Massive columns stretched to the ceiling of a soaring lobby, and grand curved staircases on either side led to a wide mezzanine overlooking the main reception area. The polished brass balusters on the steps were topped with a carved railing of rich mahogany. Every table and chest was adorned with fresh flowers. Beautiful marble floors were covered in rich Oriental rugs, and the luxuriously upholstered furniture was overstuffed, inviting guests to linger and relax in this elegant and quiet setting, forgetting the turmoil and demands of the outside world.</p><p>All seven Hamilton Hotels were known for unparalleled luxury, absolute discretion, and impeccable service. The hotels catered to discriminating clientele and were dedicated to protecting privacy. Because of the chain\u2019s reputation for pampering guests and taking care of their every whim, dignitaries, politicians, lobbyists, and celebrities had already booked the four ballrooms in this hotel well into the future.</p><p>The Capitol League gala was being held in the largest ballroom, which was located on the first floor at the end of a long, wide corridor. Outside the large double doors leading into the ballroom was an open area with a magnificent fountain. Directly beyond were tall windows overlooking the serenity gardens.</p><p>Two Capitol League attendants stood side by side at the doors. Olivia pulled her invitation from her beaded clutch and handed it to one of them. Grayson noticed the man was so preoccupied staring at her, he barely glanced at the card. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was already a crowd gathered inside, but the flow was good, and it was surprisingly easy to get from one side of the ballroom to the other.</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t attended many of these events. When she could afford it, she donated to causes that were close to her heart, most having to do with children in need, yet she rarely went to the parties, and for that reason she knew very few people attending the celebration.</p><p>Grayson, on the other hand, was the man of the hour. He seemed to know everyone, or rather, most of the guests seemed to know him. He was immediately surrounded by friends and donors. A senator on the finance committee stopped to talk about his reelection campaign and to ask what Grayson thought about a certain stock. Olivia wasn\u2019t sure what to do. This wasn\u2019t exactly a date, so she didn\u2019t think she should stay and listen to his conversations with friends. Or should she? Feeling a bit awkward, she decided to find her aunt Emma, but when she tried to step away, Grayson took hold of her hand and pulled her into his side. He wasn\u2019t at all subtle. She gave him a disapproving frown. He responded by winking at her.</p><p>Olivia decided to be accommodating and humor him, and as it turned out, she was very happy she did. She soon lost count of the number of powerful men and women he introduced her to. She patiently stayed beside him for a good twenty minutes, smiling until her face felt frozen, and chatting amicably with the CEO of a cereal conglomerate, a Nobel Prize winner for physics, a real estate tycoon, an Internet software whiz, two art gallery owners, a couple of ambassadors, and a congresswoman. She even had a brief, though surreal, conversation with a senior adviser to the president of the United States. The topic was yoga, of all things.</p> <p>The second there was a lull, Grayson suggested they go find her aunt. Then James Crowell stopped Grayson to say hello. Olivia recognized him from the cover of Time.</p><p>Crowell was Person of the Year and she believed it was a well-deserved honor. He was a genius and a self-made billionaire and, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, had donated most of his fortune to charity. Olivia was starstruck. Crowell was one of her heroes because of all of his humanitarian efforts. How did Grayson know him? It was obvious that Crowell liked Grayson, and from their conversation and their ease with each other, she concluded they had been friends for some time.</p><p>Just who was Agent Grayson Kincaid? The real Bruce Wayne?</p><p>Grayson watched Olivia as Crowell shook her hand and walked away.</p><p>\u201cYour face is flushed,\u201d he remarked.</p> <p>\u201cI admire Mr. Crowell. He\u2019s done a lot for the poor in this country.\u201d She turned to Grayson and said, \u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it will get you to quit frowning, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frowning. This is my puzzled expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Good to know. What\u2019s the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are with the FBI, aren\u2019t you? It isn\u2019t just a hobby, is it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m with the FBI, and no, it isn\u2019t a hobby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo if I were to look in your garage, I wouldn\u2019t find a Batmobile?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as though he thought she was crazy. Shaking his head and looking very serious, he said, \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She felt foolish for making the comparison and for asking such a silly question.</p><p>Grayson put his arm around her waist and pulled her close so that an elderly couple could get past. Then he leaned down and whispered into her ear.</p><p>\u201cI keep it in my cave.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Was there anyone Grayson didn\u2019t know?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you again, Grayson,\u201d Aunt Emma said when they found her.</p> <p>He took her hand and bent down so that she could kiss his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to see you, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing well, thank you. He\u2019s sorry he couldn\u2019t be here tonight to celebrate with you, but he had another engagement he couldn\u2019t cancel. He sends you his best wishes.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned to Olivia. \u201cI had no idea you knew Grayson,\u201d she said to her niece, who was standing there with her mouth open in astonishment. Olivia gave Grayson a scolding glare for not telling her he was acquainted with her aunt, but before she could say anything, Emma continued, \u201cYou look lovely, dear.\u201d She kissed her on both cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia thought her aunt looked radiant. She was a petite woman, just five feet three inches, and Olivia, at five feet six inches and in stilettos, towered over her. Emma had never had any face work done, but with her genes and her bone structure had aged beautifully. She had silver hair, cut short with just a hint of curl. She wore a silver floor-length gown, the cut simple and elegant. Her crystal clear eyes never missed anything, and her smile could melt the coldest of hearts.</p><p>Another acquaintance asked for a minute with Grayson, and while he was turned away, Olivia whispered to her aunt, \u201cAre any of the others coming tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family? No,\u201d Emma answered. \u201cThey\u2019re all in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to my mother yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, I haven\u2019t. Now go and find your seats. The ceremony is about to start. I\u2019ve been told that there won\u2019t be any long-winded speeches tonight, thank heavens. Three of us are receiving the Brinkley Humanitarian Award, and none of us feels we deserve it. It\u2019s . . . humbling,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI tried to talk my way out of this, but the committee said this event could raise a lot of money, so here I am.\u201d She stepped closer and whispered, \u201cTomorrow I expect to hear all about how you met Grayson Kincaid. I always thought you and he would make a good match, but you\u2019re so stubborn about letting anyone interfere\u2014\u201d</p><p>She abruptly stopped when Grayson joined them. A few minutes later the ceremony began.</p><p>Olivia was so proud of her aunt. She was being honored for her contributions to the community, specifically for creating a medical scholarship for cancer research and for funding a new pediatric oncology ward at the children\u2019s hospital. Olivia knew how pleased Emma\u2019s late husband would be. When he died, Uncle Daniel left her with a large fortune, and she had put it to good use. From the response the audience gave after her considerable accomplishments were listed, it was apparent that Emma was well loved and appreciated by everyone.</p><p>As soon as the music started and couples headed to the dance floor, Olivia asked Grayson if he was ready to leave. He draped her wrap around her shoulders and followed her out of the ballroom.</p><p>Aiden Hamilton intercepted them just as they were crossing the lobby. He reminded Olivia of a model in GQ. Was everyone in Grayson\u2019s life perfection? Impeccably dressed, Aiden looked as though the tuxedo had been invented with him in mind. He was tall and terribly fit, and he approached them with a wide smile. The greeting between the two men was a bit humorous. Grayson slapped Aiden on his shoulder, and Aiden retaliated in kind. Then they shook hands like gentlemen.</p><p>Grayson introduced Olivia to his friend, and after pleasantries were exchanged, Grayson asked him, \u201cHow long are you in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust overnight,\u201d he answered. \u201cI leave for Sydney first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you building another hotel?\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded. \u201cHopefully,\u201d he said. \u201cWe built one in Melbourne and didn\u2019t run into any problems, but we\u2019re having trouble with permits in Sydney. It will work out,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat about you, Grayson? Still working twenty-four/seven?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we had time for a poker game,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you still have a few dollars left for me to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour luck is bound to run out someday, Hamilton,\u201d Grayson countered. \u201cI\u2019ll get my revenge.\u201d</p><p>Aiden turned to Olivia. \u201cSorry to bore you with this chatter,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hear about our poker games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Olivia is quite a poker player, too,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Aiden looked at her admiringly. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned when I was a little girl,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy friends and I loved to play. We haven\u2019t had much opportunity lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps the next time I\u2019m in town, you can join us,\u201d Aiden offered. He smiled warmly and took her hand. \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you.\u201d</p><p>Grayson pulled her hand away. \u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d he said abruptly. He put his arm around Olivia\u2019s shoulder and turned her toward the door. She nearly tripped, trying to keep up with him.</p><p>Olivia thought that Aiden Hamilton was one of the most attractive men she\u2019d ever met. He was a real charmer who, no doubt, could have any woman he wanted, whenever he wanted, but she didn\u2019t see a reason for Grayson to be jealous. In her mind, he was much sexier.</p><p>Once they were in the car and on their way, she asked, \u201cTonight . . . how did you know all those people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run into them now and then at different events, and I don\u2019t know all of them, just some.\u201d</p><p>But you do run in their circle, she thought. He was so at ease with the movers and shakers in D.C., and she realized, there wasn\u2019t any question, she was completely out of his league.</p><p>\u201cThank you for introducing me to James Crowell. It was the highlight of the night for me.\u201d</p><p>Grayson thought about all the people he had introduced her to, including several A-list celebrities, and yet she was most impressed by a short, skinny, balding man who, without seeking publicity or fanfare, had made a real difference in the world. The fact that she recognized what Crowell had done made Grayson like her all the more.</p><p>\u201cThe men and women who met you tonight, including James Crowell, won\u2019t forget you because, frankly, you\u2019re pretty unforgettable, Olivia, and if there are cutbacks and you have to leave your current job, you have a connection with all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were networking,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, you were networking. You just didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to react. She wasn\u2019t used to people doing nice things for her, at least not lately. \u201cThen tonight was about helping me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd clearing up a few details about your interview with Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Jorguson. Our discussion could have been done over the phone, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut this was more fun.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. \u201cThen thank you. I did have fun tonight. Meeting James Crowell was a dream come true.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Grayson loosened his tie as he steered the car into traffic. He didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes and seemed perfectly relaxed. He was a real enigma, a man who was just as comfortable tackling thugs as he was socializing with the rich and powerful.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t good at small talk, and the silence was making her feel uneasy. She took a breath and blurted, \u201cYou make me nervous, but you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to ask her why he made her nervous and wondered what she would tell him, but he didn\u2019t ask. Maybe he knew why and could explain it to her. She really had enjoyed herself tonight. It had been a long time since she had gotten all dressed up and gone out with such a handsome man. A long, long time.</p><p>She should get into the game, she thought. Then she remembered her father and what was coming, and she pushed the notion of getting involved with any man aside.</p><p>Her cell phone rang. She didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>\u201cThis is Olivia MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>One of her clients was on the line. \u201cOlivia, it\u2019s Tyler.\u201d The voice was hushed and brimming with fear. He had said her name once, and so she put up one finger. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Olivia.\u201d Two fingers up. \u201cI just wanted you to know that I\u2019m back home with my uncle and aunt, Olivia, and everything is okay.\u201d</p><p>She heard someone speaking in the background, and then Tyler said, \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to worry and have to look for me. You won\u2019t, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I know you\u2019re okay, Tyler,\u201d she said, deliberately saying his name so he would know she understood the threat, \u201cI won\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to hang up now.\u201d His voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cHe just went into the kitchen. There are two other men here, and they\u2019re really mad. They say my uncle wants too much money. They have guns, Olivia. I\u2019m so scared . . . should I hide? I\u2019m going to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. Olivia quickly found the address recorded in her phone and rattled it off to Grayson. \u201cA little boy is in danger,\u201d she said and then repeated what Tyler had told her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, there isn\u2019t time for you to take me home so I can get my car. Besides, I\u2019m going to need your help. We have to get there quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall nine-one-one and request a squad car to meet us.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had pulled onto the ramp and was now blazing down the expressway. He also called for backup and was patched through to his partner, Agent Ronan Conrad.</p><p>\u201cRonan, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way home. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Grayson told him where he was headed and filled him in on the situation. \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Ronan answered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in five minutes,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cMake it faster,\u201d Olivia urged, her voice strained. \u201cFive minutes might be too long.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the accelerator. \u201cTell me about Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ten years old and was removed from his uncle\u2019s house and put in a safe house. The Purdys\u2014the uncle and the aunt\u2014are drug dealers, and they were using Tyler to deliver the product.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocaine and meth. Mostly meth these days,\u201d she added. \u201cThe aunt and uncle are twisted. The aunt has this thing about blood and family. Inside that sick mind of hers she believes she owns Tyler now that his parents are in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like the kid ever had a chance,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cJudge Bowen was his savior. He put Tyler with a good family and severed all parental rights. The aunt and uncle were never given custody, and there\u2019s a restraining order, but that means nothing to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hold up three fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the number of times he said my name. It\u2019s a code the kids and I have. If he says my name once, I know he\u2019s in trouble. The more times he says it, the more dangerous the situation. I never know who might be there with him listening or coaxing him when he\u2019s talking to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever been called when it wasn\u2019t an emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cThese kids understand real danger, and they wouldn\u2019t exaggerate. There\u2019s too much at stake to cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>The neighborhood they drove into was in the heart of gang territory. A few of the owners of the cookie-cutter houses had at one time tried to keep up maintenance, but the vast majority had let their homes go to seed. Half of them had already been abandoned and condemned. Grayson drove past a house that was falling apart. One side of the porch had collapsed, and the front lawn had been turned into a junkyard. There was a rusted-out washing machine and a stripped-down motorcycle blocking the broken sidewalk. It was impossible to tell if there was any grass because every inch of the yard was layered with trash. The air smelled of mildew, rotting garbage, and despair.</p><p>Three blocks west was the Purdy house. Grayson slammed on the brakes, threw the car in park, and said, \u201cStay in the car, Olivia.\u201d His voice was calm, almost soothing.</p> <p>He pulled his tie off and tossed it on the seat as he got out of the car. His jacket followed. Opening the trunk, he reached for his bulletproof vest and slipped it on. He was adjusting the Velcro straps when Ronan arrived. He took the corner on two wheels and came to a hard stop inches from Grayson\u2019s car. Grabbing his vest, he walked over to Grayson, saw Olivia, and nodded to her.</p><p>\u201cHow many inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour adults, but there could be more.\u201d</p><p>They could hear sirens wailing in the distance. \u201cAre we waiting for additional backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s a boy inside. We can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>Grayson bent down to look at Olivia and once again ordered her to stay inside the car.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to court with these people. They\u2019re . . . sadistic.\u201d</p><p>His nod indicated he\u2019d heard her. He pulled his gun free, and with Ronan at his side headed to the house.</p><p>The streetlights were dim, but Olivia could see that the Purdy house should have been condemned years ago. At least half of the shingles were missing from the sagging roof, and the aluminum siding had been torn off both sides. The wood on the front porch looked as though it had been torched, and there were holes in the porch floor. In the shadows, she could just make out Grayson kicking in the front door.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t realize she was holding her breath until her chest started to hurt. Two shots were fired in rapid succession, then another and another. A man came running around the side of the house. He had a gun in his hand and was glancing over his shoulder. He appeared to be young, in his late teens. Dressed in a filthy tank top and jeans, he had a crazed look in his eyes.</p><p>He headed to the street but didn\u2019t make it. Ronan came at him from one direction, and Grayson from the other. The man fired wild, and a second later they had him facedown in the dirt.</p> <p>Two squad cars arrived. The policemen ran to Grayson, and after he filled them in, they rushed into the house.</p><p>Where was Tyler? Was he safe? He knew to hide, but would he come out for the FBI or the police?</p><p>Olivia glanced in the rearview mirror and saw three men she was pretty sure were gang members. They were half a block away and were walking toward her. One of them picked up a board from the gutter, but an older man in the middle of the three shook his head, and the board was immediately tossed back into the street. Were the three simply curious to know what was going on, or were they wanting a fight?</p><p>The police brought out two of the most frightening-looking men Olivia had ever seen. They were handcuffed and shouting for lawyers. Odd how even the most drugged degenerates with burned-out brains still understood the law and knew how to manipulate it. Odd and disgusting.</p><p>Grayson and Ronan were both talking to a policeman, but she noticed their gazes were locked on the group that had stopped in the street a couple of houses away. Their number had increased from three to six. A child, no older than six or seven, ran down the street to join them.</p><p>Olivia watched as the leader of the group grabbed the little boy by the arm and pivoted him in the opposite direction, yelling, \u201cMarcus, I told you to stay inside. Now, go home.\u201d</p><p>The boy started to protest, but when the older man gave him a hard shove, he reluctantly walked away with slouched shoulders, dragging his feet.</p><p>Olivia turned back to the house and saw something moving on the roof. Oh God, it was Tyler. In the moonlight she could see him creeping along the ridge.</p> <p>She flew out of the car and called to Grayson. \u201cTyler\u2019s on the roof.\u201d</p><p>Grayson rushed back inside, and a minute later he was reaching for Tyler from the second-story window. The boy wouldn\u2019t budge, but when Grayson pointed to Olivia, he began to inch his way down the slope.</p><p>While she waited for them, yet another squad car arrived. When one of the policemen asked how many bodies were inside, Ronan answered, \u201cTwo in the kitchen, one male, one female.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, and Tyler flew across the porch and down the stairs. He ran to Olivia and nearly knocked her off her feet when he threw himself into her arms.</p><p>She hugged him tight. \u201cAre you all right? They didn\u2019t hurt you, did they?\u201d</p><p>His head was tucked under her chin, his voice muffled when he answered. She could feel him trembling, and he was crying softly.</p><p>\u201cI did it the right way, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked. \u201cI said your name when I called you on the phone, just like you told me to if I was in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did it just the way we practiced. You\u2019re very brave, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Are you ready to let go of me yet?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cYou smell good. How come you\u2019re all dressed up?\u201d</p><p>As she walked to Grayson\u2019s car and opened the back door for him, she explained that her aunt had received a special award.</p><p>One of the gang members who had been watching shouted to Tyler. \u201cIs she going to put you in juvie?\u201d</p><p>Another yelled, \u201cWhat\u2019d you do, kid?\u201d</p><p>Tyler turned to the group. \u201cI\u2019m not going to juvie, and I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d He pointed to Olivia and said, \u201cShe\u2019s my lawyer. I called her, and she came right away. She\u2019s taking me back to my new home.\u201d His voice was filled with pride.</p><p>The leader of the group, a hard-looking man who was probably still in his twenties but looked fifty, motioned to his friends to stay where they were as he walked over to Olivia. Grayson was suddenly standing in front of her.</p><p>The man stepped to the side so that he could see Olivia and asked, \u201cAre you really his lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m Tyler\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>The man glanced warily at Grayson, then said, \u201cUh . . . do you have any cards on you with your phone number in case one of us needs a lawyer? I didn\u2019t like my last one. He didn\u2019t do anything to help me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to answer him. The thought of representing a gang member made her shudder.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t realize it, Tyler came to her rescue. \u201cYou have to go through court to get her,\u201d he said, sounding very grown-up. \u201cThe judge gave her to me.\u201d</p><p>The explanation seemed plausible to the man. He nodded and headed back to his friends. He suddenly stopped, then turned to Grayson. \u201cYou got the kid out just in time. Another couple of hours would have been too late. Those fools decided they would make their own meth. Cut out the middleman,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were going to start cooking tonight. They would have blown themselves up and taken the kid with them.\u201d</p><p>Grayson wanted to get the boy away before the bodies were carried out. He and Ronan had surprised the aunt and the uncle when they burst into the house. Startled, the woman had thrown a meat cleaver at them and then she and the uncle reached for their guns and began shooting. Grayson heard Ronan mutter, \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d a scant second before he shot her.</p><p>Olivia waited while Grayson and Ronan wrapped up things with the police. She had put Tyler in the backseat. After he\u2019d snapped on the seat belt, she\u2019d covered him with Grayson\u2019s jacket. Clearly exhausted, the child was sound asleep minutes later.</p><p>She called the foster mother and filled her in on what had happened, assured her that Tyler was all right, and estimated that she\u2019d have him back home within an hour.</p><p>When they were finally on their way, Grayson said, \u201cOne of the policemen told me they\u2019d been to the aunt and uncle\u2019s house this evening looking for Tyler. They searched the house but couldn\u2019t find him. The foster mother reported him missing when he didn\u2019t come home in the carpool from soccer practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe aunt was probably waiting to grab him,\u201d she said. She looked back at Tyler to make sure he was sleeping and then asked in a whisper, \u201cAre they both dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was pleased he didn\u2019t embellish. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t feel relieved, should I? It\u2019s just that they were such vicious people, and they wouldn\u2019t have left Tyler alone. The drugs made them evil.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, they were already evil. Drugs made them bolder. Does Tyler like where he\u2019s living now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe foster mother is a loving woman. He\u2019s very comfortable there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he tell you if he weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a secret code for that, too.\u201d</p><p>As they drove toward Tyler\u2019s new home, Olivia was thinking how fortunate it was that Grayson had been with her tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were with me. It made it so much easier. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto the expressway and cut over to the middle lane. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Tell me, what would you have done if you\u2019d been home when Tyler called? You told me there wasn\u2019t time for me to take you home to get your car. Would you have driven into that neighborhood alone?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t like the answer. \u201cI always call for backup,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd usually the squad car beats me to the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not always.\u201d</p><p>His frown was fierce. \u201cWhat about tonight? What would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler was on the roof. I would have signaled to him not to move because the roof wasn\u2019t stable. Then I would have figured out a way to get him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he was inside the house, and you heard him screaming?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cI would have gone in after him.\u201d</p><p>Even though Grayson knew that\u2019s what she was going to say, it still infuriated him.</p><p>\u201cNo training, no weapon . . . what would you have done? Shout at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I heard Tyler scream, I would have gone in,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd so would you.\u201d</p><p>Only after she made that statement did she realize how foolish it was.</p><p>\u201cOf course I would have,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained for situations like this, and I carry a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is ridiculous. Tyler\u2019s safe, and that\u2019s all that counts. It all worked out.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t ready to let it go. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing you\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea how truthful that remark was. \u201cYes, it is,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been close to death, and maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re such an optimist.\u201d</p><p>Never been near death? Try two years\u2019 worth, she thought. And optimistic? Her friends were constantly telling her she was too negative. What would Grayson think if he knew this about her?</p><p>The discussion finally ended when they reached the foster home. Grayson carried Tyler inside and put him in his bed. The child never opened his eyes.</p><p>It was three in the morning by the time they reached Olivia\u2019s apartment. Unaccustomed to such late hours, Olivia was exhausted. Grayson, on the other hand, looked as though he\u2019d just started the evening.</p><p>He parked in front of her building. The doorman rushed outside to tell him he had to move his car, but then he saw the weapon at his side and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, John. He\u2019s with the FBI,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Miss MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Everything\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. She stopped at the elevator and turned to Grayson. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her to the wall when he reached around her to push the button.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still nervous with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up into his eyes. She was barely inches away from him. All she had to do was tilt her head ever so slightly and lean in, and she\u2019d be kissing him. She didn\u2019t give in to the urge.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m no longer nervous with you.\u201d It was a blatant lie, but she thought she\u2019d told it well.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t buying it. He flashed that adorable smile again. He could get anything he wanted with that smile, she thought. And probably did. That reminder helped. She knew women threw themselves at him, but she wouldn\u2019t be one of them. He wasn\u2019t her type.</p><p>She laughed. Talk about a whopper of a lie. That was the big daddy of them all.</p><p>The elevator doors opened on three. He stepped back to let her out first, then followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking you\u2019re not my type, and that was funny to me because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYour type?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re every woman\u2019s type, she thought. She didn\u2019t tell him that, thank God. Instead, she said, \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m not making much sense.\u201d</p><p>Her apartment was at the end of the hall. She got her keys out of her purse and unlocked the door. Grayson pushed it open and backed her inside. His eyes never left hers as he put his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI had a lovely time tonight,\u201d she said, remembering the awards gala. \u201cIt was really nice . . .\u201d She realized what she was saying. \u201cExcept for the two people you had to shoot and except for . . . Oh God, Grayson, just kiss me. I won\u2019t stop talking until you do.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer, and his lips brushed over hers. It was a quick middle-school kind of kiss, a prelude, she quickly realized, to driving her out of her mind. As soon as she put her arms around his neck, he stopped teasing her. His mouth opened and his tongue delved inside to rub against hers. She tightened her hold. His mouth was doing magical things to her, and every nerve in her body reacted. It was the most erotic kiss she\u2019d ever experienced, and she never wanted it to end. He made love to her with his tongue, and when he lifted his head he could have taken anything he wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sagged against him. Taking a deep breath, she let go of him and stepped back so he could leave, even though she wanted him to kiss her again. She wanted . . . him.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to lock the door,\u201d he said in parting. His voice was a rough whisper.</p><p>And he was gone. Her hand shook as she flipped the deadbolt. She kicked her shoes off, walked into the bedroom, and dropped down on the bed.</p><p>She knew she was going to be thinking about that kiss for a long time, and she wondered . . . had it meant anything to him?</p> <p>NINE</p><p>Olivia was having a lazy Sunday afternoon. She read The Washington Post and The New York Times, did two crossword puzzles, played three games of Words with Friends on her iPhone, and was now talking to Samantha and Collins on a conference call to give them an update on Jane. It had been two months since her last transfusion, and she was back in the hospital again.</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t mention Grayson Kincaid to them, Olivia couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. She wasn\u2019t sure why she didn\u2019t tell them about him. Maybe it was because she didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of their relationship. Besides, there really wasn\u2019t anything to tell, was there? In the two months since the awards gala, he hadn\u2019t called her. Of course, he never said he would. In fact, his last words to her were a reminder to lock her door. How romantic was that?</p><p>At the very least, he owed her an update on Jorguson. She hadn\u2019t heard a word about the investigation.</p><p>For the first full week after their alleged date, she was certain he\u2019d get in touch with her. The second week she convinced herself that he was too busy to call but that he would eventually get around to it. After three full weeks had passed and not a word, she decided hell would freeze over before she went out with him. She had wasted enough time thinking about him and vowed she wouldn\u2019t spend one more second remembering that amazing kiss. Yeah, right. That was pretty much still all she could think about.</p> <p>Would he have kissed her if she hadn\u2019t asked him to? Now that was the million-dollar question.</p><p>Olivia realized she was daydreaming again while she was still on the conference call. Sam and Collins were discussing Jane\u2019s medical issues, and she forced herself to pay attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the last transfusion help?\u201d Collins asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it didn\u2019t?\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s back in the hospital,\u201d Sam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu told Jane he wanted to run a couple of tests, that\u2019s all. He insists he\u2019s not worried, and we trust him, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course we do,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for him. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have the same blood type,\u201d Collins reminded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were put in the experimental program. I don\u2019t understand why Dr. Pardieu won\u2019t take some of ours, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine just happens to work better for her,\u201d Olivia answered. \u201cYou know, if you\u2019re so worried, you could talk to Jane about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too soon for you to give blood again?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia assured. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost eight weeks. If she needs it again, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I were there. I can tell how Jane\u2019s feeling just by looking at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Collins insisted. \u201cBut you know the last thing she needs now is stress. Olivia, Sam told me that creepy brother of hers is hanging around again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Logan is really trying this time. I think he might make it. He lives in a halfway house, and he\u2019s working. Jane says he hasn\u2019t missed a single day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Collins admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe cares about Jane, and he\u2019s trying to make up for all the pain he\u2019s caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will take a lifetime,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cIf Jane can forgive him, we can, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cShe went back into the hospital last week, and Logan has been there every day. He comes to see her on his lunch hour and after work. When she\u2019s home, he brings her dinner. He\u2019s trying, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give him another chance,\u201d Sam said. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to go. Quickly, Olivia, tell me how your search is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get access to my father\u2019s records, so I\u2019ve run into another dead end,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have been able to get copies of some of the statements for his fund, though, and reading them is like gazing at the stars and trying to identify each one. There are lists of thousands of investments. Some of them I recognize as legitimate but the rest are really obscure. It appears that there are a great many in foreign countries. It also appears that the portfolio changes constantly. I swear he\u2019s Houdini. He might be committing the perfect crime because I can\u2019t find the fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t find it yet,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect crime. At least that\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still determined to become an FBI agent?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered emphatically. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019ll be a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you begin your training?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still waiting to hear. I know the academy will be a challenge, so I\u2019ve decided to get a head start. I\u2019ve been going to a firing range to get some practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you shot anyone yet?\u201d Sam asked with feigned alarm.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Collins answered indignantly, \u201cbut there have been a couple of close calls.\u201d</p><p>She shared a few stories about her first experiences with a firearm. By the time the friends ended their conversation, she had them laughing uproariously.</p><p>Olivia had just disconnected the call when another came in. Her boss, Royal Thurman, was on the line. He had never called her at home before, and an alarm was sounding inside her head. Something bad was coming, she thought.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem I need to discuss with you,\u201d he began in his deep baritone voice. \u201cDo you have any time this afternoon? My wife and daughters are shopping at Tysons Corner, but they\u2019re going to meet me for dinner at Neeson\u2019s Caf\u00e9 at six. My girls love their macaroni and cheese. The restaurant is quite close to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you stop by the caf\u00e9 at five? It\u2019s important, Olivia, or I wouldn\u2019t bother you at home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him to explain what the problem was or even to give her a hint. She was supposed to have dinner with her aunt, but Emma had decided to go to Palm Springs early for a seminar to get away from the cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Don\u2019t borrow trouble, she warned herself. The nurses used to say that to her when she was worried about the results of one of her tests. And for a long while, the results had been bad. It didn\u2019t seem to matter if she borrowed trouble or not. She took a deep breath. This wasn\u2019t the chemo isolation unit, and she was now an adult. If Thurman was going to fire her or let her go because of cutbacks, so be it. She\u2019d find another job. But wouldn\u2019t he do it during office hours?</p><p>Olivia had told her boss about her horrid interview with Jorguson. He hadn\u2019t laughed, but she could tell he wanted to. He\u2019d assured her that, when the cutbacks came, he would do everything he could to protect her.</p><p>Maybe that had changed.</p><p>Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have long to stew about all the possibilities for the meeting. It was already three thirty. She jumped into the shower, washed and dried her hair, and pulled it back in a ponytail. She dressed in a heavy, dark green sweater, skinny jeans, and knee-high boots. She even took time to put on some makeup and dab perfume on her wrists.</p><p>She pulled on her heavy sheepskin coat, a bright red wool scarf, a knit cap, and gloves. The inside of her coat had a large pocket, so she put a credit card in it, added her driver\u2019s license, three twenty-dollar bills, her cell phone, and her keys. She zipped the pocket closed and headed to the elevator.</p><p>John was on duty in the lobby. \u201cIt\u2019s awful cold out there,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Neeson\u2019s to meet my boss,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Neeson\u2019s. They\u2019ve got the best mac and cheese in the city. My stomach\u2019s grumbling just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to bring you some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, no. I wasn\u2019t hinting.\u201d He opened the door for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some,\u201d she promised as she walked past.</p><p>The blast of frigid air entering her lungs as she stepped outside reminded her that she\u2019d left her inhaler in her apartment. She turned to run back up to get it but changed her mind. Neeson\u2019s Caf\u00e9 was six short blocks away from her building, and if she took her time, she\u2019d be fine. She didn\u2019t want to keep Mr. Thurman waiting.</p><p>By the time she was halfway to the restaurant, she was frozen solid. It was bitterly cold, and there was a wet, blustery wind. The lighted display on the bank across the street said it was eighteen degrees. She increased her pace the last two blocks. When she walked into the tiny vestibule, the warm air stung her cheeks, and her lungs felt like they were burning.</p><p>Although she was ten minutes early, Mr. Thurman was already there in a large booth in the back of the nearly empty restaurant. He looked relieved to see her. It was bad, all right. She reminded herself not to borrow trouble and almost laughed at the notion.</p><p>Mr. Thurman, the ultimate gentleman, helped her with her coat and hung it up for her, then waited until she was seated before he slid into the booth across from her. He pushed his empty coffee cup to the side and stacked his big hands on the table. When a waitress came over with a coffeepot and refilled his cup, Olivia requested hot tea and an order of mac and cheese to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right to it,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cI was about to sit down for Sunday breakfast when I received a call from Carl Simmons of Simmons, Simmons and Falcon. You\u2019re familiar with the law firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean to say, I\u2019d heard of the firm, but I\u2019d never had a conversation with any of them until today. You can guess what the topic was.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must also know that the firm represents your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But why would he call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl . . .\u201d He paused to smile and said, \u201cHe insisted I call him by his first name because he\u2019s certain we will become good friends who\u2014according to him\u2014will help each other. I could almost hear him winking over the phone,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t care for the man one little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe felt it was his duty to warn me about you. He believes you may be abusing your position as counsel for the IRS. I asked him what proof he had, knowing full well there wasn\u2019t any, and he hemmed and hawed. Then he got to his obvious agenda. He specifically mentioned your father. Simmons believes you\u2019re trying to manufacture evidence to discredit him. If that happens, his investors will lose faith in him, and before you know it, they\u2019ll remove their money, and his fund will go belly up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not manufacturing evidence, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Olivia,\u201d he said, his voice kind and sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m merely repeating what he said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked on cases I\u2019ve been assigned and only those cases,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t looked at my father\u2019s file. That would be illegal, and besides, what would be the point? It\u2019s all a fairy tale. I came to the IRS to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me about your father before I hired you, remember? You do exceptional work. Researching your father\u2019s dealings outside of your job hasn\u2019t interfered with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you to be ready for what\u2019s coming. Simmons hinted . . . strongly hinted,\u201d he stressed, \u201cthat you were mentally unstable and needed help. He also suggested that your family is determined to see that you get it. He kept saying \u2018in my opinion\u2019 and seemed to think slandering you is perfectly okay if he\u2019s only giving his opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a new tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come right out and say that you\u2019re unfit, but I\u2019ll tell you, Olivia, he\u2019s going to try to get you fired. He\u2019ll go over my head, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be successful. If what you say is true about your father\u2019s investment fund, I\u2019m guessing that Simmons is raking in profits right along with him. He isn\u2019t going to let you ruin it for him. He\u2019s shrewd, all right. He\u2019ll get out right before the bubble bursts. I\u2019ve seen it before, and it saddens me to say I know I\u2019ll see it again. Greed has a way of overtaking morals.\u201d</p><p>The hot tea was placed in front of her along with a carryout bag. She thanked the waitress and handed her a twenty-dollar bill.</p><p>She stared out the window and wasn\u2019t surprised to see snow falling. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCould your judgment be impaired because of past experiences with your father? Could you be wrong about him now? What if he\u2019s innocent? Have you considered that he might have learned some valuable lessons over the years and has made up his mind to be honest in his dealings? Your father is thought by many to have a special knack when it comes to picking stocks. His portfolio performance is quite impressive.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he realized how naive he sounded. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s learned any lessons. I think he\u2019s just gotten better at hiding his crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, his fund has gone through the roof,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cHis clients have made enormous profits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, you aren\u2019t one of his clients, are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd suffer your wrath? No, of course not. I just want you to consider the possibility that your father might be a changed man.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thurman wasn\u2019t familiar with the details of her father\u2019s history. He, therefore, wasn\u2019t convinced that her father was doing anything wrong, and she didn\u2019t have any evidence to prove that he was. Still, her boss was loyal to her. After pointing out the possibility that she could be mistaken, he let it go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His family arrived promptly at six. They asked her to have dinner with them, but she declined, explaining she had made plans to see her friend who was in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to get snow tonight,\u201d Mr. Thurman said. \u201cIf you have to drive, be careful.\u201d</p><p>Olivia counted herself lucky to have such a great boss. He genuinely cared about her. She knew he was trying to protect her from being laid off, and now he was trying to help her with the Carl Simmons situation.</p><p>She had just left the restaurant when her cell phone rang. She stepped back inside the warm entry to answer.</p> <p>Judge Bowen was on the line. \u201cOlivia, I just received a call from an attorney named Carl Simmons . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. What did he say?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, let me guess. In his opinion, I\u2019m unstable and making things up.\u201d</p><p>The judge chuckled. \u201cYes, he did say something like that, though he did coat it with his concern for you and the well-being of any children who may be in your charge. He was playing me, Olivia, and you know how much I hate that. He didn\u2019t come right out and say it, but he implied that you were unfit, and he felt it was his duty to caution me. He said the occasional case I give you involves vulnerable children, and I should be aware that, because of your fragile state of mind, if anything were to happen to one of the children, I could be held responsible. Did you know you\u2019re about to have a nervous breakdown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Simmons insisted that he was telling me this in the strictest of confidence,\u201d he said with obvious disgust. \u201cHe added that your father is being urged to have you committed for a seventy-two-hour evaluation.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia was shaking with anger. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you were dragged into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what this is all about. Simmons\u2019s firm represents your father . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re probing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned Simmons you could sue him for slander, and he assured me that it would never happen. He said he was only trying to protect the innocent, and that he had proof of your irrational acts. He brought up a couple of names. Just a second . . . I wrote them down.\u201d He paused and she heard papers rustling. \u201cHere they are: a Frank Greeley and a Kimberly Mills . . .\u201d</p> <p>She had to think for a second. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were involved in two different cases I handled for Judge Thorpe. Greeley was a real hothead. He claimed that I had manufactured lies that he was an abusive father. \u2018Crazed with power\u2019 I believe were his words. Of course, the bruises and welts on his four-year-old little girl didn\u2019t give him much credibility. Mills also called me crazy. She had been called to the office for a meeting about an abuse charge. I happened to walk in just as she\u2019d grabbed her little boy and was about to backhand him. I knocked her down, and she began screaming that I was a lunatic. In both instances, the parents filed a complaint, but nothing came of them. It would take some fancy footwork for Simmons to create a case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her temple and took a deep breath to calm down. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also alluded to drugs you had taken in the past that may have had a lasting effect on your mental state and impaired your judgment.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a private person, and I hate asking, but was there ever a time . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a child, I went through chemotherapy.\u201d</p><p>The judge was outraged on her behalf. \u201cIf you can find grounds to sue him, I\u2019ll testify,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you tie up all his firm\u2019s assets and paralyze them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that will happen, but thank you for your support,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll give Judge Thorpe a call and give him a heads-up. He\u2019ll probably get a real kick out of the drug accusation.\u201d</p><p>Once she got past her anger, Olivia realized she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Carl Simmons had contacted Mr. Thurman and Judge Bowen. The slimeball had been calling her on a regular basis and threatening her. The scare tactics weren\u2019t working, though, and that must have been exceedingly frustrating for Carl. It was a natural progression to go to her employers. Poke the bear, he\u2019s bound to attack. And she\u2019d certainly been poking and prodding. Of course they would retaliate.</p><p>It was a pity he hadn\u2019t come right out and slandered her. According to Judge Bowen, Simmons came close a couple of times, but the creep knew what he was doing. Olivia understood his plan. He would try to discredit her, destroy her reputation, and attack her character. She also knew that the next attack would be even more despicable but within the law.</p><p>Slimeball was smart, but she was smarter, she told herself. Eventually she would nail him for his part in ripping off innocent people, stealing their life savings, while he was living the high life. His day in court was coming.</p><p>She pulled her coat collar up around her neck, adjusted the scarf, and started walking home. The snow was coming down in sheets, and there was already more than an inch on the sidewalk. Had the temperature dropped? She couldn\u2019t make out the numbers on the bank, but she thought it felt colder because her face was stinging, and her lungs struggled to take in the frozen air. She tugged on her scarf and pulled it up over her mouth and nose. Why hadn\u2019t she gone back for her inhaler? She would love to sprint home, but she couldn\u2019t. Her chest was already tight, and she was wheezing. She had to slow the pace.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any traffic, and she was the only person on the street. The snow was swirling down all around her, and the only sound was the gushing wind. The streetlights looked like they were covered in gauze. As bitterly cold as it was, she thought it was beautiful. Her street looked like a holiday greeting card. Everything was so clean and white, and all the little lights in the windows of the apartments were glowing. It was almost magical.</p><p>Being the pessimist that she was, she reminded herself that tomorrow it would all be a mess. Slush from cars would splatter against the windows, and the snow would turn brown and gray from being trod upon. But tonight it was pretty.</p><p>No way she was going to drive to the hospital, though. She had already slipped twice crossing streets, and people\u2014including her\u2014were crazy when they drove in snow. Olivia decided she\u2019d make herself a cup of hot tea and call Jane to check on her. She didn\u2019t feel guilty. She was going to see her friend tomorrow after work when she donated more blood for her. They\u2019d have a nice chat then.</p><p>There was an SUV illegally parked at the end of the block. Though she couldn\u2019t see him, she knew the driver was inside because the motor was running and the windshield wipers were moving. Must be waiting for someone, she thought as she crossed the street and hurried on. She switched the carryout bag from one arm to the other and tried to take a deep breath. She could really use her inhaler now. The green awning over the entrance of her building was weighed down by the snow. She could tell the walkway had been shoveled, but it was quickly filling up with fresh flakes.</p><p>She was almost home when she heard an odd popping sound. She pictured a giant champagne bottle being uncorked. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the SUV coming toward her. Then she saw John through the window of her apartment building. He was standing behind his desk. He smiled when he spotted her and hurried to unlock the door.</p><p>All of a sudden there was rapid gunfire, bullets whizzing all around her. She understood what was happening and knew she needed to get to safety, but her legs wouldn\u2019t cooperate. She felt an excruciating jolt of pain in her thigh, then another jolt near her shoulder that was so forceful it knocked her back. The third jolt sent her spinning into the wall. Her head slammed against the brick, and her body crumpled to the ground. The world began to reel in a chaotic blur, with images of snow and lights and brown bags flying through the air. She tried to get up, but a dizzying fog rolled over her, and everything went black.</p><p>TEN</p><p>She made the ten o\u2019clock news.</p><p>Grayson had the television on and was half listening to the end of a Dateline interview with a congressional lobbyist while he finished his third report on his laptop. He hit the \u201csend\u201d button and closed the lid. It was Sunday evening, and he was only now finishing work.</p><p>He put the laptop back in his briefcase on the table next to his nephew\u2019s school backpack. In the two months since Henry had come to live with him, Grayson\u2019s apartment had lost all semblance of order. The backpack was lying open; papers were sticking out every which way, and the report on volcanoes that was due tomorrow wasn\u2019t there. Grayson searched the living room, then went back into the den. He tripped over some Legos and a remote-control robot Henry was building, and found the report on the sofa, half hidden under Henry\u2019s tennis shoes.</p><p>Grayson made sure the entire report was there, then put it back in the yellow folder and added it to the papers he\u2019d already straightened inside the backpack. The child would probably still lose at least one assignment before he got to class if history was any indication, but he was getting better at organization. He no longer left his backpack in the car.</p><p>Grayson went into his bedroom and was about to change out of his jeans and sweater when he heard the newscaster say that a young woman had been gunned down in front of her apartment building. A conversation about the city came back to Grayson. Washington, D.C., could be a dangerous place to live, and one had to be careful, but the energy here made the city irresistible. Hadn\u2019t Olivia said that? He smiled remembering.</p><p>A day didn\u2019t go by that he didn\u2019t think about her, and if his life hadn\u2019t gotten so damned complicated, he thought he\u2019d most likely be with her right now.</p><p>He picked up the remote to turn up the volume. The lead into the news was over and a commercial was playing. He stood in front of the flat screen and waited. He assumed the shooting had something to do with the gang war going on, and he was curious to know where it happened.</p><p>Then Ted on Channel 12 announced that he was reporting live from Georgetown. Grayson stopped breathing. \u201cAh, hell,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t let it be Olivia.\u201d The sick feeling in his gut contradicted the hope. He told himself he was overreacting. It had been two months since Jorguson had threatened her, but he had calmed down since then.</p><p>The newscaster said the name of the street, then the camera switched to the chaotic scene in front of an apartment building. Her apartment building. Grayson recognized the doorman. What was his name? John, he remembered. The man\u2019s face was gray. Grayson could see his hands shaking as he clutched something that looked like a paper bag against his chest. He was standing in the background talking to a couple of detectives. Grayson didn\u2019t recognize either one of them.</p><p>It was Olivia. Had to be. Even though he had spent only one evening with her, she had made a lasting impression. She was a beautiful, smart, and caring woman, and the way she handled that terrified little boy was something to see. The world needed Olivia MacKenzie.</p><p>His cell phone rang. Ronan\u2019s greeting was brisk. \u201cAre you watching the news? Olivia MacKenzie was shot multiple times, and she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, reacting to the fury in Grayson\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took her to St. Paul\u2019s. It\u2019s the closest trauma center,\u201d he explained. \u201cI talked to Detective Cusack, and he told me Olivia\u2019s in surgery now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got hit three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had just put his gun in his safe. He got it out and shoved it back in its holster, then picked up his badge. His hands shook. That surprised him, and he realized he needed to get his anger under control.</p><p>He went down the hall and quietly opened the door to one of his spare rooms to check on Henry. His nephew was sleeping soundly. He pulled the door closed and went into the kitchen. The housekeeper, Patrick, was sitting at the table making a grocery list. Grayson told him where he was going and headed out.</p><p>The snow was still coming down hard, and the roads were like an ice rink. There were car accidents everywhere. Grayson drove his SUV and took as many side streets as he could to avoid getting slammed by other drivers. He parked the car in the doctors\u2019 lot close to the hospital door. The security guard didn\u2019t give him any argument once he showed him his badge.</p><p>He got directions to the surgical floor, and in a hurry, he took the stairs. The floor was nearly deserted. A scrub nurse was rushing by. He stopped her and asked where Olivia MacKenzie was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in the OR,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhere are the guards?\u201d he asked then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry? There aren\u2019t any guards on this floor.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t show any reaction to that news but asked, \u201cCould you find out her condition and how much longer she\u2019ll be in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. The surgical waiting room is right down that hallway,\u201d she said motioning to her left.</p><p>\u201cWhich OR is Olivia in?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the doors at the end of the hallway on the right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d No one could get past him as long as he blocked access to the OR.</p><p>The nurse promised to be right back. She rushed down the corridor, then picked up a wall phone directly outside the OR doors.</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone and started making calls. Within minutes he\u2019d arranged twenty-four-hour protection for Olivia.</p><p>He refused to even consider the possibility that she might not make it. The idea was simply untenable. It was bizarre, this connection he felt, but he didn\u2019t try to reason through it.</p><p>Ronan arrived a few minutes later. His dark hair was covered with snow. He brushed it off as he walked down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStill in surgery. A nurse is checking on her condition.\u201d</p><p>Ronan looked around. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here. No police, no hospital guards . . . what the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got agents on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is our case then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ronan said, nodding. \u201cDo you think Jorguson\u2019s responsible? He did boast that he was going to have her killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was two months ago. He\u2019s threatened a couple of other attorneys since then. He\u2019s a hothead, and I know he\u2019s got some badasses for clients, but I still don\u2019t think this was his work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not marking him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either,\u201d Grayson agreed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho besides Jorguson would want her out of the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works for the IRS. That could open up all sorts of possibilities. Who knows what some disgruntled taxpayer might do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve released her name yet, which means they haven\u2019t notified the family. Probably still trying to locate them.\u201d Ronan walked down to the surgical waiting room to see if anyone was there. He returned a minute later. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I get an update, I\u2019ll call Olivia\u2019s aunt.\u201d</p><p>The nurse he\u2019d asked to check on Olivia interrupted. She was smiling. \u201cThe patient is on her way to recovery. She\u2019s going to be all right. The surgeon said he would be out in a few minutes to talk to you. He also said she\u2019s a very lucky young lady.\u201d</p><p>Grayson felt as though he could take a deep breath again, so great was his relief. Ronan noticed. He waited until the nurse had left, then asked, \u201cYou only had one date with Olivia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d</p><p>Grayson knew what he was asking. \u201cWhat the hell, Ronan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They both heard the bell indicating the elevator doors were about to open. Each put his hand on the grip of his weapon and waited. Two detectives stepped out. The younger one was the spitting image of the actor Tom Cruise, down to the thick brown hair and square jaw.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that guy look like . . .\u201d Ronan whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he does,\u201d Grayson agreed.</p> <p>Both detectives were eating sandwiches and chatting. They stopped when they saw Grayson and Ronan. The older one, wearing part of his sandwich on his mustache, called out, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI,\u201d Ronan answered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be here. We\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Grayson didn\u2019t raise his voice, but the look in his eyes showed he was in charge.</p><p>\u201cThis is our case,\u201d the Tom Cruise look-alike snapped. He had a definite swagger as he walked toward Grayson.</p><p>Grayson wasn\u2019t impressed with his rooster tactics. Neither was Ronan who said, \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t your case. It\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were assigned this at the scene,\u201d Mustache told them. \u201cDidn\u2019t see either of you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew this woman was gunned down, that it was a hit, right?\u201d Grayson asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Mustache replied.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t think to post guards?\u201d</p><p>The two detectives glanced at each other. Then Mustache said, \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery. We were going to wait and see if she made it . . .\u201d</p><p>Grayson spotted the surgeon at the end of the hall. He was talking to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cYou deal with them,\u201d he told Ronan as he walked toward the OR doors.</p><p>He heard Cruise say, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make some calls.\u201d</p><p>Ronan responded, \u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>After Grayson talked to the surgeon, he made the dreaded call to Emma Monroe, Olivia\u2019s aunt. It hadn\u2019t taken him long to get her cell phone number and to find out she was in Palm Springs for a seminar.</p><p>Emma knew something was wrong as soon as she answered the phone and heard Grayson\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demanded before he could continue. \u201cWas there an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d he said and then explained what had happened to her. He also told Emma what the surgeon had said and ended by repeating once again that Olivia was going to be fine.</p><p>Emma was beside herself. \u201cThree gunshots? Someone shot her three times? Who would do such a thing to a lovely, kind . . . she\u2019s been through so much . . . she\u2019s had so much pain and now this. You find out who did this, Grayson.\u201d She went from shock to fury.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cWhere was she shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight hip, left shoulder, and left side,\u201d he said. He\u2019d already given her that information, but he knew she was having trouble taking it all in.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to contact Dr. Pardieu. I hope the surgeon has already called him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndre Pardieu. He\u2019s her physician. Grayson, I\u2019m going to get on the first flight I can find . . . no, I\u2019ll charter a jet,\u201d she decided. \u201cI should be there\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grayson interrupted. \u201cThe city\u2019s snowed in, Emma. No flights in or out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be alone. She needs someone to watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be someone with her at all times,\u201d he promised. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone called her parents and her sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call them. They\u2019re all in Miami, celebrating with some new investors. Olivia\u2019s father purchased a mansion overlooking the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Grayson could hear the disapproval in her voice, which told him there were family issues. He didn\u2019t care about that. His total focus was on finding out who wanted Olivia MacKenzie dead.</p><p>Little did he know just how high that number would be.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Olivia could have sworn Tom Cruise stopped by to say hello. Then Grayson appeared and shooed him away.</p><p>She floated in and out of consciousness. Everything was a blur, and visions swirled around in her head: snow and paper bags flying through the air and John\u2019s face at the window and a thin crimson line streaming across the white earth. Then, out of the fog, Grayson\u2019s face appeared. Why was he there? Did he want to kiss her again? She couldn\u2019t focus enough to find out, and she drifted away once more.</p><p>The next time she came to, she felt something cold on her head. She forced her eyes open and saw Grayson leaning over her. She closed them again. She was hallucinating. Focus, she told herself. She knew she was dreaming and needed to make herself wake up. Yet, when she looked again, he was there. He was no illusion.</p><p>When he moved the cold pack on her head, she felt the throbbing pain. She opened her mouth to complain but nothing came out. Her throat was so sore.</p><p>Finally in a raspy voice she managed to whisper, \u201cWhat is it with you and ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you getting hit in the head?\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cThe nurse wants you to keep this on your bump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you slammed your head into the brick wall outside your building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a ready answer to her question. She struggled to sit up and felt pain all the way down to her toes.</p><p>\u201cBe useful. Help me sit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sitting up.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cGo away.\u201d She wanted to stay awake, but the fog was descending again and she couldn\u2019t fight it.</p><p>The next time she woke up, she was lucid and feeling half human. She looked around. She was in a room filled with vases of flowers, and Dr. Andre Pardieu was standing at the foot of the bed reading her chart.</p><p>\u201cBonjour, Docteur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re back with us,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have to give Jane some blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not now. You need to rebuild your strength, then you can help her.\u201d</p><p>Their conversation continued in rapid French. Grayson stood in the doorway listening. It was apparent the physician had great affection for Olivia. Grayson could have sworn he heard him call her Pipsqueak.</p><p>At the end of their talk, Dr. Pardieu switched back to English. \u201cNow that I see you\u2019re all right, I\u2019ll keep my plans to go to France. I\u2019ll be in Paris for a conference, and then I\u2019ll be going on a holiday with my family. If you need me, you know how to get hold of me.\u201d He kissed her on the forehead before he left the room.</p><p>Olivia was looking out the window when Grayson walked in, and she hadn\u2019t noticed him watching her. He wondered how anyone could look that good after being shot three times. Her face was pale, but she was still beautiful. Her dark auburn hair spilled out on the pillow behind her.</p><p>She caught him staring at her. Those clear blue eyes locked on his. Then he walked over to the window ledge and leaned against it. He folded his arms across his chest and said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things considered, pretty good,\u201d she replied.</p><p>What was he doing here? she wanted to ask. How did he get involved in this? One silly kiss, then two months without a word. Message received, she thought. He obviously hadn\u2019t wanted to have anything to do with her and had moved on. Damn it, so had she.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to answer some questions?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember,\u201d she said, surprised that she did. \u201cBut it won\u2019t help much. There was a black SUV parked at the end of the block. The motor was running, and I remember thinking that he was waiting for someone. Guess he was waiting for me, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>The topic of the conversation was horrific, she thought, yet they were both acting and sounding so casual about it. Olivia knew Grayson must be used to dealing with attempted murders and all sorts of other awful happenings. He was a pro at this sort of thing. Nothing much seemed to faze him. She, on the other hand, was a novice.</p><p>\u201cCould you see anyone in the SUV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the windows were tinted, and it was snowing. Visibility wasn\u2019t good. The driver was on my side of the street. And that\u2019s it, Grayson. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d She smiled and waited for his next question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, huh?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI should call my aunt. I don\u2019t want her to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? You didn\u2019t upset her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. Hearing that you\u2019d been shot three times didn\u2019t upset her at all.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his sarcasm. \u201cShe\u2019s in Palm Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s on her way here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia asked him about her boss and her friend Jane, but she didn\u2019t mention her parents or her sister.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of questions, and I\u2019ll let you rest while I go talk to Judge Bowen and Judge Thorpe,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo is your boss, Thurman. They\u2019re in the waiting room discussing their contempt for an attorney named Simmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are about twenty other people waiting to say hello and make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Judge Bowen, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before I go . . . do you have any idea who might have done this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean, who wants me dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She started wiggling fingers on her right hand, then her left, as she counted. Then her right hand again.</p><p>\u201cAt least fifteen people would like to get rid of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you include Jorguson?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cShould I? That makes it sixteen people who would like me to disappear. I\u2019m sure there are more. I\u2019ll be happy to write their names down for you.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was joking. He walked over to the side of her bed, towering over her. \u201cThis is a serious matter, Olivia,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am being serious, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt told me she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone would want to harm you. She said you\u2019re sweet and kindhearted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She sounded disgruntled.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to argue with her. He turned to leave and stopped, remembering the other question he wanted to ask. \u201cWhen we were having lunch, you told me you had a goal you wanted to accomplish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d hoped he\u2019d forgotten the conversation.</p><p>\u201cDoes your goal have anything to do with the number of people who would like to get rid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to explain, but she remained stubbornly silent. \u201cWe aren\u2019t playing twenty questions,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s your goal, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>She knew he would eventually find out what she was trying to do. What did she care if he thought she was a vindictive, traitorous daughter? Doing the right thing was more important than the guilt she felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put my father in prison.\u201d</p><p>After talking to Judge Bowen, Judge Thorpe, and Royal Thurman, Grayson understood their contempt for the attorney Carl Simmons. Suggesting that Olivia was a drug addict at a very young age when, in fact, she had gone through chemotherapy was despicable, and Grayson personally wanted to throw the bastard into a wall.</p><p>He spent the next several hours finding out all he could about Olivia that wasn\u2019t on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Her aunt Emma was a great help. Despite the weather, she had managed to get back to D.C., and they sat together in the nearly deserted hospital cafeteria discussing Olivia\u2019s past and her contentious relationship with her immediate family. Emma began by telling him about the experimental program Olivia and three other young girls were part of and a little of what they had endured.</p><p>\u201cOlivia wouldn\u2019t be happy I\u2019m telling you about this,\u201d Emma said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very private person. Her relationship with her parents was strained even back then. I didn\u2019t realize for a long time that none of them\u2014her father, her mother, nor her sister\u2014ever came to see Olivia when she was allowed visitors at the hospital. Olivia was all alone.\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t show any reaction to what she was telling him, but he now understood why Olivia helped kids who didn\u2019t have anyone to watch out for them. She knew what it was like.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert MacKenzie is one of the most charismatic men you\u2019ll ever meet. He could sell you a beach house in the Arctic. He walks into a room, and he owns it. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cIn the past Robert has run several companies. Each one ended up going under, yet Robert did quite well. He got his salary and bonus when he resigned. He\u2019s always lived extravagantly. When he bought a home in New York, I thought he would divorce my sister, but that didn\u2019t happen. She\u2019s still with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was CEO of these companies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was all legal,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNow he runs his own investment firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, the Trinity Fund, and it\u2019s quite successful. On paper anyway. Olivia knows several people who have given her father their retirement funds to invest. They all get quarterly statements showing how well their investments are doing. She\u2019s seen how her father works, and she\u2019s convinced this is just another one of his scams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe thinks he\u2019s running a Ponzi scheme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he is, she hasn\u2019t been able to prove it. Shall we head back upstairs? I\u2019d like to say good-bye to Olivia and find out if she needs me to bring her anything.\u201d</p><p>Grayson walked by Emma\u2019s side to the elevator. He was lost in thought. \u201cWhat do you think of Robert MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Olivia. He should be in prison.\u201d</p><p>The number of people on Olivia\u2019s enemy list made sense now. She\u2019d been asking questions and probing, bringing attention to her father\u2019s firm. She probably had already gone to the SEC, and the men raking in the money wouldn\u2019t like that one little bit.</p> <p>A woman in a wheelchair was coming out of Olivia\u2019s room when they arrived. A slender young man was pushing the chair. Emma introduced Olivia\u2019s friend Jane and her brother, Logan, to Grayson.</p><p>Logan extended his hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna catch this guy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grayson assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going home, Jane?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll come back in a month or so when Olivia\u2019s strength is back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia is giving Jane some of her blood,\u201d Logan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s got antibodies she needs. Right, Jane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOlivia\u2019s worn-out, so I wouldn\u2019t stay long. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us, Logan has a meeting to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need rest,\u201d he told Jane.</p><p>Emma and Grayson watched until they turned the corner. Then Emma said, \u201cJane doesn\u2019t look at all well, does she? She\u2019s so pale.\u201d</p><p>Grayson thought Jane\u2019s brother looked just as sickly. When Emma went on into Olivia\u2019s room, he stopped to go over the schedule with the agent on duty tonight. After that, he called Ronan to talk about Robert MacKenzie\u2019s investment firm and found out that Ronan had already dug into Olivia\u2019s family and had come up with all sorts of possibilities for those relatives who might want Olivia out of the way. He wondered if Olivia knew that her brother-in-law, George, had a gambling problem and had recently taken out another mortgage on his home to pay some of his debts.</p><p>By the time Grayson ended his conversation with Ronan, Emma had left and Olivia was alone. He checked his watch as he entered her room. He needed to head home soon. Now that his nephew was living with him, he tried to eat dinner with him as often as possible to give him some kind of stable home life.</p><p>Olivia was fighting sleep. The television was on, and she was trying to watch the news. Her eyelids kept closing on her. She saw Grayson and asked, \u201cWhy are you here? I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again. Were you assigned to this investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI asked for it.\u201d</p><p>The pain medication was kicking in, and she was feeling a bit loopy. \u201cBecause of Jorguson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, because of you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to get something straight.\u201d</p><p>She remembered. \u201cYou better understand, Grayson. I\u2019m never going to ask you to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>His cell phone rang, interrupting the moment, which was a good thing, he thought, because he was seriously thinking about kissing her. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t give in to the urge, but he didn\u2019t like the fact that he wanted her.</p><p>His nephew was calling to remind him that he had to build a solar system and that Grayson had promised to help.</p><p>\u201cWhat solar system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe solar system,\u201d Henry stressed.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first I\u2019m hearing about this, Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sure I told you, and I thought you said you would help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it due?\u201d he asked, thinking that he would make time this weekend to help him.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Ah, come on. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we need stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d Grayson wondered.</p><p>\u201cStuff to make it. Like Styrofoam and string maybe.\u201d</p><p>Grayson noticed that Olivia\u2019s head was back on her pillow and her eyelids were at half-mast, but she was smiling. She obviously thought the conversation was amusing. He didn\u2019t. This parent \u201cstuff\u201d was a bitch.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d He ended the call and said, \u201cI guess you got all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe turned nine two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to build a solar system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. I\u2019ll be driving all over town looking for supplies. I better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she whispered and fell sound asleep.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>The night before Olivia was released from the hospital, her aunt Emma came to visit and insisted that Olivia move into her home to recuperate. Olivia refused. She told her aunt she wanted to sleep in her own bed and not be fussed over. In truth, she didn\u2019t want to put Emma in any danger, and as long as the shooter was still out there, everyone around Olivia was at risk.</p><p>As Emma was leaving, Grayson and Ronan walked in. Emma smiled at the agents and said, \u201cGrayson, in all this confusion I forgot to ask about your father. How is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he answered but didn\u2019t expound.</p><p>Olivia was curious to know what had happened to his father but thought it would be intrusive to ask. She\u2019d have to wait until she and Emma were alone to find out the details. Not that it was any of her business, she reminded herself. She had made up her mind to maintain a professional relationship with Grayson and not to ask any personal questions.</p><p>\u201cPlease give him my best,\u201d Emma said. She turned to Olivia. \u201cI\u2019ll be here early tomorrow to drive you home.\u201d</p><p>Grayson stepped forward. \u201cI . . . we feel it would be best if I took Olivia home . . . for security reasons,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Emma responded. She gave Olivia a kiss on the forehead and left.</p><p>Grayson had a list of questions he wanted to ask Olivia, particularly about her brother-in-law and the debt he had incurred. Did she know about it? Did her sister? From what he had discovered thus far, Olivia\u2019s relationship with her family was strained at best. In the days she had been in the hospital, he hadn\u2019t seen any member of Olivia\u2019s immediate family come to visit.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t get the chance to ask any of his questions. A constant stream of visitors, several phone calls, and her exhaustion overrode his agenda. He decided to wait until tomorrow to talk about her family.</p><p>The following morning, he drove her home from the hospital but didn\u2019t bring up the obviously uncomfortable subject of her relatives. When Grayson announced that an off-duty policeman would be arriving soon to keep watch outside her door, she protested. As long as she stayed inside her apartment, she insisted, she was safe. Grayson listened to her argument and ignored it, stating emphatically that the guard was not negotiable.</p><p>They had just reached her apartment and Olivia was fishing through her purse for her key when a door at the end of the hall opened and an elderly woman wearing a pink chenille bathrobe stepped out. Her thin white hair was held away from her bony face by two bobby pins, and her lips were pursed to give a breathy whistle. When Olivia looked in her direction, the woman crooked her finger and motioned for her to come closer.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Delaney,\u201d Olivia said as she approached the woman.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, dear, I need milk.\u201d As she spoke, Mrs. Delaney was peering around Olivia and looking suspiciously at Grayson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be going to the store for a few days, but I\u2019ll be happy to get you some milk when I shop again.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Delaney looked perturbed. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll call down to John and have him bring me some when he comes to work tomorrow, but he always buys the wrong kind. I specifically ask for two percent, and he inevitably brings me whole milk. That\u2019s just too rich for me. My nervous stomach won\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Olivia answered patiently. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let you know when I\u2019m going to the supermarket, and you can give me a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mrs. Delaney said and turned to go back into her apartment. \u201cGet me some of those lemon cookies, the ones with the icing on top, not the plain ones like you got me last time.\u201d Grayson and Olivia could hear her adding to her list even as she was closing the door.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to go out in the cold,\u201d Olivia explained.</p><p>\u201cSounds like she\u2019s rather particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s all alone, and I don\u2019t mind helping out when I can.\u201d</p><p>Grayson took the key from Olivia\u2019s hand and inserted it into the lock. \u201cYou may act tough, but you have a soft heart, Olivia MacKenzie.\u201d He pushed the door open and stepped back so she could go inside.</p><p>Olivia was happy to be home. Her aunt had sent her staff over to clean the apartment, restock the refrigerator and pantry, and do Olivia\u2019s laundry. There were fresh apples and oranges in a wooden bowl on the kitchen island, chicken noodle soup ready to be warmed up, and fresh baked bread.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t too tired, I\u2019d like to talk to you about your family,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t know what I can tell you that would help.\u201d She was emptying her purse looking for her cell phone. She finally found it and went into her office to plug it into her charger.</p><p>When she returned, Grayson had removed his suit jacket and was tugging at his tie. She noticed what he was doing but didn\u2019t comment. If he wanted to get comfortable, that was fine with her. She would still be able to maintain her distance. He wasn\u2019t a friend; he was her protector.</p><p>That reminder should have helped keep it all in perspective, but he looked great in a suit, and with the jacket off, he looked even better. She had forgotten what a muscular frame he had. Her side was throbbing, her shoulder stung, and her hip felt as though there was still a bullet inside the bone. She was a wreck, and yet she could still lust after him. She could have blamed her thoughts about ripping his clothes off on her pain medication, but she hadn\u2019t taken any today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to discuss your brother-in-law,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cGeorge? There\u2019s not much to say about him. I haven\u2019t been with him all that much. I\u2019ve usually just talked to him on the phone, and it\u2019s always been superficial. You know, \u2018How are you?\u2019 . . . \u2018Fine\u2019 . . . \u2018How are you?\u2019 Then he\u2019d hand the phone to my sister. George isn\u2019t much of a talker. He\u2019s a bit . . . stiff,\u201d she said. \u201cHe makes Natalie happy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten years. I met him several months after they were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to their wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was in San Francisco, and I was here in D.C. It wasn\u2019t possible for me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Olivia never talked about her illness, and he wondered if she knew that he had found out all about her time in the experimental program. According to her aunt, Olivia only discussed those years with her other family, the three girls who went through the program with her. He also knew that her surrogate father was Dr. Andre Pardieu.</p><p>He forced himself to finish his questions so she could rest. \u201cDo you know anything about their financial situation?\u201d</p><p>Olivia sat on the easy chair and put her head back on the cushions. \u201cHe and Natalie started an Internet company several years ago, and they\u2019re doing very well. Natalie invested most of their profits with our father, God help her. I tried to talk to her, make her understand what a scam it all was, but she\u2019s sipped the Kool-Aid and is a believer. Like my mother,\u201d she added. \u201cShe likes to paint a picture of the perfect family. She thinks Natalie is the perfect daughter; George is the perfect son-in-law . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and smiled. \u201cImperfect,\u201d she said very matter-of-factly. \u201cSo she usually doesn\u2019t include me when she talks about her family. Natalie has become an only child. These days my mother considers me a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA traitor to the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd I guess I am. I have to stop him. He can\u2019t go on ruining lives and destroying families. I used to think he couldn\u2019t help himself, that it was all just a game to him, but now I know better. Money is everything to him. He\u2019s obsessive about bringing in more and more. He lures his rich friends to give him their savings and their trusts to invest, and he also targets large pensions and charities.</p><p>\u201cThe more difficult the potential client, the more my father thrives. My aunt Emma won\u2019t let him near her money, and it\u2019s making him frantic. He hates losing, and he\u2019s determined to find a way to force her to give him everything she has. It won\u2019t happen, but he\u2019ll go to prison still trying.\u201d</p><p>Olivia struggled to get up. Surprised by how much that action drained her, she headed to her bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m going to change clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cHelp yourself to something to eat and drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to warm up some soup for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>She walked down the hall but stopped at her bedroom door and looked back at him. \u201cMy mother idolizes my father, and she only has room in her heart for him. She can\u2019t help the way she is. It\u2019s like he has this mind control over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know what he\u2019s doing? Is she part of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was emphatic. \u201cAnd if you showed her absolute proof, she wouldn\u2019t believe it or see it. Honest to God, I think she\u2019d throw anyone under the bus to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI think, once my father is behind bars, my mother might open her eyes. Then again, she might not. She might want to crawl in the cell with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d he called when she walked into her bedroom.</p><p>She stepped back into the hallway. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would your mother think you\u2019re imperfect?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI got sick, Grayson. That made me imperfect.\u201d</p> <p>She really hoped he was through asking questions about her family tonight. He was dredging up all sorts of emotions she didn\u2019t want to feel. She shut her bedroom door and changed into a pair of blue-and-white flannel pajama bottoms and a blue T-shirt. That little bit of effort exhausted her, and she sat down on the side of the bed. She fell back, rolled to her side, and closed her eyes. She would just rest for a few minutes and then have some soup, she told herself. After that, she\u2019d send Grayson home and get a little work done on her computer.</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed and Olivia hadn\u2019t come back to the living room. Grayson opened the bedroom door a crack and looked in. Her hair covered the side of her face, and her arms were crossed over her chest. Grayson pulled the covers back on the king-size bed, then lifted Olivia into his arms. He held her close against his chest for a minute, liking the feel of her warm body against his. He gently placed her between the sheets and covered her. He brushed her hair back and stroked her cheek. Her skin was so soft, so smooth.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing imperfect about you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Ronan thought Olivia\u2019s brother-in-law, George Anderson, looked good for the shooting and wanted to put him at the top of the list.</p> <p>Grayson wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>Ronan opened his desk drawer, pulled out a Nerf football, and tossed it across the office to Grayson. Throwing the football while they brainstormed had become a ritual, providing the cavernous office was empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put Anderson in the top five,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cBut there are others who look better, like Carl Simmons and his crew, and unfortunately, Olivia\u2019s own father. Any one of them could have hired men to silence her. Did you know she was calling the SEC?\u201d</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cGood for her.\u201d</p><p>Grayson tossed the football back to Ronan. \u201cOlivia\u2019s been asking a lot of questions about the Trinity Fund. There could be someone connected with the SEC who doesn\u2019t want an investigation.\u201d</p><p>Ronan nodded agreement. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Anderson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. He owes three hundred thousand to a bookie named Subway, and every week the interest escalates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week,\u201d Grayson repeated. \u201cIf Anderson continues to let the loan ride, in six months he could owe as much as, what . . . six hundred thousand?\u201d</p><p>Ronan tossed the football as he answered, \u201cRight. So I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that Subway isn\u2019t a bookie. He\u2019s a loan shark.\u201d</p><p>Grayson nodded. Then Ronan asked, \u201cDoes Olivia know about her brother-in-law\u2019s gambling problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. I\u2019m going over there in a little while to talk to her about him. She mentioned that George is in town and wants to stop by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d</p><p>They were throwing the football faster and faster until it was rocketing across the office.</p> <p>\u201cI said he\u2019s not getting in unless I\u2019m there. The guard knows,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Anderson\u2019s wife, Natalie? Do you think she\u2019s aware of her husband\u2019s gambling problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cHe could get some money out of the Trinity Fund to pay off the loan\u2014they have close to four million in an account with her father\u2014but he hasn\u2019t taken any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019d find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. She\u2019s put a great deal of her own money in the account. Her uncle, the late Daniel Monroe, was very wealthy. He set up trust funds for his two nieces so that they\u2019d each get a large sum. The minute Natalie got her money, she turned it over to her father to invest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Olivia\u2019s fund?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets hers next year.\u201d</p><p>He then told Ronan what he\u2019d discovered about Simmons, Simmons and Falcon. He\u2019d looked into their banking practices and their accounts and had uncovered that Carl Simmons was a silent partner to Robert MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cCarl Simmons is slandering her, spreading lies about her to get her to stop asking questions. How much do you want to bet her father knows what he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>Grayson nodded. \u201cIf things work out, I\u2019ll get to see him in action in a few weeks at the Morgan Hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big birthday party?\u201d</p><p>Grayson nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t crashed a party in a while. It should be interesting.\u201d He tossed the football back to Ronan and stood. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going over to Olivia\u2019s now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Henry\u2019s sleeping over at a friend\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m keeping tabs,\u201d Ronan said, \u201cbut it appears you\u2019ve been spending an awful lot of time at Miss MacKenzie\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say,\u201d Grayson answered with a grin, \u201cI take my investigations seriously, and I\u2019m very thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Ronan drawled with a good deal of skepticism.</p><p>The fact of the matter was, Grayson had looked for excuses to see Olivia. Even when a question could be answered with a simple phone call, he\u2019d insist that it needed to be done in person. He couldn\u2019t resist being with her. What he was feeling was so new to him, he couldn\u2019t explain it. The only thing he knew for certain was that Olivia MacKenzie was different from any other woman he had ever met, and the more time he spent with her, the more he wanted.</p><p>He was walking toward the stairs when Ronan asked, \u201cAre you still being a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Olivia?\u201d he said, pretending not to understand.</p><p>\u201cNo, with her dog.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a dog, and, yes, I\u2019m still being a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>And it was killing him.</p><p>It had been three weeks since Olivia had been shot, and the only time she had left her apartment was to go to the doctor to have her stitches removed. She was beginning to feel like a caged animal. Her routine was so boring. She got up early every morning, dressed, then went into her office and logged on to her computer with her password. Since there weren\u2019t any distractions, she got caught up with her cases fairly quickly.</p><p>The only exercise equipment she owned was a treadmill, and since she couldn\u2019t go to the gym and use the elliptical trainer like she used to, she got on her treadmill twice a day to break up the boredom. Some days, when her asthma wasn\u2019t bad, she would run; other days she walked so slowly she felt as though she was crawling.</p><p>Collins came over two Sundays in a row and stayed for a couple of hours each time. Then she\u2019d go back to the firing range to work on accuracy. Olivia still trembled thinking about Collins carrying a gun.</p><p>Jane stayed at home because of the weather. Washington was having an unusual winter. It was bitterly cold, and snow kept blasting the city. She lived in a townhouse near Dupont Circle and was busy renovating it to be a studio for her painting. Olivia had missed her art show, but Jane told her all about it. She\u2019d sold three paintings and felt validated and invigorated.</p><p>Sam called only a few times, but then she was in Iceland, so she kept in touch by e-mail. She wrote long, rambling letters about the jets she was flying and didn\u2019t complain at all about where she was stationed.</p><p>All three of Olivia\u2019s friends dated, but none of them had ever been in a serious relationship. Though they were healthy today, they lived with the fear that their luck would change. And how could they put a man they loved through that kind of worry? They had decided to be practical. Happily ever after wasn\u2019t in the cards for them.</p><p>* *</p><p>Olivia had just finished answering a couple of e-mails. She closed her laptop and checked her watch. Remembering that Grayson was coming over, she went to her bedroom to change clothes. She stayed casual in a pair of fitted jeans and a white blouse she didn\u2019t bother to tuck in. She brushed her hair and dabbed on a little perfume and lipstick.</p><p>George would also be arriving soon. He\u2019d said he wanted to have a serious talk with her. Olivia wondered if Natalie would be with him. She was positive she knew what George wanted to talk about: getting Aunt Emma to invest in Trinity Fund to show her loyalty and support to the family. Olivia\u2019s response wasn\u2019t going to change, no matter what George said. Invest in Trinity? Absolutely not.</p><p>How could Natalie and George be so blind?</p><p>Grayson arrived just after she straightened up her living room. She\u2019d gathered up all her newspapers and magazines, put them in a recycle bag, and was folding her afghan when she heard the doorbell. She tossed the afghan on the back of the sofa.</p><p>She always felt a little catch in her throat whenever she saw him. Tonight was no different. He wasn\u2019t wearing a suit. He was as casually dressed as she was, in jeans and a camel-colored sweater. His gun was at his side. That hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>He looked wonderful, she thought, but then he always did. She stepped back and waited while he hung up his coat in her hall closet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she said. \u201cGeorge won\u2019t be here until eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you before he got here.\u201d</p><p>He went to the sofa and sat down. She followed. \u201cTalk about George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know he had a gambling problem?\u201d</p><p>Her expression confirmed she hadn\u2019t known. She looked shocked, then shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem the type. He\u2019s so . . . stuffy.\u201d</p><p>She sat down next to him and listened in growing astonishment as he described the hole George had dug himself into.</p><p>\u201cHe owes that much?\u201d</p><p>Grayson repeated the amount. He thought her reaction to the news was comical. Her cheeks turned pink, and she was sputtering. \u201cHow could anyone . . . he borrowed from . . . how stupid is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA loan shark? He really went to a loan shark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cAnd, yeah, it was stupid. People do stupid things all the time. It\u2019s why I have a job. You work for the IRS . . . don\u2019t you deal with stupid all the time?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, I guess I do.\u201d She thought about George for a second. \u201cNatalie\u2019s going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge is still breathing, so, no, I don\u2019t think she has any idea.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t meant to sit so close to him. She didn\u2019t want to move, though. She loved the way his eyes crinkled at the edges when he smiled. She stared into those eyes and said, \u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the investigation,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shoot,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about kissing me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her again, and she felt as though she was melting. \u201cYeah, I do. All the time,\u201d he said as his hand moved to the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAll the time, Grayson?\u201d she asked, her tone teasing.</p><p>He pulled her toward him, and his lips covered hers in a kiss that was outrageously carnal. His mouth was hot, and his tongue stroked hers until she was desperate for more. She could have stopped him, but that was the last thing on her mind.</p><p>For Grayson, the kiss was consuming and extremely arousing. When he came to his senses and realized what was happening, he took her by the shoulders and gently pushed her away. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this now.\u201d His voice was harsh.</p><p>Olivia was feeling dazed. One kiss and she was shaking. What would happen if he made love to her? She\u2019d probably disintegrate. She threaded her fingers through her hair and took a breath. Grayson had disappeared into her kitchen. She needed to apologize. She knew she was putting him in an awkward position. He was an agent investigating a crime, and she was the victim. Getting personally involved was not a good idea. Their relationship should stay professional . . . shouldn\u2019t it? Her head was telling her yes, but her heart was screaming no.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen, Grayson was standing at her refrigerator. He had the door open and seemed to be looking for something in particular.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>That was a leading question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something to drink.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the door closed. \u201cThere are all sorts of drinks in the beverage drawer. It\u2019s behind you.\u201d</p><p>It looked like a regular drawer to him; the exterior was the same dark cherrywood as the cabinets. He opened it, pulled out a bottle of water, then closed it.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said, making a mental note for his next remodel. \u201cI like it. I should put one of these in my kitchen. My nephew is always in the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s living with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ever since my father\u2019s heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is your father going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied and said nothing more.</p><p>That was it? Just yes? No explanation at all. Okay, she got the message. His personal life was off-limits. She felt like a fool now because she had all but begged him to kiss her. Again.</p><p>Olivia leaned against the sink and folded her arms across her waist. She was irritated with herself. She had broken her vow not to ask personal questions, to let him volunteer whatever he wanted to tell her.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I look at your cabinets?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Since he already had opened the door above the sink and was looking at the wood, she didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cI rehab houses,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis wood is nice. I like the grain. Did you choose it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also like the granite.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly moved and pinned her against the sink. Then he leaned down and kissed her. It was quick and very nice.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cTo get you to quit frowning.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his mouth over hers again. \u201cKnow what else I like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cYour sink.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him. \u201cYou\u2019re such a flatterer.\u201d</p><p>He followed. \u201cHey, I really do like your sink.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou want to kiss me; you don\u2019t want to kiss me. You kiss, then you don\u2019t kiss. Make up your mind, for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. There was a knock on the door, and his mood changed in a heartbeat. \u201cGo sit down. George is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s early,\u201d she said. \u201cGuess he didn\u2019t have any trouble finding the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He waited until she was seated, then unlocked the door and opened it. George was a big man, almost as tall as Grayson. He needed to lose some weight, at least sixty pounds. He carried most of the extra pounds in his chest and stomach. Heart attack waiting to happen, Grayson thought.</p><p>George introduced himself to Grayson but couldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying or leaving?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStaying,\u201d Grayson said firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy? There\u2019s a guard right outside the door. She doesn\u2019t need one inside, too. He patted me down, which I found a bit insulting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome sit down, George,\u201d Olivia called. She wanted to get up and properly greet him at the door, but Grayson had insisted she sit.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason why he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d Grayson repeated.</p><p>\u201cGrayson\u2019s with the FBI,\u201d Olivia explained. \u201cThey\u2019re investigating the shooting.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s brother-in-law stopped arguing. He took his coat off and started to hand it to Grayson. He quickly changed his mind and draped it over a table. It immediately fell to the floor, and George didn\u2019t bother to pick it up.</p><p>He was used to others taking care of his needs, Grayson thought.</p> <p>George looked around the living room before taking a seat in one of the chairs facing the sofa. Olivia didn\u2019t care if he liked her home or not. After Grayson and she were finished talking to him, he wouldn\u2019t be coming back.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He turned to Grayson. \u201cHave you got any leads on who shot Olivia? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one of the people she\u2019s going after for not paying their taxes. A lot of people hate her . . . I mean . . . hate the IRS.\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t say a word. He simply stared at George until he flinched and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Natalie?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cIn Miami with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. In fact, she suggested I come talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Here we go. \u201cTalk to me about what?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou simply have to talk to Emma and convince her to put her money in Trinity,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cNo. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dismiss me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThis is important. People . . . influential people . . . know she hasn\u2019t invested. When she does, they\u2019ll follow suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is killing your mother and your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s killing them?\u201d she asked. She tried to sound worried but couldn\u2019t pull it off.</p><p>\u201cThis hold you have on Emma. She\u2019ll do whatever you tell her to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will not. She\u2019s an intelligent, strong, independent woman.\u201d And you\u2019re a moron, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got this special hold on her, ever since you gained her sympathy when you were sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gained her sympathy? Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply stating what I know to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, George, until today I thought you had at least half a brain. I don\u2019t think that any longer. You\u2019re as blind as Mother and Natalie when it comes to Father\u2019s scam.\u201d</p><p>George huffed and started to get up. He glanced at Grayson, and quickly sat down again. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s blind. Do you realize how much money Natalie and I have made?\u201d</p><p>Grayson took over. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use some of it to pay off your loan?\u201d</p><p>Feigning ignorance, he said, \u201cWhat loan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe loan from your bookie. Subway calls himself a bookie, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen here,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s private . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie doesn\u2019t know about the loan, does she?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>He seemed to deflate in front of her. His shoulders slumped as he hunched over, and his head dropped.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sounded as though he wanted to cry. \u201cShe\u2019ll divorce me if she finds out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take that risk. You can\u2019t ignore a loan shark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bookie,\u201d he snapped. He buried his face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve been such a fool. I started out placing a couple of bets on some college basketball games, and before I knew it, I was in over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does getting Emma to invest in Trinity help you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help your parents and Natalie. It\u2019s very important to them that the firm continues to grow, and Emma is so influential. If her friends knew she\u2019d put her faith in the fund, they\u2019d follow suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you could take some of your money out for your debts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that . . . not without Natalie finding out about the gambling.\u201d</p><p>She was getting sick to her stomach. \u201cTell Natalie, and for God\u2019s sake, get your money out of that fund before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be reasonable, are you?\u201d He paused for a moment, and Olivia could almost see his mind racing. \u201cNow that you know about my debts . . . what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could borrow against your trust. Don\u2019t you get it in two months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a year and two months,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to the trust if Olivia dies before she gets it?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>Without hesitating, George said, \u201cIt all goes to Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, we\u2019re married\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cWait . . . you don\u2019t think I would ever harm Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t think George had the nerve to shoot anyone. He could see him hiring people, though.</p><p>\u201cAnd once she has the money, if anything were to happen to her, it would go to whomever she\u2019s named in her will,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>George pretended he didn\u2019t know anything about a will.</p><p>Grayson continued, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet you know how much is in Olivia\u2019s trust, down to the last dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia was given more than Natalie because of her illness. At least, that\u2019s what Natalie and I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t protest. Once he had his coat on, he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t talk to Emma?\u201d</p><p>How many times did she have to say it? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t walk him to the door. Grayson did. After he locked it, he said, \u201cWhat does your sister see in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met my sister yet, have you? When you do, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She touched his arm. \u201cI don\u2019t think George would have harmed me, but I\u2019m glad you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said. He took her hand. \u201cYou know, if you need anything . . . that is, if you get scared or want to talk, you can call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she answered with a warm smile. \u201cThank you, Grayson. I don\u2019t know that I could have handled all this without you.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her and didn\u2019t say anything. He seemed preoccupied. \u201cI should get going,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>She watched him turn off the kitchen light and walk to the closet to get his coat . . . only, he didn\u2019t get it. He pulled it off the hanger, then hung it back up. He stood there deep in thought for a few seconds, then he circled the living room and turned off all but one lamp. The room was cast in shadows. He stopped at the fireplace, picked up the remote from the mantel, and pushed the \u201con\u201d button. Fire licked the logs, the gas feeding it until the flames were high.</p><p>The living room was warm and cozy now.</p><p>He silently watched the fire for a couple of minutes with his hands in his pockets, and then he began to walk back and forth, staring at the floor as though he were looking for answers to some unsettling question.</p><p>Olivia observed his peculiar behavior. She was getting a crick in her neck as he paced in front of her. She thought he might be trying to work something out about the investigation, or he was thinking about her lovely relatives perhaps, maybe even thanking God they weren\u2019t in his family. He\u2019d met only George. She wondered how he was going to react when he met the others. She should probably take his gun away before she introduced them.</p><p>\u201cGrayson? What are you doing?\u201d she asked, breaking the silence. She\u2019d been sitting too long. She stood and stretched her arms over her head to get the stiffness out of her shoulders and immediately regretted the action. \u201cOuch,\u201d she whispered, grimacing. Her shoulder and side were healing nicely, but stretching wasn\u2019t such a good idea yet.</p><p>Grayson had stopped pacing. She looked up at him, and the intensity in his eyes made her breathless. She went to him. Stopping just a foot away, she faced him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking about. Maybe I can help you.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. \u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not gonna be able to keep my hands off you much longer. Wanna help me with that?\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>He\u2019d rendered her speechless. Fortunately, the condition didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were thinking about George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be thinking about him?\u201d he asked, clearly exasperated.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was just here,\u201d she reminded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d His jaw was clenched, and he was frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are . . . and so I assumed you were thinking about my brother-in-law. But you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked deeply into hers, and she suddenly realized what was going on inside him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d she said. It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>Her surprise irritated him. \u201cHell yes, I want you. And guess what, sweetheart. You want me, too.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to her hips. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. Are you going to be honest with me and admit it?\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. He was definitely trying to intimidate her, she thought, and she was having none of it. She stood her ground.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the question here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to raise your voice, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yelling, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>She was having trouble catching her breath. She guessed grabbing her inhaler wouldn\u2019t be very romantic, but then he was glaring at her now, and how romantic was that?</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cDoes my honesty please you?\u201d She wagged her finger at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, so tuck your ego away. I will not distract you, and ha**ng s*x with you . . . Stop smiling. Having sex . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill distract me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so.\u201d</p><p>Grayson wanted to take her into his arms and kiss every inch of her. God, she was beautiful and so damned passionate.</p><p>\u201cYou will get fired,\u201d she said.</p><p>He had to force himself to pay attention. \u201cI what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet fired.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Grayson. You\u2019ll get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cI mean . . . if they found out . . . Oh, for the love of God, stop looking like you want to laugh. I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about you, too.\u201d</p><p>He went back to the hearth, picked up the remote, and turned the gas off. The fire flickered and sputtered, then went out.</p><p>Olivia felt a stab of disappointment the second he turned away from her. Yet she was determined to help him make the right decision, no matter how it affected her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to think about this, base your decision on logic, not lust.\u201d</p><p>Grayson turned around, and his eyes never left hers as he walked toward her. He stopped just inches away, and though he wanted to take her into his arms, he forced himself to wait. He needed to hear her say the words first.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to touch you, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>His voice was gritty with emotion, and she could see the passion in his eyes. She knew she could end this now. She could lie and he would leave . . . except, she didn\u2019t want him to leave, no matter how complicated it became. And so she simply gave him the truth. No coyness, no lies, no games. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI do want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh yes. Now.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, pulling her into his embrace. She wrapped her arms around his neck and began to place soft kisses along his jaw and the side of his neck. She teased his earlobe with her tongue and knew he liked what she was doing because he tightened his hold and pulled her against him.</p><p>He growled low in his throat as he roughly twisted her hair into his fist and jerked her head back. His open mouth came down on hers and his tongue sank inside to mate with hers. The scorching kiss went on and on until she was shaking with desire and could barely stand up. Her fingers slid into his hair, and she clung to him.</p><p>Panting, she stepped back. \u201cGrayson.\u201d His name was said with a groan.</p><p>He swept her up into his arms and carried her to her bedroom. She put her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes. Her heart was racing; she couldn\u2019t catch her breath, but all she could think about was touching him. She loved his scent, so earthy and clean and male. It made her want to get even closer to him.</p><p>Grayson lifted her chin so she\u2019d look at him. \u201cAre you sure? Your wounds\u2014\u201d</p><p>She silenced him by putting her finger on his lips. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said.</p><p>He slowly put her down, and she stepped back, her gaze locked on his as she began to unbutton her blouse. She was trembling so, she could barely get her fingers to work. He was quicker. In seconds he pulled off his sweater, then his T-shirt, and was bare-chested.</p><p>Her heart beat faster and faster. The dark hair sprinkling his bronzed skin tapered to a V at his waist. His upper arms and chest were all muscle. Grayson was one fit man. One perfect man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was suddenly feeling self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Grayson said. He gently pushed her hands away and finished unbuttoning her blouse. Then he slid it down her arms.</p><p>Her bra was lacy and sexy as hell, her br**sts full. Grayson reached for the clasp and removed the garment. It dropped to the floor. He was desperate to touch her. He slowly glided his fingers down to the small of her back. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft everywhere, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s br**sts rubbed against his chest, and an electric sensation coursed through her body. His skin was warm, his muscles hard beneath. She could feel his strength and power under her fingertips, and his dark curly chest hair tickled her br**sts when she moved. The erotic feeling intensified when she put her arms around his neck and her br**sts rubbed against him again.</p> <p>Resting the side of her face against his chest, she could hear his pounding heart and knew he was as excited as she was. It had happened so quickly. She wanted to kiss him, to touch him everywhere.</p><p>He unbuttoned her jeans and pushed them to the floor so she could step out of them. When he slipped her panties down, she felt a tingle that started at her toes and shot up through her body. Olivia watched as he slipped out of his own clothes. He was so magnificent, so perfectly sculpted, like one of Michelangelo\u2019s statues.</p><p>She pulled the covers back, and Grayson followed her down onto the sheets. He covered her with his body. Bracing his weight with his arms, he lifted up and stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He clasped the sides of her face and finally kissed her. He wasn\u2019t gentle. His mouth took possession of hers, his tongue forcing her to respond. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her.</p> <p>The kiss went on and on until Olivia was burning in every cell of her body. Her fingers glided over his hot skin, caressing his shoulders and his back while her h*ps moved erotically against his hard arousal.</p><p>Grayson ended the kiss and looked at her. He could see the passion and knew she wanted him as much as he wanted her. He kissed her again, then moved slowly down her body. His lips gently nibbled on her neck and the valley between her breasts.</p><p>His thumbs brushed across her nipples, once, then again. Her body responded by arching against him, and she moaned softly, telling him without words how much she liked his touch. He began to caress her breasts, then leaned down and took one nipple into his mouth, sucking hard. She cried out and moved restlessly against him. She couldn\u2019t keep still. Her hands stroked his shoulders, and she shifted under him until she was cuddling his arousal and forcefully moving against him. Her toes rubbed against his legs. His skin was hot, and she could feel his strength, but it didn\u2019t overwhelm her, for he was being so incredibly gentle, so loving.</p><p>His hands were everywhere, stroking, teasing. He was gentle and rough, and he was driving her wild. She wanted to make him as crazed as she was. Her hands slid down between their bodies, and she caressed his arousal. She knew he liked that because he groaned and tightened all around her. He couldn\u2019t take the torment long. His mouth claimed hers again in a hot, wet kiss that ignited the fire inside her.</p><p>She arched up against him. \u201cNow, Grayson,\u201d she demanded. She was close to screaming if he didn\u2019t end the teasing and come to her.</p><p>He moved between her thighs and looked deeply into her eyes. When he thrust inside, he was immediately surrounded by liquid heat. She was so tight, so perfect for him. She drew her legs up to take more of him, and he groaned again. He began to move, slowly at first, and then with growing need. Losing all control, his mind was consumed with finding release for both of them. It was a blissful, pulsating torture as he reached higher and higher peaks of ecstasy. She dug her nails into his shoulders and arched up against him each time he withdrew, quickening the pace. Suddenly, she tightened and squeezed him, crying out his name with her cl**ax. He couldn\u2019t stop his own release. He held her in his arms while he lost himself in her.</p> <p>Her orgasm overwhelmed her, consumed her. The world seemed to splinter into a million brilliant stars, and she felt as though she had skyrocketed to the heavens and was slowly floating back to Earth. She was stunned by the intensity. She had never lost control like this, and it was terrifying. Yet Grayson had held her, whispered to her, telling her she could let go, she could trust him. And, oh God, how she did.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>One word, that was all, but it was enough to tell her how pleased and satisfied he was. She recovered before he did. His breathing was still harsh, and she could feel his heart racing. Then she realized she was having just as much trouble. She was still tingling everywhere and continuing to stroke his back and his shoulders.</p><p>Grayson lifted his head and smiled at her. She looked properly ravaged, and that gave him an arrogant satisfaction. Her lips were red, and he could see the passion still there in her beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love your mouth,\u201d he whispered before he kissed her again.</p><p>Realizing he was probably crushing her, he gathered enough strength to roll away from her. He lay on his back and took a deep breath. He was amazed it was taking him so long to clear his mind. Making love to Olivia was nothing like he\u2019d ever experienced before. It was different. She was different.</p><p>\u201cYou said, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He could hear the laughter in her comment. He rolled to his side, propped his head with his arm and said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, but she was smiling. \u201cOh, but you did, Agent Kincaid. You said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 Is that your sweet talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want sweet talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. \u2018Wow\u2019 pretty much said it all.\u201d</p><p>He trailed his fingers from her neck to her stomach. \u201cYou screamed my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you did, Miss MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>His mood darkened in the space of a heartbeat. He stared at the scar from the bullet wound on her shoulder and was suddenly enraged. He wanted to kill the man who had hurt her and hoped he got the chance. She was lucky, the surgeon had told him. Both the injury to her shoulder and her side were considered minor. The bullets had gone straight through and hadn\u2019t hit anything vital. The hip was more serious because the bullet had lodged in bone.</p><p>\u201cDoes this still hurt?\u201d he asked as he gently traced a circle around her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d He circled the small, raw wound on the side of her waist.</p><p>Olivia shivered. He was giving her goose bumps. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He touched her hip. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your throat?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt from screaming?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI did not scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to prove it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Suspicious, she asked, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cI gotta make you scream again.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was curled up against his side sound asleep. Grayson wasn\u2019t going to spend the night, but he was too comfortable and content to move. He decided he would call Ronan tomorrow and remove himself from the case. He\u2019d still follow what was being done, might even make a couple of suggestions here and there, but that was all. He couldn\u2019t sleep with Olivia again and run the investigation at the same time. Actually, he supposed he could; he just wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d stay with Olivia until early morning after all. He\u2019d get up at five and leave. Yeah, that\u2019s what he would do. He pulled the covers up and yawned loudly. Olivia scooted closer and put her head on his shoulder.</p><p>He had made her scream twice, and he was damned proud of that accomplishment. He was thinking about how aggressive she had become after her second orgasm. She\u2019d pushed him onto his back and proceeded to drive him crazy with her hands and her mouth and her tongue. Her enthusiasm staggered him. He realized he was getting hard again, and was seriously thinking about waking her up, when his cell phone rang. He gently lifted her off him, grabbed his phone from the bedside table where he\u2019d put his gun and holster, and answered.</p><p>Henry was calling. \u201cUncle Grayson. I think I\u2019m sick. Can you come get me?\u201d</p><p>Grayson sat up. He heard the worry in Henry\u2019s voice but didn\u2019t ask for an explanation because he knew what was wrong. Henry was homesick. As much as the boy wanted to sleep over with friends, he couldn\u2019t seem to get through an entire night. Grayson had thought about Henry around ten o\u2019clock, and when he didn\u2019t call, he had thought Henry had finally gotten over his problem.</p><p>He was getting better, though. He\u2019d made it until eleven thirty this time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d dressed, he kissed Olivia on the forehead and nudged her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go. You\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared under the covers. He stood there for a minute and then began to laugh. Had he been wanting some praise or a testimonial about their time together, he would have been disappointed. Apparently she wasn\u2019t much for sweet talk either.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Grayson asked Ronan to take over the MacKenzie investigation and to assign another agent to assist. Ronan refused.</p><p>The football was flying across the office as the two men argued. It was late, after nine in the evening, and both Ronan and Grayson were sitting at their desks catching up on paperwork. They had already discussed pending investigations, none of which were pressing, and then they began to talk about the progress on Olivia\u2019s case. That was when the argument started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Grayson insisted. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove myself from the investigation. I\u2019ll talk to Pensky tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Ronan hurled the football to Grayson. \u201cNo, don\u2019t talk to her. I\u2019ll take the lead, but you\u2019re staying on. You can assist. Or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistance yourself from Olivia until we get the shooter.\u201d</p><p>That was easier said than done. Grayson couldn\u2019t get her out of his mind. All he wanted to think about was taking her to bed again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can distance myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Kincaid. What happened to your discipline?\u201d</p><p>Ronan feigned disgust, which made Grayson laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with her?\u201d Ronan asked, serious now.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you care about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care.\u201d He was getting irritated. He put a spin on the football and sent it spiraling back to Ronan.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you can walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not walking away\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ronan interrupted. \u201cDo you think someone else\u2014besides me, of course\u2014could do a better job protecting her and finding the shooter? You\u2019d put her safety in someone else\u2019s hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you to do the job,\u201d he snapped, \u201cbut no one else.\u201d</p><p>Ronan was hitting a nerve. Grayson didn\u2019t want to leave the case, but he didn\u2019t know how he was going to keep his objectivity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working this without you,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to Pensky. All right?\u201d</p><p>Grayson snatched the football from the air and held on to it as he thought about his options. Finally, he gave in. \u201cYeah, okay, for now anyway. I\u2019ll find a way to keep my distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Ronan swiveled in his chair and picked up a notepad from his desk. \u201cI\u2019ve got another name to put on the list of suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson\u2019s bodyguard. Remember him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tank? That\u2019s what I felt like I was hitting when I tackled him. His name is Ray Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorguson fired him, blamed the whole incident on him.\u201d</p><p>Grayson laughed. \u201cI thought he blamed Olivia. Didn\u2019t he say it was all her fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while he did. Then it became a misunderstanding. Jorguson just found out Olivia\u2019s going to testify against him, and now there\u2019s a court date set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis attorneys will delay, probably keep it out of court for at least a year, maybe two.\u201d</p><p>Ronan didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cJorguson pointed the finger at Martin. He said after he was fired, Martin ranted to some people that it was all Olivia\u2019s fault, actually said he was going to get even with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did he say that to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jorguson, Martin made the threat in front of him and his assistant, Xavier Cannon. He claims he said it to a couple of clients. We\u2019ve checked them out, and these clients have less-than-stellar reputations themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re setting up Martin so the heat\u2019s off Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Ronan agreed. \u201cGuess what Martin drives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He spun the football with one hand then sent it in a high arc across the room.</p><p>\u201cBrand-new black SUV. Ford Explorer, to be exact.\u201d Ronan caught the ball and lobbed it back. \u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d he told him. \u201cI sent two agents over to his place. Martin lives a couple of blocks from that drug house we broke into to get the kid for Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGangland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe agents showed up to bring him in for questioning, and right there in plain sight on the table was a whole display of weapons. Gave the agents cause to search the rest of the house. They found an arsenal. Turns out Martin has a thriving business on the side selling guns to the neighbors. He said he just wanted to help them protect their homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow see, that makes him a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about George Anderson?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cI did what you suggested and had one of our agents in Las Vegas check out the loan shark, figuring he\u2019s like all the others\u2014you know, a real businessman who breaks legs and arms to get his clients to pay up but doesn\u2019t see the feasibility in killing them because then he\u2019d never get paid. Anderson\u2019s loan shark, Subway, is different. Every now and then one of his clients turns up dead. Looks like he\u2019s sending a message to other slackers. Word is, he gave Anderson a deadline. He\u2019s got three months to pay it all back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Anderson would know how to find a shooter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think Subway would have names, and if Anderson mentioned how much money his wife would get if Olivia were dead, then, yeah, I think he\u2019d help him find a driver and a shooter. He might have hired them for Anderson.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnderson\u2019s a weasel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he capable of hiring a hit?\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t have to think about it. \u201cTo save himself, yes. But then, so is Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s also the possibility it was random. It could be a gang initiation. She was about the only person out during that freakish snowstorm. A blizzard that early in the season is unusual, and weathermen had only predicted flurries, so how does a kid anxious to get in a gang pass the test when there\u2019s no one around to kill? Maybe Olivia was just a handy target.\u201d</p> <p>Grayson realized he was holding the football and tossed it back to Ronan. \u201cShe\u2019s made a lot of people who haven\u2019t paid their taxes very angry.\u201d</p><p>Ronan offered yet another option. \u201cWhat about the kids she\u2019s helped? One of their relatives or guardians could be out for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Judge Thorpe and Judge Bowen, and they gave me the names of the boys and girls she\u2019s been assigned. I tell you, Ronan, some of the places she\u2019s gone into, some of the god-awful situations those kids were in . . . I would have unloaded my gun on all of them once I got the kids out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have. You would have wanted to, but you would have taken them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I don\u2019t know how she does it,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cShe admitted she likes working for the IRS, partly because it\u2019s more mundane and balances out the horrors she sees in the other job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere there any suspects? Relatives of these kids who want her dead?\u201d</p><p>Grayson caught the ball, tucked it under his arm, and shuffled through a stack of papers on his desk until he found the one he wanted. He skimmed over it and said, \u201cTwo cousins of one little boy. Guess she really nailed them in court. They each got twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got motive . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of them have the connections outside of prison or the funds to hire a hit. I\u2019ve got a few others I\u2019m still checking out, but nothing looks promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to be Carl Simmons, her dad\u2019s attorney. After I interviewed that son of a bitch, I really wanted it to be him. Listening to all the trash he was talking about Olivia, trying to get her fired, calling her crazy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been getting threatening phone calls,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s Simmons. He disguises his voice, but she\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s him. He only calls her cell phone number . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you able to trace the number back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery call came from a different public phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia told me there have been four in all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s angry.\u201d</p><p>Ronan nodded. \u201cYou know who Simmons reminds me of? A game show host. He\u2019s got this phony yellowish-brown tan and these capped teeth that are a little too big for his mouth, and the color is beyond white. Creepy smile, too. He\u2019s tall and skinny, and when he opens his mouth, it\u2019s freaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real lady-killer, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Ronan laughed. \u201cFunny thing is, he could be. I\u2019d like it if he was the shooter,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019d like it a lot. Put his tanned ass in prison.\u201d</p><p>Grayson tossed the football into an open file drawer and turned his computer off. \u201cOlivia\u2019s due to go back to work,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much longer will there be a protection detail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting pushed now to end it,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cAnother week, maybe, but the budget . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cI\u2019ll take over and pay for it. I don\u2019t want her to know that, though. I\u2019ll hire some off-duty policemen I know and trust.\u201d As he grabbed his coat and put it on, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll help out, too.\u201d</p><p>Ronan was searching for one of his gloves. He knelt on one knee and located it under the desk across from him where he\u2019d tossed his coat. \u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUntil we make an arrest.\u201d</p><p>Ronan followed Grayson outside. \u201cThat could take awhile. I look at the list and I ask myself, who doesn\u2019t want to kill her?\u201d</p><p>It had been two weeks since Olivia had seen Grayson. The last time they were together they had spent several passionate hours making love. Then nothing . . . not even a phone call to say, \u201cHello, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She knew she probably should have been furious with him, but she wasn\u2019t. After the first time he\u2019d kissed her, she hadn\u2019t seen him or heard from him for two long months. It took a shooting to get him to remember her. Maybe this was going to be a long hiatus as well. Grayson was a busy man, she reminded herself, with a nine-year-old he was now raising\u2014though she didn\u2019t know if that was a temporary or a permanent situation\u2014and his father, Edward Kincaid, was recovering from a massive heart attack.</p><p>Emma had given her the details about his father\u2019s condition. She said that the cardiac surgeon had called the heart attack the widow maker, and if Grayson\u2019s father hadn\u2019t gone to the emergency room when he\u2019d first experienced symptoms, and if the cardiac surgeon hadn\u2019t been right there to take over, Edward Kincaid wouldn\u2019t have made it.</p><p>Olivia understood why Grayson couldn\u2019t take time for her. No, she wasn\u2019t angry with him, but she was damned irritated. How long would a phone call take? Or even an e-mail or a text? No time at all. Exactly.</p><p>It was Friday afternoon, and she was about to do a favor for a coworker so that he and his family could leave early to catch a flight to Miami for a long weekend. She had volunteered to drop off some papers, and she was looking forward to her errand. The company she was going to visit unannounced was called Nutrawonder Works, a vitamin distribution company. It was owned and operated by William Hood, who, according to the notes she\u2019d been given, had raised suspicion that he\u2019d been ripping off the government for several years. The IRS wanted to go through his records to prove it and also to find evidence that he had been ripping off his employees as well by falsely reporting contributions to their pension fund. The word bully was underlined in red on the report.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t plan to walk into Nutrawonder alone. She was going to take an armed IRS agent with her, but as it turned out, that wasn\u2019t necessary. Just as she picked up the phone, Grayson walked in.</p><p>She put the phone down and watched him walk toward her. Don\u2019t stare, she told herself, yet she continued to do just that. Her mind scrambled for ways to get over her nervousness, and the advice she\u2019d once been given before ascending a podium to speak in front of a crowd popped into her head: Think of him naked. She tried that trick, but a picture of his magnificent body appeared and had her suddenly feeling breathless and hot. Okay, that was a bad plan. Don\u2019t think of him naked, she told herself.</p><p>She could feel her cheeks getting warmer. She opened her desk drawer, took out her inhaler, and used it. God, how telling was that?</p><p>Grayson stopped in front of her desk. \u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d he asked casually. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>She was still too rattled to come up with a witty and stinging reply. She nodded, then shook her head. \u201cThe policeman drove me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent him home. Another guard will be at your front door at ten tonight. Until then, you\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>No apology, no excuses, and not a hint of embarrassment or guilt. All right. If that was the way he wanted to play it, she\u2019d go along. She could be just as aloof.</p><p>\u201cI have to make a stop before I go home. I need to drop off some papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a pleasant meeting. You might need your weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>He was Mr. Cool, leaning against the desk looking relaxed and . . . mellow. Yes, that was the word to describe him: mellow. Her nerves were raw. She had worried and wondered about him for the last two weeks, but here he stood, calm and collected. Obviously, he hadn\u2019t been thinking about her. She wanted to kick him and kiss him at the same time.</p><p>She put the papers she was going to take to Nutrawonder in a legal envelope and sealed it. Then she got her purse out of the bottom drawer and started throwing personal items inside. Her cell phone went in first, then her indulgences: M&amp;M\u2019s, a protein bar she\u2019d been carrying around for a couple of months but refused to eat because the last one tasted like sawdust, and a cold bottled water she\u2019d just gotten out of the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your inhaler,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in your middle drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have one in my purse. I always keep an extra one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to check. I saw two in your drawer when you opened it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss anything, did he? She might have two in her desk, but she always carried one with her . . . except today. She ended up emptying everything in her purse onto her desk and realized then that she had put the one she always carried with her in the drawer.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . I didn\u2019t realize . . . I don\u2019t do that. Thanks for noticing.\u201d</p><p>What else had he noticed? How nervous she was? That was a given, she decided. She put the inhaler where it belonged and was ready to leave. Even while she was telling herself she didn\u2019t care, she was wishing she\u2019d taken the time this morning to put on something a little fancier. Her pale pink silk blouse, black pencil skirt, and black flats were so ordinary. She could at least have worn high heels or boots. What had she been thinking? That it was freezing outside, that\u2019s what. Wearing high heels in this snow was asking for a broken ankle. And when she wore boots, her feet always got hot while she worked at her desk. Still, she should have put a little effort into her appearance. She hadn\u2019t even bothered to put her hair up or curl it. The thick mass was down around her shoulders. She nervously pushed a strand away from her face as she walked toward him.</p><p>He lifted her coat from the rack and held it out for her. \u201cWhat happens when you forget it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy inhaler?\u201d</p><p>She put her coat on and turned toward him. Grayson took her scarf and wrapped it around her neck, gently lifting her hair out of the way. They stood inches apart.</p><p>\u201cYes, your inhaler,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens when you forget it?\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cI get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. One of Mr. Thurman\u2019s assistants, a sweet, older woman named Violet, stood in the hallway. \u201cMr. Thurman wanted me to tell you that the team is on their way to Nutrawonder and will wait in their cars until you give them the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Violet.\u201d</p><p>The assistant took a step closer to Olivia. She glanced at Grayson, smiled, and then said, \u201cI hear Billy Hood is a nasty piece of goods, if you know what I mean. Would you like to borrow my pepper spray?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019ve got something better.\u201d She tilted her head toward Grayson as she walked past Violet. \u201cI\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Billy Hood was indeed a nasty piece of goods, though, after meeting him, Grayson had a few more succinct words to describe the bastard.</p><p>Nutrawonder\u2019s offices were located outside the city and just a mile off the interstate in a run-down industrial area. The building was old and in need of paint. The linoleum floors were cracked and split, and the desks of the employees were crammed together. It was around sixty degrees inside, and Grayson noticed that some of the men and women were wearing their coats as they worked at their computers.</p><p>Hood\u2019s office was upstairs. Unlike the sterile first floor, the second floor had been remodeled. There was a garish neon-blue carpet, new furniture, and dark paneled wood in the reception area. The temperature was much more pleasant.</p><p>The woman sitting behind the desk was wearing enough makeup to spackle an entire wall. She had a fashion magazine open in front of her and was casually turning the pages with unnaturally long, curved, polished nails, completely ignoring Olivia and Grayson.</p><p>\u201cWe close in five minutes,\u201d she said, without looking up. \u201cBesides, Mr. Hood isn\u2019t available. He\u2019s on the phone in his office, but he isn\u2019t available to anyone. You\u2019ll have to make an appointment. Mr. Hood doesn\u2019t see anyone without an appointment.\u201d She finally raised her head. \u201cDo you want to leave your name or your card . . . or something?\u201d she asked. She was staring at Grayson while she twirled a strand of hair in her fingers. \u201cOr your phone number?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes. She glanced at Grayson to see how he was reacting to Miss Spackle. He didn\u2019t seem affected. He was probably used to getting hit on, she supposed, and for some reason that irked her. She walked past the receptionist, opened the door to Hood\u2019s office, and went in. The receptionist didn\u2019t notice until Grayson followed Olivia.</p><p>\u201cHey, Billy isn\u2019t available,\u201d she called out. \u201cI mean Mr. Hood isn\u2019t available.\u201d</p><p>Grayson stopped in the doorway. \u201cYou can go home now,\u201d he told her as he was pulling the door closed.</p><p>Hood was talking on his cell phone. Grayson spotted a suitcase behind the door.</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you bring your passport, Lorraine. I\u2019ll meet you at the airport.\u201d He looked up from his conversation and saw Olivia and Grayson standing there. \u201cHold on a second.\u201d He pointed to the door. \u201cI\u2019m talking on the phone,\u201d he snapped. \u201cGet out of my office.\u201d He looked at Olivia, lingering on her legs, and said, \u201cI guess you could stay, darling.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not your darling. Now get off the phone.\u201d</p><p>Hood was an unpleasant-looking man. There were deep wrinkles in his forehead and above his cheekbones. Olivia attributed them to scowling most of his life. His beady eyes were a little too close together and his jowls hung low like a bulldog\u2019s. She knew he was married, and she wondered if his children looked like him\u2014God forbid\u2014or like their mother. She pushed the silly thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand.</p><p>Hood ended the call and slipped the cell phone into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Olivia gave him a friendly smile. \u201cWhere are you going, Mr. Hood, if you don\u2019t mind my curiosity? I noticed the suitcase, and I did happen to overhear you telling Lorraine not to forget her passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia,\u201d he answered. \u201cNapa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorraine doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license to show at the airport?\u201d she asked in her most pleasant, noncombative voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course, she has a driver\u2019s license.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tilted her head and looked puzzled. \u201cYou are aware that California is still part of the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to tell you where I\u2019m going. Did you ever think of that? For all I know you could be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>Olivia stood on one side of the desk, and Grayson was on the other, looming over him. Hood swiveled his neck and blurted, \u201cSpies.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia looked at Grayson with mock surprise. \u201cMr. Hood appears to be a little paranoid. Perhaps it\u2019s because Lorraine isn\u2019t his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal life is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014\u201d she said as she pulled the legal papers out of her envelope.</p><p>She was about to tell him that his finances were definitely her business when he interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re working for my wife, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re spying for her. How dare she not trust me.\u201d He pointed to the door again, and just as Olivia was about to explain who she was and why she was there, he started cursing her. \u201cGet out of my office, you blood-sucking bitch.\u201d He added several more gross names before he took a breath.</p> <p>Olivia pretended to be both shocked and thrilled. Her hand flew to her throat, and she gasped. She sounded excited when she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know we got to use dirty words, Mr. Hood. Let me have a turn.\u201d She dropped the papers on his desk in front of him, placed her card with the bold IRS letters visible, leaned in, and said, \u201cPrison.\u201d</p><p>Grayson listened to the conversation with great amusement. Olivia\u2019s handling of Hood was truly impressive. He had seen many sides of her since they\u2019d met. He knew she was loving and gentle. He had seen that side when they\u2019d rescued Tyler from the drug dealers. He had witnessed her steely determination when she stood up to George. He definitely had seen her passionate side with her uninhibited lovemaking. And today, he was getting a glimpse at her wicked sense of humor, a side he thoroughly appreciated.</p><p>Hood, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cGo ahead. Do another audit. You won\u2019t find anything. I\u2019m still leaving on vacation. I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia?\u201d she asked, helping him remember the lie he\u2019d just told.</p><p>\u201cYes, bitch, California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to put that trip off for a while.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to grab her arm. Grayson put a death grip on his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t touch her unless you want to get hurt. You don\u2019t want to get hurt, do you, Billy?\u201d</p><p>Hood glared at Grayson before turning to Olivia again. \u201cLorraine\u2019s going to be pissed,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow long do I have to postpone my trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen to twenty with good behavior would be my guess.\u201d</p><p>Olivia texted the leader of the audit team, but there wasn\u2019t any need. They were already in the building.</p><p>Since Grayson was watching Olivia, Hood made the mistake of assuming that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to him. He slowly reached into his desk drawer.</p><p>Grayson slammed the drawer shut, and Hood howled in pain. His fingers were trapped, and Grayson wasn\u2019t letting him pull them out.</p><p>\u201cNow, see, Billy,\u201d Grayson said, his tone mild. \u201cThat has to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke my fingers,\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou broke my fingers.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia was surprised by Grayson\u2019s actions but didn\u2019t comment. A moment later she understood the reason behind the brute force.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what you keep in your drawer,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s private property. You have no right . . .\u201d He stopped protesting when Grayson produced a handgun. \u201cI have no idea how that got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Grayson pointed the barrel at Hood. \u201cThen if I pull the trigger . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s loaded. It\u2019s for protection in case someone tries to rob me. I wasn\u2019t going to shoot anyone. I\u2019m telling you I didn\u2019t even remember the gun was in my drawer.\u201d</p><p>Olivia and Grayson were through talking to him, but it took another twenty minutes before they were able to leave Nutrawonder. After refusing to cooperate, Hood was led out in handcuffs, shouting that he\u2019d been set up and a lawyer would prove his innocence.</p><p>Once Grayson and Olivia were back in the car, he asked, \u201cDid you know the gun was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you noticed him reaching for the drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I noticed you noticing him reaching for the drawer.\u201d</p><p>Olivia saw the muscle in his cheek flex as he clenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gone into the office alone,\u201d she said. \u201cThere would have been at least one armed agent with me. When I\u2019m alone, I\u2019m more observant, and, yes, I know I should always be observant, so stop the scowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You should always be more observant. You take risks, Olivia. Dangerous risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ. I don\u2019t normally go into situations like the one today. I was doing a favor for a colleague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he warn you about Hood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Olivia, you need to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat tone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re snapping at me.\u201d</p><p>She looked disgruntled. For some reason her expression eased some of his anger away.</p><p>\u201cI care about you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t acknowledge his statement for a long while, and Grayson didn\u2019t pressure her. He had just parked the car when she whispered, \u201cI care about you, too. If I didn\u2019t care, I never would have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say I never would have touched you.\u201d</p><p>She rushed to move the subject away from sex because, from the moment she\u2019d seen him, she\u2019d wanted to rip his clothes off and have wild, arrest-able sex.</p><p>\u201cYour job is more dangerous than mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bulletproof vest in the trunk of my car, and I don\u2019t carry a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you worry about me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer because they had just arrived at her apartment building. Grayson followed her upstairs. When he got a whiff of her perfume, he instantly reacted. Her scent had the power to drive him crazy. It was so damned sexy.</p><p>He hung up her coat and then his. His suit jacket followed. Olivia went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator to search for something she could munch on. She wasn\u2019t really hungry yet; she was feeling the tension of having Grayson in her apartment again. She decided on a Jell-O cup. It had zero calories, and it would keep her hands and her mouth busy. She pulled out a spoon and turned around to finally answer him. She knew he wasn\u2019t going to let it go.</p><p>He stood in the doorway, waiting. She pointed the spoon at him and said, \u201cYes, I worry about you, but I don\u2019t want to. Besides, what\u2019s the point? Worrying is wasted energy. What will happen will happen no matter if I worry or not, and when it does, it\u2019s usually bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this time I thought you were an optimist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t live in the clouds.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the kitchen and backed her into the corner. \u201cHere now, gone tomorrow. Is that your attitude?\u201d</p><p>She waved the spoon in front of his face and tried to push him away. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d she said defiantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always optimistic with kids, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your friends, Jane and Samantha and Collins? Are they as pessimistic as you are about their futures?\u201d</p><p>She was taken aback. \u201cI know you\u2019ve met Jane, but how do you know about Samantha and Collins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma told me about them.\u201d He took the Jell-O and spoon from her and put them on the counter. Then he put her hands around his neck.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have . . . What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing you,\u201d he answered. He tugged on her earlobe with his teeth and knew she liked that. He felt her tremble.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She tried to sound irritated instead of breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d tilted her head to the side to give him better access to her neck, she couldn\u2019t tell him he was wrong. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my distance.\u201d His fingers slid through her silky hair, and he gently turned her to look up at him. His mouth came down on top of hers. She never wanted the wet and hot sensation to end. As he made love to her with his tongue, she clung to him, and when he tried to end the kiss, she pulled him back to kiss her again.</p><p>He was shaking with desire when he finally backed away. \u201cOlivia, it happens so fast with you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAll I have to do is get near you, and I want it all. I thought it was your perfume that was such a turn-on, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She understood. When she got close to him, all she could think about was making love to him. She tucked her head under his chin so she wouldn\u2019t be distracted and asked, \u201cWhat did you mean about keeping your distance?\u201d</p><p>His chin dropped down and he rubbed it lightly across the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m keeping my distance from you until we make an arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your idea of keeping your distance?\u201d</p><p>He hugged her. \u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and walked out of the kitchen. She followed. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, then closed it. Grayson took her hand and started toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWe have to have sex,\u201d he said very matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why. You\u2019re here now, but you could be gone tomorrow. We need to take advantage of the time we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d she snapped, pulling on his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it kinda is.\u201d</p><p>She was furious with him. \u201cI could die tomorrow,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cYes, you could.\u201d He\u2019d removed his tie and was now working on his shirt. His smile was tender. \u201cBut you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being cruel, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Take your clothes off, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe his gall. Did he think that all he had to do was snap his fingers and she\u2019d strip for him? she wondered, even as she removed her blouse and reached for the zipper on her skirt.</p><p>\u201cThis is just lust.\u201d She made the statement as her skirt dropped to the floor. She pulled the silky camisole over her head and tossed it behind her. Her bra and panties followed. \u201cSex is a way to release pent-up tension . . . you know, anxiety. But it\u2019s primarily lust. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d</p><p>Saying it out loud didn\u2019t make it true. Olivia was already emotionally invested. She wanted Grayson to touch her, yes, but there was another reason besides the physical. Her feelings for him were growing.</p><p>Grayson was watching her expressions. In the past minute she\u2019d looked happy, then angry, and now . . . disgruntled. He was pretty sure he knew what was going on in that stubborn mind of hers. He was pushing her and she was pushing back.</p><p>He had already undressed. He dropped down on the bed, and before she realized what he was going to do, he\u2019d pulled her down until she was straddling him.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t just lust. It\u2019s much more.\u201d</p><p>She acted as though she hadn\u2019t heard what he\u2019d said and tried to kiss him. He wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cAdmit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>If this was a game of who was more stubborn, she would win hands-down. She brushed her lips over his and whispered, \u201cNo,\u201d once again.</p><p>His mouth covered hers, and he kissed her hard, thoroughly. He fell back on the bed, forcing her to stretch out on top of him, then rolled over until he\u2019d pinned her beneath him.</p><p>Her fingers spread upward through his hair as she kissed his chin, then lower, until her lips were pressed against the pulse at the base of his throat. She could feel his heartbeat under her lips. She rubbed her pelvis against his in an attempt to drive him out of his mind. She wanted him to beg her to stop the erotic torment and come to him. Oh yes, she would make him beg.</p><p>The plan backfired. Five minutes later she was begging him. When it came to sex, how could she have thought she was superior to him? My God, he was a master. He knew what she liked, where to touch and stroke and how to make her respond. He made her burn with passion. She was writhing in his arms as she pleaded with him to come to her.</p><p>Grayson was determined to make her admit the truth to him before he let her cl**ax. The effort nearly killed him. He used his last shred of discipline as his hands and his mouth moved over her sweet body. His forehead was beaded with perspiration, and he was aching with his need, yet he continued to hold back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot more than lust between us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His hand slid between her thighs. She relented. \u201cYes,\u201d she cried out. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d he whispered gruffly. He lifted up and looked at her. Her eyes were misty, and it was his undoing.</p><p>\u201cGrayson,\u201d she groaned. \u201cGloat later.\u201d</p><p>He moved between her thighs and thrust inside her. She arched up against him, taking him deeper. He wanted to make it last, this glorious rapture, but he couldn\u2019t control his body any longer. Or his desire. Olivia was as wild to find fulfillment as he was, and both cl**axed together.</p><p>Long minutes passed while they tried to regain their senses. Olivia couldn\u2019t understand how something that was so wonderful could keep getting better.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked as he tried to find the energy to roll away from her.</p><p>She nodded against his shoulder. He moved onto his back and pulled her with him. She felt like a rag doll, a very content rag doll. She probably looked like one, too, with her hair hanging over her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy hearing me plead?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>She rolled on top of him, stacked her hands on his chest, and stared at him. He looked arrogantly pleased with himself. And why wouldn\u2019t he? She\u2019d caved and given him a little hint of the truth. She hadn\u2019t told him she loved him, but she\u2019d come close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get even with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll make you beg.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her back, his touch gentle now, sending shivers down her arms and legs. \u201cI love your scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you loved my mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>She tried to roll off him, but he wouldn\u2019t let her, so she laid her head on his chest and rested her hands on his arms. His biceps were firm and taut, and she marveled at him. He was so powerful, so protective. She had never been this uninhibited with anyone. Yet, when she was with him, all she wanted to do was melt into him and let his courage and strength enfold her. He made her feel safe.</p><p>With a contentment she\u2019d never experienced before, she lay quietly, feeling his rhythmic breathing against her cheek.</p><p>After a few minutes passed, she said, \u201cWhy does Henry live with you?\u201d</p><p>The unexpected question jarred him. \u201cHis mother died several years ago, and Henry moved in with his grandfather. Then, when he became ill, Henry came to live with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to Henry\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father is my brother, Devin. After his wife died, he went a little crazy. She . . . stabilized him, helped him focus. Now he travels a great deal. I guess you could say he\u2019s become somewhat of a jet-setter these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he love Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. He just doesn\u2019t like being a father. Since he\u2019s out of the country so often, I\u2019ve gained full custody.\u201d</p><p>She rolled to her side and her fingertips moved over his skin in feather-light strokes. She circled his navel and moved lower.</p><p>\u201cHenry has to come first,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. He grabbed her hand to stop her from tormenting him, then pulled her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>He tilted her face up toward him, kissed her brow, then her cheek. \u201cYou,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want you.\u201d</p><p>No other words were necessary.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>What started out to be a lovely, thoroughly satisfying evening ended up in a fight.</p> <p>They reluctantly left her bed, and because Grayson didn\u2019t want the intimacy to end, he followed her into the shower. Olivia was shocked by how quickly she could want him again, and though she was a little clumsy and in jeopardy of drowning, she did get him to beg her to come to him. By the time he gave in, she could barely stand. Grayson lifted her up, wrapped her legs around him, and made love to her again.</p><p>The man had far more stamina than she did. He had already dressed and was in the kitchen looking for something to eat before she had dried her hair. She put on jeans and one of her favorite T-shirts. It was old, a little frayed around the bottom, and a little too tight across her breasts, but she loved the feel of the soft fabric against her skin. Besides, after what she\u2019d done in bed and on her knees in the shower, being self-conscious about a tight T-shirt was ridiculous.</p><p>Grayson was guzzling a bottle of water, leaning against the kitchen island when she joined him. His gaze was locked on her as he slowly put the bottle down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You know that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot a lick of makeup on and I\u2019m beautiful. You\u2019ve overdosed on sex.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I can never get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>The way he was looking at her, the intensity in his expression as he watched her, indicated he meant what he said. He looked as though he was thinking about dragging her back to bed. She was suddenly embarrassed and didn\u2019t have any idea why.</p><p>He noticed she was blushing and thought that was hilarious.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, considering what you just did with that sweet mouth of yours . . .\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss what we did.\u201d</p><p>She nudged him out of her way so she could open the refrigerator. \u201cWould you like chicken parmesan with pasta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>She handed him the casserole dish. He lifted the lid and said, \u201cDid you make this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, no. My aunt\u2019s cook, Mary, brings meals over. She thinks I\u2019m wasting away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a great body,\u201d he remarked, and before she could react to the compliment, he asked, \u201cWhat can I do to help? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>She put him to work making a salad. It didn\u2019t take any time at all to warm the chicken and pasta. She sliced hot French bread, and dinner was ready. They sat at the small table in the alcove overlooking the street. Grayson turned the plantation shutters so no one could look in.</p><p>He ate like a starving linebacker. \u201cDoes your aunt\u2019s cook . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mary bring food every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, or she\u2019ll bring a week\u2019s worth of dinners. She puts all of them in the freezer with instructions on each, and all I have to do is slip one into the oven or the microwave, and dinner\u2019s ready. I keep telling her she doesn\u2019t need to continue cooking for me, but she\u2019s like my aunt Emma. Neither one of them will listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she start cooking for you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at her plate while she thought about it, twisting the pasta around and around her fork, barely aware of what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was finally released from the unit . . . the hospital unit,\u201d she explained. \u201cI moved in with Aunt Emma and Uncle Daniel. They\u2019d purchased a house in D.C. about eight months before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go back home to San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to continue to see Dr. Pardieu, and I would never leave Jane and Collins and Sam. They were still undergoing treatment.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to let her know he understood. \u201cYou\u2019re very loyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my sisters.\u201d Her voice was emphatic. \u201cWe protected one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what? The outside world?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSomething like that. Mary had just started working for Emma. At the time I was released, I was weak and thin, and from Mary\u2019s horrified expression, I assumed I looked bad. I was suddenly encased in a bear hug, and Mary told me she was going to fatten me up. I remember thinking of the story Hansel and Gretel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch was going to fatten them up before she cooked them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMary wasn\u2019t a witch, though. She was and is an angel. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still not fattened up enough to suit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma moved here for you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She put her fork down and pushed her plate aside. \u201cI thought when I went off to university and later when Uncle Daniel died, she would move back to San Francisco, but she loves it here, and she doesn\u2019t want to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary has a key to your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else has a key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane and Collins. Neither one of them has ever used her key, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane and Collins live here, and in an emergency they know they can come stay with me. That\u2019s why they have keys. Emma\u2019s house is always open to all of us, too,\u201d she added. \u201cBut Sam\u2019s in Iceland or somewhere thereabout. She doesn\u2019t need a key.\u201d</p><p>Olivia carried her dishes to the sink. Grayson followed and nudged her out of his way. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>She was happy to let him clean up. She sat on a stool at the island watching him. His back was to her so she could stare at him. He could easily overwhelm her, she thought. Can\u2019t let that happen. But he was so . . . bigger than life. So wonderful and sweet and sexy and . . . She suddenly wanted to wrap her arms around him and hold tight.</p><p>Snap out of it, she told herself.</p><p>He turned and saw her watching him. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re frowning.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, her cell phone rang, and she didn\u2019t have to come up with a suitable answer. She wasn\u2019t going to tell him the truth, that he scared the hell out of her, making her want things she could never have.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the phone number, but as soon as she heard the voice, she knew exactly who was calling.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, this is Eric Jorguson. Now, don\u2019t hang up on me, please. Hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked quietly. She tapped Grayson on his shoulder, and when he turned to her, she whispered Jorguson\u2019s name.</p><p>Jorguson continued, \u201cI want to apologize for my behavior at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happened some time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m apologizing now? Is that it? I know it\u2019s long overdue. I jumped to the wrong conclusion. I should have reasoned it through. You\u2019re Robert MacKenzie\u2019s daughter, and if I can trust him with my money, I can certainly trust that you wouldn\u2019t be part of anything so underhanded as wearing a wire. I completely overreacted.\u201d He paused and then said, \u201cThe other reason I\u2019m calling is to offer you a position.\u201d</p><p>She nearly dropped the phone. \u201cYou want me to come work for you?\u201d She shivered with repulsion over the possibility. At least she didn\u2019t gag.</p><p>\u201cYes, I most certainly do. Once I understood you weren\u2019t working for the FBI, I realized what a catch you would be. I really want you to consider working for me.\u201d</p><p>He then explained in great detail what the position would be, and when he casually mentioned the starting salary, she nearly dropped the phone again.</p><p>Grayson was leaning against the sink, a dish towel in hand, watching her intently. He looked like he was about to grab the phone and throw it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, Olivia,\u201d Jorguson went on, \u201cbut I did have a look at your financials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy financials?\u201d she repeated, dumbfounded by his temerity.</p><p>He either didn\u2019t hear how strained her voice was, or he didn\u2019t care. \u201cAnd I noticed you have never accepted any money from your relatives. You\u2019re making your own way on your own terms, and I admire that. Yes, I do,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI also found out what your annual salary is, working for the IRS. In one year with me, Olivia, you\u2019ll make more than five times that amount.</p><p>\u201cBesides salary,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere are other benefits, and you\u2019ll only work with three of my top clients.\u201d</p><p>He listed their names, and Olivia thought they sounded familiar. Probably from the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List, she surmised. Hmmm. The possibilities were growing. She might be able to help Agent Huntsman nail him. Wouldn\u2019t that be lovely?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, think about it. Take all the time you need. Now, one last thing . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you how sorry I am that Ray Martin, my personal assistant, went after you the way he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean when he attacked me and hit me?\u201d And you were yelling, \u201cGet her, get her\u201d? she thought but didn\u2019t add.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean when he drove by your apartment building and shot you. I want you to know he was no longer working for me. I had already fired him after the incident at the restaurant, and I believe he blamed you and wanted revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain it was him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. You won\u2019t have to worry about thugs like Martin bothering you when you work for me. You\u2019ll be protected.\u201d</p><p>And on he continued, raving about his luxurious offices and how very lucky she was to be one of his chosen.</p><p>As soon as the call ended, she looked over at Grayson and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to laugh or throw up. Get this. Jorguson said he\u2019s invested in my father\u2019s fund.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lose every penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuntsman will want to know about this. I\u2019ll tell him. What else did Jorguson say?\u201d</p><p>Grayson followed her into the living room, and she plopped down on the sofa. He stood on the other side of the coffee table and asked her to repeat the entire conversation.</p><p>Olivia was still flabbergasted when she finished. \u201cHow can he do that? Call me as though there weren\u2019t still charges pending for the attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t call unless he was convinced his attorneys were making it all go away. They\u2019ve evidently managed to shift all the blame onto Martin.\u201d He thought for a second and said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t give you any concrete reasons why he thinks Martin is the shooter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than saying Martin wanted revenge because Jorguson fired him. That\u2019s more of a guess on Jorguson\u2019s part, isn\u2019t it? Could Ray Martin be the shooter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an alibi, said he was home watching Sixty Minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she thought that was funny, but she did.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he insisted. \u201cCouldn\u2019t remember what was on, though. We don\u2019t have proof yet that he was involved with your shooting, but we can prove he\u2019s been selling guns to his neighbors, and we found his stash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a bad temper,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHe tried to throw a chair at an agent during questioning. He\u2019s got a short fuse, and he could kill someone. One of the guns we found, an old .45, was used in a shooting last year. Only prints on it were his. Martin\u2019s going away for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he has something to offer in return for a lighter sentence? Maybe he could give you Jorguson and some of his clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have to give up Gretta Keene along with Jorguson to get any consideration, and that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you told me Keene vanished right before she was deported.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think she ever left the country. She\u2019s still running her operation here, and we believe Jorguson is still laundering her blood money.\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to her and called Ronan. He was waiting for him to pick up when Olivia said, \u201cYou know, I could take a leave from the IRS and maybe use some of my vacation . . .\u201d</p><p>Ronan answered. \u201cHold on,\u201d Grayson said. Turning to Olivia he asked, \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize the data I\u2019d have access to if I were to work for Jorguson? You told me Agent Huntsman has been after him for some time now. I\u2019d like to help. This would be an opportunity . . . Stop looking at me like you think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you actually believe he\u2019d let you near anything illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could snoop around, find out how he communicates with Keene and how he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re going to work for that bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think I\u2019m the one who should make that decision.\u201d</p> <p>Thus began what Olivia would later refer to as the blowout. Grayson had a dark side, and she didn\u2019t like it one little bit. He thought he could intimidate her and almost did, but she gave as good as she was getting. At least, she thought she did. But in the end, FBI trumped her.</p><p>\u201cAre you really that stubborn?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cApparently I am,\u201d he countered.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, Grayson had forgotten Ronan was on the line. His friend was on his way to pick up a date. He tried a couple of times to get Grayson to talk to him, then gave up and listened.</p><p>Grayson argued, \u201cYou can\u2019t be that naive, Olivia. The only reason Jorguson wants you working for him is to keep an eye on you, and to keep you from testifying against him. That\u2019s also the reason he would pay you an obscene salary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI realize\u2014\u201d Olivia began, and that was as far as she got. She didn\u2019t get in another word for several minutes while Grayson lectured over the foolishness of her suggestion.</p><p>The sharp whistle from the phone reminded him that Ronan was still waiting.</p><p>\u201cJorguson called Olivia,\u201d Grayson explained to him.</p><p>\u201cI gathered as much,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cI could hear you shouting at her. Olivia\u2019s just trying to be helpful,\u201d he said in her defense. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid idea, going to work for that creep . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, all but shouting the word, \u201cdon\u2019t tell her that. She means well.\u201d</p> <p>While Grayson talked to his partner, Olivia went into the kitchen to get a bottle of water. When she returned, she paused to glare at him just for the sheer pleasure of it, then took a drink and sat down next to him.</p><p>Grayson finished his call, put his arm around her, and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shout at you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes heavenward. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I did.\u201d</p><p>She made the mistake of looking up at him. He kissed her then, distracting her. He took the bottle out of her hand and gulped down a long swallow before handing it back.</p><p>With a calmer voice now, Olivia said, \u201cI was only offering to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut these are dangerous people who have done terrible things. If you knew more about them, you\u2019d see.\u201d</p><p>Olivia decided to let Grayson win this battle. So much for her superspy ambitions. She realized she couldn\u2019t infiltrate Jorguson\u2019s operation or help Agent Huntsman.</p> <p>Letting the subject of Jorguson drop, she said, \u201cI hope Ray Martin is the man who tried to kill me. He\u2019s your main suspect, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, which, in her opinion, wasn\u2019t much of an answer.</p><p>\u201cHe had motive,\u201d she said. \u201cI got him fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone who got fired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge is a powerful motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other powerful motives and other people who stand to gain much more than satisfaction or revenge if you\u2019re out of the way. Why do you want it to be Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a reason.\u201d</p><p>He was gently stroking her arm. She put her head down on his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a relative.\u201d The fact that she considered it possible that her father or mother or her sister or brother-in-law could go to such lengths made her sick. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met my father yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to find out all I could about him before I met him. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people who know him and have worked with him and for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet every one of them sang his praises, even the ones who lost money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d he agreed. \u201cRonan has taken the lead on the investigation. He\u2019s met him. He flew to New York and questioned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re trying not to form an opinion until you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. I know what he\u2019s done to you, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got a real strong opinion.\u201d</p><p>There was anger in his voice. Grayson had become her champion, and she was a little overwhelmed. A long quiet minute passed before she spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you meet him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt his birthday party here in D.C. next weekend.\u201d</p><p>She bolted upright. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to his party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re not going either,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd quit shoving my head down on your shoulder. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know you\u2019re even more beautiful when you\u2019re mad?\u201d he said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cSaying I\u2019m beautiful isn\u2019t going to sway me, Grayson, so you can stop the phony flattery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not flattery, Olivia. You are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The question surprised her. \u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m all dressed up and everything works, I feel pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, if everything works?\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop him, he lifted her up onto his lap and put her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a puppet, Grayson. You can\u2019t just put me where you want me.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her criticism. \u201cWhat do you mean, if everything works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou men . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it so easy. Put on a suit and walk out the door. It\u2019s far more complicated for a woman. I\u2019ll give you an example. If I were to wear my all-time favorite white, wickedly sexy dress\u2014which I happen to love with all my heart, as shallow as that sounds\u2014and if my hair is just right, and my complexion is clear, and the makeup works, then I\u2019d feel and see a pretty woman when I look in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of complicated, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he remarked, trying not to laugh. \u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re not dressed up?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him the truth, that some days she felt like that ugly twelve-year-old in the hospital, fighting blisters and welts. \u201cI look and feel drab sometimes. Yes, drab,\u201d she repeated, jabbing him in his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh at me. I\u2019m not so different from other women. We all have insecurities about our appearance.\u201d</p><p>He laughed anyway. She was primed for a fight. Apparently, he wasn\u2019t. She leaned in and kissed him, teasing him with her tongue. She knew he liked that because he tightened his hold around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not above ha**ng s*x to get what I want,\u201d she purred.</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Olivia was going stir crazy. Work kept her busy during the days, but nights were difficult. She became quite the little housekeeper. She organized her kitchen cabinets, painted the guest bathroom a pale pink, decided she didn\u2019t like the color, and then painted it a dark blue. That didn\u2019t work either, so with her bodyguard at her side, she went back to the paint store a third time and purchased a can of taupe paint. Only after it was on the walls did she realize she\u2019d painted it the original color.</p><p>It seemed to her that she was constantly tripping over the bodyguards following her around. She was allowed to go to work or stay home. There were no other options as far as Grayson was concerned. Even Aunt Emma\u2019s house was considered out of bounds.</p><p>An off-duty policeman drove her to work, then returned at five or six, depending on her schedule, to drive her home.</p><p>Another guard sat outside her office.</p><p>Olivia put her foot down about the twenty-four-hour protection, insisting that it was ridiculous to have a guard standing outside her apartment door. Once she was inside her home and had locked the deadbolt, she was perfectly safe. Besides, there was a doorman on duty twenty-four hours a day in the lobby. She gave Grayson the same argument about work. There was absolutely no reason for a bodyguard to sit outside her office.</p><p>Grayson relented as long as she promised not to go anywhere alone. He gave her five different cell phone numbers to call for the bodyguards. One of them would always be available to accompany her.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief when she got the news that Ray Martin was behind bars. He had been denied bail\u2014the prosecutor convinced the judge that Martin was a flight risk\u2014and Olivia didn\u2019t think it was coincidence that there hadn\u2019t been another attempt on her life since he was locked up. She pointed out the obvious fact to Grayson, but every time she brought it up, Grayson asked the same question: What did Martin have to gain by killing her? Revenge apparently wasn\u2019t enough of a motive to suit him.</p><p>Monday evening she video-chatted with Samantha, who couldn\u2019t stop raving about her jet.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could go up with me,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia thought she might like it, too. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re the pilot, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Jane. How is she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was throwing up when I called and couldn\u2019t come to the phone. Logan answered. He told me he\u2019s really worried about her. He said she\u2019s losing weight, and he can\u2019t understand why the doctor can\u2019t fix her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what he said. Olivia, has it come back?\u201d she asked, fear radiating in her voice.</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu says no, there aren\u2019t any signs that our disease has come back, but her cell count is down, and her symptoms aren\u2019t consistent. He\u2019s still in France. I\u2019ll be happy when he gets back and can take over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you giving her blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she answered. \u201cThe hospital will let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollins is there. She can give her blood, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cMaybe Jane\u2019s just got a bad case of the flu. Some viruses stay in your system a long time, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re reaching,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI feel so helpless. So does Logan,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s brother has only just reconnected with her, and it\u2019s heartbreaking for him to see her so ill. He was never around when she was in the unit with us.\u201d</p><p>They continued to talk for another ten minutes. Sam told her there were several good-looking men around her, but she wasn\u2019t interested in any of them. \u201cI\u2019m so much younger than most of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>Olivia told her about Grayson and how she had gotten so involved with him.</p><p>\u201cHis nine-year-old nephew lives with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cThe child\u2019s mother died, and the father is absent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re just like me. We\u2019re fatalists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t plan futures. Happy endings don\u2019t exist for any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t live our lives . . . waiting. You know?\u201d</p><p>Sam agreed. \u201cI\u2019m going to cram all I can into the time I have.\u201d</p><p>By the time they said their good-byes, Olivia was feeling an overwhelming sadness, but she didn\u2019t allow herself to wallow in self-pity long. Since she was stuck at home, she decided to catch up on her reading. She had two unread novels and at least twenty-five journals stacked on her desk.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t read another article without falling asleep, she went shoe shopping on the Internet. After that, she decided to do a little investigative browsing. She remembered Grayson mentioning a couple of Jorguson clients. One name in particular, Gretta Keene, came to mind first, so she decided to focus on her. She typed her name into the search engine and was surprised by the number of articles she found. As it turned out, the woman had quite a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. According to the reports, she was a Belgian emigrant who had become a major player in the American drug scene. After a long investigation by the government, she was finally charged with drug trafficking, but the case never got to court because of a technicality. Shortly after her release, the Belgian government instigated their own attempts to have her extradited. They were anxious to get her back so they could prosecute her for murder. Unfortunately, before any formal action could be taken, Keene disappeared, and she hadn\u2019t been heard from since.</p><p>In her research, Olivia saw Jorguson\u2019s name mentioned several times as a business associate, but he wasn\u2019t linked to any criminal activity. If the FBI was so convinced that Jorguson was laundering money for Keene, Olivia surmised they had some pretty good evidence, just not enough to convict him. She now understood their determination to connect the dots and to prove that Keene and Jorguson were working together.</p><p>Olivia was really getting into her research and thinking it was kind of fun, that is, until she happened upon photos of a crime scene, bloody bodies amid bags that were to be filled with drugs. The article printed with the pictures stated that Keene was believed to be connected to the killings, but that hadn\u2019t been proven either. Olivia found several more references to the same incident, and those led to other articles. After an hour, Olivia couldn\u2019t look at another crime scene or read about another bloodbath between rival drug cartels. These people were monsters. If Jorguson was aiding them in any way, Olivia prayed the FBI would catch him soon.</p><p>She turned off her computer and looked at the clock. The evening was still young, so she decided to try to make dinner. She chose a recipe from her one and only, new, never-before-opened cookbook and went to work. The result was a disaster. Emma\u2019s cook, Mary, saved her from starvation. Olivia pulled one of Mary\u2019s chicken-and-noodle casseroles from the freezer and popped it in the microwave. As she sat at her kitchen island eating out of the casserole dish, her thoughts went to Grayson.</p><p>She thought about him all the time. Whenever she had a spare minute, there he was. As far as her relationship with him went, she was certain that, when the threat was over and he was convinced that the proper arrests had been made, she wouldn\u2019t see him again. And that was for the best, she believed; yet, whenever she thought about never seeing him again, she\u2019d feel an ache deep within her chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was this just a fling? Maybe . . . except, she didn\u2019t do flings. She knew exactly what had happened and finally found enough gumption to admit it. She\u2019d fallen in love with Grayson. What she didn\u2019t understand was how she had allowed herself to be vulnerable. This was all her fault. She couldn\u2019t blame Grayson for any of it. He\u2019d never done anything to lead her on or make her think he had these feelings for her. She had likened him to James Bond when she\u2019d first met him, and she\u2019d seen all the movies. In every one of them Bond made love to the woman and moved on. And so would Grayson. Wasn\u2019t that for the best?</p><p>Olivia decided not to think about the future.</p><p>On Friday she left work early\u2014Fridays were always slow for some reason. She arrived home, changed into jeans and a periwinkle-blue sweater, and went to the kitchen to see what she could microwave.</p><p>Grayson changed the plan when he showed up at her door and told her he was taking her out.</p> <p>He looked wonderful. His face was ruddy from the bitter cold outside. His coat collar was up, and his hair was damp from the falling snow.</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t seen him since last Sunday when he\u2019d dropped by unexpectedly. He had been able to stay for only a few minutes then, but he\u2019d called her every day, sometimes twice, to check on her. Now, with him standing in front of her, she wanted to throw herself into his arms. Resisting the nearly overwhelming urge, she forced herself to step back so he could come inside, and still not trusting herself, she put her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019m taking you to dinner,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re going out to dinner. You ask me. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done. And then I decide if I want to go or not.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved to the back of her neck, and he jerked her toward him. His open mouth came down on hers, his tongue penetrating, tasting, teasing, tempting. When he lifted his head, she sagged against him.</p> <p>She came to her senses and moved away from him. \u201cWe can\u2019t go out to dinner,\u201d she said as she walked into the kitchen. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be safe. Those were your words, Grayson.\u201d She opened the refrigerator, then closed it. \u201cYou told me I couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant or a shopping center or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember what I told you. Office and home. I don\u2019t recall adding paint store to the list.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard had told on her. She said, \u201cWe went in at closing and were the only customers.\u201d</p><p>Grayson noticed the open cookbook on the island. \u201cDid you already make dinner?\u201d</p><p>Her chin came up. \u201cRisotto.\u201d</p><p>He looked around. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the sink . . . soaking.\u201d</p><p>When he saw the wooden spoon sticking straight up out of the glue-like substance, he began to laugh. He took the spoon handle and attempted to move the congealed goo in the pan, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhen did you make this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she answered. \u201cGrayson, it\u2019s not that funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>She opened the refrigerator again. \u201cThank goodness for Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were serious? Of course I want to go out. I\u2019m going crazy staying in all the time. I\u2019m getting a vitamin D deficiency, for Pete\u2019s sake. I need sun and fresh air. I\u2019m even trying to learn how to cook, and if that doesn\u2019t tell you how far gone I am, I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vitamin D deficiency?\u201d</p> <p>She folded her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we\u2019re going you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>Suspicious, she asked, \u201cWhere? Your office? No, I\u2019ve got it. Vending machines at the police station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t be around Henry. It wouldn\u2019t be safe for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t home tonight. He went to a movie with his grandfather and then is spending the night. It\u2019s the only other place he\u2019ll sleep.\u201d</p><p>Curious to see what his home was like and desperate to get out of her apartment, she agreed. \u201cOkay, but no funny stuff.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFunny stuff?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she rushed into her bedroom to get her shoes.</p><p>Grayson was holding her coat when she returned. She slipped it on, grabbed her purse and cell phone, and unlocked the deadbolt. Grayson saw her inhaler on the table and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we having for dinner? Are we doing carryout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cooking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d She sounded shocked.</p><p>It was a short ride to Grayson\u2019s building, a grand five-story structure at the intersection of two quiet streets in a very exclusive neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a minimalist,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Grayson used an app on his iPhone to open the iron gates that led to a parking garage below the building.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour home,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s sleek, modern. Everything has a function. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>The garage was empty. He pulled into a parking slot next to the elevator. \u201cHave you forgotten I have a nine-year-old living with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, cluttered minimalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Henry moved in, the only furniture I had was my bed and a chest of drawers. The living room was empty. Once I\u2019d finished remodeling, I planned to put it on the market. Everything changed, of course. I ordered furniture, and the last of it just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still thinking you\u2019ll sell?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHenry needs stability, so no more moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you the only tenant living in the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I bought the building, remodeled the top floor, and the architect I hired is working on plans for the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have become an architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a hobby.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened to his foyer, gleaming marble floors and a wide-open space. The living room was straight ahead. Facing them was a wall of windows, and the view was spectacular. Area rugs in muted tones adorned dark hardwood floors. The furniture was sparse and did have the sleek lines she\u2019d imagined. Two mahogany leather club chairs sat adjacent to a taupe overstuffed sofa. The contemporary fireplace was encased in black granite that went all the way to the ceiling. There were lots of neutrals, and on the wall next to the fireplace was an abstract painting she thought might be a Richter original. Beautiful splashes of color and thick drapes gave the room dimension and texture.</p><p>The dining room was surrounded by windows as well. On the round, dark cherry table, she noticed a pad, no doubt to protect it from the Lego kit strewn about.</p><p>There was evidence of a nine-year-old everywhere. A handheld video game was on the arm of a chair; a pair of gym socks were under the dining room table, and there were three other Lego kits half completed behind the sofa.</p><p>To the left of the foyer was a long hallway. From what she could see, there were at least three bedrooms. To the right was another hallway that led to the kitchen and the pantry beyond. Grayson took her coat and hung it in the hall closet. She followed him, but stopped at the entrance to a gourmet chef\u2019s dream come true.</p><p>\u201cThis kitchen is practically the size of my entire apartment,\u201d she said.</p><p>Stainless steel, granite, and sleek lacquered cabinets everywhere she looked. All of the appliances appeared to be brand-new: two double-size ovens, a microwave, an espresso machine, a coffeemaker that had so many buttons it looked like it could run NORAD, a huge stove with eight gas burners, and a few other electrical gadgets she had never seen before.</p><p>The granite island was twice the size of hers. She pulled out one of the four bar stools and sat.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to work all of these appliances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do.\u201d He was at the sink across from her washing his hands. \u201cBut Patrick, our housekeeper, runs the kitchen,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cHousekeeper?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Patrick calls himself, but he\u2019s more like a manager. He runs the house and he also helps with the renovation projects I take on. He needed a place to live at the same time Henry was moving in with me, so it\u2019s worked out for everyone. He keeps Henry and me on schedule and somewhat organized. Would you like something to drink? A glass of wine or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust water for now.\u201d</p><p>He got her a bottle, opened it, and handed it to her. \u201cI\u2019ll get dinner started and then go change out of this suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you relax. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>He moved to the other side of the island to face her. Then he looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s six thirty-five. I\u2019ll change my clothes and fix dinner. By eight twenty we should be finished. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll hit on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then, at eight forty I\u2019ll hit on you again. My plan is to wear you down,\u201d he added.</p><p>She nodded and very seriously said, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt eight fifty-five you\u2019ll give in just to get me to stop nagging you. Besides . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it, sweetheart. I\u2019m good. You\u2019ve told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I touch you and you moan and beg me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his mouth. She could feel her cheeks warming, knew she was blushing. \u201cI can\u2019t argue with the truth.\u201d She took a calming breath. \u201cAnd then?\u201d she asked, trying to maintain a somber expression.</p><p>\u201cAt approximately one in the morning, we\u2019ll get dressed, and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s my plan.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s all good and well, but I was asking you what your plan was for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he came around the island and leaned down to kiss her. \u201cYou taste good,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cGrayson, you know we can\u2019t . . . not here . . .\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his lips over hers. \u201cYeah, I know. Want to hear my secondary plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like messing with me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda do. I like the way you blush.\u201d</p><p>She nudged him. \u201cGo change your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him again. \u201cOh no. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he left the kitchen, she went to the window to look out. She could see over the rooftops for blocks. Down below, traffic was moving slowly, and there were no pedestrians on the sidewalks. Snow flurries were expected, and the temperature had plummeted.</p><p>She turned and surveyed the apartment. There was a rectangular table with four chairs near the window. Henry\u2019s backpack was in the center of the table with two action figures. A deck of cards was stacked next to a notepad and pen. On the chair was an iPad.</p><p>Grayson returned wearing a pair of jeans and a light-blue cotton shirt, open at the neck with sleeves rolled up. Olivia insisted on helping prepare dinner. He grilled salmon he\u2019d been marinating, made a spicy lemon-pepper sauce, and added steamed vegetables and brown rice. He let Olivia do the microwaving of the vegetable steam bag, but after seeing the result of her attempt to cook risotto, he wouldn\u2019t let her near the fish.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d noticed during dinner, but when they were rinsing the dishes and putting them in the dishwasher later, he said, \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you what?\u201d she asked, handing him a glass to rinse.</p><p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t like salmon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t like salmon. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have fixed you something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to so much trouble, I didn\u2019t want to be impolite,\u201d she explained. \u201cDoes Henry like your cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nephew has a very limited palate. Chicken fingers and mac and cheese are his favorites. Patrick can get him to eat vegetables, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Grayson\u2019s cell phone beeped with a text. He read the message and sighed. \u201cHenry\u2019s coming home from the movie. He was supposed to spend the night with his grandfather, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d rather sleep here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his grandfather . . . my dad . . . has a friend coming over to spend some time with him. She just called him to let him know she\u2019s back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have time to take me home?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way now, but as soon as Patrick gets back, we can leave. It shouldn\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind waiting, and I\u2019d like to meet Henry.\u201d</p><p>He took a plate from her hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll finish here. You look tired. Why don\u2019t you relax, and I\u2019ll brew a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer tea if you have it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTea coming up,\u201d he said.</p><p>Olivia sat in one of the club chairs and picked up a comic book from a stack on the side table. As she thumbed through the pages, reading about a superhero in a slick purple suit who could teleport himself anywhere in the world, she began to feel a tightness in her chest. She recognized the signs of her asthma immediately and walked to the hall closet to get her purse. She pulled her cell phone out, then her lipstick, comb, billfold, tissues . . . no inhaler.</p><p>Grayson saw what she was doing. \u201cYour inhaler is in my coat pocket.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she asked, \u201cHow did it get in your coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left it on the table, so I grabbed it.\u201d</p><p>It was such a thoughtful thing to do. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She was thinking how terribly sweet he was until he started lecturing her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to pay attention and make certain you\u2019ve always got an inhaler with you, Olivia. I\u2019ve done some reading on asthma, and an attack can get out of hand. I don\u2019t understand how you can be so cavalier about it.\u201d</p><p>She used her inhaler and put it in her purse. Then she walked into the living room. She stopped in front of the windows.</p><p>\u201cThis view is spectacular.\u201d</p><p>He stood behind her and put his arms around her. \u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about inhalers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve become a little too careless about my asthma. I\u2019ll try to do better.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around, tilted her face up with his hand under her chin and kissed her. He meant only to give her a quick kiss, but in no time at all it got out of hand, and before he realized what he was doing, he\u2019d lifted her up, her pelvis pressed against his, his mouth ravishing hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t hear the bell on the elevator. Grayson did and reluctantly let go of her.</p><p>The doors hadn\u2019t completely opened when Henry bounded out, shouting, \u201cUncle Grayson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Henry. You don\u2019t need to shout.\u201d</p><p>Henry remembered the intercom and pressed it. \u201cI\u2019m home, Grandfather.\u201d Turning back to Grayson, he said, \u201cHe let me ride up by myself. Who\u2019s she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA friend,\u201d he answered. \u201cPut your coat away and take your shoes into your bedroom.\u201d Henry had already kicked them off. \u201cThen come meet her.\u201d</p><p>He was back in two seconds, which told Grayson he\u2019d opened his bedroom door and tossed his coat and shoes in. He slid across the marble and walked over to Olivia. Grayson made the introductions.</p><p>Olivia thought Henry was a charmer. There were a few similarities to Grayson in bone structure, high cheekbones and square jaw, and he definitely had the same smile. Henry was tall for his age and lanky. He stared up at her with big brown eyes for a good twenty seconds without saying a word. She stared back.</p><p>Grayson watched the two with amusement.</p><p>Henry broke the staring contest. \u201cDo you work in the FBI?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an attorney, Henry,\u201d Grayson explained.</p><p>\u201cYou are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at Olivia again. \u201cDo you go into the court to help good people or bad people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has two jobs,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cShe works on taxes for the IRS,\u201d he said, trying to simplify it for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a children\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>Henry was fascinated by the idea. \u201cKids can have their own lawyers? You could work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I could,\u201d she said. She walked over to the sofa and sat. He followed and sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cHow was the movie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGrandfather didn\u2019t buy the premise. That\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p> <p>Grayson sat in an easy chair facing them. \u201cDid he explain what premise meant?\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cHe did, and he said he didn\u2019t believe a car could turn into a robot.\u201d</p><p>Transforming one item into another was the topic of conversation for the next ten minutes, and then the three of them moved to the dining room table. While Grayson caught up on his e-mails on his laptop, she and Henry worked on constructing a filling station with Legos.</p><p>She heard, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong,\u201d at least ten times, and she noticed that every time Henry said it, Grayson flashed a smile. Henry thoroughly enjoyed that she was so inept.</p><p>\u201cGrandfather says I need a woman,\u201d Henry casually remarked.</p><p>That statement got Grayson\u2019s full attention. Olivia didn\u2019t seem fazed. \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo boss me probably. Olivia, when we\u2019re finished, do you want to see my room?\u201d</p><p>She was trying to cram a tiny cube into the base of the attached carwash. She couldn\u2019t resist teasing him.</p><p>\u201cI already saw your room. It\u2019s very nice. I liked your bed. I rolled around in it and tested the pillow. Nice and firm.\u201d</p><p>Henry was giggling. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she countered. \u201cThen I went through all your stuff, played some video games, and when I was finished, I went into your closet and tried on some of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>He had a good laugh. Then he told her she was connecting the Legos all wrong again. She handed him the tiny piece and said, \u201cYou fix it. I\u2019ll watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, will you write down your phone number in case I need my own lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, she doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Grayson began.</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t need to write my number. I\u2019ll give you one of my cards.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the entry where she\u2019d left her purse and patiently waited while she searched for the case with her cards. She found it and gave him one.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m going to try out for soccer.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask him to explain why he thought he\u2019d need an attorney for soccer and would have if the elevator bell hadn\u2019t sounded. A few seconds later Patrick arrived.</p><p>She had expected a much older man, but Patrick was in his early forties. He was very tall, at least six feet five, and with his lean frame, he had the physical attributes of an NBA player. He shook her hand and shot Grayson a sly look of approval before heading to his room to change.</p><p>\u201cPatrick plays basketball most Friday nights,\u201d Henry told her.</p><p>He then asked her to play a card game with him. Since Henry was having such a good time with Olivia\u2014he was clearly winning\u2014Grayson waited until his nephew had gone to bed to take her home.</p><p>Olivia was quiet in the car, her mind jumping from one thought to another.</p><p>\u201cDo you worry that Henry\u2019s father will come home and take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBecause my brother knows what\u2019s best for Henry, and right now he needs stability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like to worry?\u201d</p><p>She started to say no, of course not, then decided to think about it. \u201cI guess I\u2019m used to worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you do admit you\u2019re a pessimist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a realist.\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t argue. \u201cHenry likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I have the sense of humor of a nine-year-old. He gets me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? Do you think I get you?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her as he said, \u201cOh, I know exactly what\u2019s going on inside that illogical mind of yours.\u201d</p><p>She took immediate umbrage. \u201cExcuse me? Illogical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout some things, yes, you\u2019re definitely illogical,\u201d he said. She opened her mouth to disagree, but he changed the subject. \u201cRonan told me you\u2019re reading up on a couple of Jorguson\u2019s old clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I might\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cYou aren\u2019t still considering going to work for that prick, are you? Because if you are, you should know I\u2019m not gonna let that happen. If you think I\u2019ll stand by and watch you put yourself in danger, you\u2019re out of your ever-loving mind.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was surprised by his reaction. In the space of a few seconds, he had worked himself into a lather. \u201cYou care that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I care.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand up. \u201cDon\u2019t yell at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Olivia, I won\u2019t let you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to work for Jorguson. And don\u2019t you dare say, \u2018Damn right, you\u2019re not,\u2019\u201d she rushed to add when he looked as though he was about to say just that. \u201cI made the decision, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson, I\u2019m not going to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cYeah, okay. Tell me why you were looking at Jorguson\u2019s connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been stuck at home every night, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anything on my father, so out of sheer boredom, a little curiosity, and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ego,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I thought I might find something that would help the FBI\u2019s investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI discovered a great deal about Gretta Keene and some of the horrific crimes she might have committed. If Jorguson is involved with any of them, I hope you can find the proof you need to bring him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Grayson noticed a car parked in a no-parking zone just around the corner from Olivia\u2019s apartment and called it in. The plates were registered to a woman who lived one block over. He parked in front of Olivia\u2019s building, and she waited until he came around to get her. He was being a gentleman, but he was also protecting her. She noticed he always made himself the target whenever they walked anywhere. It was all part of his job, he\u2019d told her. She\u2019d argued she wasn\u2019t the president, and he shouldn\u2019t have to take a bullet for her, but he\u2019d simply ignored her.</p><p>They entered her apartment building, and when the elevator doors opened on her floor, he walked out first. He took her key from her, unlocked her door, and followed her inside. After he\u2019d checked every conceivable place for someone to hide, he came back into the living room. Just as he was taking off his coat, Ronan called.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? What the hell do you mean by \u2018ah\u2019?\u201d he asked, inwardly cringing over how defensive he\u2019d sounded. He went into Olivia\u2019s study and shut the door so that he would have some privacy and said, \u201cLook, Ronan, I know I said I was going to distance myself from this investigation . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve gotta be thinking it\u2019s Friday night. What am I doing in her apartment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t let him get any further. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved with Olivia, but I swear from tonight on I\u2019ll distance myself. So stop bringing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson, what the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>He had the answer, but he didn\u2019t say it out loud. Guilt. He knew what he should be doing and what he shouldn\u2019t. Yeah, it was plain old guilt.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve finished ranting, I\u2019ll tell you why I called.\u201d</p><p>Grayson leaned against the desk and closed his eyes. He had been ranting.</p><p>\u201cRay Martin wants a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch bodyguard punches Olivia and pulls a gun on her, and he wants to deal. The hell with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Grayson knew he was right. \u201cWhat does he want to deal with? What\u2019s he got to offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll give us the name of the weapons supplier and will testify against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You can\u2019t trust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he has proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? A receipt?\u201d</p><p>Ronan laughed. \u201cSomething like that. What do you think? If it\u2019s legit, would you press to make a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be objective,\u201d he admitted, and as soon as the words were out of his mouth, he was appalled. He really couldn\u2019t be objective, and how in God\u2019s name had he allowed that to happen? Hell. \u201cIf Martin\u2019s the bastard who tried to kill Olivia, there isn\u2019t going to be any deal made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t convinced he was the shooter,\u201d Ronan reminded him. \u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m still not convinced, but as long as he remains a suspect . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t argue.\u201d He sounded resigned.</p><p>\u201cRonan, he punched her and pulled a gun on her. He ought to get a firing squad for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we still doing firing squads?\u201d</p><p>Grayson ended the call a minute later and went into the living room. Olivia had kicked off her shoes and was sitting on the sofa with her feet up on the ottoman, her iPad in her lap. She looked up when Grayson entered the room, saw his dark expression, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through his hair and continued to frown at her. \u201cListen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told Ronan I couldn\u2019t be objective, and that\u2019s just not acceptable. This can\u2019t go on. I need to be able to concentrate on the investigation, but you\u2019re messing with my mind, Olivia. I can\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d</p><p>She put the iPad on the coffee table and sat up. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You\u2019re messing with my mind. I\u2019ve got to get my focus back, stay away from you while I work. I feel like I\u2019m missing something, some detail that might make a difference, but every time I\u2019m with you I get sidetracked. It\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re a very seductive woman.\u201d</p><p>He thought he was giving her a compliment, but she wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cI distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Not on purpose, but, yes, you do,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean when you said you feel like you could be missing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying attention, damn it. My focus is all screwed up. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. This is totally not like me. I\u2019ve got to get back on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you focus. Why is that funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you\u2019re the problem.\u201d</p><p>She took exception. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not? How about I won\u2019t touch you and you won\u2019t touch me? I have as much self-control as you do, probably more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. That reaction didn\u2019t sit well.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re stronger willed than I am? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he responded, as if there was no doubt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you. You believe one thing; I believe another. I\u2019m hungry for something sweet. Would you like something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cTell me what you found out about Gretta Keene. Anything that might be helpful?\u201d</p><p>Olivia got up, tossed her hair over her shoulder in what Grayson thought was a deliberately provocative gesture, and went into the kitchen. She came back a minute later with a cherry Popsicle and a plate. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cNow talk to me about Keene and then I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>She put the plate on the table, tore the paper off the Popsicle, and said, \u201cI just love these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGretta Keene,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>He watched her use the tip of her tongue to lick the side of the Popsicle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Agent Huntsman knows all there is to know about Gretta, but I did discover she\u2019s quite a micromanager. She has to oversee every detail, no matter how small.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue slowly slid up one side and down the other. Grayson couldn\u2019t take his gaze off her mouth. He knew what she was doing, and he was amused. Still, he couldn\u2019t look away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGretta has trust issues.\u201d She put the tip of the Popsicle in her mouth, her full, luscious lips closing around it. Then she took a bite and chewed. She was savoring the icy cold feeling against her tongue. \u201cShe won\u2019t move away from the money or underlings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe what?\u201d He was having a hell of a time concentrating. She was driving him crazy, and she knew it. How could eating a Popsicle be so sensual, so erotic, and such a turn-on?</p><p>She repeated what she\u2019d just said and then took another bite. When a drop of the red juice began to slide downward, she slowly drew her tongue across her lower lip to catch it.</p><p>\u201cGretta wants to keep the men who work for her under her thumb at all times so none of them will branch out on their own and become competitors. There was one employee who went against her orders, and she made an example of him. He was tortured before he was killed. I think she\u2019s here because she has to watch Jorguson, especially if a lot of her money is going through his firm.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia sucked the last bit of the Popsicle into her mouth and put the stick on the plate.</p><p>Grayson watched her carry her plate back into the kitchen. He loved the way her h*ps moved when she walked. Reluctantly, he reached for his coat and pulled it on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in every now and then,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cBut you don\u2019t go anywhere alone. Got that? You call one of the numbers and get one of your guards to go with you.\u201d</p><p>She walked him to the door. \u201cFor how long do I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as is necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, your little seduction didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>His restraint was rapidly shredding, and it was taking all of his concentration to keep from grabbing her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t act innocent or protest that she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. She stepped out of his way so he could leave, waited until he was closing the door, and then whispered, \u201cOh, I think it did.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>A week had gone by without a word from Grayson. Olivia kept telling herself she was happy and relieved that he\u2019d stayed away. She was feeling guilty for the seduction game she played with the Popsicle. It wasn\u2019t really fair. He was just trying to do his job, and their relationship was getting in the way. They had been acting like horny teenagers who couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other, and it had to stop. It wasn\u2019t right for either of them. Grayson had his job to think about, and she had her heart to think about. She was getting too emotionally involved, and since the relationship couldn\u2019t go anywhere, separating herself was the only decent thing to do.</p><p>She wondered if he would ever get married and decided that, yes, of course he would. He\u2019d probably have children, too. He should, anyway, because he would be such a great father. He was so loving and patient with Henry.</p><p>Every time she thought about her bleak future, she\u2019d get depressed, and yet she couldn\u2019t seem to stop thinking about it. Others might try to convince her that she could have a normal, happy life with a marriage and a family, but she knew better. She had seen the anxiety and suffering that illness could cause, and just the mere possibility that it could rear its ugly head again, as she feared it had done with Jane, made her determined never to let anyone she cared about go through that heartache and sacrifice.</p> <p>On Friday evening Emma called and insisted that Olivia have dinner with her. Olivia was delighted to have the chance to get out of her apartment for an evening, but that meant she had to call one of her guards to drive her. She had promised. All five guards were nice, polite gentlemen who took their job seriously, but she was getting sick and tired of having to rely on them. She longed to be able to get in her car and go wherever she wanted whenever she wanted. Boring but necessary chores, like grocery shopping or picking up her dry cleaning, now appealed to her. Even though she hated shopping for clothes, she needed a new pair of running shoes, but a trip to the mall was out of the question because there was always the worry of bullets flying all over the food court while the man who wanted her dead tried a second time to kill her.</p><p>Her patience was running out, yet every time she was close to throwing up her hands and yelling, \u201cEnough already,\u201d she\u2019d get a look at herself in the mirror and see the raw bullet scars. She\u2019d then decide she needed to be patient a little longer. Besides, the FBI wouldn\u2019t be paying for protection unless they felt there was a real threat. Right?</p><p>Ronan accidentally let the cat out of the bag. He called with a question about Simmons, Simmons and Falcon. He wanted to know how long the firm had been working with Olivia\u2019s father. She didn\u2019t have the answer but said she\u2019d try to find out for him.</p><p>\u201cWhile I have you on the phone, I\u2019d like to ask you something,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ronan was sure she was going to ask about Grayson.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI wouldn\u2019t be paying for these bodyguards if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before thinking, he said, \u201cThey aren\u2019t paying. They stopped. . . . I mean to say . . .\u201d</p><p>Olivia sat up straight, bristling at what he was trying not to tell her. \u201cWho\u2019s paying the bodyguards?\u201d There was no immediate reply, so she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s either Grayson or Emma, isn\u2019t it? Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Ronan sighed. \u201cGrayson\u2019s paying.\u201d He rushed to add, \u201cHe wants to keep you safe, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Did you have any other questions?\u201d</p><p>Ronan heard the stiffness in her voice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s paying. If you go anywhere, you call for a bodyguard first. Understand?\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia . . .\u201d he began, but it was too late. She was gone.</p><p>She found her car keys, locked the door after her, and took the elevator down to the garage. What an idiot she was, not to have figured it out sooner. If she truly needed a bodyguard, the FBI would have continued to provide the protection. How dare Grayson do this behind her back! She could take care of herself.</p><p>By the time she reached her car, she began to calm down. Maybe she was being too hard on Grayson. After all, he\u2019d obviously acted out of concern. He felt there was still a threat out there, and he wanted to protect her. True, his intentions were good, but he should have been honest with her, shouldn\u2019t he? She made up her mind to pay him every dollar he\u2019d spent on the bodyguards. Only then would her pride be salvaged.</p><p>She would prove that she could be cautious and self-sufficient. She wouldn\u2019t allow herself to be blindsided again.</p><p>She took caution to a whole new level. She carried her pepper spray in one hand and held her key fob in the other, one finger hovering over the panic button. She even checked to see if there were any red lights blinking under the car or in the backseat. Killing someone with a bomb wasn\u2019t all that unusual. She wasn\u2019t being paranoid; she was being smart. She even made certain she wasn\u2019t being followed and took several side streets to get to her aunt\u2019s house. She arrived alive and well.</p><p>Mary had set the table in the dining room. She and Harriet stayed in the kitchen, no doubt to eavesdrop because they knew the topic was going to be Olivia\u2019s father.</p><p>Emma greeted her with a kiss on each cheek. Her aunt always looked so put together. Olivia had never seen her in what she called casual clothes, and the thought of Emma putting on a pair of jeans made her smile. It was such an outlandish picture. Tonight Emma wore a fitted charcoal-gray wool dress with a high round neck. The skirt was straight and ended just below the knees. Her mid-heel shoes matched the dress exactly. They were a beautiful suede. Her only jewelry was her wedding ring\u2014she\u2019d never taken it off after Daniel died\u2014and a jeweled broach in the shape of a hummingbird. Standing next to her, Olivia felt like a hobo.</p><p>She straightened her sweater and said, \u201cI should have taken the time to put on a dress, but I had only just changed out of my clothes from work when you called.\u201d She realized she was making excuses and paused. \u201cI should have changed out of these jeans at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine, dear. You worry too much, but then you always have been a worrier. Come sit and we\u2019ll have dinner.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. Two fudge bars and a grape Popsicle had dampened it. Olivia loved junk food, mostly freezing-cold junk food. It was a dark secret only her friends knew about. The cold had soothed the sores in her mouth after the chemotherapy, and ever since, she craved the icy sweet comfort. Half of her freezer was stuffed with Dove bars, Fudgsicles, Popsicles, and various flavors of ice cream. The other half was reserved for Mary\u2019s healthy casserole dishes.</p><p>Tonight, Mary had prepared a roast turkey with root vegetables for dinner. She entered the dining room with a large platter and held it for Olivia to serve herself. Olivia didn\u2019t want to hear Mary tell her she was too thin and needed to put some meat on her bones, as she had often done in the past, so she took a portion of everything and said, \u201cThis smells wonderful.\u201d</p><p>After Mary returned to the kitchen, Emma said, \u201cCatch me up. What have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>Having sex with Grayson, thinking about ha**ng s*x with Grayson, and having more sex with Grayson. Emma would be horrified if Olivia blurted out those thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some research on a few of the names connected to Eric Jorguson.\u201d She then explained who and why, and when she was finished, Emma asked several questions.</p><p>\u201cIt was a wasted effort,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cAside from the fact that I made myself sick reading all the awful things these monsters have done, I couldn\u2019t find anything that might help Agent Huntsman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure out who shot me. And work has been busy.\u201d She put her fork down and talked a bit about her job.</p><p>Emma asked, \u201cWhat about your father? What have you done about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sort of put him on the back burner . . . it\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWord has gotten out that I\u2019m trying to stop him and . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t finish her sentence. Time for some honesty, she decided. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing Grayson,\u201d she began.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t seem surprised. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear. You were explaining why you\u2019ve put your larcenous father on the back burner,\u201d she reminded.</p><p>Olivia felt cowardly because she didn\u2019t want to admit to her aunt that she feared the repercussions of the truth, that when it all came out and her father was arrested and charged, life would change dramatically. There was going to be such anger, such hate, and it would all be directed at her family. Her father would be safe behind bars and probably become a celebrity with the other prisoners because of his oh-so-clever scams, but the rest of them would be fair game for the press and for all those people who had lost their life savings. Even though Olivia knew it had to be done, she dreaded what was coming.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young man sitting in a jail cell waiting to go to trial for a crime your father committed,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>Olivia was surprised. \u201cJeff Wilcox? Why is he in jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was arrested. The prosecutors feel they have enough to convict him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the court set bail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they\u2019ve revoked it. I asked Mitchell to check into it, and he says they\u2019re trying to force Jeff into making a deal, but he\u2019s refused, and so they\u2019ve come up with some excuse to keep him in jail until his court date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell Kaplan is one of my attorneys. He\u2019s also a financial adviser and a dear friend. I believe you\u2019ve met him.\u201d</p><p>If she did, she didn\u2019t remember. \u201cIs he representing Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jeff\u2019s attorney is Howard Asher. Mitchell said he\u2019s a deal maker. That\u2019s all Asher does, make deals, and ninety-nine percent of them are bad deals. He\u2019ll do anything to stay out of court. Mitchell told me that Asher doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. A public defender would have been a better choice. Jeff doesn\u2019t have the resources to fight this. He doesn\u2019t have any income, and his poor wife is at home trying to hold on until this is all sorted out.\u201d She stared at Olivia a long minute and then said, \u201cAnd you, young lady, are just the one to sort this all out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more back burner . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cI feel responsible for what\u2019s happened to Jeff. Your father used Jeff\u2019s friendship with me to get close to him. Did you know, if it does go to trial, your father is going to testify against Jeff?\u201d</p><p>Olivia was beginning to feel the familiar tightness in the pit of her stomach again. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father won\u2019t want it to go to trial. It would bring too much attention to him, and heaven forbid, his attorneys might not be able to keep his records hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, my focus is back where it should be.\u201d</p><p>Focus. That was the word of the week. Grayson had told her he needed focus. She did, too. He\u2019d also told her he felt as though he could be missing something because he hadn\u2019t been giving the investigation his full attention. She\u2019d distracted him. Now she felt the same way. She had allowed Grayson to distract her from her investigation into her father\u2019s dealings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help,\u201d Emma continued. \u201cMitchell Kaplan is one of the best attorneys in the country, and investment fraud is a specialty. He\u2019s agreed to take this case on, but you have to hire him. Mitchell made me promise that I would step back from this. He believes if my financial assets are in any way connected to this, your father will try to attach them.\u201d</p><p>Olivia agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s been trying to get your money into his Trinity Fund for a long time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s a love/hate relationship between us, but the fact is, there has never been any love.\u201d Emma pushed her plate aside and, sitting back in her chair, folded her hands on the table. With a steady voice of authority she said, \u201cI have an unwritten agreement with Mitchell, but you need to give him a small retainer. After this is all over, I\u2019ll transfer money into your account to pay his full fee. I can\u2019t do that now, though, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could come back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably will anyway, dear, but it\u2019s best not to have a paper trail leading to my door. I also want you to give Jeff\u2019s wife a check, enough to make ends meet. Do you have enough to do that?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. And if she ran out of money before this was sorted out, she would take out another mortgage on her apartment. Whatever it took, she would make things right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need to go see Jeff as soon as possible, before any deals are made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a check over to Mitchell on your way. I\u2019ll give you his card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Saturday,\u201d she reminded. \u201cWill he be in his office?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he will, and he\u2019s expecting you at ten o\u2019clock. You could messenger the check over, but I\u2019d like you to meet him, and he certainly wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask why. \u201cWhat about Jeff? Does he know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd the answer is no. You\u2019re going to have to explain it all to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a MacKenzie. How am I going to get him to trust me?\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p> <p>TWENTY</p><p>For Olivia, Saturday started at four thirty in the morning with a call from a police station across town.</p><p>The officer on duty apologized for the early hour. \u201cJudge Bowen told me to call you. We have a little girl here who needs protection . . . your kind of protection. The judge doesn\u2019t want her in the system. It has something to do with a trial that\u2019s coming up,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe said you\u2019d help the child disappear for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness for GPS, or she never would have found the police station. The paperwork didn\u2019t take as long as usual because the judge had already signed the order. By eight o\u2019clock she had nine-year-old Lily Jackson settled in her new, though temporary, home.</p><p>When she got in her car and checked her phone, there was a message from Mitchell Kaplan moving their meeting to eleven. Olivia was thankful for the extra time. She drove back to her apartment, showered, and changed into a dark blue dress. She left her hair down but used a barrette to keep it out of her face, then put on her earrings and watch. Since there was still a little time to spare, she went through her briefcase again to make absolutely certain she had all the necessary papers for Jeff. She\u2019d already written her check to Mitchell Kaplan and tucked it in her purse, along with another one for Jeff Wilcox\u2019s wife.</p> <p>Coat and scarf on, she headed out. The elevator doors opened, and there stood Grayson. She was so surprised to see him, she froze, but only for a second or two. She stepped into the elevator and pressed the button to the garage.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Not very original, but it was the best she could do.</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t look happy to see her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he pushed the button to stop the elevator. \u201cI said, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErrands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She didn\u2019t shout the word, but she wanted to. Instead, she pushed his hand away from the buttons. \u201cRonan told me you\u2019ve been paying for my bodyguards, and I want you to know I\u2019m going to reimburse you for every dollar you spent, but, Grayson, you really should have told me what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep you safe, no matter how much you fight me,\u201d he countered. He nudged her chin up so she would look him in the eye and said, \u201cDamn it, Olivia. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>She thought he was going to kiss her, but he suddenly stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI am safe,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd, of course, I\u2019m being cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you cautious when the elevator doors opened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually have my pepper spray at the ready,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cUsually?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deceptively soft, a bad sign she recognized from past experience. Grayson was about to lecture the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cPush the button to the garage. I have an appointment I can\u2019t miss.\u201d</p><p>He started to argue, then changed his mind and pushed the button to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst to an attorney\u2019s office, then to jail.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell Kaplan was going to be a godsend for Jeff Wilcox. Olivia had taken time the night before to look up some of his cases and was impressed. Kaplan\u2019s adversaries called him a barracuda, and that was exactly what Jeff needed.</p><p>His nickname certainly didn\u2019t fit his appearance. Kaplan reminded her of a teddy bear. He was short, a bit round in the middle, and wore thick wire-rimmed glasses. He was also soft-spoken and reserved. Although Olivia and Grayson spent only a short time with the attorney, they both liked him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they holding Wilcox?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wilcox has been held close to his home in Fairhaven. It\u2019s a decent facility, but I had my assistant check this morning before I sent you there to talk to him, and I learned that last night he was moved to Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ninety miles from here. Wilcox won\u2019t last long there.\u201d</p><p>Kaplan nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they move him?\u201d Olivia asked, and then before Grayson or Kaplan could explain, she asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t he last long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairhaven is to a country club what Beaumont is to Attica,\u201d Grayson explained.</p><p>\u201cMy assistant was told he was moved because of overcrowding. It\u2019s a game they\u2019re playing, trying to force Mr. Wilcox to take the deal he\u2019s been offered. There are serious charges, and I\u2019m sure the federal prosecutor would like to save the taxpayer the expense of a trial.\u201d</p><p>Kaplan went over the documents he was sending with Olivia and then said, \u201cPlease tell Mr. Wilcox I\u2019ll get the ball rolling right away to get him released, but I can\u2019t do anything until he signs the paper retaining my services. I\u2019ll plan on being at the jail to see him later today. By now I imagine Mr. Wilcox is feeling beat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be able to get him out of there today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kaplan nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll be under house arrest, but he\u2019ll be home.\u201d</p><p>Olivia handed him an envelope containing the retainer check and pulled the other envelope from her purse. \u201cWould you see that he gets this, as well?\u201d she asked. When Kaplan gave her a questioning look, she continued, \u201cIt will help his family get through the next couple of months,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Smiling, Kaplan took the envelope. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Olivia thanked him and was walking out the door with Grayson at her side when Kaplan said, \u201cMr. Wilcox\u2019s useless attorney is meeting with him late this afternoon. I\u2019d try to get there before he does.\u201d</p><p>Once they were out in the hallway, Olivia whispered to Grayson, \u201cThis is going to sound really paranoid. The deal that\u2019s being pushed on Wilcox\u2014I\u2019ve got a feeling my father has something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt does sound paranoid, but I\u2019m not dismissing the possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Wilcox\u2019s inept attorney has made a deal of his own to pressure Wilcox to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would make the deal? Your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimmons,\u201d she suggested. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my father\u2019s attorneys. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past him, and he and my father would have good reasons not to want this to go to trial. Kaplan would bring them into it, and there goes my father\u2019s low profile.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she clipped her seat belt in place, she said, \u201cI\u2019m nervous about meeting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilcox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Wilcox,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll remember me, but as soon as he hears my last name, he\u2019ll probably spit in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen. Start with \u2018I\u2019m going to get you out of here,\u2019 and I guarantee he\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop him from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does anything to you, I\u2019ll coldcock him.\u201d</p><p>As much as she hated to admit it to herself, she was glad he was so protective. \u201cCan you take the time to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasketball camp all day with Patrick. As long as I\u2019m back by eight tonight, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a date.\u201d</p><p>Her reaction was instantaneous. She felt as though he\u2019d just coldcocked her and immediately recognized that she was being illogical. She wanted him to move on, so shouldn\u2019t she be happy that he had a date?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d She tried to sound pleased, but her voice betrayed her, coming out raspy, as though she\u2019d just gargled vinegar.</p><p>Grayson pulled onto the highway. \u201cTraffic isn\u2019t bad. It shouldn\u2019t take us all that long to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just meet this woman, or is she someone you\u2019ve known for a while?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cMaking conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had a date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say \u2018That\u2019s nice\u2019 again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just . . .\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cMaking conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Where are you going?\u201d She hurriedly added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, unless you want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthday . . .\u201d The light dawned. \u201cOh no, you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He started to laugh. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson, we talked about this. You\u2019re going to my father\u2019s birthday party? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d She knew she sounded like a petulant child.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why didn\u2019t you say something sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did say . . .\u201d She realized he was teasing her. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201d</p><p>She looked out the side window while she tried to put into words what she was feeling. \u201cI\u2019m related to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, we all have at least one family member we\u2019d rather not be related to,\u201d he said. His brother immediately came to mind.</p><p>\u201cJust one? I\u2019ve got a plethora.\u201d</p><p>Had she not sounded sincere, he would have laughed again. \u201cI want to see him at work.\u201d</p><p>At work? She thought about it for a minute and understood. \u201cYes, he will be working, dazzling people. He\u2019ll make sure everyone loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Because of what your father did to you. She remembered Grayson saying those very words to her. He knew what Robert MacKenzie was all about. He couldn\u2019t be swayed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be working. Did it bother you when I said I had a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d It was an outrageous lie, and she was pretty sure he knew it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we go out on a real date\u2014and we will be going out on a real date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cOnce I\u2019m convinced we have the right man behind bars and it\u2019s safe out there for you, we should celebrate.\u201d</p><p>She started to object but changed her mind. What could one date hurt? A celebration date, nothing more. \u201cYes, okay. One date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to wear the white dress you\u2019ve told me about. You\u2019ve made me very curious to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that. My coveted, one-of-a-kind white dress? If I were to wear the dress, there would be rules you\u2019d have to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike no red wine. And you couldn\u2019t eat any pasta with red sauce. Now that I think about it, I should probably give you a list of what you could and couldn\u2019t eat. Maybe it would be better if you didn\u2019t eat at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually fling my food around when I eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne tiny little splat, and the dress is ruined,\u201d she warned. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage, 1960. It can\u2019t be replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking you out to dinner and not eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I could wear a raincoat.\u201d</p><p>He whistled and shook his head. \u201cThat dress must be something else.\u201d</p><p>The banter was fun, and Olivia was beginning to relax, but her lighthearted mood changed with a phone call. Her sister wanted to harass her one last time to make Emma attend the birthday party. Natalie had blocked her phone number on the display so that Olivia would answer the call.</p><p>Olivia denied Natalie\u2019s request yet again, but her sister was not ready to end the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know that all of us have suites at the Morgan Hotel. Mom and Dad are in the presidential suite, and George and I are in a smaller suite on the same floor. The top floor, of course,\u201d Natalie bragged.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cYou and George made a lot of money with your Internet company, honest money,\u201d she qualified, \u201cand you never acted like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Like a greedy fool, she silently answered, but since she didn\u2019t want a fight, she didn\u2019t say it aloud. \u201cIs there something else you want, Natalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother would like you to stop by before the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she can drag me along? No, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Natalie exploded. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself? You should be,\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re so damned selfish.\u201d</p><p>And on she went. Olivia held the phone away from her ear and waited for the rant to end. She knew Grayson could hear every word. The people in the Ford Explorer in the next lane could probably hear.</p><p>Turning to him, Olivia quietly said, \u201cI just realized I haven\u2019t had anything to eat since last night. I had to get up at four thirty, and by the time I got back to the apartment, I was in too much of a hurry. Think we could stop for a bagel or something?\u201d</p><p>Natalie had gone into warp speed, screeching. The more she ranted, the louder she got.</p><p>\u201cYou left your apartment at four thirty? What the hell for?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>Great. Now she was going to have shouting in both ears. \u201cIt was closer to four forty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes a big difference. Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>Olivia started to answer, but Natalie\u2019s voice had just gone up another decibel. She was demanding to know if Olivia knew she was such a bitch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she told Grayson before putting her phone back to her ear. \u201cYes, Natalie. I do know I\u2019m a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Warp-speed screaming again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for an explanation,\u201d Grayson reminded, ignoring her sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cI drove across town to a police station to pick up a nine-year-old little girl. She\u2019s a new client,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cWhich police station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all of them. Which one was it?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell him because the station was located in such a bad area, and she knew he wouldn\u2019t take the news well. He coaxed it out of her, though. Thankfully, Grayson was neither a screamer nor a screecher. She couldn\u2019t imagine him ever behaving like her sister. Grayson\u2019s voice was soft but firm. Sometimes he could be downright scary, but he was never scary with her. Angry, yes\u2014scary, no. He always got his point across, and when he was displeased with her, she knew it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her if she knew she was crazy\u2014that was a Natalie move\u2014but his look suggested he thought she might be.</p> <p>Olivia put her phone to her ear again and, interrupting her sister\u2019s tirade, said, \u201cGood-bye, Natalie.\u201d She took great delight in ending the call.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night . . . What would you have done if your car had broken down?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay in the car, keep the doors locked, and call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d call me?\u201d</p><p>That took a little wind out of his anger. \u201cI\u2019d also call for a tow. Now, can we please stop and get something to eat? We should probably find a drive-through. I want to get there before Wilcox\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>At her insistence, they stopped at a McDonald\u2019s. She ate a chicken wrap and drank a Diet Coke and told Grayson it was delicious.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to make you happy,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>She smiled as she sipped the last of her Coke. \u201cI\u2019m a simple girl at heart,\u201d she said. Carefully folding the wrapper and napkin so that no crumbs would fall, she placed them in the paper bag.</p><p>\u201cHave you figured out what you\u2019re going to say to Wilcox?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She had given some thought to the conversation, but she couldn\u2019t know how Wilcox would react to seeing her. Would he remember her? Would he freak out when he heard her name? She practiced a couple of approaches on Grayson and was feeling pretty good about her plan . . . until she walked into the jail. She was immediately sorry she\u2019d eaten anything because her stomach started doing flips. The rancid smell of what she suspected to be rotting mice in the walls was overwhelming, and everything looked old and decayed. The few pieces of furniture were broken-down and ready for the dump. Grayson told her the jail was going to be closed just as soon as a new facility was finished, but with budget cuts, no one knew exactly when that would be.</p><p>The air in the cell block was heavy with sweat. The cells were so crowded, there was barely room to walk around. A jailer with dark circles under his eyes and a weariness to his gait led Jeff Wilcox into a small interrogation room. Wilcox sat on one side of a small wobbly table. He looked scared and overwhelmed.</p><p>He saw Grayson\u2019s FBI badge and said, \u201cAm I being charged with mail fraud, too?\u201d His voice was flat, with little emotion.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grayson answered.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t my attorney be here for this interrogation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an interrogation. We\u2019re having a conversation,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Wilcox was focused on Grayson and was obviously afraid of him or possibly what he thought he was going to hear from the FBI agent. Olivia had time to study the man. The longer she watched him, the angrier she became on his behalf. She was seeing one of her father\u2019s victims up close and personal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to fire your attorney,\u201d Grayson said very matter-of-factly. He stood next to Olivia with his arms folded across his chest, his stance relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Grayson looked at Olivia. \u201cDo you want to start explaining?\u201d</p><p>Jeff Wilcox turned to face her then, and his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jeff,\u201d she began. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember me. I\u2019m Olivia\u2014\u201d</p><p>He almost came out of his chair. \u201cMacKenzie,\u201d he finished. \u201cI remember you.\u201d His demeanor changed immediately to anger. \u201cYou\u2019re that bastard\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cListen carefully. Yes, I\u2019m that bastard\u2019s daughter, and I know what he is. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d She rushed to continue before he could turn away from her. \u201cYou have a new attorney. His name is Mitchell Kaplan. Have you heard of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I have. He\u2019s famous. I can\u2019t afford . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying for his services,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cDid he agree to take my case? Does he know what I\u2019ve been charged with?\u201d</p><p>Before Olivia could answer, he listed them. \u201cInvestment fraud, securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, and my attorney says, if I take the deal, they won\u2019t add mail fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the deal?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five years. Solid twenty-five years.\u201d He put his head in his hands. \u201cI swear to God I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I swear it, but my attorney said that, given the atmosphere, the prosecutor could add another twenty and get it.\u201d</p><p>She thought he might start crying. Who could blame him? She put her briefcase on the chair across from him, pulled out a manila folder, and placed it in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re innocent, and I know what you\u2019re up against. Mr. Kaplan has written you a letter. Please read it, and then if you agree, sign the attached paper authorizing him to take over your defense. You can either choose to let Kaplan prove your innocence or . . . not. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>She could see the confusion in his eyes. He wanted to believe but was afraid.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to help me?\u201d</p><p>Tears came into her eyes. \u201cI told you why,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. \u201cI know what he is, and he has to be stopped. I would like your help to do that, but even if you can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, I\u2019ll still keep trying until I succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the letter,\u201d Grayson suggested.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know this is real?\u201d He looked at Olivia and said, \u201cYour father showed me investment statements on official letterheads, and it was all a fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the letter, Wilcox,\u201d Grayson repeated more firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.\u201d</p><p>His hands shook as he opened the envelope. Olivia\u2019s hands were shaking, too. She hadn\u2019t realized how anxious she\u2019d been about this meeting. She felt as though she\u2019d just put herself through a wringer. Her nerves were stretched tight, and she could only imagine how Jeff was feeling.</p><p>Jeff looked up from the page he was reading. \u201cMr. Kaplan says he\u2019ll have me out of here by tonight. Can he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he says he can, then he can,\u201d Olivia replied. \u201cYou\u2019ll be under house arrest, but you\u2019ll be home with your wife and your baby.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was starting to believe. She could see it in his eyes. She watched him go through the rest of the folder, scouring every page.</p><p>\u201cThere are copies of all these papers for you to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo either of you have a pen?\u201d</p><p>Jeff signed two papers, one firing his current attorney, Howard Asher, and another retaining Mitchell Kaplan.</p><p>He\u2019d just handed the papers back to Olivia when Asher walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Asher wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. Because Olivia had heard how inept the man was, she had made the assumption that he was young and inexperienced and perhaps had only just passed the bar. Asher was in his late thirties or early forties. He was dressed in a business suit and tie, but there was still something disheveled about him. She noticed the expensive Rolex watch he was wearing when he reached out to shake Jeff\u2019s hand.</p><p>She decided he was also sleazy when he wouldn\u2019t stop giving her the once-over. Her chest and legs seemed to captivate him.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you,\u201d Jeff said, reaching out with the signed document in his hand.</p><p>Asher was still staring at Olivia when he asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA paper I signed, firing you,\u201d Jeff answered.</p><p>That got his attention. He whirled around and snatched the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about? You need an attorney, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell Kaplan will be handling my defense.\u201d</p><p>Asher\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cKaplan? You can\u2019t afford Mitchell Kaplan. You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Kaplan has agreed to represent me.\u201d</p><p>Asher shook his head. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to prove it. You\u2019re fired. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Asher stammered. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a deal.\u201d</p><p>Jeff looked to Olivia for help.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re in trouble, Mr. Asher,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause Jeff hasn\u2019t agreed to any deals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly who did you make this deal with?\u201d Grayson wanted to know.</p><p>Asher looked as though he needed to sit. His face was gray. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. How did you ever get Kaplan interested . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re done here,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWait . . . now, wait here,\u201d Asher demanded. \u201cJeff, you\u2019ll get fifty years or more if you don\u2019t take the deal. You can\u2019t take this to trial. You\u2019ll get . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped arguing when Jeff put his hand up. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any deals, and you\u2019re no longer my attorney.\u201d</p><p>Grayson could see the panic in Asher\u2019s eyes. The attorney had gotten past his surprise and was now letting his anger control him. His body was rigid and his hands were fisted at his sides.</p><p>\u201cJeff, it\u2019s time to go back to your cell,\u201d Grayson said as he motioned to the jailer.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Asher demanded. \u201cJust wait a minute. We\u2019re not finished here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are finished,\u201d Olivia stated emphatically.</p><p>Asher turned to her and took a threatening step forward. Grayson pulled Olivia into his side.</p><p>\u201cListen, you,\u201d Asher muttered, \u201cgo back to your boss and tell him we\u2019ve already made the deal and it\u2019s solid. It\u2019s done. Kaplan will just have to step back.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had had it. She took a step toward Asher and said, \u201cNo, you listen. There isn\u2019t any deal. Got that? No deal. And, by the way, I don\u2019t work for Mitchell Kaplan.\u201d</p><p>Asher was obviously scrambling to keep his sinking ship afloat. His eyes darted back and forth between Jeff and Olivia while he tried to think of a way to stop what was happening.</p><p>The jailer escorted Jeff out of the interrogation room. Asher didn\u2019t move. He seemed rooted to the floor, he was so livid. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing here, but you\u2019re messing with the wrong people,\u201d he hissed. \u201cPowerful people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I know exactly who I\u2019m messing with,\u201d she replied. Her voice was as smooth as a summer breeze. \u201cAllow me to introduce myself. My name is Olivia MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her briefcase and walked to the door. Grayson pulled it open for her. She looked back over her shoulder and said, \u201cTell my father I\u2019ll see him in court.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Grayson arrived at the Morgan Hotel a little after nine o\u2019clock. He noticed all the security as soon as he walked inside. Because he\u2019d worn a gun\u2014he never left home without it\u2014he had to show his credentials three separate times before he reached the guarded ballroom doors.</p><p>Ronan caught up with him as he was going in.</p><p>\u201cWait up,\u201d he called. He showed his identification to another guard and started to walk past. The guard reached out and put his hand on Ronan\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you have an invitation? I don\u2019t see one. You can\u2019t go inside without an invitation. There\u2019s some very important people in there.\u201d</p><p>One glacial look from Ronan, and the guard immediately pulled his hand back. The antagonism in his voice irritated Ronan. \u201cI\u2019m FBI. I can go wherever the hell I want to go. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The guard hastily opened the door and stepped away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met MacKenzie,\u201d he reminded. \u201cYou interviewed him, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ronan grinned. \u201cOf course I remember, but that was one-on-one, and I want to see what he\u2019s like in a crowd. I\u2019m betting he\u2019s as humble as he was with me. He\u2019s a real nice guy,\u201d he added. \u201cJust ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>His sarcasm wasn\u2019t lost on Grayson. \u201cYeah, right. Nice guy. Olivia\u2019s worried I\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p><p>Ronan shook his head. \u201cDid you tell her we put a lot of nice guys in prison every damn day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I did.\u201d</p><p>The two agents moved to the back of the room and tried not to draw any attention as they watched the guests.</p><p>Four bars were set up, one in each corner, and people thronged around them as the bartenders rushed to fill their drink orders. Waiters passed among the crowd, offering dainty canap\u00e9s or glasses of wine from their silver trays. The double doors to the adjacent ballroom were open, and there were stations with every kind of delicacy to eat. The best of everything. Guests were encouraged to help themselves to whatever they wanted.</p><p>A man walked past carrying a heaping plate piled with oysters, crackers, and a mound of caviar. The glutton was practically drooling in anticipation of his feast.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how these people would react if they knew they were paying for this,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be real pissed when they find out they paid for his mansion on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. No expense spared tonight. Do you know how much a bottle of that champagne costs?\u201d he asked when a waiter offered fluted glasses to a couple in front of them.</p><p>\u201cI drink beer, not champagne, but I\u2019m guessing a whole lot.\u201d</p><p>Grayson laughed. \u201cYes, a whole lot. It tastes like seawater, too.\u201d</p><p>Grayson spotted Olivia\u2019s brother-in-law, George, and pointed him out. There was a woman next to him, smiling and sipping champagne. She didn\u2019t look anything like Olivia, but Grayson was sure she was her sister because she was holding George\u2019s hand and occasionally smiling at him. Grayson thought the affection looked forced. George appeared to be miserable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wonder if he paid the loan shark back,\u201d Ronan remarked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the look on his face, I\u2019m guessing, no. Is that his wife with him? She\u2019s pretty. There\u2019s a small resemblance to Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d But then he knew what a witch Natalie was to her sister.</p> <p>It took a lot to surprise Grayson, but he nearly did a double take when he saw who walked in the door.</p><p>\u201cOlivia and I went to see one of MacKenzie\u2019s victims today,\u201d he told Ronan. He then explained everything that had happened with Jeff Wilcox.</p><p>Ronan was impressed that Mitchell Kaplan had taken the case. \u201cThe prosecutor won\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Grayson shrugged. \u201cAsher\u2019s reaction was telling. He went into a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis reaction to getting fired? From what I know about him, he\u2019s got to be used to it. I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s a terrible attorney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look into his finances. I think he was paid to make the deal and put Wilcox away. The last thing Robert MacKenzie wants is a trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking MacKenzie paid Asher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Not directly, of course. The guy\u2019s one shrewd son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to prove that Asher even knows MacKenzie,\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>Grayson smiled. \u201cNot that tough. Asher just walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Showing up here . . . not real bright. I\u2019ll get some pictures of him with MacKenzie. I\u2019m gonna have to use my cell phone,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t let MacKenzie see me do it. Where\u2019s Asher now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the bar on the left. He\u2019s gulping down whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, Asher has had one hell of a day. He must need courage before he talks to MacKenzie. Real stupid to talk to him here, though. Speaking of the devil, there he is. The birthday boy. I\u2019ll see what I can do about pictures.\u201d</p><p>The crowd had parted, and Grayson had a clear view of Robert MacKenzie. He was standing by the French doors to the terrace, surrounded by well-wishers. His wife stood just behind him. There was no doubt who the stunning woman was, for Olivia was her spitting image.</p><p>Grayson dismissed her and focused on MacKenzie. The man was quite the showman. He had an easy smile and a charming way about him. Self-confidence oozed from his pores. Grayson watched him closely and decided that what made him so charismatic wasn\u2019t just his handsome looks or his personality but the way he interacted with other people. It was a talent really. His gaze never left the person he was talking to. He didn\u2019t once glance to the left or the right. His concentration couldn\u2019t be broken. If he were talking or listening to a woman, he added touch to his repertoire. He would pat her arm or clasp her hand, nodding sagely when the woman paused for a response, and all the while his eyes would be locked on hers. He appeared to be fascinated by whatever his companion was saying. His intelligent eyes reeked sincerity.</p><p>MacKenzie reminded Grayson of a sorcerer. He could be all things to all people. He made them feel as though they could whisper their secrets, and he alone would keep them safe. He didn\u2019t pretend to be God, just one of His agents.</p><p>How could they not trust him? Grayson was impressed. He was watching a master work the crowd, and because MacKenzie\u2019s guests were all so spellbound, they couldn\u2019t see what he really was.</p><p>MacKenzie used their greed to lure them in. He didn\u2019t go after all the wealthy people, just the ones who coveted more. There were plenty of rich, successful people who were prudent with their money, who used their wealth wisely and generously, but Robert MacKenzie knew how to weed them out. He went after those who were never satisfied. He understood their twisted and pathetic insecurity, and he pounced on it. He knew exactly how to snare them: You\u2019re a rich man now, but is it enough? And will it last? With your well-deserved, though admittedly lavish, lifestyle and with rampant inflation? No, of course it won\u2019t last. How could it? Can you envision what your life will be like when it\u2019s all gone? Do not worry, my friends. Give me your millions, and like a modern-day Midas, I\u2019ll double it . . . triple it . . . quadruple it.</p><p>He made them believers.</p> <p>And because they were the superrich, others wanted to emulate them. People who aspired to such wealth looked to these paragons of affluence for examples of what to do. The hopefuls believed the rich had an in, that they were in the know and understood the fluctuating market. If the man who signed their checks invested with MacKenzie\u2019s Trinity Fund, shouldn\u2019t they take their meager life savings and invest, too?</p><p>It was the domino effect, Grayson thought. From the top to the bottom, from the first to the last, they would all fall.</p><p>Drink in hand, Asher was weaving his way through the crowd to get to MacKenzie. When he reached him, he motioned to MacKenzie\u2019s wife and waited a few feet away. MacKenzie ignored him and everyone else until he finished his conversation, then, with a whispered word from his wife, he excused himself and joined Asher.</p><p>The attorney\u2019s forehead was beaded with sweat, and as he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the sweat away, he talked fast and furiously. Grayson waited to see how MacKenzie would react to Asher\u2019s bad news.</p><p>Had he not been watching so closely, he would have missed it. For a second or two, but certainly no longer, MacKenzie\u2019s expression cracked. Grayson saw real, raw anger. Then\u2014wham bam\u2014Mr. Nice Guy was back. Smiling broadly, he put his arm around Asher\u2019s shoulders. He looked like a man who couldn\u2019t have been happier to see an old friend and hear the latest news. MacKenzie was good, all right, a pro playing his role.</p><p>Grayson thought about Olivia and the hell she\u2019d endured from the time she was just a little older than Henry, and he suddenly wanted to smash his fist into MacKenzie\u2019s sparkling white teeth.</p><p>Ronan came back carrying a stemmed glass of ice water and a small digital camera. \u201cI got some great photos with this camera and my phone. I\u2019ve already sent a couple of them on to our computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the camera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confiscated it.\u201d He slipped the camera into his pocket and said, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Senator What\u2019s His Name?\u201d</p><p>Grayson nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a schmuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is.\u201d He lost sight of Asher and asked Ronan if he knew where he was.</p><p>They both spotted him at the same time. Asher was standing by the entrance, guzzling one last drink. He put the glass down and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that calling out to Asher?\u201d Ronan asked. \u201cI can\u2019t see his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>They watched Asher drag his feet as he crossed the ballroom. The man demanding his attention finally separated himself from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cCarl Simmons,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cWonder what MacKenzie\u2019s top attorney wants to chat with Asher about.\u201d He was grinning as he asked the foolish question. \u201cTalk about a schmuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Simmons is much worse than a schmuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got an alibi for the night of the shooting. While Olivia was taking three bullets, Simmons was with a woman. According to her, they were supposed to attend a party but decided to spend the night in bed instead. Of course, Simmons could have paid someone to shoot Olivia, so, yes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stays on the list.\u201d He pulled out the camera he\u2019d lifted and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get some shots of Asher with Simmons. Look how scared Asher is. Maybe I can capture that expression and show it to him when we pull him in.\u201d</p><p>Ronan left on his errand, but Grayson stayed where he was and kept his eyes on Simmons. The longer Asher talked to him, the more Simmons\u2019s outrage grew.</p><p>Olivia was going to get her security guard back whether she wanted it or not. Simmons\u2019s expression went way beyond anger, and Grayson knew his hate would be directed at her.</p><p>If Simmons was going to do something, it would be soon, and with that possibility in mind, Grayson called two bodyguards on his list and sent both of them to Olivia\u2019s apartment. One would stay outside her door, the other in the lobby.</p><p>He then phoned Olivia. Hell, what if she wasn\u2019t home? He took a breath when she answered.</p><p>\u201cIs your door locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson, where are you? I can barely hear you.\u201d</p><p>He walked into a back hallway. \u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you? I thought you were going to the birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the party . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him?\u201d</p><p>He could hear the anxiety. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it. You\u2019re staying in tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just leaving. Jane\u2019s back in the hospital, and I thought I\u2019d sit with her for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know you\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you won\u2019t have to call and tell her you\u2019re staying home.\u201d He told her about Asher and Simmons. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling Simmons is going to do something. The look on his face . . . he\u2019s going to come after you. Could be as soon as tonight. You have to stay home. Check your door and make sure the deadbolt is in place. I\u2019m sending over a couple of bodyguards, and I\u2019m going to come by as soon as I\u2019m finished here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in, no matter who it is. If your sister or your mother knocks on the door, don\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she insisted. \u201cStop worrying. I won\u2019t let anyone but you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one of your kids calls, you don\u2019t leave. You call me. I\u2019ll leave here in five and be at your apartment in fifteen. If you need to go, I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Her quick agreement pleased him. He checked the time, then went to find Ronan. He spotted Asher leaving the ballroom. The guy was practically jogging, he was in such a hurry to get away. Simmons was on his cell phone and followed Asher at a much slower pace. He wasn\u2019t paying any attention to where he was going and nearly knocked a waiter over.</p><p>Ronan came up behind Grayson. \u201cWant to say hello to the birthday boy?\u201d</p><p>Grayson smiled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that. Got to make it quick, though. I\u2019m going to stay with Olivia tonight. I\u2019ve got an uneasy feeling . . . probably nothing, but I want to hang around.\u201d</p><p>MacKenzie saw them coming. He had just blown out candles on a gigantic birthday cake amid cheers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the wife\u2019s name?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cDeborah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia looks like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you get a close look at her father. Same color eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRonan.\u201d MacKenzie said his name and extended his hand. \u201cGood to see you again. How is your investigation going? Have you arrested the man responsible for shooting my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ronan answered.</p><p>\u201cThen what brings you here?\u201d MacKenzie asked pleasantly. He looked at Grayson and then back to Ronan.</p><p>\u201cI heard it was your birthday, and I wanted to give my congratulations,\u201d Ronan responded.</p><p>Without so much as a blink, MacKenzie smiled broadly and said, \u201cI appreciate that. Please . . . have a drink and something to eat. Enjoy yourself.\u201d He paused and then turned to his wife. \u201cWhere are my manners. Deborah, this is Agent Ronan Conrad. He was assigned to our daughter\u2019s investigation.\u201d</p><p>She greeted Ronan with a warm smile. \u201cSuch a terrible ordeal, to get a phone call telling us our daughter had been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you rush to her side?\u201d Grayson asked the question.</p><p>Deborah looked at her husband, no doubt hoping he would answer.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible to go to our daughter,\u201d Robert answered. \u201cWe were in Florida at the time, and our schedule wouldn\u2019t permit deviation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s put us through such worry over the years,\u201d Deborah said. \u201cShe\u2019s been ill most of her life. Hasn\u2019t she, Robert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow inconsiderate of her,\u201d Ronan drawled.</p><p>Grayson didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to Deborah\u2019s comments, though he was seething inside.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m Agent Grayson Kincaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI,\u201d Robert told his wife.</p><p>Deborah\u2019s hand went to her throat. It was impossible not to notice the huge diamond ring she wore. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you working on the investigation with Ronan?\u201d Robert asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m also a friend of Olivia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know . . .\u201d Deborah began.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Grayson asked when she hesitated and looked to her husband again.</p><p>Robert answered. \u201cHow fragile our daughter is.\u201d He suddenly looked quite sad. \u201cMentally fragile. She\u2019s been through so much . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd put you through so much, Robert,\u201d Deborah reminded him.</p><p>He showed a flash of impatience for being interrupted and then a quick nod. \u201cYes, she has.\u201d</p><p>Grayson couldn\u2019t be quiet any longer. \u201cDo you mean when she was in the chemotherapy unit? Was that when she put you two through so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see she\u2019s talked to you about her past,\u201d Deborah said. Her voice had taken on a hard edge.</p><p>\u201cShe had you to comfort her when she was going through that hell, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Once again Deborah deferred to her husband who said, \u201cThe poor thing. She does tend to exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExaggerate what? The side effects?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as she tells people,\u201d Deborah explained. \u201cShe\u2019s got quite the active imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you did stay with her while she was going through the chemo? She was just a child, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, neither one of us stayed with her. It just wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d Deborah explained.</p><p>\u201cThen how do you know that Olivia exaggerated?\u201d Ronan asked the question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the time or the place for this conversation,\u201d Deborah said. She was angry and opened her mouth to say something more, but her husband stopped her by putting his hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This isn\u2019t the time,\u201d Grayson agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were explaining that Olivia has become mentally fragile,\u201d Ronan reminded Robert.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed she has. It\u2019s not her fault,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe love her dearly, don\u2019t we, Deborah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, of course we do. We would have loved to have had her here tonight to celebrate with us, but we couldn\u2019t dare include her. She\u2019s so unpredictable we couldn\u2019t risk a scene and watch her embarrass herself.\u201d</p><p>Robert looked almost sympathetic. \u201cIt\u2019s all those poisonous drugs she\u2019s taken over the years. They\u2019ve made her paranoid. She really can\u2019t help how she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow exactly is she?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cShe makes up the most bizarre stories,\u201d Robert said. \u201cAnd no matter how outrageous they are, she can\u2019t let them go. Olivia needs medical attention and a safe environment. As her parent it\u2019s my responsibility to see that she gets it.\u201d</p><p>Grayson smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d better not let Olivia hear you talk about her like that, or she\u2019ll never come see you in prison.\u201d</p><p>With those parting words Grayson and Ronan left the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cHe pretty much spelled it out, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Ronan said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s laying the groundwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon do you think they\u2019ll come for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. Maybe tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch is gonna lock her away somewhere, keep her drugged so she can\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what\u2019s worse? That son of a bitch is her father.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p> <p>Grayson arrived at Olivia\u2019s apartment with his gym bag in hand and announced that he was staying over.</p><p>\u201cYou went home and packed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI always keep clean clothes and a shaving kit in the trunk of my car.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she followed him into the living room. \u201cFor sleepovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for the gym,\u201d he patiently explained. He dropped the bag on the chair.</p><p>He wanted to pull her into his arms, but he wouldn\u2019t let himself. It took all the willpower he could muster not to kiss her sweet lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping here tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll take the sofa,\u201d he answered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, bewildered. \u201cI think you\u2019d better explain what happened at the birthday party, and if you tell me my father\u2019s your new golf buddy, you\u2019re sleeping on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, sweetheart . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, trying not to be worried. Grayson couldn\u2019t be fooled. Her father couldn\u2019t charm him.</p><p>Grayson looked into her eyes for several seconds, then said, \u201cYour parents are god-awful people.\u201d</p><p>She was thrilled. She threw her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s about the nicest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang. He took her hand and led her into her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said. He was reaching for his gun as he left the room and pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long. A minute later Grayson told her she could come out, and she emerged to find Ronan removing his coat. He tossed it on the back of a chair near the door, lifted a gun out of the back of his waistband, and handed it to Grayson. \u201cI thought you might need some extra firepower. Never know. There are more clips in my coat pockets.\u201d</p><p>Grayson turned to Olivia. \u201cRonan\u2019s going to hang out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Instead of asking why, she simply said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and waited for one of them to start talking. Her patience quickly ran out when neither of them spoke. Hands on her hips, she said, \u201cExactly what are you boys expecting to happen here? A shootout on the third floor? I\u2019ll tell you right now, Mrs. Delaney won\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cMrs. Delaney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tyrant in three-ten,\u201d Grayson answered. \u201cShe makes Olivia do her grocery shopping for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not make me grocery shop. I just pick up a few things for her now and then . . . that isn\u2019t important now. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Ronan asked Grayson.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Grayson told her about the party and his conversation with her parents. By the time he\u2019d finished, Olivia had dropped down on the sofa and was speechless.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be taking this pretty well,\u201d Ronan remarked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Grayson said. Then he started counting. \u201cFive, four, three, two . . .\u201d</p><p>She bounded to her feet with a roar. Grayson smiled. \u201cThere it is,\u201d he told Ronan.</p><p>\u201cHow dare he! If Carl Simmons comes through my door and invades my home, I want you to shoot him, Grayson. You can shoot him, too, Ronan. No, I\u2019ll do it. Ronan, give me a gun, and I\u2019ll shoot him. I\u2019ll be doing the world a favor. That snake, that creepy slimeball, that . . .\u201d She stopped sputtering for a second, searching for more names. \u201cThat no good . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a breath, sweetheart,\u201d Grayson suggested. She was starting to wheeze as she paced back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I need to calm down so I can think. That\u2019s what I need to do. That son of a . . . When do you think this will happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d Grayson took off his jacket and began to unbutton his shirtsleeves.</p><p>Olivia stopped in the middle of the room. It was really beginning to sink in, the lengths her adversaries would go to. \u201cYou really believe Simmons will bring men here to take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I believe. If you\u2019d seen the look on his face when Asher was talking to him, you\u2019d be a believer, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s in this, as well, Olivia,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cYou need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get out of these clothes,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Olivia widened her pacing trail from the sofa to the kitchen and back. On one of her trips she noticed another FBI gym bag on the floor outside her office. \u201cAre you staying over, too?\u201d she asked Ronan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Olivia walked into her kitchen. It was dark, and she stood in the shadows looking out the window, trying desperately to understand how it had come to this and how her father could justify what he was doing. She was suddenly overwhelmed with sadness. How could she miss what she never had?</p><p>Oh, snap out of it, she scolded. Feeling sorry for herself wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything. Besides, she had a family. She had Jane and Collins and Sam. They were her sisters. But as loving and supportive as they were, she had to admit she needed more. God help her, she needed Grayson in her life.</p><p>She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Concentrate on now. Don\u2019t worry about the future; just focus on tonight. Stop thinking like an outcast daughter and start thinking like a smart, strong, independent woman.</p><p>Pep talk over, she went back into the living room. Who would come to get her? How many would there be? And where did they think they would take her?</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Ronan was carrying his bag into the guest bathroom. He turned back and waited.</p><p>\u201cSimmons has to know I would never let him in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, trying not to smile. She was so earnest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? Simmons knows I\u2019ll be cautious, and I won\u2019t let just anyone in. He\u2019ll send someone I know, someone I\u2019ll open the door for. That no good . . .\u201d</p><p>And she was off on another tirade. Grayson came out of the bedroom just as she was winding down. He\u2019d changed into jeans and a shirt and had his gun and holster back on his hip. He was on his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d He ended the call and said, \u201cThat was Agent Huntsman. He\u2019s helping us out with Jeff Wilcox\u2019s old attorney, Asher. He said to tell you that you owe him one, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? Okay.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask what Huntsman was doing to help, Grayson said, \u201cYou were right, Ronan. Asher was going to try to disappear. He was getting in his car with a suitcase and files when they picked him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he being arrested, and if so, on what charges?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was taken in for questioning. No charges yet,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to explain where the twenty-thousand-dollar deposit came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat twenty thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the amount of cash deposited in Asher\u2019s account the day before he offered his services to Wilcox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that information so quickly?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cOur resources are extensive,\u201d Ronan explained.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you need a court order or a . . .\u201d She stopped when Grayson gave her the look. She was getting used to seeing that expression, the did-you-really-just-ask-that-question look.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She went into the kitchen and got a grape Popsicle from the freezer. She was about to tear the wrapper off when Grayson grabbed it from her.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to be distracted tonight.\u201d He put the Popsicle back in the freezer.</p><p>She followed him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to . . .\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean drive me nuts like you did with the last Popsicle?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI drove you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you did.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s good to hear you admit it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia realized there was nothing she could do now but wait. Grayson had taken his laptop into her office to write a report, and Ronan had turned on the television. She sat next to him and watched him channel surf. He settled on a station and leaned back when the news came on.</p><p>\u201cDoes Agent Huntsman know why you\u2019re here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he your superior?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a smile. \u201cNo, we just help each other out every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if Grayson\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t wrong. He\u2019s got this way of reading people. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. It\u2019s something he sees in their eyes maybe. He\u2019s saved our lives more than once. A couple of years ago we were called in to help on a case with Huntsman. There were five of us and an informant who had worked with Huntsman for over a year. Very trustworthy,\u201d he added. \u201cWe knew there was a deal going down, and we were waiting for the suspect to show up with his crew. We got there real early and had time to set up the ambush. We had a good two hours to wait. Anyway, Grayson\u2019s watching the informant talk to Huntsman, and he goes over to the two of them and chats for a minute, surely no longer. The informant\u2019s supposed to leave, but Grayson grabs him and puts him in cuffs. Then he tells all of us we have to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d she asked when he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t even take the time to explain, so we all hightail it out of that house. We\u2019re all in our cars down the street, parked behind an abandoned building, and we\u2019re waiting there for maybe ten minutes. No one\u2019s saying anything to Grayson, but I know Huntsman and the other agents are thinking, what the . . . has Grayson lost it? We\u2019ve got a major bust about to happen, and he\u2019s screwing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t thinking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I trusted his instinct. And about five minutes later the house blows up. And I mean blows. It was like a nuclear bomb went off. Even tore out the foundation. From that night on, Huntsman doesn\u2019t question Grayson. If he says he\u2019s got a feeling or he\u2019s read something in the guy\u2019s eyes or in the way he\u2019s behaving that none of us notice, we listen. Grayson would make a hell of a profiler,\u201d he added. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t interest him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight he saw Simmons\u2019s reaction to Asher\u2019s news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that was easy. Grayson said anyone with half a brain would know Simmons was going to do something crazy. You know those cartoon characters that have fire coming out of their eyes and ears when they get mad? According to Grayson, Simmons looked like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe compared him to a cartoon character?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe won\u2019t admit it, but I\u2019m pretty sure he watches cartoons with Henry.\u201d</p><p>Olivia imagined Grayson kicking back with his nephew and laughing at some juvenile TV show, and she got a warm feeling. No wonder she loved him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, he knew Simmons was going to do something because you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou really pissed him off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we chatted with your father, we knew what the plan was, especially after he said he was going to see that you were put somewhere safe. Grayson\u2019s convinced it\u2019ll happen tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas my mother with him?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cOf course she was. She never leaves his side if she can help it.\u201d</p><p>Grayson joined them. \u201cHuntsman\u2019s here with Larson. One will stay in the security room off the lobby watching the garage and the front entrance, and the other will watch the back steps. They won\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the floors are on closed-circuit,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI hope Simmons comes. I\u2019d love to sit down and have a chat.\u201d</p><p>Grayson shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll stay away and wait to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re coming here to kill me? Have you considered that possibility? Hide my body where it won\u2019t be found. Simmons would like that.\u201d</p><p>She saw the look on Grayson\u2019s face and went to him. She didn\u2019t care that Ronan was watching as she moved into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you ever again,\u201d Grayson stated with an unflinching resolve.</p><p>Olivia had just looked at the time on Grayson\u2019s watch\u2014it was straight up midnight\u2014when a knock sounded at her door. Then the doorbell rang.</p><p>Grayson motioned for Olivia to go into the kitchen. Both he and Ronan had their guns drawn. Ronan looked through the peephole. The only man visible was George Anderson, Olivia\u2019s brother-in-law.</p><p>The banging got louder. George shouted her name. \u201cCome on, Olivia. Open the door. I\u2019ve got to talk to you. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>It got quiet for a minute while George conferred with the men accompanying him, and then he started banging on the door again. \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident. Open the door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia could hear him, of course. She came out of the kitchen and shouted, \u201cAll right. I\u2019m opening the door. Hold on.\u201d She\u2019d tried to sound sleepy and thought she\u2019d done a good job. She stood there smiling over her performance until Grayson tilted his head toward the kitchen. Nodding, she went back to hide.</p><p>Ronan waited just inside the entrance to Olivia\u2019s study. Grayson opened the door and moved out of the line of sight.</p><p>There were two men with George. They knocked him to his knees as they pushed their way inside. They were in such a hurry they got halfway into the living room before they realized their target wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>George didn\u2019t wait around. He staggered to his feet and ran down the hall to the elevator, frantically hitting the button.</p> <p>The men Simmons had sent were big and looked like bodybuilders. Dressed alike in black pants and white shirts with identification cards clipped to their pockets, they were obviously trying to look like hospital orderlies. Damned scary orderlies who would give patients nightmares. One was bald and had an eagle tattoo on the back of his head; the other had a scar that cut into his chin. Tattoo held a gun, and Scar carried a small black bag.</p><p>Disarming the man with the gun came first. Grayson didn\u2019t waste time. He came up behind him and clipped him hard on the back of his neck. The hit didn\u2019t seem to faze him, but the barrel of Grayson\u2019s gun pressed against the face of the eagle got his attention.</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun,\u201d Grayson ordered.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re just here to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun.\u201d</p> <p>Ronan had his weapon pointed at Scar. \u201cShoot him,\u201d he told Grayson. \u201cWe only need to interrogate one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Tattoo heard the click of the weapon and quickly dropped his gun. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d he cried out.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, both men were handcuffed and sitting side by side at the kitchen table. They\u2019d been read their rights but thus far hadn\u2019t asked for a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this all wrong,\u201d Tattoo said.</p><p>They had been searched and their wallets were now on the table. Grayson found their drivers\u2019 licenses, read their names, and said to the tattooed man, \u201cWhere did we go wrong, Kline?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were sent here to get Miss MacKenzie and take her to Marydale Hospital, where she can get the treatment she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarydale is at least a hundred and fifty miles from here,\u201d Ronan pointed out.</p><p>Kline shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s where we were told to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you to take her?\u201d</p><p>The two men looked at each other. Then Kline said, \u201cI guess her doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>Grayson opened the black bag and held up two vials of a milky substance. \u201cWhat were you planning to do with these?\u201d</p><p>The other man, whose name was Vogel, answered. \u201cWe were going to sedate her because we were told she was violent.\u201d</p> <p>Grayson found a third vial in the bag. \u201cThere\u2019s enough here to put down a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know how much to give, or were you just going to guess?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cI knew about how much.\u201d Vogel was becoming defensive. \u201cAnd it was going to be a long drive. I didn\u2019t want her to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how much? You could have killed her.\u201d Grayson was trying to keep his temper under control. He was so furious, he wanted to throw both of them out the window.</p><p>\u201cI would have been careful,\u201d Vogel insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, then that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Vogel perked up. He obviously didn\u2019t understand sarcasm. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt her, but . . . you know . . . she\u2019s . . .\u201d The way Grayson was looking at him broke his concentration. He looked at Kline for help.</p><p>\u201cViolent,\u201d Kline whispered.</p><p>\u201cRight. Violent.\u201d</p><p>They were following a script, and any deviation rattled them.</p><p>\u201cWere you just going to drop her off at the door?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, we were going to take her in and then . . . you know . . . leave her because . . .\u201d Vogel answered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s violent?\u201d Grayson supplied. He glanced over at Olivia. Had he not known better, he might have given some credence to their claim. She was standing behind Vogel with her lips clinched tightly, looking as though she could strangle the man with her bare hands.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re dressed like orderlies?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to look professional,\u201d Vogel explained.</p><p>\u201cYes, professional,\u201d Kline agreed.</p><p>\u201cCut the BS.\u201d Ronan shouted the order. Olivia flinched in reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go get George. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t believe he was leaving now. They hadn\u2019t gotten Kline and Vogel to tell them anything yet. She followed him into the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving now? George is long gone. Don\u2019t leave.\u201d He gave her the look again. \u201cOh . . .\u201d she said, suddenly understanding. \u201cGeorge isn\u2019t gone. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he\u2019s beating the hell out of the elevator button about now. The elevator is locked on the ground floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have taken the steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the bodyguards blocked it. George can\u2019t open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, then. Go get him.\u201d</p><p>There was a warm glint in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to let go of me first.\u201d</p><p>She had a death grip on his hand. She let go, and turning on her heels, she hurried back into the kitchen.</p><p>Grayson was marching down the hallway toward George when the medallion above the elevator doors lit up. George spotted Grayson coming and, in a panic, pounded on the doors, chanting, \u201cCome on, come on . . .\u201d</p><p>The doors opened, and for a second George thought he was going to get away. He tried to run inside, but Agent Huntsman stopped him. Without breaking stride, Huntsman grasped George by the back of his neck and dragged him down the hall.</p><p>Grayson led the way to Olivia\u2019s apartment as Huntsman shoved the blubbering George inside.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up,\u201d Huntsman ordered.</p><p>Grayson grabbed George and dropped him into a chair adjacent to Kline and Vogel. With his head in his hands, George began to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Olivia. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of this, but I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t,\u201d Grayson snapped.</p><p>Ronan caught Huntsman up on what they had learned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take these two in,\u201d Huntsman said, pointing to Vogel and Kline.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Larson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s babysitting the driver. He was sitting in his van in front of the building with a loaded .45 in his lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take them just as soon as they tell me who hired them,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Kline responded with a defiant smirk on his face. \u201cYou can\u2019t make us tell you anything. You can talk to our lawyer. Right, Vogel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Grayson conceded. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk to us, then don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got you for attempted kidnapping, and I\u2019m going to add attempted murder. I\u2019ll make it stick, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttempted murder? We weren\u2019t going to murder her,\u201d Vogel protested.</p><p>Grayson pointed to the vials. \u201cSure you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of this, too, George,\u201d Ronan interjected. \u201cAttempted kidnapping and\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a panic, George began to stammer. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not right. I . . . I was told she was mentally ill, and I was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Ronan grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good, George. You got that lie out without blinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p><p>Huntsman stood behind George while he recited his rights. \u201cWe need another pair of handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, George, did you ever pay that loan off? It must have tripled by now. If you didn\u2019t pay it back, you\u2019ll probably be safe in prison,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will be going to prison,\u201d Ronan assured him.</p><p>\u201cDid you pay the loan off?\u201d Grayson asked again.</p><p>George\u2019s face was turning white. \u201cNot yet. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hired you?\u201d Grayson asked Kline.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t answer. Neither would Vogel. George was the weakest link, so Grayson concentrated on him again.</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up with these two? I know you don\u2019t run in the same circles. So how do you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey work for Carl Simmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth,\u201d Kline demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou do work for him. Everyone knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe said shut up,\u201d Vogel yelled this time.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, do you have any duct tape?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. In the cabinet by the pantry.\u201d</p><p>Grayson found it. He ripped off a long strip.</p><p>\u201cI know my rights. You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d The first strip covered Vogel\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat might not stick,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cI\u2019d better reinforce it.\u201d And with that, he taped over Vogel\u2019s nostrils, making breathing impossible. \u201cThat should do it.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the other side of the table, winked at Olivia as he passed her, then pulled out a chair and straddled it. Stacking his arms across the back, he stared at George, completely ignoring the wide-eyed Vogel.</p><p>\u201cYou were telling us that these two work for Simmons. What do they do for him?\u201d</p><p>Vogel\u2019s face was turning beet red.</p><p>George was gaping at him. \u201cHe can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cWhat do Kline and Vogel do for Simmons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do Kline and Vogel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. Just get that tape off him and let him breathe.\u201d</p><p>Grayson reached across the table and ripped the tape off. Vogel gasped for air.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your mouth shut, George,\u201d Kline blurted.</p><p>\u201cHand me the tape,\u201d Huntsman said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be quiet. No tape. This isn\u2019t right,\u201d Kline said. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat us this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t right.\u201d Grayson nodded to Huntsman who immediately covered Kline\u2019s mouth with the tape. \u201cKnow what else isn\u2019t right?\u201d he continued. \u201cKidnapping and attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>George looked as though, at any moment, he could burst into tears. \u201cOh God, how did this all get so messed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m going to ask . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that Kline and Vogel have been working for Carl Simmons for at least a year. He tells people they\u2019re his bodyguards. I heard him offer them a big bonus if they could get it done fast.\u201d</p><p>Kline grunted and shook his head. Grayson raised his hand, and Kline immediately stopped making noise. It was almost a Pavlovian response.</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d he asked George.</p><p>\u201cOlivia. If they could take care of Olivia fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up with them tonight?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>George\u2019s shoulders slumped. He looked completely defeated now.</p><p>Ronan got down in his face and shouted, \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>George flinched. \u201cSomething happened during the party. I don\u2019t know what set Carl off, but I swear he was shaking. I\u2019ve never seen him so angry. He dragged me out to the lobby, and when he couldn\u2019t see Kline right away, he called him on his cell phone. I heard him tell him what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Ronan prodded.</p><p>\u201cHe told me I had to go with them because Olivia wouldn\u2019t open her door to two strangers, but she would if she saw me through the peephole. I told him about the doorman, that he could call Olivia and tell her there were three of us and she\u2019d never let us come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe told me not to worry about it, that Kline would take care of the doorman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how Kline would take care of him?\u201d</p><p>George shook his head. \u201cNo, and I didn\u2019t ask. I didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a weasel,\u201d Grayson said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cAs it turned out,\u201d George continued, \u201cthe lobby was empty and the door was unlocked. He must have been on a break. . . . No, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, finally figuring it out. \u201cYou wanted us to come inside. You were waiting for us. How did you know we were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did Simmons say?\u201d Grayson asked, ignoring the question.</p><p>George couldn\u2019t look Olivia in the eye. Staring at the table, he said, \u201cThe place they were taking her would keep her locked away where she couldn\u2019t make any more trouble. She\u2019d be let out in three days. Carl said that was all the time Robert needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s MacKenzie going to get done in three days?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cHe told Carl he\u2019d have it all cleared out by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard him say that?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Robert came out in the lobby and pulled Simmons over behind some potted plants. Both of them were hopping mad. I don\u2019t think my father-in-law cared at that point if I heard him. He was in a rage about some attorney\u2014Mitchell Kaplan\u2014and Olivia hiring him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of Jeff Wilcox\u2019s attorney because he knows he\u2019ll have to open up his files.\u201d She looked at her brother-in-law. \u201cGeorge, tell me what you think \u2018clearing it out\u2019 means.\u201d She wanted him to acknowledge what her father was going to do.</p><p>\u201cYou know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money, the stocks . . . he\u2019s going to close it all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hide money,\u201d Ronan predicted.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you promised?\u201d Grayson asked. \u201cNo, let me guess. Simmons found out about your gambling debts and was going to see that you got enough money to pay them off without Natalie finding out. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Simmons told me nobody else knew about the loans, and he\u2019d help me out. He said there was no way I could get money out of the fund without the family suspecting.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t understand George\u2019s stupidity. When was he going to pull his head out of the sand? \u201cAren\u2019t you beginning to figure it out?\u201d she said to him. \u201cSimmons wasn\u2019t going to give you any money. You have to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up at her with weary eyes. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s gone, George. You\u2019re never going to get it back.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Probable cause. The legal term would be a game changer.</p> <p>Grayson contacted the New York office, which would continue the investigation. Since there was now probable cause, he anticipated it wouldn\u2019t take long to get a signed order to stop Robert MacKenzie and Carl Simmons from clearing out any accounts.</p><p>Once Kline and Vogel had been removed from the apartment, George became more talkative. To Olivia, he seemed genuinely contrite, but neither Grayson nor Ronan were buying his remorse.</p><p>Olivia fixed George a cup of coffee, ignoring Grayson\u2019s frowns, and sat with him while he talked about all the mistakes he had made. He was certain Natalie would divorce him, and before Olivia realized what was happening, she became his counselor, even suggesting ways he might discuss his problems with her sister.</p><p>\u201cI should have told her about the loan, and he\u2019s right,\u201d George said, tilting his head toward Grayson. \u201cI did borrow the money from a loan shark. I should get it all out in the open, shouldn\u2019t I? How will Natalie ever forgive me if I keep secrets? Could I text Natalie?\u201d he asked Ronan, who had taken his cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ronan answered.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge, you can\u2019t text that information or e-mail her. You have to sit down with her and explain.\u201d Olivia couldn\u2019t believe he thought it was okay to drop that bomb in a text. How would he phrase it? Oh, by the way, I owe around five hundred thousand to a man who will break my legs if I don\u2019t pay up soon? \u201cShe might understand,\u201d she told him. If she had a lobotomy first, she thought. \u201cI\u2019ll help you tell her if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would do that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Grayson was about to drag Olivia into the living room and ask her what the hell she was doing when George whispered, \u201cI can help you, too.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to nudge Grayson and say, \u201cAh ha! See what happens when you\u2019re patient?\u201d She didn\u2019t, though. She kept her attention on George and asked, \u201cHow can you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe keeps files.\u201d His voice gained strength, now that he\u2019d made up his mind to share the information. \u201cYour father keeps files hidden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Grayson demanded, his tone surly.</p><p>George immediately shut down. Olivia shook her head at Grayson. \u201cHave you seen the files?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t . . . he\u2019s my father-in-law, and every dollar Natalie and I have is tied up in investments he\u2019s made for us.\u201d</p><p>Grayson and Ronan looked as though they wanted to grab George by the throat. Olivia remained calm and refused to give up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to get a backbone, George.\u201d She put her hand on his and with sincere compassion said, \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his brow and kept silent for another minute. \u201cThey\u2019re in the wall in his study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe New York apartment study?\u201d Ronan asked. \u201cOr are they in San Francisco or Miami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York. I swear you\u2019d never know the wall moved. There aren\u2019t any panels. It looks just like . . . a wall. He doesn\u2019t know I saw him, thank God. None of us are allowed to go into his study, even when he\u2019s there, and he always keeps the door locked. I made a joke about it once. I think I called it Fort Knox or something, and he exploded. I was in shock. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019d ever seen him lose his temper like that. I saw that ugly side of him again tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you see the files?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a month ago. Natalie and your mother were in the dining room, and I went down the hall to knock on the study door to tell him dinner was ready. The door was open a crack. I was surprised because that never happened. I almost didn\u2019t look in, but . . . you know . . . curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYour father had his back to me, and he was putting a file folder away. I swear the entire wall moved. I got away from the door as fast as I could because I knew he\u2019d kill me if he saw me watching.\u201d</p><p>Grayson took a call and left the room. Ronan leaned against the wall, going through George\u2019s cell phone messages while Olivia and George continued to talk.</p><p>\u201cDid my mother know men were coming here tonight?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She usually just repeats whatever your father says. She thinks she\u2019s being a supportive wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Natalie? Did she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This was all Carl Simmons and your father. Start to finish.\u201d</p><p>Ronan had just read one of many angry texts from Natalie demanding to know where George was when another text appeared. After he read it, he said, \u201cThe son of a bitch is going to try to shred those files.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had just returned to the kitchen, and Ronan tossed him the phone. He quickly read it, cursed, and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cNatalie sent George a text. Your father has decided to fly back to New York right away. He\u2019s on his way to the airport, and you, George, are an ingrate because you bailed on the party. I guess that\u2019s still going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going home now?\u201d George asked. \u201cHe left his own party to go home? He\u2019s got his own jet, so he can get back to his apartment in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcGraw\u2019s the lead on this in New York,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cHe just called, and I told him about the files in the wall. He\u2019s putting an agent on MacKenzie\u2019s door just in case he slips past the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Simmons?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe left the party right after Olivia\u2019s father. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me in?\u201d George asked. He looked frantic.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ronan answered. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, please,\u201d Olivia called. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask George another question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>She looked George in the eye and asked, \u201cDo you think Simmons hired someone to shoot me?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated several seconds and then nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s capable of it. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a year ago, but now . . . yes. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to shoot you himself. I don\u2019t have proof that he\u2019s involved, though.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Carl was talking to Kline in the lobby, I heard him say he wouldn\u2019t be upset if something happened on the drive to Marydale tonight. I thought he was joking because he was smiling, but then he told Kline not to mess up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left that part out before, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>George nodded but insisted it hadn\u2019t been on purpose. \u201cThat could mean anything, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Grayson towered over him. \u201cWhat do you think it meant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>George seemed to shrink before their eyes. \u201cI guess it could mean that Simmons had hired Kline to shoot Olivia, and he messed up because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t die,\u201d Olivia finished.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it could have meant something altogether different, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d He put both hands up. \u201cI know, I know. I should have told you everything.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Olivia then. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was going to ride all the way to the mental facility with you. I wanted to make sure Kline didn\u2019t hurt you. I was going to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy hurt her you mean kill her,\u201d Ronan stated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were going to protect her, why did you run the second she opened the door?\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cI got scared, but I was going to wait in the van. I didn\u2019t want to watch them drug her. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>\u201cYou are part of it,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>Olivia could see his anger building and sought to diffuse it before he punched George. She got up from the table and went to Grayson.</p><p>\u201cCould I please be there when you question Simmons? I can\u2019t wait to hear the spin he puts on this.\u201d</p><p>Her smile calmed him. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Grayson suddenly needed to be alone with her, to hold her, to love her. With that thought in mind, he vigorously helped George to his feet. Ronan then gripped his arm and shoved him toward the front door. A minute later, as Grayson was sliding the deadbolt into place behind them, he could hear George blubbering once again that his life sucked. Grayson had to agree.</p><p>He returned to Olivia. \u201cI want to go to bed,\u201d he said, reaching for her.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cNo, Grayson. We can\u2019t. You said yourself we have to stay away from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said. But damn it, Olivia, staying away is killing me.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cWhat about Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go home and be there when he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her neck and gently pulled her closer. \u201cI ate dinner with him last night, and he almost fell asleep at the table. He and Patrick go back to basketball camp tomorrow. They\u2019ll leave around seven thirty, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m there or not. He\u2019ll tell me all about it tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ignore him,\u201d she said, trying to catch her breath. His body was pressed against hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ignore him.\u201d His mouth was now hovering over hers, his warm breath tickling her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet the way you worry about Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really worry about him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe has you.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up so he could look into her eyes and said, \u201cSo do you, sweetheart. Like it or not, you\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to reason or to argue. He sealed his promise with a kiss that let her know how much he wanted her.</p><p>Backing her into the living room, he pulled her T-shirt over her head. His hands quickly went to work on the zipper to her jeans, as she struggled to unbutton his shirt and pull it off his shoulders.</p><p>She pushed away and gazed up at him for a second. His eyes were filled with such passion. She took his hand and led him toward her bedroom. \u201cJust this once,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cJust this once.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Sunday morning with Grayson was wonderful. And enlightening. He woke Olivia, caressing her as he nuzzled the side of her neck. He was making love to her.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be awake for this?\u201d she asked, her voice a sleepy whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. You can go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>As if that were possible. His mouth and his hands were everywhere, and oh, did he know how to drive her out of her mind. She was soon writhing in his arms, demanding that he come to her.</p><p>She cl**axed twice before he did. He held her close for several minutes until his breathing calmed and his heart stopped racing. \u201cEach time it\u2019s more intense, isn\u2019t it? More amazing.\u201d</p><p>Olivia started to tremble. \u201cGrayson, we need to talk. I . . .\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her say another word. He kissed her hard, then got out of bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. I\u2019m getting in the shower now, and then I\u2019m making breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He was heading into the bathroom when he said, \u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already lost her train of thought because she\u2019d watched him walk away, and all she could think about was how sexy he was. She knew for a fact that he was all muscle because she\u2019d touched every inch of him. That thought led to another, and she was suddenly replaying the different ways they\u2019d made love during the night. Had she really been that uninhibited, that wild?</p><p>With an audible sigh, she got out of bed and put on her robe. She should have been exhausted, but she wasn\u2019t. Fact was, she\u2019d slept better than she had in years. She\u2019d felt so safe and protected in his arms.</p><p>As it turned out, she did eat breakfast, and Grayson didn\u2019t even have to coax her. He made an omelet with peppers and chives and mushrooms. It was delicious.</p><p>She was sipping hot tea while she watched him clear the table and stack the dishes in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean up,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou cooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I offered.\u201d She tapped her forehead. \u201cAlways thinking.\u201d</p><p>She put her teacup in the sink and followed him into the living room. He took his laptop out of his bag and sat on the floor. Leaning against the sofa, he stretched out his legs, opened the computer, and pulled up The Washington Post.</p><p>\u201cThe newspapers are in the hall,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d</p><p>After she looked through the peephole, she opened the door, scooped up the papers, and locked the door again.</p><p>\u201cI like reading the actual paper,\u201d she explained. \u201cI stare at a computer screen all week. It\u2019s a nice change.\u201d</p><p>Grayson took The Washington Post, and she started reading The New York Times.</p><p>She noticed he read the financial section first, then the sports section.</p><p>\u201cGrayson, may I ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sweetheart.\u201d He moved the paper so that he could check the time. \u201cWe\u2019re having a normal, leisurely Sunday morning. At noon you may ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d</p><p>She understood, and she was happy to wait. The world and all the ugly problems could return at noon. Until then, Grayson wanted time for just the two of them.</p><p>And it was lovely. Curled up against his side, she read most of the Times. There was a particularly interesting article about a renowned Broadway producer she thoroughly enjoyed. She even read the entire editorial page and checked out the new fashions in the style section. At one point she glanced over at Grayson, who was immersed in a story about a new construction project, and she marveled at how comfortable they were in their silence.</p><p>At twelve o\u2019clock, Grayson reluctantly let reality intrude. He stacked the papers on the table and tensed in anticipation of what he was pretty sure was coming. Olivia would ask him about the future. His future. She would tell him that he needed to move on, that there could never be a future with her. She\u2019d hinted at it several times already. It didn\u2019t matter how she phrased it. Whatever she told him would lead to a quarrel, and as stubborn as she was, it would be a long one. He was stubborn, too, and this was one argument he was determined to win. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and he wondered how many times he would have to say those words before she believed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s the question?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She surprised him. She straddled his h*ps and put her hands on his shoulders. Sighing, she said, \u201cI was going to ask if you wanted to go back to bed. You know, for sex.\u201d She leaned forward and ran the tip of her tongue across his lower lip, then she shrugged her shoulders and looked at him with sad, innocent eyes. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t let me ask any questions . . . and now it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>He was laughing as she got up and headed to the kitchen to get them something to drink. A knock on the door changed her direction.</p><p>\u201cRonan\u2019s here,\u201d she announced as she swung the door open. Please don\u2019t let it be more bad news, she prayed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked before Ronan could step inside. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday, and you\u2019re here, so it\u2019s bad news.\u201d So much for taking a stab at optimism.</p><p>Ronan smiled at her. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to New York,\u201d Ronan told Grayson, who was already heading to the closet to get his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Olivia asked.</p> <p>Ronan answered. \u201cWe want to see what\u2019s in that wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to let you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gave her the look, just like Grayson did, the how-could-you-ask-such-a-dumb-question look.</p><p>She found his arrogance amusing. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re going in. Why haven\u2019t they opened the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for McGraw, so no one\u2019s been inside the apartment yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been holding him, and he\u2019s not too happy about it. He was picked up when he landed in New York. He can\u2019t be held much longer. We have to get moving or we\u2019ll miss our flight.\u201d</p><p>Grayson followed Ronan to the door. He stopped, pulled Olivia into his arms, and kissed her passionately. \u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d he promised. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere without\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling one of the bodyguards,\u201d she recited as though she\u2019d memorized the rule.</p><p>\u201cCall Carpenter,\u201d he suggested. \u201cHis wife\u2019s pregnant. He can use the extra money.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Robert MacKenzie\u2019s apartment reeked of wealth. Original artwork hung on every wall, rare antiques blended in with the elegant furnishings, and beautiful rugs covered the gleaming hardwood floors. Grayson walked by a table with a vase he knew cost more than ten thousand dollars. He wondered whose pension paid for that.</p><p>A locksmith was working on the door to the study. One of the agents told Grayson he\u2019d been at it for twenty minutes.</p> <p>The locksmith heard him. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a lock like this before. It\u2019s tricky.\u201d</p><p>Grayson motioned to Ronan. \u201cYou want to get this?\u201d</p><p>Ronan stepped forward. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>The locksmith moved out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Ronan said as he reached for the tool the man was holding. He squatted down eye level to the lock and after a couple of maneuvers, turned the door handle, and the door opened wide.</p><p>The locksmith\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>How? Ronan had grown up in the inner-city and had learned all sorts of tricks, most of them illegal. That\u2019s how. But he wasn\u2019t going to talk about his past with a stranger or boast that he could pretty much open any lock by the age of ten. Instead, he said, \u201cJust lucky.\u201d</p><p>Agents rushed into the study with cameras. While everything was being documented and recorded, Grayson and Ronan turned their attention to the walls. They examined each one carefully and finally agreed on the one that would move. It took them a while to figure out how it worked, but once they pinpointed the correct spot and gave it a firm push, a section of the wall, about four feet wide, swung open, revealing a small room. File cabinets lined one wall, and a stack of file folders sat on an immaculate desk in the center.</p><p>Grayson and Ronan were the first to have a look. They sifted through some of the files and called in a couple of investigators who, after several hours of inspection, verified what the two agents had concluded: Robert MacKenzie was running one of the most elaborate Ponzi schemes they had ever seen.</p><p>It was all there. His meticulous record keeping was impressive. There were statements for every investor and every deposit. Transaction records showed that he made purchases of stocks, bonds, and other funds, but when these were cross-referenced with the statements the investors got, it was apparent that he had bought only a fraction of the amount he had reported to them. Buying ten shares of a stock and then showing a hundred shares on the investor\u2019s statement, he was able to pocket the difference, and the investor never knew. The number of transactions he showed in one month alone was mind-boggling, making it almost impossible for his clients to keep up. The inspectors surmised that some of the companies and funds that appeared didn\u2019t actually exist. There were lists of handwritten names crossed off in a ledger book, and these names appeared on statements as a buy, and the very next month they were listed as a sell. If an investor were to ask about any particular security, it would already have disappeared. Like a Ping-Pong ball, MacKenzie had bounced from one to the other, never landing for long in one place.</p><p>Investors were sent reports that showed how much money they were making, and even with those, MacKenzie was clever. One month the profit would be slight; the next it would be bigger. He even showed a couple of minor downturns, just to make it realistic.</p><p>There were records that indicated some investors had cashed in and taken profits, but these were few and far between. With his charisma and powers of persuasion, Robert MacKenzie had most likely convinced his clients to wait for a bigger payout. How long he could have held on to his deception was the question. The only way he could keep going was to take in more than he returned . . . or spent on his lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Without a doubt, it was the most convoluted scam Grayson had ever seen. It was also brilliant. No wonder Olivia was having such trouble finding proof. It was a maze of lies.</p><p>A particularly thick file caught Grayson\u2019s attention. It had Eric Jorguson\u2019s name on it.</p><p>He picked it up and thumbed through the papers. Some of the pages showed names of other people whose investments appeared to be linked with Jorguson\u2019s. One was Gretta Keene. It didn\u2019t take much scrutiny to discover that funds were being moved from one to the other through the account. Grayson could tell that it would take some time to unravel all these figures, but he knew Huntsman was going to be ecstatic when he got his hands on this information.</p><p>Jeff Wilcox\u2019s file was there, as well. Inside were several signed documents.</p><p>Grayson looked through them and held up a couple of pages, comparing them to two pages he had laid on the desk. He called to Ronan. \u201cLook at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cContradictory documents,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAnd they all have Jeff Wilcox\u2019s signature on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would MacKenzie keep them?\u201d he asked. \u201cThese alone will put him away for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor his signature,\u201d Grayson answered. He pulled out a sheet with Jeff Wilcox\u2019s name signed at least a dozen times. \u201cWhen MacKenzie forged his name, he wanted it to look authentic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the money from the charity Wilcox gave him?\u201d</p><p>Grayson gathered the papers and slipped them back in the file. \u201cLooks as though Wilcox gave it to him in good faith, and MacKenzie lost a good deal of it in a risky scheme and kept the rest for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a guy,\u201d Ronan said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a real peach,\u201d Grayson agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Olivia will be happy, knowing that her suspicions were true. She was right all along.\u201d</p><p>Grayson thought for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? She\u2019s been vindicated. Her father won\u2019t be able to scam innocent people anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cBut now all those people who trusted in Robert MacKenzie, the innocent clients who gave him their life savings, are going to find out the truth: They\u2019ve lost it all.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Monday was a nightmare. The sins of Olivia\u2019s father were being broadcast all over the news channels and the Internet. It was the story of the day. Investors were in shock and disbelief. They awakened to find that they had been duped and that all of their money was gone. Those who had lost their life savings felt helpless. They had no one to turn to, nowhere to go to get their hard-earned money back. Such deceit was simply inconceivable.</p><p>Once the initial shock wore off, they were out for blood, and who could blame them? They couldn\u2019t get to Robert MacKenzie\u2014he was safe behind bars with guards protecting him\u2014and so they took their anger out on the other members of his family. Olivia had anticipated what was coming once the news broke, and she knew it would be bad. She still wasn\u2019t prepared.</p><p>Officer Carpenter drove her to work, but instead of leaving and returning for her at the end of the day, he stayed. He pulled up a chair and sat right outside her office door\u2014Grayson\u2019s instructions, no doubt.</p><p>Working at her desk, she received a multitude of hateful phone calls. She listened to the comments of the first few callers, and from then on, she simply hung up as soon as the irate words began to fly. If she took the time to respond to each one, she\u2019d never get anything done. Mr. Thurman stopped by a couple of times to check on her.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThere are some terribly angry people out there calling and threatening you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I work for the IRS. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled over her joke and said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll let you get back to work, but I insist you take half the day. Go home at noon, and if you must, work from there.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t argue. She intended to leave at noon as Mr. Thurman had ordered, but it took her longer than expected to finish working on one particularly challenging file. It was after two when Officer Carpenter dropped her at her apartment door.</p><p>Safe and sound, she thought and sighed with relief. She actually believed that, once she was inside her apartment, she would have a little peace and quiet.</p><p>There were forty-eight extremely hostile messages waiting for her on her home phone and half that many on her cell phone. Both numbers were unlisted and Olivia was surprised that so many people had been able to get hold of them. She wanted to hit the delete button, but she made herself listen to each and every message. By the time the last one played, she felt completely drained.</p><p>She was just about to change out of her black wool skirt and silk blouse when another call came in. The second she heard the voice she picked up.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, it\u2019s me, Henry Kincaid. Can you come to school?\u201d The little boy\u2019s voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll come to your school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? Can you come to Pinebrook now? \u2019Cause I need a lawyer and you\u2019re my lawyer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now,\u201d she promised, hoping her quick agreement would calm him. \u201cHenry, can you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go to the principal\u2019s office \u2019cause I got into trouble,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s because of soccer. Bobby told me not to try out or I\u2019d be sorry, but I told him I was going to try out anyway. Ralph is going to try out, too.\u201d</p><p>Olivia checked the time. Two thirty. \u201cWhere are you? Shouldn\u2019t you be in the classroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the nurse\u2019s office. Miss Cavit wants to talk to you. Okay? And after we talk to the principal, will you take me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, I\u2019m not authorized to take you out of the school\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit with you until your grandfather or Patrick gets there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay with you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The nurse came on the line a second later. She introduced herself and said, \u201cHenry had a little accident. He tripped into a locker and struck his forehead, his nose, and his eye. The nosebleed has stopped, but I\u2019ll keep him here until school dismisses at three fifteen. He\u2019s resting on a cot,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe poor lamb\u2019s got a bump on his forehead. I\u2019ve got an ice pack on it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you notified his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a message for Grayson Kincaid. Henry told me his uncle is in New York on business. I also left a message for Henry\u2019s grandfather, and I just spoke to Patrick, Henry\u2019s housekeeper. He was at the dentist and couldn\u2019t leave yet. He\u2019ll be here at the regular dismissal time, but Henry seems insistent that you come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I speak to Henry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Henry whispered, \u201cMiss Cavit says you should come when school is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, let her think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, but I\u2019m really leaving now and should get there in fifteen minutes or less. All right?\u201d</p><p>She could hear the anxiety leave his voice. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was out the door minutes later. She said a prayer there wouldn\u2019t be any angry people in the garage waiting for her, and blessedly there weren\u2019t. Once she was in her car with the key in the ignition, she used her iPhone to get directions to Pinebrook School. It was a cold, rainy day, which worked to her advantage. Few reporters liked waiting outside in the raw elements. There were several cars parked along the street with their motors running. She spotted them before she turned in their direction and quickly drove the other way, even going so far as to drive down an alley on the off chance she was being followed.</p><p>She thought about calling Grayson to let him know she was going to the school, then decided to wait until she had the full story from Henry.</p><p>The private school was all redbrick and ivy vines. Very Georgetown, she thought to herself. She pulled into one of the visitor\u2019s slots and went up the stone steps.</p><p>A security guard opened the door for her. He was a man in his late sixties and wore a brown uniform. He had a sincere smile and a wealth of information to impart. \u201cYou\u2019re here for the Kincaid boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I am,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy name is Olivia MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand out, and he quickly shook it and introduced himself. His name was Arthur. He motioned to a corner, and she followed. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it myself, but I have no doubt what happened,\u201d he stated with a nod. \u201cThat Deckman boy is a bully, and he\u2019s been after Henry and his friend Ralph because they\u2019re younger and smaller. I used to be just like those little boys. I was small for my age, and I got picked on. I know what it feels like. I wish Principal Higgins would take a firmer hand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs the Deckman boy\u2019s first name Bobby? Henry mentioned that name to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Bobby Deckman. He\u2019s been in trouble before, several times, as a matter of fact, but his father does some fast talking and makes a hefty donation, and bam, the problem goes away. I know I shouldn\u2019t be saying this, but I figure, what the heck. I\u2019m retiring in a couple of months, and it\u2019s time someone said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Deckman boy attacked Henry. He smashed his face into the locker. If the custodian hasn\u2019t gotten to it, there\u2019s blood still on the locker. Poor little Henry\u2019s blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there cameras in the hallways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cI could make you a disc, but I\u2019d have to hurry. As soon as Bobby\u2019s father gets here, I\u2019m afraid the disc will accidentally get wiped.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cCould you make me two?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and ducked into the security office next to the school\u2019s entrance.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t have to stand there long. Arthur reappeared, grinning and waving two discs, just as another security guard rushed down the hall toward them. He explained he had gotten Arthur\u2019s page and would take over front door duty.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Arthur told her.</p><p>He led her up some stairs to a computer lab. Fortunately it was empty. Arthur used his security code to access the Internet, then stepped back so that Olivia could insert the disc. She quickly sent the file to her e-mail account, and she sent another to Grayson. With Arthur hovering over her, she watched the video. The encounter between the two boys lasted less than a minute, but the video left no doubt who the aggressor was. Olivia felt heartsick. Bobby was twice the size and weight of Henry.</p><p>Olivia played it one more time. \u201cWhat grade is the Deckman boy in? He looks like a senior in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifth. He\u2019s quite big for his age,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cAnd mean,\u201d he added in a whisper. \u201cLook at his expression as he grabs Henry. He\u2019s enjoying himself. It\u2019s downright evil, if you ask me. I tell you, there\u2019s something missing in that boy\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>She silently agreed. There wasn\u2019t any provocation. Bobby came up behind Henry, half lifted him, and threw him into the locker.</p><p>Olivia could feel her anger building. Arthur fueled it when he said, \u201cDo you see? That\u2019s what the Deckman boy does. He chooses a kid and goes after him. Then, when he gets bored, he chooses another kid. Always younger so they can\u2019t fight back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Principal Higgins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never had any concrete proof until now,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cThe kids Bobby goes after won\u2019t tell what happened. They\u2019re afraid. Bobby\u2019s a bully, all right. The school needs to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was in wholehearted agreement. She grabbed her phone and called Officer Carpenter, quickly filled him in, and after he gave her his e-mail address, she sent the video to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>After making the promise, Carpenter demanded to know why she had left her apartment without a bodyguard. The man was almost as bossy as Grayson, she thought. She had to listen to a lecture and vow to wait for him to come to her.</p><p>Arthur walked her to the nurse\u2019s office. \u201cYou\u2019ll like Miss Cavit. She worked in a hospital for twenty years before she retired from the long hours and took this job. She\u2019s real good with kids.\u201d</p><p>The nurse was sitting at her desk in a tiny room. Beyond was another little room with two cots side by side. Henry was resting on one of them. He lit up when he saw Olivia in the doorway.</p><p>Miss Cavit said, \u201cThere\u2019s a meeting with Bobby Deckman\u2019s parents after school. Three forty-five. Henry tells me you\u2019re his lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll want to be at the meeting, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I will.\u201d Olivia walked to the cot and sat down beside Henry. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come here \u2019cause you said you would.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Miss Cavit. \u201cCould you give us a moment while I confer with my client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at my desk if you need me,\u201d she answered.</p><p>When she\u2019d pulled the door closed, Olivia turned to Henry. \u201cOkay, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her hand, surprising her. His expression was so earnest. \u201cBobby decided Ralph and I couldn\u2019t try out for soccer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you why he didn\u2019t want you to try out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just being mean \u2019cause he can. He\u2019s like that with other kids, too. Honest,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI believe you, Henry.\u201d She reached into her purse and pulled out a small notepad and pen. \u201cTell me about the other kids he\u2019s bullied.\u201d</p><p>Olivia took copious notes, and when she was finished with her questions and had deciphered Henry\u2019s convoluted stories, she asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your uncle Grayson about Bobby Deckman?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause Ralph and me were going to stand up to Bobby together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph and I,\u201d she automatically corrected.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re just like my uncle and Patrick. They\u2019re always telling me the right way to talk. How come you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I roll.\u201d She laughed after using the silly expression she and the other Pips had often used when they were in the unit together. The non-answer always baffled the nurses.</p><p>Patrick arrived a few minutes before three fifteen. He sat on the empty cot next to Henry\u2019s and his tall frame dwarfed the tiny room. Olivia pulled up the video on her phone and let Patrick watch Bobby throw Henry into the locker.</p><p>\u201cOh man,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHas Grayson seen this? He\u2019s going to go ballistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she answered. \u201cI think we should go to the principal\u2019s office now. It\u2019s almost three forty-five.\u201d</p><p>Henry clasped Olivia\u2019s hand and walked by her side down the hall until he spotted some of his friends. He let go then and walked behind her with Patrick, imitating his swagger.</p><p>The Deckmans were waiting in the reception area. Mr. Deckman looked like an uptight banker with his conservative suit and tie and his rigid stance. His wife looked like one of those reality show housewives of Washington, D.C. She was unattractive, painfully thin, and had had way too much face work. Brittle was the word that came to mind. Olivia feared that if she shook her hand a little too vigorously she\u2019d crumble into a thousand pieces.</p><p>Mr. Deckman didn\u2019t acknowledge them, and his wife kept giving them covert glances but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Bobby was waiting in the principal\u2019s office. When they were all ushered in by the receptionist, Olivia was taken aback by the hostility in the boy\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t looking at her, though. His anger was directed at his father.</p><p>Extra chairs were dragged in. On the left of the principal\u2019s desk sat Brittle, Uptight, and Bobby. On the opposite side, Henry and she sat in straight-backed chairs. There was a chair for Patrick, but he preferred to stand behind Henry. She could tell he was still hopping mad.</p><p>Principal Higgins was a young man, probably in his early to middle thirties, Olivia estimated. There were stress lines around his mouth and dark circles under his eyes. Running the all-boys school had taken its toll.</p><p>Higgins rubbed his jaw. \u201cThis is a difficult situation. We know Henry and Bobby were in an altercation, but the boys have given different interpretations of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys like to fight,\u201d Mr. Deckman said.</p><p>Had he not shrugged and acted so indifferent, Olivia might have softened her response.</p><p>\u201cYour son is a bully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not,\u201d Mrs. Deckman snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s a normal fifth grader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bully,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd that won\u2019t stand. Principal Higgins, this isn\u2019t the first time Bobby\u2019s been accused of attacking a student, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here. That\u2019s confidential information,\u201d Bobby\u2019s mother said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Olivia replied. \u201cYour son punched Tom Capshaw. Split his lip open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is absolutely no proof that it was our son who struck Capshaw,\u201d Mr. Deckman argued.</p><p>Olivia opened her notepad and glanced at it. \u201cWhat about Will Kaufman or Matt Farrell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose altercations happened last year,\u201d Mrs. Deckman said. \u201cIt was all hearsay, one boy\u2019s word against another\u2019s, and then both Will and Matt changed their stories.\u201d She turned to her husband. \u201cThey were just roughhousing, weren\u2019t they, Sean?\u201d</p><p>Her husband nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right. No proof of any wrongdoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time there is proof,\u201d Olivia said. She handed the principal one of the discs.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Mr. Deckman asked.</p><p>\u201cA security tape,\u201d Olivia answered.</p><p>Principal Higgins looked surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got this, Miss MacKenzie, but I\u2019m not sure we can . . .\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to Bobby\u2019s parents. \u201cYou do want to know the truth, don\u2019t you? If it was just two boys roughhousing, this will prove it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Deckman stammered, \u201cWell, of course I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Olivia said. She nodded to Principal Higgins, who slipped the disc into the computer slot. He adjusted the monitor so they could see it, then came around the desk to watch the video with them.</p><p>Not a word was spoken as the event played out on the screen. Mrs. Deckman\u2019s face turned white, and she winced when she saw Bobby throw Henry into the locker. Mr. Deckman\u2019s face turned red. When Olivia turned to look at Bobby, he was smiling. What was he? A sociopath in the making?</p><p>Principal Higgins was appalled, but Olivia could detect a hint of relief as he returned to his chair and removed the disc.</p><p>Mr. Deckman grabbed the disc from his hand, slipped it into his pocket, and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to look at this again at home.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Deckman smiled at her husband\u2019s quick response. Did she think the problem had just gone away?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019ve sent the video to Henry\u2019s uncle and to others as well. This isn\u2019t going away.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Deckman sprang to his feet and was all bluster when he said, \u201cThat\u2019s illegal. I\u2019ll sue. You can\u2019t confiscate private property. It\u2019s an invasion of privacy. It\u2019s . . .\u201d He turned his outrage on the principal. \u201cDo something, Higgins. If you want to keep your job, fix this.\u201d</p><p>Principal Higgins was not intimidated. He looked directly at Deckman and stated, \u201cWe do not tolerate violence or bullies in this school.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Deckman\u2019s smile had disappeared and she now looked worried. \u201cYes, we understand, but he\u2019s just a child. We could get him counseling. We\u2019ll do it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d Higgins began. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t have this behavior . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we bring charges,\u201d Olivia told the principal, \u201cthe decision would be out of your hands. This is clearly a case of assault, and I\u2019m confident that any court would see it our way.\u201d</p><p>Principal Higgins was the one who looked worried now. \u201cI understand your point of view, Miss MacKenzie, but for the sake of our school and its reputation, I hope we can find a way to settle this without a legal battle.\u201d</p><p>Olivia appeared to consider his concerns and then said, \u201cWe suggest that Bobby be expelled from Pinebrook immediately. He should not be allowed to return here or attend any other school until he\u2019s gotten the help he needs. He could have broken Henry\u2019s neck. Surely, you wouldn\u2019t wait until something that serious happened before taking action, Principal Higgins?\u201d</p><p>The Deckmans erupted, but Olivia stood her ground. Any threats that the parents hurled at her were met with the sound and logical details she would use in a suit against them and their son.</p><p>Until now, Bobby had sat quietly with a smug grin on his face, but he was beginning to see the handwriting on the wall. He rushed to his father, poked him in the chest, and screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare let them kick me out. You\u2019ll be sorry if you do.\u201d</p><p>There was no calming the boy. A minute later, as he was being dragged from the office by his mother and father, everyone could hear Mrs. Deckman trying to comfort him with the promise of a new iPad as soon as this mistake was sorted out. Mr. Deckman paused at the door to give Olivia a contemptuous glare before he left.</p><p>Olivia spent a few more minutes talking to the principal, and Patrick and Henry waited for her in the reception area. When she came out, Henry hugged her. \u201cThank you, Olivia,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned down, smiled, and kissed his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, Henry.\u201d</p><p>Officer Carpenter was standing by the front door to the school when she walked outside. He held out his hand to take her car keys, but after her protest, he agreed to follow her in his car if she promised to be cautious. Just to make him happy, she drove under the speed limit the whole way home.</p><p>He was just about to say good-bye to her at her apartment door when Mrs. Delaney, who must have been listening for Olivia to return, stuck her head out and announced she needed milk. Carpenter waited while Olivia went into her apartment and came back with a quart. The grumpy woman made her stand there while she found her reading glasses and checked the expiration date, then she thanked Olivia and went back inside.</p><p>After Carpenter wagged his finger in Olivia\u2019s face and told her to stay home, he left. Olivia locked her door and leaned against it. She suddenly felt very tired. She changed into snug jeans and a blouse, put her hair up in a ponytail, and went into the kitchen to find something she could microwave for dinner. Determined to eat something healthy first, she made a salad and ate every bit of it. She thought about what had happened at Henry\u2019s school and realized how lucky she\u2019d been that no one had recognized her. Maybe they hadn\u2019t seen the news yet or hadn\u2019t associated her name with the family. Regardless, she was thankful. She even had the thought that maybe it wasn\u2019t going to be as bad as she\u2019d anticipated. Maybe it would go away sooner rather than later.</p><p>In her dreams perhaps. Just as she was going to put her frozen dinner in the microwave, another call came in. It was so grossly disturbing, she lost her appetite. She put the dinner back in the refrigerator and curled up on the sofa to watch television.</p><p>Her father\u2019s face was plastered on all the major channels. The broadcaster on one news network was interviewing a tearful woman who kept saying she\u2019d been promised a triple return on her money. Olivia pushed the button on the remote and turned the television off. The silence brought a few welcome moments of peace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She decided a Popsicle sounded good so she got one from the freezer, put it on a plate, and went back to the television. Maybe she could find an old classic movie to take her mind off her worries. A knock on the door startled her, and an instant of panic gripped her stomach. Had one of the angry investors gotten inside the building? She walked over and peered through the peephole. When she saw Grayson standing there, she threw the door open and fell into his arms. He looked tired, she thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? It\u2019s almost ten. Did you just get back from New York? Shouldn\u2019t you be\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth stopped her. He tightened his hold and kissed the breath out of her. She didn\u2019t resist him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back passionately. It had been such an awful day, but he was here now, and everything was better.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d He took off his coat, hung it in the closet, and draping his arm around her, pulled her along to the sofa.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFully recovered,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen I opened the file you sent and saw Henry being slammed into his locker, I wanted to lock that Deckman kid up in solitary for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little extreme, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHenry and Patrick are singing your praises. Thank you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her on her forehead and pulled her down next to him. They talked about the school for a few more minutes, and then Olivia said, \u201cI want to hear about the files again. Tell me everything. Start at the beginning when you entered the apartment.\u201d</p> <p>She took a bite of the Popsicle and waited. Grayson, she noticed, was staring at her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t concentrate while you\u2019re eating that,\u201d he said.</p><p>A little bit of the devil in her came out. She put the Popsicle in her mouth and sucked the sweet cherry juice. \u201cHow come?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cOlivia,\u201d he warned, \u201cwant to find out how fast I can get your clothes off?\u201d</p><p>Smiling sweetly, she stopped tormenting him and took the Popsicle to the sink. Her mood changed immediately when she heard her phone ring.</p><p>Grayson went to the door of her study to listen to the incoming call. He obviously didn\u2019t like what he heard. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he growled. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he asked when she came back into the living room.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cCome sit and tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others are there?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up to fifty-some now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson, you knew this was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you listen to all of them?\u201d His voice shook, he was so angry.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t want to. Some of them are sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many were death threats?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop snapping at me. I didn\u2019t make the calls.\u201d</p><p>Her retort eased some of the tension, and he gave her a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cI should have erased them and turned the phone off,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cNo, absolutely not. I\u2019m going to have every damned call traced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t arrest people for saying mean things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath threats? Hell yes, I can arrest them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back from New York?\u201d she asked to keep him from getting worked up again.</p><p>\u201cAround five today. I didn\u2019t see the video until I got home.\u201d He was still glaring as he followed her.</p><p>\u201cDid you get to see any Broadway shows?\u201d she asked with a straight face.</p><p>The question jarred him; then he laughed. He dropped down next to her and swung his feet up on the ottoman. \u201cI was in your father\u2019s study until after two. Then I went back around nine this morning. Spent most of the day there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the apartment,\u201d she said.</p><p>He described the layout but didn\u2019t mention the fact that there wasn\u2019t a single photo of her anywhere. He went into detail about the secret room and what he had seen in the files.</p><p>\u201cRonan talked to Wilcox\u2019s attorney, told him what we found,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cEmma will be so relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ll really like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know that Eric Jorguson invested with your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears that not all the money Jorguson had flowing through the fund was going into his retirement nest egg. When the auditors sort it all out, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll be able to prove this was one of his money-laundering accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something?\u201d Olivia shook her head. She\u2019d listened intently to all the evidence that was piling up against her father, and the cold reality of the situation was setting in. \u201cThis is going to go on for a long while, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe phone calls and the threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the next big story.\u201d Grayson could see her wilting before his eyes, so he changed the subject. \u201cWant to know what I did when I got home this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, wondering why he suddenly sounded exasperated. \u201cDid you eat dinner with Henry and Patrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cHenry met me at the door and went into a long narration of what happened at school. Then Patrick gave me his summary. Then Henry started over again,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cYou impressed the socks off him, Olivia. He\u2019s now quoting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so is Patrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, sweet. We sat down for dinner when sweet Henry remembered he had another assignment due tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip to keep from laughing. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to memorize all the states in alphabetical order and all the capitals. He was supposed to have been working on it for a couple of weeks, but he just remembered tonight.\u201d He shook his head as he added, \u201cWhen he told me, I swear I was speechless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. He knew some of them, and Patrick came up with a rap tune. It made it easier for Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you memorize them along with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . and, no, I\u2019m not singing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren learn quickly. I\u2019m sure you got through the assignment in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you about the math yet.\u201d</p><p>The lighthearted conversation ended with the doorbell. Then the banging on the door started. Olivia reluctantly went to answer it. She looked through the peephole and groaned.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he asked, coming up behind her.</p><p>\u201cWorld War Three,\u201d she said. \u201cNatalie and my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to let them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I do. Natalie will stand there hitting the door and shouting until tomorrow if she has to. I might as well get it over with now.\u201d</p><p>Grayson made her step back into the living room before he opened the door. Natalie couldn\u2019t storm inside because he blocked her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my sister?\u201d she demanded. She pushed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s here. Let me in,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Since she was acting like a child, he decided to treat her like one. \u201cYou will behave yourself, or you will leave.\u201d</p><p>The second he stepped back, Natalie rushed in. Her mother, Deborah, showed more decorum. She nodded to Grayson as she walked past.</p><p>Natalie saw Olivia and screamed, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her sister, Olivia said, \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Deborah MacKenzie looked exhausted. Grayson noticed her hands were shaking as she struggled to remove her coat. He took it from her.</p><p>She was a beautiful woman. Except for the color of their eyes\u2014Olivia\u2019s were blue; Deborah\u2019s were brown\u2014Olivia looked just like her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Olivia. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very distressed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Your father\u2019s in jail, and he\u2019s been accused of stealing money. It\u2019s outrageous to think that my husband would do such a thing. It\u2019s all a misunderstanding,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, it isn\u2019t a misunderstanding. This is what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d Natalie yelled. She was pacing around the room with her arms crossed.</p><p>Olivia turned to her. \u201cSit down and wait your turn. I\u2019m talking to Mother. When I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou selfish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. If you call me names, you\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>Grayson smiled. He was impressed with the way Olivia had taken the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cMother, I know this is a shock.\u201d</p><p>Olivia could see the anger washing over her mother. She straightened up, her spine rigid. Her voice turned to ice when she said, \u201cA shock? My husband is in jail. It\u2019s all a mistake,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBecause of you, young lady. You started all those rumors. You\u2019ve ruined your father with your foolish accusations.\u201d</p><p>Rumors? Olivia didn\u2019t know where to start. She looked at Grayson and lifted her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou must fix this,\u201d her mother implored. \u201cShow your father the support he needs now. He\u2019s all alone in New York, without any family to help him through this humiliation. I wanted to go and stand by his side, but he\u2019s been denied bail.\u201d</p><p>For good cause, Olivia knew. They were sure he would try to run.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home with Natalie,\u201d she said then. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with her until this is resolved.\u201d</p><p>Hopeless. Her mother was completely hopeless. Still drinking Robert MacKenzie\u2019s poisoned water, Olivia realized. Eventually she would be forced to face reality. And so would Natalie. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to try to reason with either of them now. She actually felt sorry for them. Acknowledging the truth was going to be painful.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Natalie, it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cDid you know George is sitting in a cell? He\u2019s been accused of the most heinous crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do know,\u201d she replied calmly. She crossed the room to Grayson and leaned against him. She needed comfort.</p><p>\u201cThis is all such a mess,\u201d Natalie railed.</p><p>\u201cThe time is getting away from us, Natalie. Get the papers out,\u201d her mother ordered.</p><p>Uh-oh. Olivia didn\u2019t like the sound of that.</p><p>Natalie opened her purse and pulled out a stack of papers. She unfolded them and was searching for a pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Natalie finally explained. \u201cMother and Father\u2019s assets have been frozen, and most of my money is unavailable. I have a small account that will get us through, but there isn\u2019t enough to pay for George\u2019s defense. So, you\u2019re going to sign over your trust. I know you don\u2019t get the money for another year, but if you sign it over to us now, we can borrow against it and hire the best attorney we can find to clear this up. You got him into this mess. You can damn well help to get him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must help your father, too,\u201d her mother said firmly. She put her purse over her arm and reached for her coat. \u201cYou simply must call your aunt Emma and insist that she support your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by support, Mother, do you mean you want me to ask her to give Father all of her money?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s chin came up. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I mean. His defense will be expensive, and Emma is a member of this family. She must do her part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to sign these papers,\u201d Natalie reminded, shoving them at her. \u201cAnd we aren\u2019t leaving until you do.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pushed them away. \u201cI\u2019m not signing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Natalie cried. \u201cYou owe us.\u201d</p><p>For Olivia, that was the final straw. As she calmly walked out of the room, she turned back and said, \u201cGrayson, please get the door.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Olivia was sitting with Jane and Collins in Jane\u2019s hospital room, catching them up on the latest events. The news about her father was still a hot topic on TV, but now the how-could-this-have-happened-again questions had started. Fingers were pointed; and if history were to repeat itself, no one was going to step up and take responsibility for not doing his job.</p><p>Olivia wondered how many had ignored all the signs and all the complaints and had simply turned a blind eye.</p><p>Collins couldn\u2019t understand how Natalie could blame Olivia.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to blame me than to admit that she was horribly deceived by her father,\u201d Olivia explained. \u201cNatalie trusted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie knows what a Ponzi scheme is, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019ll do when she finds out about George\u2019s debt to that loan shark?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be happy,\u201d Collins predicted.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d Collins asked. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. She\u2019s a lost cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s just loyal to a fault,\u201d Jane said. \u201cNo one\u2019s a lost cause. Look at my brother. Logan\u2019s completely turned his life around.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. Jane always looked for the good in people. She wished she could be more like her friend. She had such a sweet disposition and a gentle soul.</p><p>\u201cIf convicted on all counts, your father will never get out of prison,\u201d Collins predicted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d Jane asked. She sounded like a therapist now. She was sitting up in bed, trying to ignore Collins, who was fluffing her pillows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIf he got out, he\u2019d just do it again. He really can\u2019t help the way he is.\u201d</p><p>Collins disagreed. \u201cYour father knows the difference between right and wrong. He set out to steal.\u201d</p><p>Jane pulled a pillow from behind her and whacked Collins with it. \u201cGo sit down and stop fussing over me.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Collins dodged the attack and sat on the edge of the bed. Olivia took the pillow and put it on a chair. She noticed a couple of long strands of Jane\u2019s hair. Oh God, it was falling out again. Was she doing chemo and not telling them? She turned the pillow over so Jane wouldn\u2019t notice, then went to the window ledge and leaned against it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Collins asked when she noticed Olivia\u2019s stark complexion.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t going to talk about Jane\u2019s illness now, and so she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about family any longer. I\u2019m sick of it. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Collins agreed. \u201cTell us about Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia can\u2019t keep her hands off him,\u201d Jane announced.</p> <p>Both of her friends had a good laugh. Olivia didn\u2019t take exception because it was true. She couldn\u2019t keep her hands off him. Jane was simply repeating what she\u2019d told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I really don\u2019t,\u201d Olivia said, perplexed. \u201cI make all these resolutions, and the second I see him, I want to . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him.\u201d Collins stated the obvious.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m in love with him. I wouldn\u2019t be so miserable if I weren\u2019t. But I\u2019m not going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he asked?\u201d Jane wanted to know.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he told you he loves you?\u201d Collins asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut I know he cares about me. It\u2019s all the little things he does . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she thought about him.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Collins asked. \u201cGive us an example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe carries an extra inhaler for me because he knows I\u2019ll forget to put one in my purse,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he does so many sweet, loving things for me.\u201d Tears came into her eyes. \u201cWhen I first met him, I thought of him as the James Bond type. He was so sophisticated and sexy and . . .\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t go on, Collins said, \u201cLove \u2019em and leave \u2019em, like Bond?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. He isn\u2019t like that, though. He\u2019s responsible and solid.\u201d She thought of him with Henry. Grayson was patient and loving, and she knew he would always be there for his nephew. Henry knew it, too.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes think about a future with him, and then I remember what your parents went through, Collins, and your mother, Jane. Sam\u2019s family, too. I saw their fear, and I heard them crying. For a while there, when everyone but Dr. Pardieu thought we were dying, your families came and kept vigil. It was awful for them.\u201d</p><p>Collins nodded. \u201cWe all remember, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I put Grayson through that?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t do that to him. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Collins didn\u2019t try to convince her that she was wrong. How could she with Jane so ill now?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t live your life waiting for it to come back.\u201d Jane made the statement. \u201cWhat a fatalistic attitude. Olivia, you need to stop being afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Jane?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t tell us it\u2019s the flu again,\u201d Collins warned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling better again. It\u2019s the weirdest thing. I get so sick, and then I bounce back. Since Dr. Pardieu has been away, another doctor has been seeing me. By the way, Logan\u2019s going to be here any minute. Please don\u2019t talk about my illness in front of him. Okay? He gets so upset. I know he\u2019s scared, so keep it upbeat.\u201d</p><p>They quickly agreed. Then it was Collins\u2019s turn to catch her friends up. She told them she was still waiting to hear when she would start at the academy. She couldn\u2019t understand why it was taking so long, but she thought it might have something to do with her medical history.</p><p>Exasperated, Jane said, \u201cYou\u2019re just like Olivia. The two of you need an attitude adjustment.\u201d</p><p>An argument ensued, and Jane deflected it by changing the topic. \u201cI can\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s happened to you in the last few months, Olivia. You were attacked by the CEO of a major corporation and his goon, and you were rescued by the FBI. You were shot three times, and then you were almost kidnapped and taken to a mental hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s the end of it, and I really hope and pray they find whoever shot you,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>Logan walked in and heard what she\u2019d said. \u201cJane told me that Martin guy was the shooter.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were red, and it was obvious he\u2019d been crying. No one mentioned his condition.</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cBut until there\u2019s absolute proof, Grayson is going to continue to provide protection for me. He doesn\u2019t care if I want a bodyguard following me around or not. He\u2019s extremely stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s absolute proof?\u201d Logan asked. He walked to the side of the bed and kissed Jane\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cA confession would seal it,\u201d Jane suggested. \u201cBut he obviously isn\u2019t talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding the weapon would also do it. If they could trace it to Martin, Grayson would be convinced,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you get to go home?\u201d Collins asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cHopefully tomorrow,\u201d she answered. \u201cOlivia, will you be around in a couple of weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Dracula room? Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the doctor waiting so long?\u201d Collins wondered.</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to finish some meds first.\u201d</p><p>Olivia yawned again. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m going home. Come on, Collins. Let Jane visit with her brother.\u201d</p><p>Olivia waited until she and Collins were in the elevator before talking about Jane\u2019s condition. \u201cShe\u2019s losing her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it on the pillow,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could try to talk to the doctor who\u2019s covering for Dr. Pardieu, but he has to hold her confidence, and if she wants to keep it secret, he can\u2019t tell us anything.\u201d</p><p>Several heartbeats later, Collins took Olivia\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s back, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Olivia allowed. Determined to be more positive, she added, \u201cAnd maybe not.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>Olivia had suffered a week from hell. The phones never stopped ringing; the threats never subsided, and because of the disruption she was inadvertently causing at the office, she\u2019d been forced to work at home. By Friday, she was feeling like a caged orangutan.</p><p>She pretty much looked like one, too. She continued to shower and brush her teeth every day, but getting dressed didn\u2019t seem all that necessary. Her new uniform was a pair of baggy sweats and an old faded T-shirt. She didn\u2019t bother with a bra or shoes and didn\u2019t do much of anything with her hair. Every morning she put it up in a ponytail, but by nightfall, most of it was hanging around her face. Her eating habits weren\u2019t much better. She walked around with a bag of chips\u2014the unhealthy kind\u2014and a Diet Coke.</p><p>She was sitting cross-legged on the floor with her laptop balanced on her knees and a pencil clutched in her teeth. She had just reached for a potato chip when there was an unexpected knock at the door. She stuck the pencil in her hair, popped the chip in her mouth, and went to answer it.</p><p>When the door opened, Grayson took one look at her and started laughing.</p><p>She dared him to criticize her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to tell her. In her present frame of mind, she wouldn\u2019t believe him if he told her that, no matter how she dressed, she was beautiful to him. Her face scrubbed clean and dressed in clothes that could pass for bag lady rejects, Olivia could still grace the cover of any glamour magazine.</p><p>The phone was ringing as he shut the door behind him and locked it. Another caller was leaving a threatening message.</p><p>\u201cHow many . . .\u201d Grayson began.</p><p>She shoved the bag of chips into his hand. \u201cHold that thought,\u201d she said as she rushed into the study to listen to the rest of the message.</p><p>The voice was an angry growl. \u201cYou got that, bitch? Bill and me are gonna hurt you because you took all that money. We\u2019re gonna . . .\u201d</p><p>Olivia picked up the phone before Grayson could get to her and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Bill and me\u2019\u2014it\u2019s \u2018Bill and I are going to hurt you\u2019\u2014dumb ass.\u201d She slammed the phone down.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart. I think it\u2019s time for you to get out for a little while,\u201d Grayson said calmly. He put his hands on her shoulders and guided her out of the study. She was as stiff as an ironing board.</p><p>\u201cHow can you want to be seen with me?\u201d She sounded pitiful. She realized she was feeling sorry for herself, but the phone calls were getting to her, and so was the isolation. She hadn\u2019t stepped outside her apartment since Monday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll change your clothes and put on shoes,\u201d he answered drily, as he pushed her along into her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to change my name,\u201d she said, \u201cand move to Europe where no one knows me. That\u2019s what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will get better,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She scoffed at his prediction. Grayson turned her around and tilted her chin up. \u201cSnorting isn\u2019t ladylike, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his comment, she said, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s really ironic? Natalie and my mother haven\u2019t gotten all these hostile calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly once. Natalie\u2019s been leaving her own horrible messages for me. I picked up yesterday when she called, and it was more of the same. She and Mother have gone into hiding, so these threatening calls aren\u2019t reaching them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want them to get the threatening calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m just saying . . .\u201d</p><p>The tenderness in his eyes warmed her heart, and suddenly the whining and complaining weren\u2019t all that satisfying.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have your gun with you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. If you want to risk it, we\u2019ll go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>The lopsided ponytail was driving him to distraction. He pulled the elastic band free and handed it to her. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. He traced the side of her jaw with his fingers, leaned down, and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you overwhelm me,\u201d she whispered. How could this gorgeous, sexy man want to be with her? He could have any woman in the world, and yet here he was.</p><p>\u201cOverwhelm, huh? I like that.\u201d</p><p>He looked a little too arrogantly pleased with himself. \u201cOnly sometimes, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a reservation at Veronique\u2019s in ninety minutes. You\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>She was astounded. Veronique\u2019s was the hottest restaurant in D.C. It had received rave reviews and had been booked solid every night since it opened.</p><p>\u201cIt takes six months to get a reservation there. How did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear the white dress.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cBut that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything in the car. Get moving.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to tell her again. She was already stripping out of her clothes in the bathroom before he pulled the bedroom door closed behind him. She showered and washed and dried her hair in record time. It took her longer to do her makeup. She was going for the pouty, sultry look. Her dark, smoky eye makeup made the color of her eyes more intense. After applying her red lipstick, she dropped her robe, sprayed perfume, and slipped into her lacy undergarments. Next came the dress. It was probably sinful to love a piece of clothing as much as she loved this dress, but it was so perfect. It was made in 1960, but it had never been worn . . . until tonight. She\u2019d paid a fortune for it at a vintage shop, and it was worth every dollar. It had a low-cut square neckline and long tapered sleeves that came just below her wrist. The straight skirt was short, just to her knees, and the fabric clung to every curve of her body. This dress was so spectacular, it would make any woman look and feel like a temptress.</p><p>And she was ready. After one last inspection in the full-length mirror, Olivia took a deep breath and opened the door without making a sound.</p><p>Grayson was standing by the window. His head was bent, and he was going through his text messages. He glanced up and saw her, and his reaction was instantaneous. His mouth suddenly went dry. He couldn\u2019t swallow, and breathing was impossible. She was stunning. He was so aroused, he would have sworn his blood was on fire coursing through his veins.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t need to hear any compliments. His smoldering eyes said it all.</p><p>A minute passed and then another, and he still hadn\u2019t said a word. He slowly began to walk toward her. The way he was looking at her made her heart race. If he were a panther, she was his prey, and every nerve in her body tensed in anticipation.</p><p>For Grayson, the primal need to touch her overrode caution. He stood in front of her, one hand on the small of her back, the other at her neck. He roughly twisted her hair around his fist, forced her head back, and growled, \u201cOpen your mouth for me,\u201d a scant second before his mouth covered hers. His tongue thrust inside, stroking hers, forcing her to respond. He savored the taste of her. For this moment in time she was completely his. No one else could have her. She belonged to him.</p><p>The scorching kiss ended. He lifted his head, and staring into her eyes, he slowly rubbed his thumb across her lips. He took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cI\u2019ll get your coat.\u201d</p><p>Olivia could barely get her wits about her. She hurried back into the bedroom to collect her evening bag. The kiss so rattled her, she\u2019d almost forgotten it. She caught a glimpse at her reflection in the mirror. Her lipstick had stayed on her lips. Impressive, she thought. Especially considering the way Grayson had tried to devour her. Just thinking about that kiss made her heartbeat quicken.</p><p>Grayson helped her with her coat and locked the door for her. He still hadn\u2019t said a word about her appearance, and for some reason she was inordinately pleased by that fact.</p><p>He had parked illegally in front of her building again. John was standing behind the counter talking to a policeman at the door. She slowed to greet them, but Grayson had her elbow and was in a hurry to get her in the car. Were there angry people outside waiting for her? Sleet was spitting across the windshield. Who would stand outside in this weather? She could feel a dark cloud closing in on her mood and rebelled against it. Not tonight. She was not going to be pessimistic and worry about anything. She was going to have the most wonderful evening with Grayson. No worries. No complications.</p><p>Once they were on their way, he finally spoke. \u201cI\u2019m gonna want you to keep your coat on during dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. He didn\u2019t join in. \u201cOh my . . . you\u2019re serious? I am not keeping my coat on while I eat.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cSo, you like the dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I tell you what I wanted to do to you when I saw you standing in the doorway?\u201d</p><p>Her face felt warm, and she knew she was blushing. \u201cThe dress isn\u2019t inappropriate . . . is it?\u201d</p><p>His slow smile caught her by surprise. \u201cNo, the dress is beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>He decided he might as well tell her the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s you. You\u2019re the problem.\u201d</p><p>Turning toward him, she folded her arms defensively. \u201cWould you care to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way you fill out the dress. It hugs your perfect, voluptuous body, and the sensual way you move in it . . . hell, it should be illegal.\u201d His voice was becoming more intense. \u201cYou\u2019re the sexiest woman I\u2019ve ever known, and in that dress . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cJust keep the coat on.\u201d</p><p>He thought her body was voluptuous? She fought the urge to look down at her chest. Wait a minute. . . . Was voluptuous a code word for \u201cfat\u201d? No, it couldn\u2019t be. Grayson wouldn\u2019t be looking at her that way if that\u2019s what he meant. He was telling her she looked hot. She smiled at him to let him know she appreciated the compliment, but he returned her smile with a frown.</p> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHow many other men have seen you in that dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis dress is a 1960 vintage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. This is the first time I\u2019ve worn it. I was waiting for a special occasion, and you did tell me to wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember the promise? As soon as you were convinced you had the right man behind bars for trying to kill me, you\u2019d pull the bodyguards and we\u2019d celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the gun\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cThe gun used to shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThat gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d</p><p>Grayson promised to tell her everything later. He pulled up to the restaurant entrance. A valet rushed forward to open Olivia\u2019s door while another attendant came around to give Grayson a claim ticket. He told the man to keep his car close.</p><p>Veronique\u2019s was a small bistro with a European flair. Grayson was watching the crowd as they entered. He thought every man there was staring at Olivia, and he didn\u2019t like that one little bit. She hadn\u2019t taken off her coat yet, but the second she\u2019d walked in, she had their attention.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to check your coat?\u201d the ma\u00cetre d\u2019 asked her when they stepped up to his podium.</p> <p>She looked at Grayson. \u201cWould I?\u201d</p><p>He muttered something she couldn\u2019t quite catch before he helped her remove her coat. He took her hand and headed to the bar. Like the sea parting, men stepped back on either side, making a path for her. It was actually comical, and had he not been feeling so possessive of her, Grayson might have laughed. Instead, he decided a little intimidation was called for, and he unbuttoned his suit jacket so that his badge and gun were visible.</p><p>Olivia also noticed the stares. Her reaction was panic. Ever since the scandal with her father had hit the news, various photos of the MacKenzies had been plastered on all the media. There were quite a few pictures of her parents and her sister attending parties, and since Olivia was never with them, she hadn\u2019t expected she\u2019d be so easily recognized.</p><p>She turned back to Grayson and whispered into his ear. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure this was a good idea. I think some of these people might know who I am. They\u2019re staring. Maybe we should leave.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her waist and pulled her close. \u201cIt\u2019s the dress they\u2019re staring at.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the dress, of course. They were staring at a beautiful woman.</p><p>The maitre d\u2019 appeared and told them their table was ready. Grayson didn\u2019t like the first choice\u2014the table was in the middle of the room\u2014but another was available against the wall near the back. It was more intimate.</p><p>Once Olivia was seated with a menu in front of her, she began to relax. Her back was to the other diners, and she decided she would let Grayson handle any problems tonight. If anyone wanted to get in her face and yell at her because of what her father had done, she would let Grayson shoo him away. She was not going to let anyone or anything mar her evening.</p><p>She tried to ask Grayson for the details about the gun, but he shook his head and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk after dinner. Every time I think about you getting shot, I get angry, real angry. I don\u2019t want to ruin my appetite.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to the menu. Each selection was written in French with the English translation below. Everything sounded wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cPotato chips didn\u2019t do it for you?\u201d</p><p>A waiter placed a silver basket filled with freshly baked bread and a small silver disk with sweet, creamy butter on the table.</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu would like this restaurant,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Grayson\u2019s cell phone vibrated. He pulled it out of his pocket to see who was calling, then quickly got up from the table. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019ve got to take this.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gone long. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Olivia, but we have to leave. Henry\u2019s on his way to the emergency room to get stitches. It doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d he rushed to add when the color left Olivia\u2019s face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask questions until they were in the car. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to a birthday party at one of those indoor playgrounds. I guess he tried to do a summersault into some kind of ball pit and didn\u2019t quite make it. Ralph\u2019s father thinks Henry will need about six stitches in his forehead. Ralph is Henry\u2019s best friend, and he doesn\u2019t have a brain in his head either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry\u2019s a smart little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut he also just turned nine, and at that age, caution isn\u2019t a word he\u2019s familiar with.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they were walking into the emergency room lobby. Ralph and his father were in the waiting area. As soon as they saw Grayson, they hurried over.</p><p>\u201cHenry\u2019s getting an X-ray to make sure he doesn\u2019t have a concussion. Who\u2019s this?\u201d the father asked, thrusting his hand out to Olivia.</p><p>Grayson made the introductions. \u201cOlivia, this is Dr. Ralph Jones.\u201d</p><p>The doctor wasn\u2019t letting go of Olivia\u2019s hand. Staring intently at her, he said, \u201cI\u2019m an ophthalmologist. A divorced ophthalmologist. Would you like to sit with Ralph Junior and me while Grayson checks on Henry?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Grayson thought. Ralph was hitting on her. Grayson put his arm around her shoulder and said, \u201cShe works for the IRS.\u201d</p><p>A pallor came over the doctor, but he quickly recovered. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to, I suppose. Why don\u2019t you tell me all about your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming with me,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cLet go of her, Jones. You don\u2019t need to stay now that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia softened the harshness of his command. \u201cI\u2019d like to sit with Henry.\u201d</p><p>She noticed a nurse waving to her. It was Kathleen from the chemo ward. Olivia excused herself and went to say hello. \u201cWhat are you doing in the ER?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were short staffed, so I\u2019m filling in,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you doing, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you certainly are,\u201d she replied, looking past Olivia to Grayson. \u201cThat\u2019s one fine man you\u2019ve got there.\u201d</p><p>Olivia agreed. Grayson was one fine man.</p><p>\u201cHas Jane been admitted again?\u201d Kathleen asked. She knew everything that went on inside the hospital, and she\u2019d made it a point to keep up with all the Pips. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia answered, \u201cnot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane certainly has had a rough go of it,\u201d Kathleen said.</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s doing better, but I don\u2019t believe her. Neither does Collins or Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Pardieu is back from his medical conference, and you know what a miracle worker he is. He\u2019ll sort it all out. Why are you here then?\u201d</p><p>After Olivia quickly explained, Kathleen called radiology to see how much longer Henry would be. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way up now. Did you have a big evening planned? You\u2019re all dressed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner at Veronique\u2019s,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fancy,\u201d Kathleen said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen you with makeup on. You look lovely. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Olivia unbuttoned her coat and held it open. \u201cGorgeous,\u201d Kathleen raved. \u201cThe fabric is divine.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had finished the paperwork and came up behind Olivia. Kathleen introduced herself and asked, \u201cHave you and Olivia been dating long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2014\u201d Olivia began. She\u2019d seen the speculative look in Kathleen\u2019s eyes and thought she should explain that they weren\u2019t actually dating, that the evening was more of an obligation for Grayson because of the investigation.</p><p>Grayson cut her off. \u201cFor a while now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen you know Olivia\u2019s a hellion, don\u2019t you?\u201d the nurse said, smiling. \u201cShe gave us such trouble when she was about your nephew\u2019s age. Made all of us love coming to work just to see what she\u2019d do next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathleen\u2019s being polite,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a holy terror back then.\u201d</p><p>Grayson leaned down and whispered, \u201cBack then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy break\u2019s over,\u201d Kathleen said. She hugged Olivia. \u201cThey\u2019ll put Henry back in bay four. It\u2019s the second curtain on your left. Why don\u2019t you wait in there?\u201d</p><p>As soon as Kathleen hurried away, Olivia said, \u201cI should stay out here. Have Ralph and Ralph left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut you\u2019re coming with me. Henry will be happy to see you. He asks about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d she asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he does. I have to make up all sorts of terrible stories about you.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the curtained-off bay Kathleen had pointed out. Henry\u2019s shoes were on a chair in the corner with his coat. There was another chair on the opposite side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit here while I go see what\u2019s taking so long,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>He was on his way to the elevators when the doors opened, and Henry was wheeled out by an orderly. The child had blood all over his face. There was a jagged cut that started at the top of his hairline above his right temple and ended at the tip of his eyebrow. He also had a bloody nose.</p><p>Grayson\u2019s breath caught when he saw all the blood, but he concealed his appalled reaction because Henry was watching him. \u201cHow are you doing, Henry?\u201d he asked, his voice filled with sympathy.</p><p>The child was trying hard not to cry. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d he whispered as he was wheeled past. \u201cRalph said they\u2019re going to put a needle in my head. A big one,\u201d he added worriedly.</p><p>Henry spotted Olivia just as the orderly stopped the wheelchair. He was so happy to see her, he bolted out of the wheelchair and ran to her. She was getting up when he threw himself into her arms, nearly knocking her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t . . .\u201d Grayson called. But it was too late. Henry had his arms around Olivia\u2019s waist, and his bloody face was pressed against her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came to see me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly have had more than your share of injuries lately, haven\u2019t you?\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve done to your face.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and looked up at her. \u201cThe nurse cleaned it, but it started bleeding again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA lot,\u201d he admitted. He noticed the front of Olivia\u2019s dress was covered in his blood, and he became teary eyed again. \u201cI ruined your pretty dress.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was filled with tenderness. She brushed his hair out of his eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s old.\u201d</p><p>Henry moved on to his major concern. \u201cThey\u2019re going to put a needle in my head.\u201d</p><p>Grayson stood there watching her as she listened to Henry\u2019s worries. She couldn\u2019t have cared less about the dress now. All she wanted to do was comfort the child.</p><p>Grayson\u2019s heart swelled with his love for her. He probably should tell her how he felt, he supposed, but he knew what would happen. She would panic and bolt. He understood how her mind worked now. She\u2019d run, all right. She wouldn\u2019t get far, though, because he was determined to spend the rest of his life with her. Getting her to agree was going to be a challenge.</p><p>Grayson filed the problem away for another time and went to his nephew. He picked him up and placed him on the bed, then tilted his head to the side so he could get a better look at the damage.</p><p>\u201cDid you break your nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t, and he doesn\u2019t have a concussion.\u201d The emergency-room physician gave the news. \u201cHe just banged his head. The plastic surgeon on call is already here finishing up with another patient. I thought, because of where the cut is, a plastic surgeon should do the repair. He wants me to go ahead and numb the area and clean it.\u201d</p><p>A nurse placed a metal tray on the counter. Henry spotted the needle and grabbed his uncle\u2019s arm. Grayson calmly assured him that the needle would take away the hurt, and as soon as the area was numbed, Henry relaxed. By the time the plastic surgeon arrived, Henry was laughing at a story Olivia had told him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t leave the hospital until after ten, and Henry was sound asleep in the back of Grayson\u2019s car before they pulled out of the hospital drive.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Grayson said to Olivia as he checked on his nephew in his rearview mirror. \u201cHaving you there made it easier on Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad he\u2019s okay,\u201d she answered. \u201cHenry\u2019s a great little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about tonight,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe evening didn\u2019t exactly turn out the way I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are more important things than dinner at a swanky restaurant,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate another time,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me about the gun,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAre you sure they\u2019ve found the gun that shot me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, ballistics confirmed it. It\u2019s a match. No question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Martin\u2019s house. They found it inside Martin\u2019s house. No fingerprints, though. The weapon had been wiped clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the police had already gone through that house from top to bottom. How could they have missed anything? And how did they know to search again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA guy called. He didn\u2019t give a name, just identified himself as a neighbor. He said his son and some of his friends had gone into the abandoned house and found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was Martin after all. A simple motive: revenge,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sort of hoping Simmons had done it. He could have found out about Jorguson and Martin and planted the gun. I was hoping my father\u2019s sleazy partner would never see the light of day again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wish may come true anyway,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe picked him up at his D.C. office. He was just beginning to shred documents when we got there. We\u2019ll not only indict him for his part in your attempted kidnapping, but if we find what we think we\u2019ll find in those files, we\u2019ll be able to get him for his part in your father\u2019s Ponzi scheme as well. Unfortunately, he\u2019s already posted bail so he\u2019s free for now, but he\u2019s got a lot of prison time ahead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was Martin who shot me, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut finding the weapon . . .\u201d The sentence trailed off, and he shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what this means? With Martin locked up, the case is closed. My case anyway. No more bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling until he reminded, \u201cAnd all the death threats on your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The burst of optimism was gone. How could she have forgotten the calls?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bodyguards stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for a few more days,\u201d she conceded. \u201cSurely, all the anger about my father will die down soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take longer than a few days.\u201d</p> <p>She knew he was right. \u201cI\u2019m paying the bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She counted to ten. It didn\u2019t help. \u201cI\u2019m going to insist.\u201d</p><p>The set of his jaw told her he was going to be stubborn. \u201cInsist all you want.\u201d</p><p>She decided to table the discussion since she wasn\u2019t winning. Besides, her asthma was kicking up. The cold night air had triggered the wheezing. She opened her purse and only then realized she didn\u2019t have her inhaler.</p><p>\u201cGrayson . . .\u201d</p><p>He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out an inhaler. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>She used it and, without thinking, handed it back to him. It wasn\u2019t until he drove into his garage that she realized where he was taking her.</p> <p>\u201cYou should have dropped me at my building. There\u2019s a guard right inside the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you home yet. We haven\u2019t had dinner.\u201d</p><p>He parked the car and came around to open her door. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is open,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to prepare a gourmet dinner for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about hot dogs?\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Olivia tried to say good night to Grayson at her door, but he was having none of it. He backed her into her apartment, kicked the door shut, and jerked her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>From gentleman to caveman, she thought. The transformation was extremely arousing. She tried to remember why she shouldn\u2019t go to bed with him. Oh yes, they needed to talk. \u201cGrayson, I need to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. I want you now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to argue. He kissed her hard and then proceeded to tell her in the most graphic detail exactly how he was going to make love to her. By the time he finished, her legs had turned to Jell-O.</p><p>He was waiting for her permission. She wrapped her arms around his neck and spread her fingers up into his hair. \u201cYou do have a way with words,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Just tonight, she promised herself. Just one more night. Then she would make him leave.</p><p>Their need for each other was fierce, and their lovemaking was wild. Grayson wasn\u2019t gentle, nor was she. Her lips were swollen from his kisses, and his shoulders wore scratches from her demanding touch. When Grayson finally summoned enough strength to move away from her, he was panting for breath, and his body was covered with a fine sheen of perspiration. Her scent mingled with his, clinging to the air around them.</p><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d Olivia sighed.</p><p>\u201cYour voice is hoarse,\u201d Grayson told her.</p><p>\u201cI might have screamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have?\u201d he asked, grinning. \u201cYou were . . . demanding. I got a little rough, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a little rough, too.\u201d</p><p>Now or never, he thought to himself. It may not be the best timing, but he was going for it regardless, while she was still recovering. He moved so quickly, she didn\u2019t have time to react. Pinning her to the bed, he said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d He cupped the sides of her face with his hands, holding her captive.</p><p>She looked wary. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Tears came into her eyes. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t love me. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeated firmly.</p><p>\u201cGrayson . . .\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cYou love me, too.\u201d</p><p>She pushed against him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell think it does.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. She tried to get up, but he grabbed her hand and pulled her back down. She landed on top of him. Holding her prisoner with his arm wrapped around her, he forced her head down on his shoulder and said, \u201cCalm down, sweetheart. It\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>The irony in the situation wasn\u2019t lost on him. He was having to soothe her because he\u2019d told her he loved her.</p><p>Olivia was desperately trying not to cry. \u201cI let this go too far,\u201d she whispered against the side of his neck. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have. I knew better. I really did, but you\u2019re so irresistible, and I\u2019m weak when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>He decided to ignore her ramblings. \u201cI want you in my bed every night,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI want to wake up with you beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her reaction wasn\u2019t what he would consider an encouraging one. She bolted upright and in a near shout said, \u201cOh God, no.\u201d</p><p>At the very least he should have been insulted. The appalled look on her face did smack at his ego. He didn\u2019t get upset, though, because he was pretty sure he knew what was going on inside that wonderful, but decidedly warped, mind of hers.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me,\u201d he demanded. His hand moved to the nape of her neck, and he tugged on her hair, forcing her to look at him. \u201cTell me. I know you do. I want to hear you say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. A single tear escaped and slowly trailed down her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The tightness in his chest immediately eased. Although he already knew how she felt, he needed her to acknowledge it. The rest was up to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t marry you, Grayson. I can\u2019t marry you. You need to move on without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Collins and Jane and Samantha? Can they ever get married? Will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do my friends have to do with this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey have everything to do with this. And so does Dr. Andre Pardieu. Your friends were in the same experimental program under his supervision.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. She dropped down beside him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He began to stroke her back and could feel how tense she was. \u201cYour aunt told me a little about that period in your life. You were in the hospital a long time, weren\u2019t you?\u201d She refused to answer. He wasn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI know your family didn\u2019t come to see you. You were all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was glad of it,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI saw what my friends\u2019 families went through. It was horrible for them. I can still see their faces, their anguish.\u201d</p><p>She remembered what Sam had once said after her family had visited. They\u2019d all been crying, and Sam told her that maybe it would be better if she died because then they would be at peace.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s going to come back,\u201d he said very matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want anyone you love to go through that agony. Right?\u201d</p><p>She kept silent.</p><p>\u201cDo your friends share your fatalistic attitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re realists like I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His fingers gently trailed down her spine. \u201cSo you are willing to live your life waiting for death? What the hell, Olivia? Do you not see how crazy that is?\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly furious. She pushed away from him and got out of bed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you understand or not,\u201d she cried. She grabbed her silk robe and put it on. Her hands were shaking so, she could barely get the sash tied. \u201cFatalist? Ask Jane how she\u2019s feeling these days.\u201d She threaded her fingers through her hair in agitation. \u201cOf the four of us, she\u2019s the most optimistic, but what good does that do? It\u2019s come back. I know it has, and oh God, poor Logan. He\u2019s only just become her brother again, and now he\u2019s going to go through hell. All those years he drank and used drugs, he was so horrible to her, and he\u2019s desperately trying to make up for the past, but it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t know what will happen to him when she dies.\u201d Tears streamed down her face. \u201cAnd Henry. What about him, Grayson? He\u2019s already lost his mother. Do you want him to watch me die?\u201d She put her hands up. \u201cI\u2019m done talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Grayson wanted to go to her, to comfort her, but in her nearly hysterical state, he knew she\u2019d fight him. He sat up, casually leaned against the headboard, and said, \u201cOkay. My mistake. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>His blas\u00e9 tone confused her. She took a step toward him. \u201cNever mind what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe proposal. Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me. I have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>She slowly walked over to the side of the bed. He put his hands on her h*ps and pulled her onto his lap. A wary look in her eyes, she faced him with her hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI want you to give Dr. Pardieu permission to talk to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her grip on his shoulders tightened. \u201cWhy? I thought you understood what I just said. Now that you have the right man locked up, my case is closed. You must move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m moving on,\u201d he agreed a bit quickly. \u201cI still want to talk to the doctor, and he can\u2019t tell me anything unless you give permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do this, Olivia. First thing in the morning,\u201d he ordered, leaving no room for negotiation.</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to call me a dumb ass?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m thinking it,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we had our talk, and I understand. You aren\u2019t going to marry me, and you hope that I\u2019ll get on with my life . . . my life without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cWhen you leave here, that\u2019s exactly what I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You give Pardieu permission to talk to me about you, and after that conversation, you\u2019ll never see me again. That\u2019s my condition.\u201d</p><p>Never see him again. The thought made her sick.</p><p>\u201cYes, all right.\u201d</p><p>Grayson untied her belt and opened her robe, uncovering her beautiful breasts. She was so lovely. His fingers caressed her soft, flawless skin.</p><p>Olivia was confused. She didn\u2019t want him to stop touching her, and yet she wanted him to go.</p><p>\u201cEverything will change when I leave here. I know that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he told her. He pushed the robe off her shoulders. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t left yet.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>Grayson had been up half the night working at his computer. It was amazing how much confidential information was available when one had the right credentials and knew where to look.</p><p>Olivia had said that it would have been easy for Simmons to find out about her connection to Jorguson and Martin, and that was true. Her entire life was there with a push of a button, including the names of her employers. Simmons had obviously gained access to that information because he\u2019d called them to try to discredit her.</p><p>Yes, it would have been easy for Simmons to plant the gun in Martin\u2019s house. He considered the possibility while he showered and got dressed. It was Sunday morning, and he was getting ready to leave for the office. He knew Ronan was already there, catching up on his own reports.</p><p>In the kitchen, Henry was having breakfast with his grandfather and Patrick. The two men were getting a blow-by-blow of what had happened the night before. Grayson heard Henry boast that Olivia had come to the hospital and had insisted on holding his hand while he got stitches. He also mentioned once again that she was his very own attorney, which the men knew was his segue into the story of what had happened in the principal\u2019s office.</p><p>Grayson poured himself a glass of orange juice and pulled out a chair across from his nephew. \u201cHas there been any change in plans?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cGrandfather is going to take Ralph and me to the movie, but Ralph has to go home after because\u201d\u2014he glanced at his grandfather before continuing\u2014\u201cbecause he can only take so much of Ralph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Patrick said, smiling.</p><p>Grayson nodded. Ralph was a little on the wild and loud side, but then, so was Henry. Together they sometimes sounded like a tornado.</p><p>\u201cHenry, how would you feel about me marrying Olivia?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>Henry\u2019s eyes clouded with worry. \u201cWill you move away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she would move in here with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me and Patrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill you have a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to marry her.\u201d He bowed his head and stared at his cereal bowl.</p><p>\u201cWe know you like Olivia,\u201d his grandfather said. \u201cYou talk about her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Henry wouldn\u2019t look up. \u201cI do like her. I just don\u2019t want Grayson to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us why,\u201d Patrick insisted. \u201cWe want to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Henry glanced at his grandfather, received his encouraging nod, and turned to Grayson. \u201cBecause if you have a wedding, you have to ask my father, and he\u2019ll come back here and take me away.\u201d</p><p>Grayson was surprised by Henry\u2019s response. The child\u2019s anxiety was almost palpable. He shouldn\u2019t have such a worry, Grayson thought. He sat quietly while his father tried to calm the boy\u2019s fears. \u201cWe would never let that happen. Never.\u201d</p><p>Grayson explained that he had full custody, but that didn\u2019t make much difference to Henry.</p><p>It was Patrick who finally convinced him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have your own attorney?\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cYou know I do. It\u2019s Olivia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll let your father take you away?\u201d</p><p>Henry didn\u2019t have to think about it long. \u201cNo.\u201d He smiled then. He looked at Grayson and added, \u201cIf I tell her, she won\u2019t let you invite my father.\u201d</p><p>Grayson laughed. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre congratulations in order?\u201d his father asked. \u201cYou do know I\u2019ve yet to meet this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAnd, no, congratulations aren\u2019t in order. She\u2019s being difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to ask her?\u201d Henry offered.</p> <p>Patrick gave his opinion. \u201cYou might have a better chance with the kid.\u201d</p><p>It was the last time Grayson smiled the rest of the day. When he got to the office, he told Ronan about Olivia\u2019s hope regarding Simmons, and after tossing the football for a few minutes, the two decided on a plan of action.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt,\u201d Ronan said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Just to be sure,\u201d Grayson replied.</p><p>For the next several hours, both he and Ronan caught up on their case files. It was late afternoon before Grayson finished his last report. He had just logged off his computer when his cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cGrayson Kincaid?\u201d The voice had a thick French accent.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Andre Pardieu. Olivia MacKenzie asked that I give you a call. She has authorized me to discuss her medical history and her prognosis with you. What would you like to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you for calling, Doctor. I know you\u2019re a busy man, so I\u2019ll get right to the point. I\u2019m in love with Olivia and I want to marry her, but she\u2019s a very stubborn woman.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Pardieu laughed. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve known that for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia is afraid to commit. She fears that her cancer will return. She sees her friend Jane so ill, and that has convinced her she can\u2019t make plans for the future. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to persuade her, but I figure if I got some assurance from you, I\u2019d have a better chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t discuss Jane\u2019s case specifically, but I can tell you that Olivia should not be concerned. I\u2019ve been away from the hospital and haven\u2019t been able to give this latest development my full attention, but now that I\u2019m back, I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of it. Let me assure you, Olivia has not shown any symptoms of toxemia, so, from what I\u2019ve seen, she has nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d Grayson said.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Dr. Pardieu said. \u201cOlivia deserves some happiness, and I hope she\u2019ll find it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. That\u2019s my plan,\u201d Grayson assured him before he ended the call.</p><p>Grayson sat back in his chair and thought about what the doctor had said. Something stuck in his mind. Toxemia was a general term for blood poisoning, wasn\u2019t it? He booted up his computer again. He began feeding in data, and that only created more questions. When he ended his search, he told Ronan what he had discovered. They knew whom they had to talk to and what information they needed to gather. By late afternoon, their questions had been answered, and he phoned Dr. Pardieu right away. If the doctor confirmed his suspicions\u2014and Grayson was certain he would\u2014he needed to act immediately. Time was critical.</p><p>* *</p><p>Olivia tried to keep busy so she wouldn\u2019t think about Grayson, but that was impossible. Sam called, and even with a horrible connection, she knew something was wrong. She heard it in Olivia\u2019s voice. The questions came, one after the other, until Olivia was close to tears.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about him,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cTell me the story again, Sam. It will take my mind off my miserable life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve heard that stupid\u2014though amazingly incredible\u2014story at least five times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like twenty, but tell me again. It makes me laugh every time I hear it.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s sigh was loud and clear even with the static. \u201cThere I was, minding my own business in seat twenty-eight A on flight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven forty-three,\u201d Olivia supplied.</p><p>\u201cThe plane was packed, and it was noisy, but I\u2019d blocked it all out because I was frantically studying for a final I had to take the next morning at zero eight hundred. The flight was making good time and I, along with everyone else, thought everything was just fine, when a flight attendant tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to come with her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia added the details she remembered. \u201cYou shoved your notebook into your flight bag and dragged it with you. You thought you were being upgraded to first class for some bizarre reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I thought. Clever deduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I go on?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou want to, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes,\u201d she said, her voice eager. \u201cYou and Collins and Jane are the only ones I can brag to. My brothers are so sick of hearing this story, they groan whenever I bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not groaning,\u201d she assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful plane,\u201d she continued. \u201cA jet, of course, with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get technical again. Suffice it to say it was pretty.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed and continued, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a jumbo jet, but it was still pretty, I suppose. Anyway, I followed the perky flight attendant past first class, noticing that all the seats were occupied. I started to get a bad feeling, but the flight attendant was smiling and acting like nothing was out of the ordinary. She said that she\u2019d heard me tell another passenger that I\u2019d gone through the Air Force Academy. I hadn\u2019t said anything to any of the passengers, and I was about to correct her when she said in a rather loud voice that the captain had also gone through the academy and wanted to say hello. That didn\u2019t make any sense, and she could tell I was going to argue. She knew the cockpit door was locked while the flight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t cite regulations. Get to the good part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attendant whispered \u2018please,\u2019 then tapped on the door\u2014that crazy smile on her face all the while\u2014and the door opened, and she pushed me inside. And I mean pushed me,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go into a long description of this part,\u201d Olivia pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to. The whole crew was throwing up into these plastic bags, and it began to dawn on me: they must have gone through their passenger list looking for a pilot. It smelled so vile in the cockpit, the attendant gagged. I didn\u2019t, of course. I grew up with such gross brothers. That, plus going through chemo . . . nothing really gets to me.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, their complexions were lime green and they were throwing up what looked like chunks of bile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Sam. Don\u2019t be so . . . visual.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed. \u201cI naturally thought the worst, that they had been poisoned, but the captain told me they had just been on a flight where several passengers became quite ill. It took two of us to get the copilot out of his seat and move him. You know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you have to tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the midst of dry heaving, the captain gave me instructions. As you know, I\u2019ve flown just about everything with wings,\u201d she boasted. \u201cThis plane wasn\u2019t a challenge. I told him to relax; I\u2019d take over. The attendant came back in with a napkin over her mouth and nose because of the awful smell that I\u2019d kind of gotten used to, and she told me some of the passengers knew something was wrong and were getting nervous. The captain flipped on the intercom to calm them down. He still thought he was going to land the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know the intercom was left on,\u201d Olivia interjected.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t have argued with the captain if I\u2019d known passengers were listening, and he was so sick, he forgot. He looked like he was going to pass out any second. I told him to relax, that I could handle it, and I began to familiarize myself with the control panel and do a couple of maneuvers to get the feel of the plane.</p><p>\u201cThe poor captain\u2019s eyes kept closing, and he was struggling to stay conscious. He said that, on final approach to the runway, I must instruct the passengers to get into a crash position. I tried not to take insult, and I asked him why would I want to do that, and we got into a bit of an argument.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cA bit of an argument? I heard the recording. It was more than a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe passengers recorded the conversation? You can\u2019t do anything these days without someone documenting it. I swear, our privacy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting off track, Sam,\u201d Olivia reminded.</p><p>\u201cYes, okay. So even though I tried not to take insult, I was insulted. I mean, how could I not be? I tried to explain my position, and I listed all the different planes I\u2019d flown, and I ended my litany by saying that I am a pilot in the United States Air Force, and I have been trained by the finest. Air Force fighter pilots don\u2019t crash planes. I also told him I could understand his reticence if I were a crop duster or even a Navy pilot, but come on . . . I\u2019m Air Force. Didn\u2019t he realize how superior we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also said\u2014and I\u2019m quoting\u2014\u2018We are the best pilots in the world.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d she countered, and Olivia could picture her friend shrugging. \u201cSo I might have said something like that. Yes, it was ego, but the passengers calmed down. At least, that\u2019s what the attendant told me. She also said there were three passengers in the back of the cabin throwing up. Whatever that virus was, it was quick and powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did instruct all of them to get into crash position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because the captain insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you said, your exact words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me. It was all over the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just explained that the captain and the copilot were under the weather and that I would be landing the plane. I also said that, even though I personally did not believe it was necessary, they all should get into crash position, and I only hoped they were as insulted as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on approach I saw all the fire trucks and the ambulances, and I might have said something to the tower about getting them the hell off my runway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also told the passengers that the landing would be the smoothest they\u2019d ever experienced. It was, too,\u201d she asserted. \u201cNot a single bump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard on the news,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cThe tower thought we should use the chute, but I got them to let us park at the gate because it would be much easier to get all of the sick off the plane that way. Once we opened the door, I got out of the way so the paramedics could get into the cockpit. I waited a long time in the galley while all the passengers filed off, but then I saw what time it was, and I knew my ride was waiting for me at baggage claim. I put on my baseball cap and my jacket, grabbed my flight bag, and headed into the terminal. I was relieved no one stopped me because I had to get back to base before curfew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I did. I had to,\u201d she explained. \u201cRandy was driving three of us back. He\u2019d already picked up the others, and I didn\u2019t want them to be late, too.\u201d</p><p>She sighed before she continued, \u201cI had this stupid hope it would blow over. You know, no big deal, right? Unfortunately, it was all over the news. I got back in plenty of time, and after I dropped my bag in my room, I went to report to my commander. That was mortifying. He was in a bar with some other officers\u2014a sports bar\u2014and there were jumbo screens all over the place. I asked him for a moment alone and quickly explained what had happened. I also told him I thought the newsmen would try to get on base, and if they wanted any interviews, I was going to assume he\u2019d handle them. He didn\u2019t like me dumping it in his lap, but I argued I had an exam the next morning, and I needed to concentrate on that. The commander is never in a good mood, but he was that evening, and it was only later that I found out why. He\u2019d heard what I\u2019d said about being superior to the Navy. He liked that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgo,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAll of you pilots have major egos.\u201d Olivia heard a beep on the line, indicating there was a call waiting. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d she said after she looked at the screen.</p><p>\u201cWait. Don\u2019t you want to hear about the press conference? It was really hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was,\u201d she agreed. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t hear more. Jane\u2019s beeping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cE-mail me after you talk to her,\u201d Sam said, \u201cand tell her I\u2019ll call her this week.\u201d</p><p>Olivia said good-bye and switched to Jane\u2019s call. Her friend was phoning to invite Olivia to dinner. She insisted that she come because Logan was making a special roast with fresh herbs. Although Olivia really didn\u2019t want to go out\u2014the weather had turned nasty and it was beginning to sleet\u2014she did want to see Jane and make sure she was all right. She would pretend that everything was fine, but Olivia would know the truth as soon as she looked at her face. She told Jane she\u2019d be there in an hour.</p><p>The nasty phone calls about her father had subsided\u2014there were only two that morning\u2014and, at Olivia\u2019s insistence, Grayson had canceled the guard at her door as long as she promised to call one of them if she chose to leave. Since Jane lived just a short distance away, Olivia decided she\u2019d be safe if she took extra precautions. John, the doorman, kept her informed about the number of reporters trying to get in the building to interview her. He had warned her that some of them sat in their cars, waiting, so, before leaving her apartment, she called down to John. The sleet was working to her advantage, he told her. There weren\u2019t any cars on the street tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John escorted her to her car in the parking garage and watched her pull out onto the street. Olivia drove around in circles until she was convinced she wasn\u2019t being followed, then headed over to Dupont Circle where Jane lived.</p><p>Jane\u2019s three-story townhouse was quite small, but there was an art studio on the top floor. The converted attic was the reason Jane had purchased the space because the light coming in through the windows was perfect for her work.</p><p>Logan opened the door. He looked surprised to see her.</p><p>\u201cJane didn\u2019t tell you she invited me?\u201d Olivia asked.</p> <p>Logan stepped back to let her inside. \u201cI\u2019m sure she did. I just forgot. Don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s plenty of roast.\u201d</p><p>Olivia followed him into the living room. The room was dark except for the glow from the fire he\u2019d started in the hearth. He switched on a lamp, and she could see how haggard he looked.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s upstairs resting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d he replied. He was looking everywhere but at her. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cLet her rest awhile longer,\u201d Olivia said. She nodded toward the kitchen. \u201cSomething smells wonderful. Can I help?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let me keep you. I\u2019ll occupy myself until Jane comes down.\u201d She pointed to a stack of magazines on the coffee table. \u201cI can do some reading.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Logan went into the kitchen, Olivia picked up the magazine on top of the pile and sat down on the sofa. She flipped through the pages. Nothing caught her attention, so she placed it back on the table. She then spotted a laptop sitting on the floor next to an easy chair. She hadn\u2019t read the newspaper, and she thought she\u2019d pull up the Times and catch up on the latest happenings. She knew Jane wouldn\u2019t mind if she used her computer for a few minutes.</p><p>Olivia reached for the computer and lifted the lid. The dark screen came to life, and an open page appeared. The title at the top caught her attention: \u201cThe Pathological Effects of Arsenic Ingestion.\u201d What an odd subject to be reading about, Olivia thought. She hit the key to return to the previous page, and then the page before that. It didn\u2019t take long for her to realize she wasn\u2019t holding Jane\u2019s computer at all. It was Logan\u2019s.</p><p>Logan\u2019s voice called from the kitchen. \u201cWhen do you give her blood again, Olivia?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia quickly closed the computer and placed it on the floor where she\u2019d found it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Logan walked into the living room, drying his hands on a dish towel. He glanced at the stairs, making sure Jane wasn\u2019t there, and lowered his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s talking crazy. She won\u2019t tell you, but she\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d He walked closer and in a whisper said, \u201cI think she might kill herself. That\u2019s how depressed she is.\u201d</p><p>Olivia moved to the side so that Logan would turn his head toward the light and she could see his eyes more clearly. She took a step back. She was so rattled, she couldn\u2019t think what to say. Her hand went to her throat. \u201cOh God,\u201d she gasped. His pupils were dilated as big as saucers.</p><p>Logan patted her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve moved into the guest room so I can watch her. It will actually work out for the best. My meetings are a few blocks away, and I can go more often. Next to Jane, of course, my sobriety is the most important thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, trying to stay calm. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been cooking for her so she\u2019ll keep her strength. You\u2019re doing everything you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get Jane. Please don\u2019t tell her what I said. It will only upset her, and she won\u2019t confide in me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she agreed.</p> <p>He stopped at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cDo you mind if we eat right away? I\u2019ve got a meeting to get to. They help me stay sober,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to call Grayson, but by the time she dug her cell phone out of her purse, Jane and Logan were joining her.</p><p>\u201cGo sit at the table,\u201d Logan told his sister. \u201cThe roast will dry up if I don\u2019t get it out of the oven. I\u2019ll go ahead and scoop it out on the plates.\u201d He disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Grayson today?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call him now,\u201d Olivia answered.</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wanted to cry. Jane looked like hell, and she\u2019d lost so much weight. She waited until her friend took a seat at the table, then walked into the living room and called Grayson. He answered on the second ring. His greeting wasn\u2019t polite.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you? I just left your apartment. You were supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Jane\u2019s, Grayson,\u201d she said. \u201cLogan\u2019s here.\u201d She was just about to tell him about her suspicions, but Logan came into the living room. She quickly said, \u201cGrayson, I\u2019ll call you back. It shouldn\u2019t be long, Grayson.\u201d She ended the call quickly. Logan was standing there, listening. Plastering a smile on her face, she went to join her dearest friend and her psychopath brother.</p><p>The plates were already on the table. Logan had prepared them, and they all looked the same, except for one thing. Olivia noticed that Jane\u2019s plate had a sprig of parsley on the side. Logan\u2019s didn\u2019t, and neither did hers.</p><p>She went to Jane, kissed her on the cheek, and hugged her. She took her place at one end of the table. Logan took the other.</p><p>\u201cLogan, do you have any pepper?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>The second he disappeared into the kitchen, Olivia grabbed Jane\u2019s plate and switched it with Logan\u2019s. She switched the parsley, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Olivia put her finger to her lips, a sign to keep silent. Jane nodded but continued to frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this orange stuff?\u201d she asked Logan when he returned.</p><p>\u201cMashed sweet potatoes. Jane loves them. Some nights, that\u2019s all she eats.\u201d</p><p>Logan ate his dinner quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be late for the meeting,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Olivia moved the food around on her plate, but didn\u2019t eat any of it.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was, but I guess I\u2019m not feeling very well. Grayson and I had a fight,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t know how much longer she could keep silent. Jane was repeating a story Collins had told her, and Olivia noticed she had eaten every bit of the mashed sweet potatoes, and so had Logan.</p><p>She dragged dinner out as long as she could, telling two stories about Jane, praying that Grayson would get there soon. She hoped she\u2019d said his name enough times for him to figure out that she was in trouble. Jane\u2019s home wasn\u2019t far from Olivia\u2019s apartment. She had just finished her second story and was frantically trying to think of a third when Jane said, \u201cOkay, Olivia, dinner\u2019s over. Tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you switched my plate with my brother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>If Olivia had any doubts, they were all erased in that second. Logan leapt to his feet, overturning his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d he screamed.</p><p>Jane looked thunderstruck by his behavior. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Olivia kept her attention on Logan. Oh, this was going to be bad, she thought . . . really bad . . . for she could see the rage coming over him.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2019s been poisoning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he roared. \u201cWhy would you tell such a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are dilated, which tells me you\u2019re using again,\u201d she began. \u201cYou have a very interesting website on your computer, all about arsenic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God . . .\u201d Jane whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he was worried you would kill yourself, Jane. Laying the groundwork, I suppose. I guess you were taking too long to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Logan shouted.</p><p>Olivia continued to address Jane. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so sick. He\u2019s been giving you the poison, and he\u2019s been clever about it. He makes sure it\u2019s no longer in your blood by the time you go to the hospital. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s been giving it to you for a long time. After a few days, arsenic doesn\u2019t show up in the blood, but it\u2019s everywhere else. Now that we know what to look for, we\u2019ll have all the proof we need.\u201d</p><p>Logan was frantically trying to search for a way out. He grasped his head in his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t think,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re high,\u201d Olivia pointed out. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie as well when you\u2019re drugged, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. You can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d His agitation was beginning to take over.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not as clever as you think.\u201d</p><p>He turned to his sister. He couldn\u2019t seem to control the twitch in his neck that had suddenly appeared. \u201cThat\u2019s my money sitting in your account. Mother meant it for me, but you convinced her to leave it all to you. I want what\u2019s rightfully mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have gotten away with it,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAn autopsy would have shown the poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m smarter than you think,\u201d he boasted. \u201cThe arsenic was just supposed to weaken her a little. I figured the cancer or something else would kill her, but she wasn\u2019t sick enough, so I decided to speed things up. Since she\u2019s been feeling so ill, no one would blame her for wanting to end it all with a bottle of sleeping pills.\u201d</p><p>Olivia went to Jane and put her hand on her shoulder to keep her in her chair. When she looked up, Grayson was standing in the doorway, his gun trained on Jane\u2019s brother. He didn\u2019t make a sound. She knew he wanted her to move away from Logan, but she was afraid to leave Jane\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s clever, Logan?\u201d she taunted. She wanted him to continue to look at her until Grayson grabbed him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever done anything clever in your life. You\u2019re too stupid.\u201d She could tell he was losing control. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>Logan lunged for her and grabbed her around the neck, choking her. Grayson moved like lightning and tore him off her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Olivia,\u201d he shouted as he slammed Logan against the wall. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you move away from him?\u201d</p><p>She coughed the words, \u201cI should have.\u201d She rubbed her neck and said, \u201cI wanted him to keep talking.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jane, who appeared to be so stunned she couldn\u2019t move. Olivia took her hand and pulled her to her feet. She put her arm around her friend\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cCome on. You\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>It was almost nine before Olivia arrived home from the hospital. Grayson had followed her in his car and waited until they were inside her apartment to give her hell again.</p><p>\u201cIf he had a knife . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he . . .\u201d</p><p>She went into the kitchen to get something to drink. \u201cYou had your gun on him. What could he do?\u201d Too late, she realized it was a dumb question.</p><p>\u201cHow about use you as a shield? He could have snapped your neck. He could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ronan arrived, interrupting the lecture Olivia knew Grayson was about to launch into.</p><p>Olivia told him to help himself to whatever he wanted to eat or drink. He grabbed a Coke and sat facing her.</p><p>Grayson wanted to pace. \u201cShould have checked sooner,\u201d he told Ronan. \u201cWhen Olivia mentioned that Logan was an addict, I should have checked to make sure he was still clean . . . do my damned job. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. She could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Olivia reassured.</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cHe was talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more impulsive than a devout cokehead,\u201d Ronan remarked. \u201cWhere is Logan now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped and then to jail,\u201d Grayson answered. He shook his head. \u201cEverything that came out of that bastard\u2019s mouth was a lie. He didn\u2019t live in a halfway house, and he only worked for the car rental agency a couple of months.\u201d He came around the sofa as he said, \u201cAnd he sure as hell didn\u2019t go to any meetings. I\u2019ll bet he was getting high every night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia turned to Grayson. \u201cDid you know he was poisoning Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I found out everything out of his mouth was a lie, I called Dr. Pardieu and told him my suspicions. He confirmed that it all added up. I told him we\u2019d bring Jane in. I wanted to make sure you were safe, and I\u2019d stopped to warn you when I got your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to Logan\u2019s apartment,\u201d Ronan said. \u201cIt was a real dump. We found the arsenic there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poison only stays in the blood a couple of days,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cLogan timed it so that when she went back into the hospital, it wouldn\u2019t show up. He was giving her small doses, just enough to weaken her. I think he was hoping it would make her cancer come back.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang, and he went to answer it. A lovely blond, blue-eyed young woman with a bewitching smile was standing there, waiting for him to let her in.</p><p>\u201cCollins,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cGrayson.\u201d</p><p>Introductions over, she rushed past him. She was yelling before she reached Olivia. \u201cI told you Logan was a sleazebag. Didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have mentioned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had a gun . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that,\u201d Olivia blurted. \u201cThere are two FBI agents here.\u201d</p><p>Collins whirled around. \u201cTwo?\u201d</p><p>Ronan was standing right behind her. They stared at each other for several seconds, neither saying a word. Olivia watched, fascinated. She could almost see the electricity flowing between them.</p><p>Grayson introduced them. Collins smiled up at Ronan, then turned around and continued her rant.</p><p>\u201cI called Sam and told her. She didn\u2019t believe Logan had changed either.\u201d Hands on hips, she faced Grayson. \u201cHow did you finally figure it out?\u201d</p><p>Olivia groaned. Collins had inadvertently gotten him worked up again. He went through the process, and by the time he was finished, he was furious once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask any more questions, Collins,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d she countered. \u201cHow did you find his apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put his address on the application at the rental agency.\u201d</p><p>Ronan was having trouble paying attention to the conversation. He couldn\u2019t seem to make himself stop staring at Collins.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a Popsicle. Want one?\u201d she asked Olivia.</p><p>\u201cSure. Grape.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, Grayson and Ronan stood side by side watching the two women.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like Popsicles?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe got hooked on them when we were going through chemo,\u201d Collins answered matter-of-factly. \u201cThe cold soothed the blisters in our mouths.\u201d</p> <p>Both women put the Popsicles in their mouths at the same time. Grayson moaned, \u201cAh, come on.\u201d</p><p>Olivia knew what he was thinking. Her tongue swirled around the tip of the Popsicle, her gaze locked on his. \u201cWant some?\u201d she innocently asked.</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Ronan muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d Grayson said, glaring at Olivia.</p><p>Ronan gave him an understanding slap on the back. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p> <p>Ray Martin was sitting in jail, charged with the attempted murder of Olivia MacKenzie. Grayson and Ronan still weren\u2019t convinced they had the right man. They needed to be sure.</p><p>They brought Carl Simmons\u2019s alibi in for another interrogation. Her name was Vicky Hyde Clark, and she was a paid escort. Simmons was one of her best clients. He always overpaid her for her services, and he didn\u2019t mind being seen in public with her. She considered him a good friend.</p><p>Vicky was tall, thin, and wore a dress that was a little too tight. She wasn\u2019t pretty, by any means, and there was a hardness about her and a look that suggested she\u2019d been through a couple of wars.</p><p>She sat at a table across from Ronan, who had a file open in front of him. Grayson leaned against the wall behind the agent and stared at Vicky. He had yet to say a word to her.</p><p>He was an expert at intimidation, and he knew he was scaring her, all without moving a muscle or uttering a sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know,\u201d Vicky whined. \u201cCarl\u2019s one of my dearest friends . . . he used to be, anyway, but now that he\u2019s going to prison for all that fraud business, I don\u2019t see how I can help you. I understand . . . Carl\u2019s innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, but we all know . . .\u201d She took a breath and said, \u201cI told you the truth. Carl was with me that night you asked about . . . you know, when that girl got shot. Carl was in my bed all night.\u201d</p><p>She kept nervously glancing at Grayson, then back to Ronan. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me,\u201d she cried. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of questions, Vicky, then it will be over and we\u2019ll take you to lockup,\u201d Ronan said smoothly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she gasped. \u201cLockup? Why?\u201d</p><p>Grayson finally spoke. \u201cYou lied to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t hold his stare.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Vicky, just a few questions and we\u2019ll be done,\u201d Ronan repeated. \u201cWhere did the ten thousand dollars come from? You made a five-thousand-dollar deposit in your savings account and a five-thousand-dollar deposit in your checking account. You made those deposits on the same day, exactly one week after Olivia MacKenzie was shot.\u201d</p><p>She was so rattled she had to think about the question a minute before blurting, \u201cIt was money I saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another lie,\u201d Ronan said. He tried to sound disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ronan\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cWe traced it, Vicky. The money came from Carl Simmons\u2019s account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it didn\u2019t. I saved all that money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl withdrew that precise amount,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t have proof that Carl had done any such thing, but he was going to see if Vicky would take the bait. \u201cAnd you deposited that amount. There\u2019s only one conclusion we can draw. Carl gave you the money. So now I have to ask, why? Could it be for the alibi you gave him?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked for an attorney, so Ronan kept at her, question after question, trying to wear her down.</p><p>Grayson spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to prison for a long time if you lie to us. You\u2019re as much responsible for shooting Olivia MacKenzie as Carl is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying for him to give him an alibi, so you\u2019re in it with him,\u201d Ronan said. He slapped his hand down on the table, and the sound reverberated around the small room. Vicky jumped.</p><p>\u201cTell her about the proof we have that she\u2019s lying,\u201d Grayson told Ronan. \u201cThe other proof.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Ronan had no idea what Grayson was talking about, but he nodded and said, \u201cI will. I\u2019m getting to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more proof?\u201d Vicky was scared and unsure now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ronan said, shaking his head. \u201cCarl\u2019s going to go to prison for his other crimes. Why are you protecting him? You certainly don\u2019t have to worry about giving the money back to him.\u201d</p><p>Grayson knew they were going to have to let her go. Aside from the fact that Vicky had deposited ten thousand dollars, everything they claimed to know about her was fabricated. He wasn\u2019t through messing with Ronan, though. \u201cGo ahead, Agent Conrad. Tell her about the other proof.\u201d</p><p>Ronan was going to have to come up with something, and Grayson couldn\u2019t wait to hear what he would say. He knew his friend\u2019s mind was scrambling.</p><p>Vicky panicked. \u201cI want a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Ronan asked. He\u2019d also been thinking they were going to have to cut her loose.</p><p>Grayson stepped forward and leaned on the table. \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what really happened, and you don\u2019t put me in lockup. You let me go for good. No charges . . . ever.\u201d</p><p>They nodded, but before they spoke their agreement or disagreement, she blurted, \u201cYes, I lied. He made me. He was with me that night, but only for a little while. He left early. He seemed to be in a real hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see what he was driving?\u201d Grayson asked.</p><p>\u201cI did. I\u2019d never seen it before, so I asked him about it. It was a brand-new SUV. One of those big fancy ones. He said it belonged to the fleet that they used whenever lawyers from other branches were in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d Ronan asked.</p><p>\u201cBlack. Real shiny black.\u201d</p><p>Grayson walked out into the hall. Ronan followed him. \u201cA black SUV doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we can show where it\u2019s been,\u201d Grayson said and then added, \u201cGPS.\u201d</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cOf course. Simmons spends most of his time in New York. He can\u2019t be that familiar with D.C. He might have needed directions to Olivia\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe even Martin\u2019s house to plant a gun. If he programmed an address into the GPS, there would be a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find that SUV.\u201d</p><p>Carl Simmons\u2019s misery started and ended with Olivia MacKenzie. She had set out to destroy her father and him, and she had succeeded. He tried, but he hadn\u2019t been able to shut her up or stop her relentless quest.</p><p>Carl had estimated he had at least another good year to draw more and more rich investors into the Trinity Fund. He\u2019d tucked away a little bit in foreign banks, but he simply hadn\u2019t had enough time to hide what he\u2019d need to live on. It was too late now. He had to figure out a way to get out of the country.</p><p>He\u2019d made sure there weren\u2019t any papers to prove he was a silent partner in the fund. Nothing in writing to damn him. That was only slowing the Feds down, though. Eventually they\u2019d have enough to fry him.</p><p>Yes, it started and ended with her. He\u2019d tried to stop the woman by threatening her, but she didn\u2019t scare that easily, so he took it to the next step and went to her employers to discredit her. That didn\u2019t work either. Killing her seemed the most logical solution.</p><p>Kline needed money and agreed to do it, but he backed out at the last minute. Simmons decided that he would have to pull the trigger himself. Three bullets and he still couldn\u2019t get rid of her.</p><p>He felt confident he\u2019d covered his tracks pretty well, but then finding out about Ray Martin was a lucky break. His arrest was covered in all the papers, so Carl took advantage of his good fortune and decided to hide his gun at Martin\u2019s house. Simple as could be. Martin would go down, and maybe Olivia would be so shaken she\u2019d worry about the shooting and back off her persistent prying. He actually thought it was a possibility . . . that is, until she started messing with Robert\u2019s deal with Jeff Wilcox. She brought in the lawyer, Mitchell Kaplan, and Carl knew that pit bull wouldn\u2019t stop until their whole operation was exposed.</p><p>All they\u2019d needed was a little time, a few days for them to clean out their accounts and hide what was left of the money before they took off and disappeared, but when he learned about her visit to Jeff Wilcox, he could almost hear the clock ticking down the minutes before he and Robert MacKenzie were destroyed. Carl should have killed Olivia then, but he had to act quickly, so he\u2019d tried to use the mental illness ploy to get her hauled away to an institution for a few days. He never should have trusted those idiots, Kline and Vogel. They screwed up everything, and if he\u2019d just been a little quicker, he would have gotten away before the Feds showed up.</p><p>Carl refused to be defeated. They may have arrested him, but he was smart enough to convince the judge to release him on bail. Obviously they\u2019d underestimated him. He had a plan. He was going to leave in the middle of the night, drive one of the fleet cars that wouldn\u2019t be recognized, and hightail it to Miami. He had connections there, people who could get him out of the United States.</p><p>Everything was in place. He was all set to leave that night, but then he got the phone call that changed everything. An inside source, an attorney who had a contentious relationship with the FBI and who owed Simmons a favor, called to let him know his bail was going to be revoked. The Feds were on their way to his house to take him in. He was being charged with attempted murder. The source told him about the evidence. The GPS had damned him, and Carl knew there wasn\u2019t any way out of this now. Even if he tried, he couldn\u2019t get away.</p><p>When he\u2019d been arrested for his white-collar crimes, he hadn\u2019t panicked. Even if he didn\u2019t make it out of the country, at the very worst, he\u2019d be sent to a minimum-security prison, or as the media liked to call these facilities, a country club. Now that he was going down for attempted murder, minimum security was off the table. The judge would put him in a hard-core federal prison, and Carl knew he couldn\u2019t handle that. Just thinking about it terrified him.</p><p>He\u2019d rather die.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more sense it made. He would die. It would be quick and over. No long years of terror in prison. He\u2019d go out on his own terms. And he wouldn\u2019t go alone. Yes, he\u2019d take her with him. It was fitting, wasn\u2019t it? She\u2019d caused all this pain in his life. She had been his ruination. Now he would be hers.</p><p>He already had the fleet car waiting, a dark blue Honda. It was parked on a street a couple of blocks away. He\u2019d removed the license plate and swapped it with one he found on another Honda in a parking lot.</p><p>He had to act fast. Once the Feds discovered he wasn\u2019t at his small D.C. apartment, they\u2019d put out a search for him. He knew he couldn\u2019t evade them long. He took the gun he kept in his safe and hurried down the street to the waiting car. He drove to Olivia\u2019s apartment building, pulled into the garage across the street, and waited. Darkness was descending. It was Saturday, and he hoped she\u2019d go out. He\u2019d follow her and ambush her. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but he hadn\u2019t had time to figure out something more elaborate.</p><p>There were other cars parked on the street across from the entrance to her building. People were sitting inside them. Newspeople, he knew, waiting for a chance to talk to her about her father. He might just get lucky and shoot a couple of them, as well. They certainly hadn\u2019t been kind to him. Why should he care about them?</p><p>Carl decided he\u2019d have a better vantage if he joined the other vans and cars. An Acura left, and he pulled into its slot behind a white van. It was a great spot. A red SUV honked at him because he\u2019d gotten to the space first. Like the other vans and SUVs and sedans, he kept his motor running. Slinking down in his seat, he waited. Condensation quickly covered the windshield and windows, making it difficult for anyone walking by to see inside.</p><p>Carl had brought a flask of whiskey with him. He took a long swallow and felt the liquid burn his insides. The whiskey gave him courage. Before he killed himself, he hoped he could watch Olivia die. He smiled thinking about it and took another swig. It would all be over soon.</p><p>Grayson paced in Olivia\u2019s apartment while he waited to hear that Simmons had been picked up. Agents were on their way to Simmons\u2019s apartment now, and it shouldn\u2019t be much longer before Grayson got the call that the bastard was in handcuffs. Only when Simmons was in lockup would Grayson stop worrying.</p><p>Olivia was getting ready to go out. Grayson was taking her to a dinner party honoring Dr. Pardieu.</p><p>She had taken the news about Carl Simmons well and admitted she was actually more relieved than surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe GPS was his big mistake. He left a clear record that he\u2019d driven to Martin\u2019s house to plant the gun,\u201d Grayson told her. \u201cAre you happy now that you know it was indeed Simmons who tried to kill you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHappy? This will put him away forever, so yes, I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>Grayson had told her that as soon as Simmons was picked up they could leave.</p><p>The bedroom door opened, and there she stood. She wore a black dress with a V-neck that showed just enough cl**vage to make Grayson nuts.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he told her as he pulled her into his arms and kissed the side of her neck. \u201cEvery time I get near you, I want to take you to bed.\u201d</p><p>She felt the same way. She kissed him on his cheek and pulled away. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late if we don\u2019t leave now. It\u2019s a thirty-minute drive to the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard about Simmons yet. We\u2019re going to wait\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t we get in the car and start driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia . . .\u201d</p><p>The warning in his voice didn\u2019t deter her. \u201cIf we get to the restaurant and Simmons still hasn\u2019t been taken into custody, we\u2019ll turn around and come back. I don\u2019t want to wait here, then drive like crazy to get there before it\u2019s over. It\u2019s Dr. Pardieu,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t miss it. He\u2019s like a father to me.\u201d</p><p>He relented. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll leave now, but you have to promise you\u2019ll stay in the car and not balk if we have to turn around.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the balking, Grayson. I\u2019ll stay in the car, but I feel I\u2019m entitled to a little balking.\u201d</p><p>He helped her with her coat, kissed her neck again, and buttoned his suit jacket. \u201cReady to walk the gauntlet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many reporters did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree vans, a couple of SUVs. They\u2019ll try to swarm as soon as you step outside. Keep your head down,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out of here as fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should park in the garage from now on,\u201d she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re down there, too,\u201d he replied. \u201cMore than are on the street. When we get back, I\u2019ll talk to the doorman about sweeping the garage.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up her collar as the elevator door opened in the lobby. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Grayson took her hand and strode past John. She waved to him as she was being pulled through the door.</p><p>A door opened on every car that was parked across the street, and cameramen and reporters came running. Grayson noticed a blue Honda opposite the apartment entrance. It hadn\u2019t been there when he\u2019d arrived. The sedan was squeezed in between two vans. As Grayson hurried Olivia around his car to get to the passenger side, out of the corner of his eye he saw the door of the Honda open and Carl Simmons step out into the street.</p><p>Olivia was blinded by camera lights. She put her hand up to shield her eyes, unaware of the danger.</p><p>Simmons swung his right arm up, and Grayson saw the glint of steel. He moved so quickly, Olivia didn\u2019t have time to brace herself or react. He threw her behind him, and she fell to her knees before he flattened her with his body. In one fluid motion, he covered her and trained his gun on Simmons.</p> <p>He shouted to the reporters, \u201cGet down, get down . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d was all that Olivia could utter. Grayson had knocked the wind out of her. Gunshots stopped her from asking questions. She squeezed her eyes shut and prayed Grayson wouldn\u2019t get hit. Protecting her, he\u2019d made himself a target.</p><p>Camera lights illuminated the scene that was unfolding. Simmons ran toward them, shooting again and again, trying desperately to get Olivia. Grayson fired only one shot. That was all he needed. The bullet sliced into Simmons\u2019s black heart. His arms flailed, his legs buckled, and he crashed spread-eagle to the ground, face-first.</p><p>The noise was ear-piercing. People were screaming and running every which way. Olivia\u2019s heart pounded in her chest, and she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. Grayson lifted her, checking to make certain she hadn\u2019t been hit by one of Simmons\u2019s bullets. Her dress was ripped all the way up to the top of her thigh, her elbow was scraped, and she was shaking from head to toe.</p><p>Grayson\u2019s eyes showed fear mixed with his rage. \u201cAre you all right? Did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered, surprised by how weak her voice sounded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl Simmons.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she asked, \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. Can you walk? I want you to get inside. Tell John to lock the door. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Just sit and wait for me. I need to get to Simmons\u2019s gun\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said.</p><p>John held the door for her, blocking two eager reporters from entering. He bolted the door behind her and led her to the security room behind the desk. \u201cNo one will bother you here, and you can watch the street, see what Agent Kincaid is doing.\u201d</p><p>Grayson ran across the street. Pushing reporters out of his way, he knelt beside Carl to check for a pulse while he called it in.</p><p>Others had called 911 already. Within bare minutes, police and agents filled the street. Olivia waited patiently, but her chest was getting tight, and she knew she was going to be in trouble if she didn\u2019t use her inhaler. She then realized she didn\u2019t have her purse. She must have dropped it when Grayson pushed her. John found it under the car and brought it to her, and once she\u2019d used her inhaler, she felt immediate relief. She put her head back, closed her eyes, and tried to calm her racing heartbeat.</p><p>She thought about Grayson and how calm he\u2019d been while that maniac was shooting at them. He was completely in control, until it was over. Then his composure turned into fury that Simmons had tried to hurt her. He had put his life on the line to save hers, she realized, and her eyes filled with tears at the thought of what could have happened to him.</p><p>Knowing it would be some time before Grayson was finished, she went back upstairs. She stripped out of her clothes, washed her hands, and cleaned the cut on her elbow. She slipped into her silk robe and curled up on the sofa to wait for him.</p><p>He arrived a half hour later and found her standing at the kitchen window, looking down at the street.</p><p>\u201cIs he really dead?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he thinking to come here? With all the reporters . . . He couldn\u2019t have thought he\u2019d get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to die, but he wanted to kill you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really hated me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. You stopped him from destroying more innocent people\u2019s lives. The world\u2019s a better place without him.\u201d Grayson tossed his tie on the table. \u201cYou took your clothes off,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her and stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late. We could catch the end of the party I guess.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out. I could fix dinner . . . microwave something. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>He slowly looked her up and down, smiled, and said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her into his arms, he walked into the bedroom and kicked the door shut behind him.</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Grayson wouldn\u2019t leave Olivia alone. He was determined to marry her, and nothing she could do or say would change his mind. He had listened to her protests for two months, but he was persistent.</p><p>\u201cIf I were to get sick again, you\u2019d have to suffer with me,\u201d she argued. \u201cAre you ready for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I toss you out if you get so much as a cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I get sick?\u201d he countered.</p><p>The question gave her pause. \u201cI\u2019d take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d He was backing her into her bedroom while he made his demand. \u201cI\u2019m not asking. I\u2019m telling you. You\u2019re going to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She promised to think about it. He knew what that meant. She\u2019d be thinking about it six months from now.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake up, you\u2019ll have a ring on your finger. I\u2019m done waiting.\u201d He pulled her to him and began to undress her.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll sleep through you putting a ring on my finger? I\u2019m a very light sleeper, Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished with you, you\u2019re going to be so exhausted, you\u2019ll sleep through anything I do to you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exaggerating. He began to make love to her with gentle caresses and slow, wet kisses. He soon became more demanding, and he brought her to the brink again and again, but each time he pulled back and made her wait. When she finally screamed for release, he gave in. The last thing she remembered was Grayson leaning over her and whispering that he loved her.</p><p>He stayed over that night and slept with her wrapped in his arms. When Olivia woke up, he was in the kitchen. She could smell bacon, and she could hear him whistling. She rolled onto her back and stretched her arms toward the ceiling. She saw the ring then, a gorgeous emerald-cut diamond.</p><p>Grayson heard the rich, joyful sound of laughter coming from the bedroom. It was music to his ears.</p><p>He had his answer.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>Their wedding was to be a small affair in her aunt Emma\u2019s living room. Olivia couldn\u2019t make up her mind if she wanted to invite her mother and her sister, but Natalie made the decision for her. She called late one evening, and her voice was absolutely frigid.</p><p>\u201cStill blaming me, Natalie?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are to blame,\u201d her sister said resentfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mother or I will ever be able to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I asked for forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message is from our father. He has such a kind heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s ready to forgive you, but you have to face him when you apologize.\u201d</p><p>There was dead silence on the phone for at least twenty seconds. Then Olivia began to laugh. Some things\u2014and some men\u2014never change. Logan Weston was one example; Robert MacKenzie, another.</p><p>* *</p><p>It was such a beautiful spring day, Emma decided to have the wedding outside in her garden. By the time she finished with the caterer and the florist, the yard looked like a wonderland.</p><p>Dr. Andre Pardieu walked Olivia down the aisle. Her maids of honor were Collins, Jane, and Samantha. Olivia had told Grayson that Samantha had to be at the ceremony, and if she couldn\u2019t get leave, then everyone would go to Iceland, and they\u2019d get married there.</p><p>Grayson in his tux set her heart on fire. This beautiful man loved her. As she walked toward him, she felt as though she were floating. All her worries had vanished. She was no longer afraid of what might come. With Grayson at her side, she could face anything. He was her lover, her friend, her strength. It would be all right to lean on him every now and then.</p><p>There was much to celebrate. Collins had finally received word that she could begin training to become an FBI agent, and she was thrilled. Ronan kept his distance, but Olivia noticed he hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off Collins. She couldn\u2019t wait to see what might come of the attraction.</p><p>Agent Huntsman was late for the ceremony, but he had the most wonderful excuse. He pulled Olivia and Grayson aside to share his news. \u201cI\u2019ve got a wedding present for you,\u201d he began. \u201cWe finally caught up with that bitch, Gretta Keene. She was in New Mexico under an assumed name. She\u2019s behind bars now. And guess who else?\u201d</p><p>Olivia gasped. \u201cEric Jorguson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We nabbed him, too.\u201d Huntsman couldn\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ve got everything we need to prove Jorguson was laundering money, and now it looks like we\u2019ll also be able to go after some of his other clients. It\u2019s a mighty fine day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia thought it was a fine day, indeed. Every one of Grayson\u2019s buddies was drooling over Olivia\u2019s three best friends. And the girls certainly knew how to flirt, even Jane, now that she was looking so radiant. She\u2019d started dating again and was truly happy.</p><p>Ralph and his father were invited\u2014Henry had put them on the list. Mary and Harriet were busy protecting the cake and keeping the boys out of mischief.</p><p>Ralph Sr. fell under Samantha\u2019s spell. He hung on her every word. She was launching into \u201cthe story\u201d when her friends joined her.</p><p>\u201cThere I was . . .\u201d</p><p>Collins, Jane, and Olivia finished the sentence for her. \u201c...in seat twenty-eight A on flight twenty-seven forty-three. . . .\u201d Laughter followed, drawing smiles from the guests.</p><p>The photographer wanted a picture of the bride with her maids of honor. Olivia gathered them on the terrace. They stood together smiling into the camera. Sam whispered something the others found hilarious, and they had a good laugh.</p><p>Contentment washed over Olivia. The Pips were together again. They had come through the storm, and the sun was shining.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>A year had passed since the wedding, and Olivia had settled comfortably into married life. Patrick continued to keep the household running smoothly, and she helped with carpools and homework.</p><p>Grayson hadn\u2019t committed yet, but he was giving serious thought to accepting a promotion at the agency. As an incentive, they had agreed to his demands: He could take on individual cases from time to time and not be tied to a desk, and Ronan would continue to be his partner for those investigations. The new position would mean that his work schedule would be predictable and he could spend more time with his family.</p><p>Olivia and Henry had become very close. Their busy lives kept them occupied during the week, so Olivia made it a point to reserve the weekends for family activities. One Saturday in late June, Olivia and Henry were at a local farmers\u2019 market that was set up on the edge of a city park. She wanted to pick up some fresh vegetables for their dinner, and she\u2019d promised Henry they would see the latest Transformer movie when she was finished. Grayson and Ronan were tying up a case, and Ronan was going to drop Grayson off at the park to meet them and spend the rest of the day with them.</p><p>Henry had one of his handheld game players and was trying to destroy aliens while Olivia and he strolled among the crowded stalls. She kept her hand on Henry\u2019s shoulder, guiding him. They stopped in front of a stall containing fresh tomatoes. As she was sorting through them, she glanced across the market to the parking lot beyond. Grayson was walking toward her. Her heartbeat quickened, and her breath caught in her throat. Oh, he was such a handsome man. In all this time together, she still hadn\u2019t gotten used to him. Whenever he walked through the door at night, she reacted the same way. Always with excitement and wonder. She thought it a miracle that he loved her.</p><p>He reached her and leaned down to kiss her. Henry was so intent on his game, he didn\u2019t realize his uncle had joined them.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late. After all this time, Eric Jorguson wants to make a deal,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen. He can\u2019t give us anything we don\u2019t already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t despise the man,\u201d she whispered so Henry wouldn\u2019t overhear. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t attacked me, I never would have met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Grayson said. And though he wasn\u2019t usually poetic, he added, \u201cWe were meant to be together. I would have found you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
