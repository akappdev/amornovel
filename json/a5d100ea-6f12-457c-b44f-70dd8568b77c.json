Every spring break, I go on mission trips to Honduras, where we renovate houses for the underprivileged. I do all my homework every night, and before I go to bed, I kiss Daddy\u2019s cheek and tell him I wish he\u2019d go to the doctor about his blood pressure and start getting more exercise than walking Fritz and scooping his poop.</p><p>I\u2019ve only kissed one boy my entire life.</p><p>Emily called that day, crying. \u201cKate,\u201d she said between sobs. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone. Not even your mom.\u201d</p><p>I drove to Walmart two towns away, over in Green Hills, so no one would see me buying the test. I trembled as I carried the box to the self-checkout lane. I scanned, bagged, and paid, and bit back tears, because my best friend of fifteen years\u2014since we were three years old\u2014might have accidentally gotten pregnant by her long-time boyfriend.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know they had had sex. It\u2019s not something they would tell. If anyone found out that Jacob, son of Brother Michael\u2014our preacher at church\u2014got a girl pregnant out of wedlock? Chaos.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t look good for Emily either. She\u2019s like me. Always wears clean T-shirts and none of her jeans have holes or loose strings. She would never even think about smoking a cigarette. She doesn\u2019t go over the speed limit. She plays the violin and has a scholarship lined up to attend Belmont University in Nashville.</p><p>But Emily made a mistake.</p><p>I use my black coloring pencil to shade her hair. My red pencil fills in her lips, turned upside down in a frown.</p><p>And then I made an even bigger mistake: I helped her.</p><p>you were my first kiss</p><p>friday, june 1 ~ week 1 of 7</p> <p>I haven\u2019t been to Cumberland Creek Camp since I was eleven, since I was a camper. Now I\u2019m eighteen, a high school graduate. I\u2019m someone who has no business being a camp counselor, that\u2019s for sure. I can\u2019t start fires. I can\u2019t tell poison ivy and poison oak apart. And since I tipped over in the Cumberland River sophomore year, canoes and I have had a serious love-hate relationship.</p><p>But my friendship bracelet\u2013making skills are first-rate, so my church\u2014Forrest Sanctuary\u2014nominated me to be the camp arts and crafts instructor. I never would\u2019ve agreed if Emily hadn\u2019t been nominated to be a counselor as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a great summer!\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet new people and get to hang out by the lake and make s\u2019mores and go creek stomping together. Like when we were eight!\u201d</p><p>But now I\u2019m here alone.</p><p>I need the money for college, and it\u2019s too late to find a job anywhere else in this economy, and I figure if I do this for the church, maybe God will think about forgiving me for what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Back in the day, the Chickasaw Indian tribe believed that this land\u2014these mountains in Tennessee\u2014were where heaven meets the earth, and lots of locals say God often communicates to people here. Through signs. Through visions. Through just feeling closer to Him. When I was little, it was always the talk of camp. Would God speak to anyone this year? I remember hearing a rumor about how a counselor had this deep feeling she needed to go see her boyfriend. So she drove away from camp and made it to his house just in time to find he\u2019d slipped and fallen down the stairs and was bleeding heavily from his head. He lived, thanks to the sign.</p><p>Everyone wants a sign at some point, and this summer I need one more than ever.</p><p>I park my car along the tree line beside the basketball court and make my way up the trail, past the cedar and oak trees, keeping a watch out for copperheads and black widow spiders. Last time I was here, a deer tick bit me and burrowed into my skin. Two weeks later, I had a rash the shape of a dartboard stretching across my pale stomach. Everybody wanted to see it. And I mean everybody. Even Will Whitfield. But when you\u2019re eleven, you don\u2019t pull your shirt up for anybody except your mom and the doctor.</p> <p>Anyway, the whole reason I\u2019m thinking about Will Whitfield is because I see him standing in front of the camp director\u2019s cabin, along with the other counselors. The cabin\u2019s name is Great Oak because camp is divided into two lands: Birdland and Treeland, and all the cabins are named accordingly. Cardinal, Redwood, Wren. My favorite cabin is White Oak because it\u2019s nestled up in the hills overlooking the lake and it\u2019s closest to the Woodsong Chapel, my favorite place. Emily and I made a lot of good memories here, memories that I hoped would continue this summer. But this job doesn\u2019t pay much\u2014not enough for her to rent an apartment in Nashville.</p><p>Her parents kicked her out of the house after they found out about the abortion.</p><p>They said they\u2019d pray for her soul.</p><p>I hope they\u2019re praying for my soul too.</p><p>A guy wearing no shoes is staring at me.</p><p>Boys don\u2019t usually stare. Except for Bruce Wilson, captain of the high school math team, and he hardly counts because I never wanted to return his stares.</p><p>Shoeless Boy is beautiful. His tan face is kind and maybe a bit mischievous. A red bandana keeps his dirty blond hair in check. His khaki shorts reach his knees and sunglasses hang off the collar of his black T-shirt. He\u2019s carrying a guitar case in one hand and has a laundry basket full of clothes under the other arm.</p><p>He sets the guitar down and waves. I wave back. He grins, and my knees feel kinda wobbly.</p><p>He reminds me of someone...</p><p>A lady blows a whistle. \u201cIf y\u2019all will gather round,\u201d she says to the group of ten counselors. She\u2019s got a mass of curls and she\u2019s... large. I can\u2019t think of another way to describe her. My face flushes. I shouldn\u2019t think mean things like that.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the sixty-fourth summer of Cumberland Creek Camp!\u201d she yells. Everyone hoots and screams in response. I clap along with them, but my heart\u2019s not in it. Not while Emily\u2019s living by herself, working two jobs to make enough money to pay her rent. I\u2019ve already promised myself I\u2019ll send her half of every paycheck. I\u2019ll make $300 a week here.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Will nudges me.</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks,\u201d I lie. We went to the same school\u2014Hundred Oaks High in Franklin\u2014and I had a crush on him for just about forever. Now he\u2019s finally got a girlfriend...who\u2019s also a counselor here this summer. She took Emily\u2019s job.</p><p>Parker wraps her arm around Will\u2019s waist and leans toward me. \u201cHey, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I reply with a smile. A non-jealous smile, I pray. I always imagined he and I would get together, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the kind of couple who breaks up. Parker goes to my church and we went to school together, but we never talk. Her long brown hair is tangled with messy plaits in it. She\u2019s like a beautiful wild child.</p><p>The whistle screeches again. \u201cI\u2019m Megan Anderson, the camp\u2019s director.\u201d</p><p>Two girl counselors squeal, \u201cMegan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a seat on the porch and we\u2019ll do introductions, go over our training schedule, and then take a tour of camp, for those of you who haven\u2019t been here before,\u201d Megan says.</p><p>Everyone rushes for the folding chairs and porch swing, but I make myself comfortable on a tree stump next to the deck. Sunlight filters through the leaves dripping above us.</p><p>The boy who had been staring at me got a coveted spot on the porch swing. The two girls who squealed \u201cMegan!\u201d sit on either side of him, and he\u2019s laughing and looking back and forth between them. He must be a returning counselor. I can\u2019t help but notice how pretty the girls are, with their short shorts and tanks and tan, skinny legs. My body and legs are skinny too, but I desperately need a tan this summer. I also need to gain some muscle back after my soccer injury.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Megan says, tooting her whistle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play an introduction game. Y\u2019all have to pair your name with an animal and tell us a bit about you.\u201d</p><p>Everybody groans, but they\u2019re smiling. I remember playing this game when I was little.</p><p>Megan starts us out. \u201cI\u2019m Monkey Megan and I just finished getting my master\u2019s in education from Tennessee Tech.\u201d</p><p>A buff guy with brown hair announces himself as \u201cBumblebee Brad. I\u2019m the games director this summer.\u201d He says he just graduated high school but doesn\u2019t mention where he\u2019s going to college. I notice a series of deep purple bruises peeking out from beneath his T-shirt sleeve.</p><p>Will says he\u2019s Wallaby Will and Parker is Platypus Parker and they are going to college together at Vanderbilt.</p><p>My turn. I swallow the lump in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m Kangaroo Kate\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shoeless Boy laughs and croons in a deep Southern accent, \u201cOh, cool. I can ride in your pouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d his swing mate asks, elbowing him in the gut.</p><p>\u201cFilter, dude. Filter,\u201d Bumblebee Brad says to Shoeless Boy.</p><p>Megan blows her whistle, giving everyone an evil eye. That whistle\u2019ll get way old way fast. \u201cTell us a bit about yourself, Kangaroo Kate.\u201d</p><p>My face burns. I decide not to tell them this is my first job. Ever. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a freshman at Belmont University in Nashville this fall. I\u2019m the arts and crafts director here this summer.\u201d</p><p>Shoeless Boy stares at me some more and I stare back. Ride in my pouch? Really?</p><p>We move on to other counselors. A girl sitting on the swing says, \u201cI\u2019m Alligator Andrea and I\u2019m a senior at Middle Tennessee State University, where I\u2019m majoring in communications. I\u2019m also the president of Chi Omega Tau.\u201d</p><p>This guy Iguana Ian howls like a wolf, and everyone cracks up.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I whisper to Parker, who\u2019s sitting on the steps.</p><p>She plays with a clump of her long messy hair. \u201cChi-O-T. Coyotes? It\u2019s a sorority.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. I didn\u2019t know Christian girls joined sororities.</p><p>Next up is Shoeless Boy and I hold my breath, waiting to hear his name and interests and what he\u2019s doing here this summer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Marsupial Matt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an animal,\u201d I interrupt, and everyone gives me weird looks.</p><p>\u201cSure it is,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classification, not a specific animal. A kangaroo is a marsupial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replies. His mouth curls into a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d Andrea asks, using the same tone as before.</p><p>\u201cIt means that a kangaroo is a marsupial.\u201d He shrugs and glances at me again.</p><p>She flicks his thigh, then musses her hair, watching him for a reaction. So Andrea likes Matt.</p><p>He looks so familiar.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cNow, as I was saying, I\u2019m Marsupial Matt\u2014\u201d</p><p>I accidentally snort and laugh, and Matt smiles. Will\u2019s mouth falls open as he looks at me.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Matt says to me. \u201cI\u2019m Matt Brown the Mutt, and I\u2019m from Bell Buckle. I\u2019ll be a junior at MTSU this fall. I\u2019m majoring in literature and I\u2019m getting a minor in classical guitar. I\u2019m the camp lifeguard.\u201d</p><p>I love that he plays classical music and likes reading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, and I\u2019m in Delta Tau Kappa,\u201d he adds. I\u2019ve never even considered joining a sorority and it seems like everyone here does that kind of stuff. On weekends they probably throw raging keggers and underwear parties. I\u2019ve seen stuff like that on TV.</p><p>Nearly everyone is older than me and is a returning counselor. Parker, Will, and I are the only new hires. Most people are dressed in shorts and tees, but this one guy is dressed in camo pants and big brown hiking boots. Eric (\u201cI refuse to play the animal introduction game\u201d) wears a Braves cap, chews gum, and is twenty-one and a senior at Auburn. He doesn\u2019t laugh along with everybody else and he rolls his eyes when anyone mentions a frat. He seems very into the whole Camping Experience because he keeps bringing up fly-fishing and trailblazing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet everyone,\u201d Megan says. \u201cLet me go over our schedule for the next two days. Tonight we\u2019re going to focus on ethics and Bible studies we\u2019ll do with the campers, but tomorrow and Sunday we\u2019ll do a run-through of a week at camp. We\u2019ll grill out and we\u2019ll go swimming, canoeing, kayaking, and creek stomping. I encourage you all to get to know each other. Each week you\u2019ll be paired with a new counselor of the opposite sex. Our groups of campers consist of twenty boys and girls, and your cabins will be side-by-side. You and your co-counselor are responsible for your group all hours of the day, except for during activities, when campers rotate among us.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around my leg and drop my chin onto my knee. Thinking of children reminds me of Emily\u2019s baby and what I did. I shut my eyes.</p> <p>Megan tells us who our partners are for week one. Parker pouts when she hears she\u2019s been paired with \u00fcber camper Eric while Will\u2019s paired with Andrea. Matt\u2019s with Catfish Carlie and I\u2019m matched with Bumblebee Brad.</p><p>He lifts his chin and winks at me. Not in a creepy way, but in a friendly way. I decide I like Bumblebee Brad.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Megan says, twirling her whistle like she\u2019s doing nunchucks. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll put somebody\u2019s eye out. \u201cEveryone gets weekends off. But no one is allowed to be here over the weekend\u2014it\u2019s a liability for the regional conference. As some of you know, we had to fire two counselors who broke this rule last year.\u201d</p><p>We take a break before our camp tour and our first session: \u201cA Practical Introduction to Sharing God\u2019s Love with Young People.\u201d</p><p>I dart away from Great Oak before I have to speak to anyone. I go to my Volvo, to grab my sketchpad and pencils and to check my cell, and surprisingly, I don\u2019t have any missed calls. I can\u2019t believe my parents haven\u2019t called a bazillion times already. And Emily usually calls me once a day, but I haven\u2019t been answering.</p> <p>Not since our fight.</p><p>I angle my phone toward the sky. I don\u2019t seem to be getting any reception here. Not even one bar. I should be using this time to talk to God about everything anyway. And I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about not picking up Emily\u2019s calls.</p><p>I drop the cell into my car\u2019s cup holder, stealing a deep breath. I take in the purple and pink sunset. This isn\u2019t bad so far\u2014I mean, besides the fact most of these counselors seem obsessed with their fraternities. I noticed Andrea playing with her necklace made of Greek letters, and the Jeep parked next to me has a \u201cGreek for Life\u201d Delta Tau Kappa bumper sticker and no doors (must be Matt\u2019s).</p><p>He drives a Jeep with no doors?</p><p>I lean my head against my steering wheel and pray and hope and think about the sign. The sign I desperately need.</p><p>Without Emily, without soccer, and without my relationship with God, who am I anymore? Can you forgive me? I pray.</p> <p>Can I forgive myself?</p><p>The memory of the fight floods my mind and won\u2019t go away. I clutch my steering wheel.</p><p>Three weeks ago, I let myself into Emily\u2019s room to find her sitting at her desk, mascara and tears staining her cheeks. I hugged her and helped her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cMom found the paperwork,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe found the paperwork from the women\u2019s center in my backpack.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my face. Told my heart to stop pounding. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Dad asked me to move out. They\u2019re beyond pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want you to move out now?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWe graduate in three days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I graduate.\u201d She pointed at an ad for a studio apartment on her laptop screen. \u201cI guess I won\u2019t work at camp. I\u2019ll go to Nashville early so I can make more money. It\u2019s only three months until college starts.\u201d Even if she didn\u2019t have her parents\u2019 support anymore, at least she had her scholarship.</p> <p>I clutched the bedspread, not looking directly at her. Her parents kicking her out didn\u2019t surprise me. They\u2019re all about appearances. They\u2019re the type of people who wear fancy clothes so people will think they\u2019re rich, but behind the scenes they\u2019re drowning in debt. Having a daughter pregnant out of wedlock would make them gossip fodder for our entire church.</p><p>\u201cYou can move in with us if you need to,\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded and the tears flowed down her cheeks again. I hugged Emily for the longest time. Then I chewed on my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cStop biting your nail,\u201d she said. Since she had come back from her symphony camp in D.C. last summer, she\u2019d been bossy. I took my thumb out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCan we pray together?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cI need to.\u201d</p><p>Several heartbeats went by before she said quietly, \u201cI can\u2019t pray with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. I don\u2019t buy it. Any of it.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over onto my knees. I didn\u2019t understand what she was saying. All I knew was that I needed my friend and I needed to pray.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d I asked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why you need to pray. Nothing happened to you.\u201d She folded her arms across her stomach and hunched over.</p><p>It didn\u2019t just happen to her. It happened because she decided to sleep with Jacob. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said. \u201cI sinned. I sinned to help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sin.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she understand that I\u2019d shoved aside everything I believe in, everything at the core of who I am, to help her? By taking her to the women\u2019s center, by holding her hand while the doctor spoke to her, I gave up who I am. I gave up the relationship I had with God and openly defied Him to help her. I sat in the exam room while it happened.</p><p>I told her all of that.</p><p>Her face went red and her eyes glossed over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking you to pray with me,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a judgmental bitch,\u201d she replied, wiping a tear off her cheek. Her eyes popped open, as if she couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d just said.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it either.</p><p>Pain crushed my chest. I stood up from her bed and wiped my hands on my jeans. \u201cI just...needed to pray.\u201d I barely got the words out before I started crying.</p><p>She jumped up, knocking a pillow to the rug, reaching out a hand to me. \u201cKate\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without saying anything, I left her house and haven\u2019t picked up a call from her since. Not because I don\u2019t miss her, because I do, but because I lost part of myself that day and I don\u2019t want to lose even more.</p><p>I pray for the sign; I want Him to tell me that what I did, helping to end a baby\u2019s life, is okay. Because everything within me says it\u2019s not. If I hadn\u2019t taken her to the center, maybe she would\u2019ve changed her mind about aborting the baby. Maybe her parents wouldn\u2019t have freaked out on her.</p><p>I have a billion what-ifs and no way forward.</p><p>I pray to God, telling Him I want my Emily back. Because without her, and without knowing what I\u2019m supposed to do next, life kind of feels like french fries without the salt.</p><p>Here in the now, something smashes into the driver\u2019s side window, rattling it. I jump, hitting my head on the car\u2019s ceiling.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I rub the top of my head.</p><p>I climb out, carrying my sketchbook and pencils. Matt hustles up to retrieve a basketball bouncing beside my car\u2019s front left tire.</p><p>He\u2019s not wearing a shirt, and seeing his muscles nearly makes my heart stop. Then his blue eyes and tan biceps are right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he says, smiling down at me. He has a dimple in his chin.</p><p>He should be a bicep model. Is there such a thing as a bicep model? Like hand models who model watches and rings? I guess a bicep model would show off tattoos.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, touching my head.</p><p>He tosses the basketball up and down. \u201cI wanted to ask...do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so familiar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go to camp here when you were little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He grins and looks around. \u201cAre you King Crab Kate?\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth with a hand. \u201cOh my gosh\u2014you\u2019re Miniature Poodle Matt!\u201d</p><p>He drops the ball, rushes forward, and hugs me. His arms and chest are all sweaty, but I hug him back.</p><p>\u201cI totally won our cannonball contest,\u201d I say. \u201cI beat you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, keep telling yourself that,\u201d he says, releasing me. We fought about that contest for days.</p><p>\u201cYou shared your ice cream with me.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cI took you to the Thursday Night Dance!\u201d</p><p>I touch my mouth, remembering how he pulled me behind the art pavilion and quickly pecked my lips. He looks at my face and I know he remembers.</p><p>\u201cYou were my first kiss,\u201d he says, pointing at me.</p><p>And my only, I think.</p><p>Now we\u2019re both laughing.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d Brad calls out. \u201cCan we get the ball back?\u201d</p><p>After he hurls the ball back into Brad\u2019s hands, Matt picks up his black T-shirt from the asphalt and slips it over his head, then gestures toward the path. We fall into step with each other and stroll down the trail.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing shoes?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks down at his filthy feet. \u201cCutting to the chase, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few years ago? I got into marathoning. I\u2019ve done seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve run seven marathons?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cI want to try to run the Chicago marathon barefoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarefoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds cool. Maybe after that you could run a marathon dressed up as Miss Piggy or Elvis or something.\u201d</p><p>He stops walking and a smile spreads across his face. \u201cOr I could run the marathon dressed as Miss Piggy. Barefoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigs have hooves, not feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting too complicated for me. I can\u2019t run a marathon in hooves.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve paused next to this big fat cedar tree, smiling at each other. He peels bark away from the tree\u2019s trunk, catching my eye. I can\u2019t believe this is the Matt I knew when I was eleven. He\u2019s changed so much. The quiet, skinny boy I knew wore glasses and had a comb-over. Always had a Hardy Boys book in his hand. Shy. He rarely smiled. But I remember how he smiled at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now he\u2019s a literature major with a mess of dirty blond hair who could be a bicep model.</p><p>I say quietly, \u201cI\u2019d love to run again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to play soccer. I fell and tore my ACL last fall.\u201d</p> <p>Matt winces and checks out my knee. I want to cover the long, thin scar.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t play again after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did a lot of physical therapy this spring. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to play intramural in college.\u201d It\u2019s a total long shot.</p><p>He asks, \u201cWere you a good runner before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good. I played center midfield.\u201d</p> <p>He looks impressed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got hurt.\u201d</p><p>I clutch my sketchbook closer to my chest, trying to forget how much my injury had hurt. Physically and in my mind. I haven\u2019t gone running since it happened, because I\u2019m scared I might tear something again. I stick to the exercise bike now.</p><p>But I miss feeling my long black hair flopping against my back in the wind. My heart pounding and blood rushing through me as I sprint faster than anybody. I miss being part of a team where we spoke a common language: soccer.</p><p>Looking down at my scar, I say, \u201cIt happens, I guess.\u201d But God didn\u2019t have it happen to anyone else on my team.</p><p>I point at the restroom pavilion, indicating I need to use it. We walk over there to find that Parker and Will have snuck into the darkness behind the bathroom pavilion and he\u2019s got her pressed up against the wooden wall. They are kissing fast and furiously and their hands are everywhere. I\u2019m a little curious, because no boy has ever kissed me passionately like that, and I spend way too much time imagining what it would be like. Tingles rush up my spine and my face goes rosy, for spying, for being jealous.</p><p>\u201cGeez,\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>Matt and I stare at Parker and Will, then move inside the pavilion filled with picnic tables.</p><p>\u201cGuess they couldn\u2019t hold out.\u201d Matt chuckles softly. He\u2019s okay with this? With Parker and Will getting all handsy at church camp? It reminds me of how uncomfortable I was in my high school cafeteria, where the football players made out with girls all the time, slipping their hands under shirts and skirts.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you just can\u2019t wait,\u201d Matt says.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I say with a tiny voice, wondering what kind of guy he is now.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like, a couple weeks ago? My mom sent me to pick my little sisters up from ballet, and on the way home, I saw this new restaurant called Just Tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Tacos.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cBut it was weird. They had a lot more than just tacos there. They had fajitas and quesadillas and enchiladas. I told the waitress that a burrito isn\u2019t a taco and she said, \u2018It\u2019s a big taco.\u2019 I cried bollocks on that one.\u201d</p><p>All this laughing feels good. \u201cSo what does Just Tacos have to do with kissing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides the fact I absolutely love both?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. How many girls has he kissed since he pecked my lips that time? He was thirteen then, so probably a bunch.</p><p>\u201cSo I was driving home and I got really hungry for a taco. I took my little sisters inside and we totally pigged out, and when I got home, my mom was pissed because she had cooked a roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you just couldn\u2019t help getting the taco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He puts his hands in his shorts pockets and glances from the ground up to my face. The lantern light filling the pavilion really brings out the green flecks in his blue eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, King Crab Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Miniature Poodle Matt.\u201d We smile at each other some more. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot. You\u2019re more confident.\u201d</p><p>He blushes. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot too.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows.</p><p>He looks me up and down, at my khaki shorts, tank top, and the cross charm hanging from my neck. His eyes move from my long black ponytail hanging over my shoulder to the freckles dotting my nose. My breath hitches in my throat.</p><p>He adds, \u201cYou\u2019re a lot taller. I bet you can ride the big kid rides at the fair now.\u201d</p><p>I playfully nudge his shoulder and take in his eyes again. I don\u2019t want to look away.</p><p>He coughs lightly into a fist and points over his shoulder at the bathroom\u2014I need to go too. I push open the screen door to find Andrea and Carlie chatting next to the sink. I decide to listen\u2014subtly, I hope\u2014before walking inside.</p><p>Carlie is drying her hands on a paper towel. \u201cMatt seems happier this summer.\u201d</p><p>Andrea fluffs her short blond hair. \u201cHe\u2019s still not over it...\u201d</p><p>Carlie throws the paper towel away, then uncaps her lip gloss. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn he was checking you out when you first got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019s not interested in dating at all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan asked me to share a bed in Dogwood. Thank God, it\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve gotten any.\u201d</p><p>Andrea laughs, and my heart speeds up. It\u2019s nothing new, but it always upsets me when I hear about other Christians doing it. Don\u2019t they hear the same lessons as I do in Sunday School?</p><p>\u201cI sooo want Matt,\u201d Andrea says. \u201cI haven\u2019t fooled around in like, a year.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t listen anymore. I let the screen door slam behind me and walk into the bathroom. Andrea and Carlie shoot me looks before I push the stall door open and sit down. A beetle is crawling on the floor, so I edge my sneaker away from it.</p><p>What hasn\u2019t Matt gotten over?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that new girl was eavesdropping,\u201d I hear Andrea say as the door slams shut.</p><p>When I come out of the bathroom, Andrea\u2019s sitting on a picnic table, talking with Matt.</p><p>I bite down on both of my lips. I loved our conversation, and now he\u2019s off talking to Andrea already. I tell myself he\u2019s not the same boy I knew when I was eleven anymore. He\u2019s twenty, a grown-up. A bicep model.</p><p>He\u2019s not interested in dating anybody...?</p><p>He looks over at me and waves. I wave back and inch away toward Great Oak, passing by Parker and Will again. Now they are holding hands and talking quietly. If I\u2019d gotten the chance to date Will Whitfield, would he have tried to put his hands all over me? I\u2019m not that kind of girl.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t think Emily was that kind of girl, either.</p><p>sketch #332</p><p>what happened on april 17</p><p>I sketch an outline of Emily\u2019s figure, thin and hunched over.</p><p>That day, she had sat on her porch steps and buried her face in her palms.</p><p>\u201cI have to do it,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up my scholarship.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gotten an offer to attend Belmont University\u2019s prestigious music school in Nashville, where she would study violin. Her grandfather played violin too, and the first time he heard her play, he knew she\u2019d go a lot further in life than he did. His claim to fame was playing the fiddle in front of crowds of three hundred at the Rutherford County Fair. Emily wanted more, and between junior and senior years, she\u2019d played for the National Youth Philharmonic in Washington, D.C.</p><p>I fan my colored pencils out on Great Oak\u2019s cedar deck. As I draw the scene, I add heavy mascara to Emily\u2019s eyes, something she never wore before D.C. I smudge her cheeks, to show her tears and the stress she was under that day in April. I make her lip gloss glisten and make her tight yellow skirt cling to her legs. I draw myself looking confused. Eyebrows tilted down. Hands stuffed in my armpits.</p><p>Neither of us admitted it, but that summer had changed her. She had started using words we\u2019d only heard in movies. She showed off more cleavage and went quiet during Sunday school. She didn\u2019t participate anymore. With a voice full of wonder, she would say things like, \u201cDo you think God really exists?\u201d I told her, of course there is a God.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t understand why she was questioning that, and that made me think about my own beliefs. Church was all I had ever known, and Emily had come back from D.C., telling me most kids there didn\u2019t believe or they belonged to some other religion that I knew nothing about, like Judaism and Islam. Why didn\u2019t we learn anything about those religions in Sunday School? Why didn\u2019t we have more than a few temples and mosques in Tennessee? The only thing I knew about either religion was what I had learned in history class: the Holocaust, 9/11.</p><p>I knew what I was supposed to believe: God is great. God loves me. I don\u2019t want to go to Hell. I know some people wonder whether Heaven and Hell truly exist, but do those people question whether gravity exists? Or oxygen? You can\u2019t see those with your naked eye, either. I can\u2019t see cologne on a guy\u2019s body, but I can smell it. I may not be able to see Heaven, but deep inside, I can feel it.</p><p>Anyway, Emily\u2019s boyfriend of three years liked her physical changes a lot, and when the three of us would hang out together, Jacob and Emily disappeared upstairs into her bedroom more frequently. I figured they wanted to kiss in private.</p><p>Before she went to D.C., she\u2019d once told me about how Jacob had gone up her shirt and unsnapped her bra.</p><p>\u201cEmily, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d I had said.</p><p>\u201cPrude,\u201d she\u2019d replied with a laugh.</p><p>Maybe I was a prude, but that\u2019s how I wanted to be. We had been told to save ourselves for marriage. After that, she tried to talk to me about physical stuff she did with Jacob, but it always made me uncomfortable.</p><p>A small part of me was jealous. I wanted a guy to kiss me. To touch me.</p><p>But Mom sent me to Sunday School every week and she taught me to follow the Bible\u2019s instructions (thou shall not steal, thou shall not lie), to do what our pastors say. And for good reason.</p><p>Like, my pastor told us not to drink. That made a lot of sense after James Macanley drove his truck into a backhoe and slashed his forehead open on the windshield. He had to get seventeen stitches. Sex before marriage isn\u2019t smart because you can get pregnant or contract some nasty disease. Taking drugs is stupid. Why mess up your brain like that?</p><p>God\u2019s laws just make sense. And like I said, before Emily went to D.C., I honestly never knew there were other options, other beliefs. It was like a part of my brain opened up to this whole new world. A world I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Using my pink coloring pencil, I shade in Emily\u2019s Converse, which she was staring down at.</p><p>That day on her porch in April, Emily wiped her eyes and said, \u201cI want to play for the National Symphony. I can\u2019t have a baby.\u201d</p><p>In elementary school, my Barbies married Emily\u2019s Ken dolls. In middle school, we shared deodorant after gym class. Freshman year, when Kristen Markum called me a Jesus Freak, Emily got in her face and told her to shut up. I loved Emily more than anything.</p><p>\u201cHave you prayed about it?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cI need to do what\u2019s best for me. I think God would want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what He wants,\u201d I replied, and bit my lip.</p><p>\u201cI want to get an abortion,\u201d she said so quietly I could barely hear her.</p><p>I dug the heels of my hands into my eyes to stanch my tears. If I were her, I would\u2019ve married the father and had the baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted to tell Emily that at nine weeks, a fetus can wrap his tiny fingers around his nose and toes. At fourteen weeks, which was about how far along Emily was, a fetus learns to suck his thumb.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we talk to your mom?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she blurted. \u201cNo one can know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Jacob think?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced up at me, her eyes watering. \u201cHe can\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s his baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my body.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my chest, squeezing my T-shirt. \u201cWhat happened? Didn\u2019t you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cThis one time it kind of slipped off and Jacob didn\u2019t notice until we were finished.\u201d</p> <p>I paced around in circles until Emily told me to stop. My face felt stretched and stung from tears. I could tell I was getting on her nerves. I could tell she thought I was immature. But this was a living, soon-to-be breathing person we were talking about. A new life.</p><p>\u201cCould you put the baby up for adoption?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cJacob wouldn\u2019t go for that. That\u2019s why he can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cBecause I love him and wanted to be with him. Isn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d</p><p>The thought of saving myself for my future husband\u2014the person who would love me and understand me better than anybody\u2014thrilled me. I can\u2019t wait to share myself with a guy someday.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ll love the baby you made with him?\u201d</p><p>She let out a sob. Cried for a minute straight. She loved the baby growing inside her.</p><p>She said, \u201cI want my future. I want to compose music and play for the National Symphony. I want that.\u201d</p><p>I sketch the flowerbeds and grass around Emily\u2019s front porch.</p><p>That day, I silently prayed to God, asking for help. And right then, Emily picked a few white clovers out of the ground. She started tying them together, like when we were kids. She and I would sit outside for hours, singing songs while making flower bracelets and necklaces and rings.</p><p>I watched as she made a bracelet, and smiling a slight smile, she handed it to me. I slipped it over my hand, onto my wrist. I knew Emily was still the same ole Emily, even if she\u2019d changed in D.C. She was my friend who I loved.</p><p>I sat beside her on the step and hooked my arm through hers. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Megan\u2019s calling us back to training now, but before I put my pencils away, I draw the clover bracelet, looping it around my wrist.</p> <p>never have i ever</p><p>friday, june 1 ~ week 1 of 7</p><p>After two hours of ethics, and in a very un-camping-like move, Megan announces we\u2019re having pizza delivered for dinner.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eric says, throwing his hands in the air before going back to cleaning supplies in his tackle box. He must be pissed we\u2019re not out hunting deer with bows and arrows and grilling it up. This isn\u2019t Beowulf, Eric. It\u2019s 2012!</p><p>\u201cEveryone give Matt your topping preference,\u201d Megan says.</p><p>With my hands in my back pockets, I approach the picnic table where he\u2019s hovering over a sheet of paper with a laughing Andrea. She touches his elbow and whispers in his ear while I stand there.</p><p>He clicks his pen, edging away from her. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you have, King Crab Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepperoni and mushrooms, Miniature Poodle Matt.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he writes my order down in shaky cursive. It\u2019s cute.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Andrea asks me. She moves so close to him she might as well sit on his lap.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell you when the food gets here,\u201d she replies, and goes back to acting like I don\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Matt says to me, fumbling with his pen. He glances up at my face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed you with that whole riding in your pouch thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cI have no idea what you meant, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what I meant either.\u201d He smiles, pushing the pen behind his ear. He places his palms on the picnic table and leans toward me. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to Belmont this fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start unpacking supplies,\u201d Megan interrupts, so I smile at him before moving away. We all start sorting through big white boxes of camp T-shirts, games, spatulas, frying pans. I dig right into the new paints and crayons, and start surveying the arts and crafts closet in the open-air pavilion. I have to admit, I love being surrounded by fresh air and listening to crickets and other bugs making their noises. It\u2019s relaxing and I can let my brain float away into a world of colors.</p><p>I love painting and sketching. My Uncle Steve is a cartoonist and has been drawing political comics for The Tennessean for the past twenty years, but it doesn\u2019t pay much\u2014Uncle Steve has borrowed money from Daddy on occasion. Grandpa Kelly always says that drawings don\u2019t get you anywhere in life, really, and while I spend lots of rainy Saturday afternoons doing watercolors and sketching, it\u2019s something I do to de-stress. My parents think I have the ability to become a lawyer, like Daddy and Aunt Missy and Grandpa Kelly.</p><p>The truth is, I have no idea what I want to major in. Architecture, a career that requires a lot of math, aka something I am truly terrible at? Art, a career where I\u2019d make no money? Interior design, like Mom? Pre-law track, like Daddy? I should decide soon: college starts in three months, after all, and if I could figure out what to do with my life, I wouldn\u2019t waste time taking classes that won\u2019t count toward my major.</p><p>I unload a bag of my own supplies into the closet. I brought a painting I did when I was a camper: a watercolor painting of White Oak cabin. I tack it on the inside of the door, to remind myself of how much I loved Cumberland Creek as a kid.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I hear a voice say, and turn around to find Parker standing there with Will.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I did it a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019re into art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy one true love.\u201d I give her a smile.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brad says, striding up with hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cI also love soccer. And coffee.\u201d</p><p>Brad chuckles. \u201cDo you need caffeine to survive? Because they don\u2019t serve Coke at the cafeteria here.\u201d He shudders, as Carlie walks over.</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot about that,\u201d Will whines. \u201cI remember when I was little, how at the end of a week of camp, I always begged Mom to take me straight to McDonald\u2019s for a Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did the same thing,\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get a secret stash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that too loud,\u201d Brad says quietly. \u201cMegan\u2019s a real stickler for us following the same rules campers do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised our lights-out time isn\u2019t nine p.m. like the campers,\u201d Ian says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get some of those Five-Hour Energy things,\u201d Parker jokes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do without cigarettes,\u201d Carlie groans. \u201cLast summer I died without them. But some nights I was able to sneak away and smoke down by the lake.\u201d</p><p>The Middle Tennessee regional conference is made up of six churches, and each nominates members to be counselors here every summer. I\u2019ve never been to any of the other churches, but based on how Carlie and Andrea act, I can\u2019t imagine those churches are anything like Forrest Sanctuary.</p><p>\u201cPeople smoke here?\u201d I whisper to Parker. She goes to my church, so she should understand what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cSo I didn\u2019t think people would do that sort of thing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care one way or the other,\u201d Parker replies, rolling her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p><p>After hearing that, I edge away from the conversation and finish unpacking my art supplies. This is church camp. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for counselors to sneak away at night to go smoke. And since I sinned majorly, I need to show God that I\u2019m still a good person.</p><p>The pizza comes, and after we say grace, we divvy it up. Andrea grabs a seat right next to Matt. I had been planning on trying to sit with him. He looks over at me and raises his shoulders, as if to say he\u2019s sorry.</p><p>I sit down beside Brad and sip my water. \u201cIs your arm okay?\u201d I ask, checking out those bruises again.</p><p>He shoves his sleeve down, trying to cover them. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks painful.\u201d</p><p>Brad nods. \u201cIt was. A game of pick-up basketball got nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get into a fight or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I fell onto the asphalt,\u201d he says, but I don\u2019t believe him one bit. The bruises look like finger marks. He pulls down on his T-shirt again. \u201cDo you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d I reply. I nibble at a pepperoni, then focus on Matt across the pavilion. He laughs at something Parker just said and scratches his cheek before folding a slice in half and taking a huge bite. He and I keep glancing at each other so much I guess it finally gets to Andrea.</p><p>She stands up and says, \u201cWe should play another introduction game. To get to know the new hires better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s up for a game of Never Have I Ever?\u201d Carlie asks.</p><p>Ian says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll get the pennies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move it over here,\u201d Matt says, coming to sit beside me on the bench. I\u2019m sandwiched between him and Bumblebee Brad.</p><p>Everyone squeezes around my picnic table except for Megan and Eric, who\u2019s going on and on about how his girlfriend dumped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Megan says, not sounding sorry at all.</p><p>\u201cTwo years gone. That\u2019s all,\u201d Eric replies. He wipes his mouth with a napkin and taps his big brown combat boot on the concrete floor.</p><p>Matt leans over to my ear. \u201cMegan wants Eric bad. And Eric wants Megan\u2019s job bad. And Megan is trying to protect her job while trying to win Eric\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>I cringe.</p><p>\u201cExactly the response I was looking for,\u201d Matt says with a laugh. \u201cLast summer I about put my name up for the director position just so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with them anymore.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at him, smiling. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that would require me to be responsible. Now, are we ready to play?\u201d</p><p>Everyone has a pile of pennies in front of them. The rules are this:</p><p>Someone says something they have never done. For instance, I have never gone deep sea fishing. If a player has gone deep sea fishing, he or she has to throw a penny in a bucket in the center of the table. The pennies don\u2019t really mean anything except to show who\u2019s done what. It\u2019s like a game of Truth or Dare with cash but without the dare. I would rather have the dare than deal with truth after truth after truth.</p><p>Carlie goes first. She taps a penny on the picnic table. \u201cNever have I ever gone skydiving.\u201d</p><p>Ian is the only person who throws a penny in the bucket.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hot,\u201d Carlie says to him. \u201cYou must be fearless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTotally fearless,\u201d Ian growls, and I get the sense that if no one else was here, they\u2019d totally sweep the bucket of pennies to the floor and start going at it on the picnic table.</p><p>Matt whispers in my ear again. \u201cThey hook up every summer. She gets away with anything \u2019cause her mom is vice president of the regional conference.\u201d</p><p>Ian says, \u201cNever have I ever worn ladies\u2019 underwear.\u201d</p><p>All the girls throw a penny in the bucket, and Will pretends like he\u2019s about to, then he changes his mind.

I like the way his breath feels warm on my ear. Our shoulders touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed, y\u2019all,\u201d Megan says, leaving the pavilion. \u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d</p><p>Eric then announces he\u2019s going to ensure the camp\u2019s main gate is locked so that intruders can\u2019t get in.</p> <p>\u201cNow we can play for real,\u201d Andrea whispers, twirling her blond hair.</p><p>\u201cThat guy is such a douche,\u201d I hear Ian muttering to Brad, who nods.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever gone skinny dipping,\u201d Andrea says.</p><p>\u201cNo one believes that,\u201d Brad says, as Ian and Carlie throw pennies into the bucket. Yay, Matt doesn\u2019t toss a penny! Will drops a penny in the bucket, then shrugs sheepishly at a gaping Parker. She rolls her eyes and throws a penny in too.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever been in love,\u201d Brad says.</p><p>Andrea and Ian throw pennies into the bucket. Parker\u2019s face grows pink and Will lowers his chin. They aren\u2019t in love yet? Matt raps his penny on the table for a second, then tosses his in.</p> <p>I clutch my penny, wishing I could say I\u2019ve been in love. I glance sideways at Matt, to find he\u2019s looking out of the pavilion into the woods. Who has he been in love with?</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Parker,\u201d Carlie says.</p><p>Parker gets this really coy look on her face. \u201cNever have I ever kissed a girl.\u201d</p><p>All of the guys toss a penny into the bucket. And then Carlie and Andrea do too.</p><p>My mouth falls open.</p><p>Matt leans over to my ear again. \u201cI bet they kissed each other. For practice.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. Andrea shoots me a look.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Brad asks. \u201cYou go, Kate.\u201d</p> <p>I chew on my thumb. \u201cNever have I ever eaten coconut ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Everyone glances around at each other. Andrea snorts. Matt, Carlie, Brad, and Parker throw pennies in.</p><p>Matt grins at me sideways. \u201cI\u2019m a vanilla guy, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like strawberry,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cCoconut tastes like ass,\u201d Ian announces, tossing a penny in.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Matt!\u201d Andrea says loudly.</p><p>He leans his head back, thinking. \u201cNever have I ever driven heavy construction equipment.\u201d</p><p>Nobody throws a penny in.</p><p>\u201cBoring,\u201d Carlie says. Her mouth lifts into a smirk, and she glances between me and Matt. \u201cNever have I ever gone streaking across the MTSU campus.\u201d</p><p>Matt sneaks a glimpse of me, then raps a penny on the table before tossing it in the bucket.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I missed seeing that!\u201d Andrea exclaims.</p><p>\u201cThat takes balls,\u201d Will says, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI heard what they made you do with that banana in the dining hall,\u201d Ian says to Matt, laughing.</p><p>I sit up straight.</p><p>\u201cMy frat made me do it,\u201d Matt whispers to me, avoiding my eyes. \u201cTo get in.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s been in love. He might still be in love. His body has transformed from that of Bill Nye Science Guy to that of Adonis. Girls talk about him in the bathroom, and it\u2019s not to make fun of him. He streaks across campus to impress other guys.</p><p>And my pile of pennies is mostly untouched.</p><p>I roll my suitcase over the bumpy, dusty trail toward Birdland. Megan said we should go ahead and get our cabins set up for this week. Brad and I have been assigned to the Cardinal cabins.</p><p>Andrea and Carlie pass by me, carrying sleeping bags and pillows, chatting about some shirt they like at Abercrombie.</p><p>Ian sprints by me, slaps my arm, and yells, \u201cYou\u2019re it!\u201d</p><p>Brad and Matt chase behind him, whooping.</p><p>Their noise echoes in the wind. The wind rustles the fragrant pine trees. I try to find the moon over the tops of the trees, but they\u2019re too tall. These woods must be several hundred years old\u2014they\u2019re large and in charge.</p><p>That\u2019s when Parker and Will come walking up. He\u2019s carrying two sleeping bags over his shoulders and she\u2019s hugging his waist and laughing. They pause to kiss.</p><p>I clear my throat to let them know I\u2019m here.</p><p>They break apart and she wipes her mouth with two fingers. \u201cHey, Kate,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everybody going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She looks at him. He looks at her. Will says, \u201cWe\u2019re all sleeping over in Dogwood. You can grab a bed in there if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls are sleeping in the same cabin as boys?\u201d I ask. I thought it was just Carlie and Ian.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Parker says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to me.\u201d Emily and Jacob always snuck off together and look what happened. And now a bunch of counselors are basically going to share a bedroom?</p><p>I bite down on my lips, trying not to remember how Emily\u2019s face looked after the abortion. Splotchy red marks dotted her cheeks and pain filled her glossy eyes. She kept asking me what the doctor was going to do with the baby and I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her. I just kept squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cGuys and girls shouldn\u2019t share a cabin,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a sin. What if someone gets pregnant? I\u2019m not helping you if that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Parker\u2019s eyes pop open. She grabs Will\u2019s elbow. \u201cI told you I\u2019d try to be nice, but if she acts nasty, it\u2019s really hard for me to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Will says in a soothing voice to Parker. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cMaybe \u2018nasty\u2019 was the wrong word,\u201d Will says carefully, shifting the sleeping bags in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the right word?\u201d I ask, almost scared to know.</p><p>\u201cJudgmental,\u201d Parker says, staring me down. Will squeezes his eyes closed.</p><p>Emily said the same thing about me. That\u2019s why we got into the fight. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t talked to her in three weeks. In the past, people at school would call us Jesus Freaks, and Emily always told me not to worry, that they were raised differently than us. And I believed her\u2014until she called me judgmental and said that church isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Why do Emily and Parker, who were both raised in the church right alongside me, think so differently now? What changed?</p><p>Was I supposed to have changed?</p><p>Is that why I\u2019ve never had a real boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cJudgmental?\u201d I say softly. \u201cReally?\u201d I add, even more softly.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Parker exclaims. \u201cLike last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my mom left my dad for another woman last year, you weren\u2019t supportive at all.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back.</p><p>She goes on, \u201cYou acted like I didn\u2019t exist when I needed friends more than anything.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to argue, then close it. She\u2019s right. Brother John always said if you associate with people who sin, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll sin too. So I steered clear of Parker, because after her mom left, she started hooking up with lots of guys at school and supposedly she seduced a teacher. Who does that?</p><p>That line of thinking didn\u2019t do me much good, though\u2014I ended up helping Emily do something so, so wrong. I did it because I love her.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d Parker continues. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I have to spend time with you.\u201d She turns on her heels and marches toward Dogwood.</p><p>Will gives me a shrug. \u201cNight, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Then he follows her and I\u2019m left standing in the middle of the trail, surrounded by drooping branches and darkness.</p><p>That night, I sleep alone in Cardinal, with only the whir of a box fan to keep me company. The fan blows warm air across my shaking body. Tears coat my cheeks and no matter how much I try to empty my mind, all I can think about is what I did to Emily\u2019s baby. Emily\u2019s baby, and what Emily and Parker said about me being judgmental.</p><p>I\u2019m not happy, and I\u2019m making everyone around me miserable. If I don\u2019t figure my life out, the loneliness will continue into college. Into forever? What if I never have a best friend again?</p><p>What\u2019s going on in Dogwood right now? If I were in there, would Matt be sleeping in the bed next to mine? What does he wear to bed? Pajamas? A T-shirt and shorts? Only boxers?</p><p>I shake those thoughts out of my mind and clutch my pillow.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried to live a good Christian life. I follow the Bible to a T. I listen to everything Brother John says. I\u2019m trying harder than ever and it just isn\u2019t working. This is not the sign I was looking for.</p><p>I\u2019m a good, good girl.</p><p>A good, good girl who\u2019s got no friends.</p><p>A good, good girl who helped her ex-friend get an abortion.</p><p>I don\u2019t deserve any friends.</p><p>I focus on the humming box fan, watching one blade spinning over and over in the same circle.</p><p>The next morning when I wake up, I grab my shower caddy and head to the bathhouse. I cut across the dewy grass. Nobody\u2019s awake yet. That\u2019s a good thing since my face feels puffy and I need a long cool shower to rinse off the sweat and shame from last night. I shriek when I find two massive granddaddy longlegs in the shower stall, then laugh at myself. They can\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, the clean underwear, T-shirt, and shorts I put on make me feel like I just left a spa. But the guilt is still fresh. I run my things back to Cardinal, where I dry my long black hair and put on sunscreen, as if it could stop the freckles. When I step back out onto the porch, I jump.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning to you too,\u201d he says, yawning.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my morning breath had upset you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lounging on the porch swing. Sunglasses sit on top of his head. I take in his biceps and lazy smile and the blond stubble covering his cheeks and dimpled chin.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2019s snoring sounds like a freight train.\u201d</p><p>We smile at each other. A long, still moment. He makes me feel calm, like wrapping up in my robe after a hot shower. I can\u2019t explain it. But then I remember he\u2019s a streaker. How far did he have to run when he went streaking?</p><p>Instead of dressing as Miss Piggy, what if he ran a marathon naked?</p><p>And then I\u2019m wondering what he looks like naked.</p><p>And then I\u2019m shaking my head and rubbing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d see if you\u2019ll help with breakfast?\u201d He scratches the back of his neck, peering up at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my day to fix breakfast for everybody. Want some expert tips on scrambling eggs and making doughnuts over a campfire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make doughnuts over a campfire?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cOh sure.\u201d He smirks a little. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything fancy like Boston cream pie or anything, but I can make killer cinnamon doughnut holes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love those,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d love some company.\u201d He stands up, clutching a shaved tree branch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cMy walking stick? It assists me in walking.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw. Of course not. I\u2019m the lifeguard! Who would hire an injured lifeguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mistake indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious,\u201d I find myself saying.</p><p>He elbows my arm and glances over at me. Using his walking stick, he makes his way to the cafeteria on the hill. The building\u2019s green paint is flaking off and the air smells like grease. He unlocks the doors and we raid the fridge for eggs, bacon, juice, and biscuit dough.</p><p>\u201cGrab that big can of Crisco off the shelf, please,\u201d he says, nodding toward it.</p> <p>We lug all the supplies back down to the fire pit area next to Great Oak. He says, \u201cLet\u2019s get us some firewood.\u201d Out in the woods, we pick up logs.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s too wet,\u201d he says.</p><p>I drop it and pick up another.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s too big,\u201d he says.</p><p>I drop it and pick up another.</p><p>\u201cGet some tiny branches for kindling, please,\u201d he says.</p><p>Matt arranges the logs in the fire pit, then grabs a wad of paper towels and stuffs them under the sticks. Then he turns the Crisco can upside down and lets the goop drip onto the wood. He lights a match and throws it on the wood pile. A flame bursts up.</p><p>I jump back, panting. \u201cAre you a pyromaniac?\u201d I blurt.</p> <p>\u201cCrisco\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says, smiling. Squatting, he begins tossing tiny sticks and grass onto the fire until the flame gets hot enough to catch the thicker logs.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that cheating?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware there are rules for starting a campfire when you\u2019re starving for breakfast. I mean, sure, if this was a Boy Scout competition I totally would\u2019ve been disqualified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll use your Crisco trick when it\u2019s time for me start my own fires,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI just converted you to my Crisco Cult!\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNow what do I do, oh master of the Crisco Cult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab that cast-iron kettle and hang it over the fire,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd dump the rest of the Crisco in it so it\u2019ll melt. Then we\u2019ll fry up the doughnuts in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat doughnuts are we gonna fry?\u201d I ask, glancing at our supplies.</p><p>\u201cTake the biscuit dough and start rolling it into balls.\u201d</p><p>The first thing Matt does is get the coffee brewing (he has a secret stash). It\u2019s a humid June morning and the fire\u2019s roaring, so I\u2019m wiping sweat off my face like crazy. For a second I\u2019m terrified Matt thinks I look hideous, but then I glance over at him and find that his face is covered in dirt and he\u2019s all sweaty too.</p><p>Once Matt has the eggs cooking in the skillet, he pours us each a cup of coffee. I watch as he briefly shuts his eyes and murmurs a blessing.</p><p>He sips his coffee and asks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you share a cabin with us last night? Were you afraid that I snore too loud?\u201d</p><p>I bite back a laugh. \u201cNah. I just don\u2019t think my parents would like it if they knew I was sharing a room with boys. And what if the regional conference finds out? They\u2019d be mad.\u201d</p><p>Matt slaps his palm with the spatula. \u201cEh. They\u2019d never know. But I know what you mean. My mom would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. She\u2019s the youth minister at Bell Buckle Chapel and spends most of her time teaching sex ed and trying to keep teenagers out of each other\u2019s beds. Especially her own kids. My brother Jeremiah\u2019s practically a man whore.\u201d</p><p>I stop moving. \u201cA man whore?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cHe\u2019s got a new girlfriend every day.\u201d He points at me with the spatula. \u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating. One time, this girl Laura came to lunch at our house and by dinner she\u2019d been replaced by someone named Mary.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, rolling biscuit dough into a ball. \u201cAnd what about you? Are you a man whore?\u201d I stutter, trying not to seem interested in his answer.</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he says with a sigh. When he sees the look on my face, he quickly says, \u201cJust kidding. I\u2019m a one-girl kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just Andrea?\u201d I ask, baiting him.</p><p>He pauses and picks up his coffee cup from the picnic table. He sips. \u201cNaw. I\u2019m single right now. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m single all the time.\u201d I blush.</p><p>\u201cSo...you have a moratorium on dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cI just haven\u2019t dated anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cEver. Unless you count our date to the Thursday Night Dance that time.\u201d He\u2019s so easy to talk to, I can\u2019t help but tell the truth, no matter how embarrassing it is.</p><p>He takes a swig of coffee. \u201cAre you picky?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to answer that. This is probably the longest conversation I\u2019ve ever had with a boy. Well, besides Jacob, and he belonged to Emily. I still can\u2019t believe she broke up with him.</p><p>I sip some coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m picky too,\u201d he says before I can respond.</p><p>I change the subject. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow some bacon in that skillet, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Woman\u2019?\u201d I burst out laughing.</p><p>He adjusts his bandana, smiling at me, and my stomach leaps into my throat, and I feel this longing deep inside\u2014a longing to have a friend.</p><p>sketch #336</p><p>what happened on may 5</p><p>After making breakfast with Matt, I sharpen my pencil so I can sketch, to keep my mind off my pathetic dating history. But my plan doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>One day in May, I pulled open the front door and Jacob marched in, brushed past me, and headed for my living room. No hello, no hi, no nothing. I dug my fingernails into my palms and took a deep breath. I trudged into the living room and sat down beside him on the couch. His face was buried in his palms. Emily had broken up with him a week before, right after the abortion.</p><p>I had never seen him that upset. Come to think of it, I\u2019d never seen him upset at all. Jacob always had been a carefree kind of guy. I sketch his hair: black curls pulled back into a low ponytail. I draw the sticker-covered skateboard he always carries around, as he smiles and talks to everybody. Like Emily, he\u2019s insanely musically talented. Sometimes he wears a kilt and plays silly music on the bagpipes. Once he played \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for me and I couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Lots of girls wanted him, but he\u2019d been with Emily since they were fourteen years old.</p><p>I draw the blank TV screen that Jacob had stared at that day. Draw tears leaking from his eyes.</p><p>For a moment I wondered if he knew about the abortion, about what I had helped Emily do to his baby, when he spoke. \u201cWhat did I do wrong? Why did she break up with me? Please\u2014\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>I continued to dig my thumbnail into my palm. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t told me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up, flashing me a look. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath through my nose. \u201cI\u2019ll try to get her to talk to you, but I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know what\u2019s wrong, Kate. Tell me.\u201d His eyes dug into mine. \u201cDoes she not love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him that Emily loved him so much, but she wanted her future more than a life with the baby they hadn\u2019t planned for. But she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the decision she\u2019d made without Jacob, so she broke up with him. If Emily had had the baby, would she have had Emily\u2019s auburn hair? Would he have had Jacob\u2019s black curls?</p><p>And then I started crying for Jacob and Emily, who wanted to be together so badly. They loved each other, but her guilt was messing that all up.</p><p>That\u2019s not the only reason I cried.</p><p>Deep down, I was jealous of that love and I wanted a boy to show up crying for me because he loved me so much.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He abruptly stood up. \u201cThis is not what love is,\u201d he said, and left my house.</p><p>I start an outline of my body, sitting alone on the couch after Jacob left.</p><p>Then I scribble over it and start a new picture. A picture of Matt teaching me to use Crisco to start a campfire. I smile and reach for my yellow coloring pencil to draw the flames licking at my feet.</p><p>snake!</p><p>saturday, june 2 ~ week 1 of 7</p><p>Before going swimming, kayaking, and canoeing this afternoon, Megan\u2019s giving us time to plan our individual sessions. Will\u2019s in charge of the Monday ice cream night, so he\u2019s fiddling with homemade ice cream makers. Brad\u2019s been counting hula hoops, unfolding a giant parachute, and inspecting a tug-of-war rope because he\u2019s in charge of field games. Andrea\u2019s the camp videographer, so she\u2019s playing with various cameras and her laptop. Carlie\u2019s writing out clues for the treasure hunt.</p><p>Matt already cleaned the pool, so he\u2019s lounging in a camping chair, lazily strumming his guitar, playing what sounds like a Hawaiian version of \u201cKumbaya.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m inventorying the paintbrushes when Will plops down on the picnic table bench beside my closet.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispers, glancing over his shoulder at Parker. She sees him talking to me and her face looks pained. It\u2019s like she\u2019d rather him talk to a Playboy Bunny than me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him, placing paintbrushes in a plastic box and storing it on the shelf.</p><p>\u201cMatt said you seemed upset this morning.\u201d</p><p>I focus on my watercolor painting of White Oak and remember the time I found a frog in a bush outside the cabin. He was so scared, he peed on my hand. Part of the reason I like art so much is the escape. The escape into a world that I fill with my colors and music.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Parker yelled at you last night,\u201d Will says, lounging against the table.</p><p>I organize the boxes of crayons into a straight line. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt her,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d I just don\u2019t want someone else to go through the same pain as Emily and me.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her that, not me.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? She\u2019s a pretty forgiving person.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>After a few seconds, he goes, \u201cShe forgave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do wrong?\u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine. \u201cLeft her when she needed me most.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him that I don\u2019t have a best friend anymore.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Will says, drumming fingers on the picnic table. \u201cThis is none of my business and I hope you don\u2019t take it the wrong way, but I want to tell you something about your church.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I brace myself. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForrest Sanctuary destroyed Parker after her mom left.\u201d</p><p>I smooth my hair. Until last night, I had had no idea Parker was so badly affected. I mean, she and I were never all that close growing up\u2014I had Emily, after all. And Parker was always fooling around with random guys in high school. So I ask Will about that.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she was so screwed up?\u201d Will asks slowly. \u201cIt must suck to give your whole life to a church, only to watch everyone disappear when you need help.\u201d</p> <p>This reminds me of how Emily\u2019s parents kicked her out after the abortion. How I played it differently. I stuck by, only to have her call me a judgmental bitch.</p><p>I feel bad for not having noticed what Parker was going through.</p><p>\u201cSo Parker\u2019s mad at me because I go to her church?\u201d I ask quietly. \u201cBecause she\u2019s mad at our church?\u201d</p><p>Will lifts his shoulders. \u201cI think she\u2019s just, um, wary of people?\u201d</p><p>In high school, people called me a prude and Jesus Freak because I had no problem telling people that I care about church and God. It didn\u2019t make people rush to invite me to the movies on Friday night, that\u2019s for sure. But I had Emily to hang out with, and I had soccer, so all was okay.</p> <p>Until it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I say, \u201cParker\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI\u2019m lucky she agreed to give me another shot.\u201d</p><p>No guy has ever stood up for me this way. I glance over my shoulder at Matt.</p><p>\u201cIs Parker feeling better now?\u201d I ask Will. \u201cSince her mom left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to think so. But as you saw last night, she\u2019s definitely not anywhere close to being fine...She doesn\u2019t really have any friends who are girls.\u201d</p> <p>I know how that feels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m around if you want to talk more,\u201d he says, then leaps up and dashes across the trail to Great Oak, where he pulls Parker into his arms and pecks her lips. She grins.</p><p>My mouth edges into a smile.</p><p>We\u2019re walking down the path toward the lake, where Matt will train us to canoe and kayak. I look for trail markers that I can remember when walking my campers to the lake. Breadcrumbs, like Hansel and Gretel, but all I see are trees, trees, and more trees.</p><p>Parker is a little ways behind me, so I slow down.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, clearing my throat.</p><p>She just looks at me and passes on by like I said nothing. I open my mouth to speak again, but nada comes out. The thing is, I wasn\u2019t in the wrong last night. This is a job at church camp. Should guy and girl counselors really be sleeping in the same cabin together?</p><p>Rules exist for a reason, right?</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019d been less than tactless, accusing Parker of sinning, but I was just trying to help. And I feel bad for not noticing her pain during high school, but it\u2019s not like she paid much attention to me then, either. She never checked on me after my surgery or asked why I didn\u2019t play soccer anymore. The first time she confronts me, she bites my head off, leaving me embarrassed and alone.</p><p>Or have I made myself that way?</p><p>Am I embarrassed and alone because of who I am as a person?</p><p>\u201cYou lost?\u201d</p><p>I look up to find Eric standing in front of me, narrowing his eyes. His camo outfit truly blends in with the trees. The rest of the group is way ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you\u2019ve got ten girls to watch out for, okay? You can\u2019t take your eyes off them even for a second, or you could lose one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, hardly believing how intense this guy is.</p><p>He stalks off. I follow everyone down to the algae-spotted lake, where Matt is pushing canoes and kayaks into the water. Shirtless. His tan biceps and smooth chest just about make my heart stop.</p><p>\u201cOgle much?\u201d Andrea asks me.</p><p>My face goes hot. Matt looks up as he unties a canoe and pushes it into the water. He gives me a little wave.</p><p>Matt makes everybody put on a lifejacket and hands each of us an oar. Will and Parker share a canoe, and so do Andrea and Carlie, but the rest of us get our own kayaks.</p><p>Matt takes my hand, helping me step into my kayak, the rough callouses of his skin scraping against mine.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everybody,\u201d he yells, clapping once. \u201cThe rules of canoeing are simple. If you want to go right, then put the paddle in the water on your other right.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>Andrea drops her oar in the water and it starts floating off, so Matt leaps into the water and rescues the oar and returns it to her with a smile. I bet she dropped it on purpose, just so she could see him get all wet. I don\u2019t blame her.</p><p>I paddle around the lake slowly, drifting in various directions. Will\u2019s pointing into the water and Parker\u2019s peering down, smiling. Is it a turtle? A school of fish?</p><p>Eric circles the lake like it\u2019s his job to secure the perimeter from bears or something.</p><p>My kayak gets stuck on the side of the bank, and when I touch my oar to the bank, to push away from the land, a coiled brown and white snake catches my eye.</p><p>I scream.</p><p>I scream again. I thrust my paddle into the water and start paddling away as quickly as I can. Can the snake come in the water? I think they can swim.</p><p>Was it a copperhead? A rattlesnake? A water moccasin?</p><p>I look up from paddling to see Matt dive off the dock and swim my way. I stop thrusting my oar into the water and lean over onto my thighs, swallowing. Everyone is staring at me like I\u2019m a major moron, which I guess I am. But what if the snake had bitten me?</p><p>A minute later Matt surfaces next to me and shakes the water out of his hair. \u201cYou okay? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I chew my lip. \u201cI saw a snake.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dart around, probably to make sure the snake isn\u2019t about to retaliate because I ruined its nap. \u201cSnakes scare the bejesus out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never seen one before.\u201d My body is trembling.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re more scared of us than we are of them,\u201d he says, treading water, bobbing like a cork. \u201cBut they are still scary as hell.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m disappointed that he curses, but I keep my mouth closed. I\u2019m not messing up the good start with him.</p><p>He says, \u201cCan you get yourself back? Or do you want me to try to squeeze in and paddle for you?\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds at the idea of him squeezing into a kayak with me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not enough room in here,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he teases. He grabs my hand. I suck in a deep breath. \u201cYou sure you can make it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cTotally sure.\u201d I paste a smile on.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014I\u2019m gonna go rescue that runaway over there,\u201d he says, jerking his head toward an orphaned canoe nestled up against the banks. \u201cRace you back to the docks.\u201d</p><p>He takes off swimming in the opposite direction and I start paddling as hard as I can, smiling to myself about our race. He doesn\u2019t seem to be going all that fast. I hope he\u2019s not the type of guy who lets a girl win.</p><p>After a billion years of paddling, I beat him back to the docks. I shakily climb out of the kayak onto dry land and face an inquisition.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d Will asks, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cI had a run-in with a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA snake?\u201d Megan asks, playing with her whistle.</p><p>\u201cI doubt she saw a snake,\u201d Eric announces, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d I say, catching my breath. \u201cIt was a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a book you should read before campers arrive on Monday morning,\u201d Eric says, puffing his chest out. \u201cIt will tell you everything you need to know about dangerous animals in Tennessee.\u201d Eric looks pointedly at Megan.</p><p>She blushes. \u201cYes, you should read it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd please, no more screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you saw a snake?\u201d Eric asks, scanning the banks.</p><p>\u201cYes, I saw one,\u201d I say again, wringing my hand. \u201cMaybe you should read the chapter on snakes in your book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any snakes around this lake,\u201d Eric says. Is he pretending he didn\u2019t hear what I said?</p><p>\u201cI dunno if that\u2019s true,\u201d Matt says, leaping onto the docks from the canoe he just rescued. \u201cLast year I killed a copperhead that was swimming near here.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells as I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a picture of it on my phone!\u201d Andrea says, nodding quickly. \u201cHe smashed it with an oar!\u201d</p><p>Eric checks his ginormous watch that\u2019s the size of a compass. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly want to start studying everything I can about the outdoors so I can one-up him, like Matt just did.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of whether there are snakes in the lake,\u201d Megan says, \u201cyou can\u2019t react like that in front of children, Kate. It\u2019s unprofessional and it will scare the kids.\u201d</p><p>I look around at the other counselors and nod. Parker raises her eyebrows at me.</p><p>I turn to gaze across the lake at the deep green woods. When I was younger, I learned about how Henry David Thoreau went out into the wilderness and lived by himself at Walden Pond for a long time and wrote his magnum opus. I\u2019m not saying I want to go write a magnum opus or anything, but I\u2019d love to have a tiny cabin to myself in the mountains, where I could paint landscapes until my hand falls off and not be around people like Monkey Megan and Eric \u201cI refuse to play the animal introduction game\u201d and Alligator Andrea, who probably is an alligator disguised as a sorority girl.</p><p>Parker appears beside me and whispers, \u201cI would\u2019ve screamed if I saw a snake too. And I want to be a vet!\u201d</p><p>I slip my thumbs into my belt loops. \u201cI\u2019m, uh...can we talk about last night?\u201d</p><p>Megan blows her whistle and beckons for us to follow her back up the trail, and Parker walks off with Will without responding to me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you killed a poor snake!\u201d Parker snaps at Matt, passing by him.</p><p>\u201cIt was swimming near a group of eight-year-old campers who were canoeing. What was I supposed to do?\u201d Matt replies, drying his face with a towel. He waits for me to catch up. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never want to see a snake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d He jerks his head toward Parker. \u201cFor multiple reasons.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThanks for swimming out to save me.\u201d</p><p>He looks over at my face. \u201cYou saved me once too.\u201d</p><p>sketch #340</p><p>what happened seven years ago</p><p>At twilight, I rock back and forth on Cardinal\u2019s porch swing. I use a piece of charcoal to sketch, making sure to keep my hands away from my face and clothes, so black dust doesn\u2019t get everywhere.</p><p>I draw thirteen-year-old Matt with glasses and a bit of acne on his face.</p><p>I hate it when Christians don\u2019t act Christian-like. The boys in our group had been teasing him for writing music and lyrics.</p><p>\u201cOnly girls do shit like that,\u201d a boy had said to Matt, making him turn redder than a strawberry. He clutched the neck of his guitar, glancing at me. Most of the other kids looked away, but I held his stare and tried to show him he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I got the impression this wasn\u2019t the only time he\u2019d been bullied. He never smiled and hardly ever spoke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But now, as a guy about to be a junior in college, he seems sure of himself. He\u2019s grown into his skin.</p><p>I draw a picture of eleven-year-old me pulling Emily over to Matt.</p><p>\u201cCan we hear one of your songs?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He smiled and began to strum his guitar while watching my eyes.</p> <p>By Wednesday night, he\u2019d written a new one. Something about comparing a girl\u2019s beauty to that of a redbird.</p><p>\u201cVibrant, free, elegant, and lovely.\u201d \u263a</p><p>When he sang it for me, I kept my head down and buried my clasped hands between my thighs. The song ended, and he reached out a hand, grabbed my shoulder, and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>I never knew what he was thanking me for, but I said you\u2019re welcome and the next night he gave me my first kiss.</p> <p>This afternoon, when I asked how I saved him, he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I touch my lips, probably getting charcoal on them. How did I save him?</p><p>I use my red coloring pencil to fill in an outline of a redbird.</p><p>his snores are louder than a bulldozer</p><p>sunday, june 3 ~ week 1 of 7</p><p>\u201cThis is inhumane.\u201d</p> <p>Parker is upset about creek stomping.</p><p>Once a week, we\u2019ll take campers down to Cumberland Creek, where we\u2019ll wade around and catch crayfish. Some crayfish are the size of a quarter. Some are the size of a brick.</p><p>\u201cWe should just let the kids walk through the creek and splash around,\u201d Parker complains to Megan. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to remove poor animals from their little homes under rocks. From their families!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she always this opinionated?\u201d Megan asks Will.</p><p>He smiles and gives a little shrug. \u201cIt does seem kind of inhumane.\u201d</p><p>Parker loops her arm around Will\u2019s elbow and pecks his cheek. Megan watches them, not disapprovingly but longingly\u2014it\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s as jealous of their relationship as I am. Then she focuses on Eric. Still wearing his combat boots and camo pants, he\u2019s standing on the bank whittling a stick. The rest of us are in water shoes and shorts and bathing suits, in case we slip and fall in the chilly creek.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in, Eric?\u201d Megan asks.</p><p>He scrapes the stick with his knife. \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ve got this activity down pat.\u201d</p> <p>She nods slowly and after staring at him for a moment too long, she turns to face the rest of us. She blows her whistle, and I wince.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going,\u201d she says. \u201cPay attention to where the deep spots are, so you can point them out to campers. The most important thing to remember about this activity is that you should always have a first aid kit handy. Be careful not to slip and fall. Try picking up some crayfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them right behind the claws,\u201d Eric calls out from the banks. \u201cThat way they don\u2019t pinch you. The big ones could snap your finger off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Megan agrees.</p><p>Parker harrumphs behind me.</p><p>Will and Matt move ahead of the group, stopping to flip over stones in the water, to look under them.</p><p>\u201cEric is still pissed he didn\u2019t get the camp director position, huh?\u201d Andrea whispers to Carlie.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Megan is up for that big Bible education job at the regional conference,\u201d Carlie whispers back. \u201cMom told me that the conference is watching how well she runs camp before giving her the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seriously uptight this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a hard-on for Eric, that\u2019s why,\u201d Carlie says. \u201cShe needs to majorly get laid.\u201d</p><p>I accidentally stick my tongue out at the thought of that, and Parker laughs at the face I\u2019m making. I trudge through shin-high water to wade next to her.</p><p>\u201cIs this your first job?\u201d I whisper to her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She bends down to pick up a shell. \u201cI worked at Chuck E. Cheese last summer. It was baaaad.\u201d</p><p>I watch as she examines the shell, turning it over in her palm. \u201cThis is my first job,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be so much like high school. All over again. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad says gossip never goes away, no matter where you are in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say in a flat tone, making Parker smile. \u201cMy dad has never mentioned if gossip is bad at his work or not.\u201d He\u2019s a tax attorney, which is like the most boring kind of lawyer there is.</p><p>Parker carefully places the shell back down in the creek and wades off with Will, taking his hand in hers. It reminds me of the buddy system.</p><p>When I was little, we weren\u2019t supposed to go anywhere at camp without our buddy. Emily was always mine. We used to hold hands as we waded in the creek. We did cannonballs off the side of the pool together.</p><p>I never imagined that one day I would have no buddy beside me.</p><p>That\u2019s when Matt slows down to wade next to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, King Crab Kate,\u201d he croons, making me beam.</p><p>\u201cHi, Miniature Poodle Matt.\u201d</p><p>We angle off from the group, and at first the silence is scary and makes me want to chew all my fingernails off, but then I peek over at his face and see the calm smile there. I bend down to turn over a rock. I find three tiny crayfish the size of my thumb but let them scurry away. The bubbling water noises make my heart slow down.</p><p>I rise to my full height again, to find Matt waiting for me, and we keep trudging down the creek. The water is chilly but the air is hotter than a sauna.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this about you and a banana in the dining hall?\u201d I ask, even though part of me doesn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>He drags a hand through his hair, ruffling it. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in a frat?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. The guys were just messing around,\u201d he says, flushing.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t want friends who make me do questionable things with a banana, but I let it go because I don\u2019t want to embarrass him.</p><p>Parker told me that after her mom left, she needed friends more than anything. Did she hook up a lot because she was lonely? At the time, all I saw was that she fooled around with too many people, when now I know that she was hurting.</p><p>So maybe there are two sides to Matt wanting to be in a fraternity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about frats,\u201d I say. \u201cHow many guys are in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have ninety-seven members right now. We\u2019ll take on more in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of friends.\u201d</p><p>He nods and smiles. \u201cI know some of the guys better than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s up with the banana?\u201d I laugh softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for a lady\u2019s ears.\u201d</p><p>He bends down and moves a rock. He spots a crayfish and picks him up, looks him in the eye, and then puts him back down beside the rock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re majoring in literature?\u201d I ask Matt.</p><p>A smile appears on his face. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, really. I love everything from Dickens to John Grisham to John Green to Judy Blume.\u201d</p><p>Judy Blume? I\u2019ve smiled more this morning than I have in months. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Once and Future King, by T. H. White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of it. What\u2019s it about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cKing Arthur and how he pulled the sword from the stone and became the king of Camelot...What\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the Red Fern Grows. About the dogs and coon hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that book,\u201d I hear Parker muttering to Will. \u201cAll those poor raccoons got killed to make hats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that book,\u201d Matt says, grinning over at me. \u201cI think that\u2019s the first book I ever cried at. When the dog got into the fight with the mountain lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a real man unless you can admit you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d he says, laughing as he picks up a tree branch from the banks. He snaps a stick from it, then drops the branch in the water. The current carries it away. \u201cWhat other books do you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t read a lot,\u201d I admit. \u201cI\u2019m more into art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you carry around the little portfolio and pencils?\u201d</p><p>I peel a strand of hair away from my damp forehead and nod. \u201cDo you want to become a writer or something? Is that why you\u2019re majoring in literature?\u201d</p><p>He squats and dips his hand down beneath the surface, scooping up water. \u201cMaybe. I mean, I\u2019d like to do that eventually, you know, when I find the right idea for a story, but I think I\u2019ll probably become an English teacher in the meantime. Like my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have to wear shoes at school?\u201d</p><p>He splashes my shin. \u201cWhat are you going to major in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue,\u201d I say. \u201cDaddy thinks I should do the pre-law track, but I don\u2019t think it sounds all that exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cOne time I looked at an LSAT study guide, just to see what going to law school might be like, and I fell asleep. I drooled all over it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and two steps later, I slip and nearly wipe out. Matt grabs me, stopping me from crashing down into the water. He helps me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cIs your knee okay?\u201d He peers down at my scar.</p><p>I\u2019m grasping his elbows. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The creek forks and splits to the right, but we keep walking straight.</p><p>Andrea wades past us, peering over at me.</p><p>Having never stepped a foot in the creek, Eric is waiting for us at the other end. My water shoes make squishy noises when I step out onto the grass.</p><p>\u201cDid you catch any crawdaddies?\u201d Eric asks me.</p><p>I shake my head, glancing at Parker. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt them.\u201d</p><p>She finds my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t even try, how will you teach campers how to do it?\u201d Megan asks me, clucking her tongue. I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t blown her whistle in my face and asked if I can do anything right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why campers have to do it at all,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Matt says, adjusting his bandana. \u201cThey could just enjoy nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreek stomping is a rite of passage at Cumberland Creek Camp!\u201d Megan\u2019s face looks like it might explode.</p><p>I watch Brad as he mouths \u201crite of passage\u201d with his jaw draped open.</p><p>To fill the silence (I guess), Eric announces to the group, \u201cSome campers might want to save their crayfish for the Critter Crawl, but they aren\u2019t usually good contenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the Critter Crawl?\u201d Parker asks.</p><p>\u201cEvery week we\u2019ll have a contest where each group finds an animal to compete in a race,\u201d Eric replies. \u201cLike granddaddy longlegs and beetles and worms. We put the animals in a ring and whichever one escapes the ring first wins.\u201d</p><p>Parker sets her hands on her waist. \u201cI am so calling PETA.\u201d</p><p>I had forgotten all about hobo packs.</p><p>I loved them when I was a little girl. It\u2019s Sunday evening, the day before camp is to start, and we\u2019re preparing to cook over the campfire.</p><p>\u201cIt should taste like beef stew if you make it right,\u201d Megan tells us. \u201cEveryone watch how Carlie does it. Her hobo packs are always delicious!\u201d Megan has a bright smile on her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When her back is turned, Carlie sticks a finger in her mouth, fake-gagging herself. \u201cI wish she\u2019d stop sucking up to me.

First we each rip off a long strip of aluminum foil. I take pieces of beef and spread them across my foil, then pile mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, and green beans on top. Add salt and pepper to taste. Wrap it up like a burrito and place it right in the fire, on top of the logs.</p><p>And of course mine immediately starts falling apart. The foil splits open. The veggies and beef fall onto the wood. I groan loudly. I spent twenty minutes preparing that!</p><p>\u201cTry wrapping it tighter,\u201d Megan tells me, clucking her tongue.</p><p>\u201cLike a burrito,\u201d Eric interrupts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll start over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be able to show campers how to do this right,\u201d Eric says, pushing the skewer into me even deeper.</p><p>\u201cLike a burrito,\u201d Megan repeats.</p><p>\u201cLike at Just Tacos!\u201d Matt calls over his shoulder to me. He\u2019s already feasting over at the picnic table.</p><p>I snort. \u201cDid they have hobo packs at Just Tacos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. They had everything in the world there,\u201d Matt replies. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just tacos!\u201d</p><p>Ian and Brad just pulled their hobo packs out of the fire and are moving back to the picnic tables. Carlie turns hers over, using tongs. The fire crackles and hisses as she nestles her pack back down in the embers.</p> <p>I go back over to my cutting board and start slicing beef, carrots, and potatoes all over again, to make a new pack. I\u2019m not even hungry, but if I just say to heck with it, Megan will probably get angry with me, and I\u2019m sick of that blasted whistle.</p><p>At the table beside mine, Andrea and Matt are whispering as they eat.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she says, pushing a chunk of beef around with a plastic fork. \u201cLet\u2019s do something during free time tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna work on this new dodgeball court thing I want to build,\u201d he replies, popping a cooked carrot into his mouth. \u201cDo you want to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping we could take a hike or go down to the lake. Alone? Together?\u201d</p><p>He goes quiet for several seconds. \u201cI really want to get started on my dodgeball idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I want to ask him about his dodgeball court idea, but I stay silent, so that maybe Andrea will forget I exist.</p> <p>I mix all of my hobo pack materials, taking more care this time, and then wrap up my aluminum foil as tightly as I can. The last thing I want is for my hobo pack to disintegrate twice in one night.</p><p>Can a person get banned from camping?</p><p>This time my hobo pack stays in one piece as it cooks, and Will fishes it out for me with tongs. He drops it onto my tin plate. Careful not to burn my fingers, I rip the aluminum open and the smell of beef stew wafts up to my nose. Okay, so I was hungry.</p><p>Matt, Ian, Brad, and Will finish up their food and decide to go play a game of two-on-two up at the basketball court. I pick at my dinner and eavesdrop on Andrea and Carlie.</p><p>\u201cGive it time. If you really like him\u2014\u201d Carlie says.</p><p>\u201cI do really like him.\u201d Andrea\u2019s voice is hard.</p><p>\u201cThen you can wait for him to work stuff out,\u201d Carlie whispers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting even more distant.\u201d Andrea shuts her eyes and sucks on her bottom lip. \u201cI wish I\u2019d get the sign this year. I wish God would show me how I\u2019m supposed to work things out with him. I wish I\u2019d never fallen for him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help how you feel. He needed somebody, and you were a good friend to him,\u201d Carlie says quietly, putting an arm around Andrea. \u201cYou\u2019re a great person.\u201d</p><p>Carlie looks up at that moment and catches me staring. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your business,\u201d she says.</p><p>My face heats up. I wad my aluminum foil into a ball and throw it in the garbage bin, then stand and just walk. I have no idea where I\u2019m going. I could go get my knee brace that\u2019s made of more steel than a skyscraper and see if I can do some jogging in it, to try to get used to it. Maybe if I go out and roam the trails, God will give me the sign. Sorry to act selfish, but I feel like I need the sign more than Andrea does.</p><p>I pass by Parker, who\u2019s telling Eric (Camper Extraordinaire), that the Critter Crawl is \u201can unbelievable act of cruelty and must be called off immediately.\u201d</p><p>I shove my hands in the pockets of my jean shorts and make my way up the trail. If Emily were here, I bet we would\u2019ve died laughing when my hobo pack fell apart in the fire. Then she would\u2019ve shared hers with me.</p><p>The sunset looks like a rainbow. Stars are beginning to peek through the colors. I pass by the basketball court, where the guys are playing shirts versus skins. Will and Matt are on skins and Brad and Ian are shirts. Matt takes a jump shot and makes it\u2014nothing but net. When his bare feet hit the ground, he looks up. He drags a hand through his shaggy blond hair, then waves at me.</p><p>I wave back.</p><p>Will playfully shoves Matt\u2019s shoulder, and Matt grins, continuing to look my way.</p><p>I smile at him and keep walking toward Cardinal.</p><p>What was Andrea talking about? What can\u2019t Matt get past?</p><p>How did I save him?</p><p>Past midnight, someone knocks on the screen door of Cardinal.</p><p>I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m sweaty. It\u2019s been a rough two days of learning how bad I am at everything outdoorsy, like fishing off the docks. Only I could manage to knock an entire can of bait into the lake.</p><p>Only seven weeks of camp to go.</p><p>My bed screeches as I roll over and peer up to find Matt standing outside. The moon casts a glow around his body. I swing myself out of bed and go open the screen door for him. He\u2019s wearing a pair of light blue scrubs as pajama pants, and no shirt. I already saw him shirtless playing basketball and swimming at the lake, but still, my stomach flips and flops.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, checking out my XXXXXL T-shirt. Note to self: wear cuter pajamas in case boys drop by randomly after midnight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you sleeping in here all by yourself.\u201d He stifles a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say, my shoulders tensing. \u201cI can\u2019t let you sleep in here with me.\u201d</p><p>He waves a hand. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep out on the porch.\u201d He steps past and begins dragging a bed through the door. The metal frame creaks and groans.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d I say. My heartbeat races and races.</p><p>He drops the bed with a clang on the porch and stretches his sleeping bag out on the thin mattress. \u201cWhat if the bogeyman is out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bogeyman?\u201d I laugh. \u201cA myth.\u201d</p><p>Matt fluffs his pillow. \u201cHow about that dude with a hook for a hand?\u201d He drops the pillow and makes a claw with his fingers and growls.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re the bogeyman?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019d already have captured you if I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you get eaten up by mosquitoes? Or a black widow spider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d His mouth stretches into another yawn.</p><p>\u201cThanks for sleeping out here.\u201d</p><p>He nods and yawns again. \u201cI\u2019m about to pass out.\u201d</p><p>Where has he been all night? Has he been hanging out with Andrea up until now? I play with the hem of my long T-shirt. \u201cSee you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already is tomorrow,\u201d he groans, flopping down on the bed. It screeches and wobbles.</p><p>I go curl up in my sheets.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, Kate,\u201d he calls out.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later I hear him snoring up a storm on the porch and it makes me laugh. Didn\u2019t he say that Will is the bad snorer? Matt sounds like a bulldozer. I bring two fingers to my lips, laughing, and smile myself to sleep.</p><p>sketch #346</p><p>what happened last night</p><p>Before campers start arriving at 9:00 a.m., I walk up to the cafeteria. The entire area is hilly and mountainous, but the building rests at the highest spot of the camp. From here, you can see everything. I sit Indian style on a bench, where I can stare at the valley full of cedar trees. I can smell their sappy smell.</p><p>I pull my pencil from behind my ear and open my sketchpad to a blank page. Chewing on the eraser, I think about last night. How Matt slept outside Cardinal. It was the first time in a long time I didn\u2019t feel alone.</p><p>I begin with the bed and mattress that he pulled through the door onto the porch, sketching the legs and beams that support the steel. I make thick lines across the mattress, to denote the blue stripes. After taking a quick glance around me to make sure I\u2019m alone, I outline what Matt\u2019s body looks like without a shirt, showing him wearing only blue hospital scrub pants. I pay careful attention to his muscles. Not because I\u2019m being a pervert or anything, but because the human body is the hardest thing to draw. It requires precision and patience and a steady hand.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear footsteps. I snap the book closed against my chest. I look up to see Will, Brad, and Matt running together. Will and Brad are huffing and puffing, trying to keep up with Matt the marathoner.</p><p>I lift my hand to wave. All three wave back, which makes my heart swell.</p><p>\u201cCome run with us,\u201d Matt calls out to me. \u201cGet that knee in shape.\u201d</p><p>Can my knee handle running again? I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m willing to take the risk to spend time with Matt. \u201cOkay! Meet me at my cabin in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He disappears down the dirt steps, heading toward the art pavilion. I walk as quickly as I can back to Cardinal and throw on a sports bra, shorts, a tank top, and sneakers. Carefully, I put on my steel knee brace that makes me sound like a walking industrial paper slicer. I step out onto the porch, where Matt is waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Brad and Will?\u201d I ask, tightening my black ponytail.</p><p>\u201cThey gave up already.\u201d Matt stretches out a hand to me and I take it. \u201cYou got this.\u201d</p><p>We walk, my hand lightly tucked inside his. I don\u2019t think I can handle running on trails full of hazards like rocks, sticks, and tree roots, so we go to the big field.</p><p>\u201cNice and slow,\u201d Matt says, and I lurch into a jog, keeping my breath steady. Thanks to my exercise bike, I\u2019ve saved some of my endurance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still got your form,\u201d he says, looking me up and down while running. I hope he\u2019s seeing me as I want to be seen: black hair flowing in the wind, smiling, moving swiftly and gracefully.</p><p>We run five laps around the big field, hardly speaking a word. When I look over at his face, I find his mouth shut in a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing this morning? In the notebook?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDrawing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see your work sometime.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t share my sketchpad with anybody. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say softly, not meaning it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He must sense this. \u201cIt\u2019s okay...I don\u2019t share most of my lyrics and writing with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be like letting someone inside me.\u201d I immediately regret my choice of words and feel my face go hotter than the sun.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he replies, glancing away.</p><p>After the run and a shower, my sketchpad catches my eye.

By the end of summer, freckles will have won the battle against my skin.</p><p>Megan checks campers\u2019 names off on a clipboard and sorts them into groups. Since I\u2019m at Cardinal this week, I\u2019m waving a red flag. Several girls head my way, carrying satchels and sleeping bags. Campers range between eight and twelve, but this week I have a group of ten older girls. All twelve-year-olds.</p><p>Some of them are chatting a mile a minute and others look nervous, like they are about to sing a solo during the school musical.</p><p>I swallow the frog in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m Kate,\u201d I tell them, and I begin passing out nametags. The nametags haven\u2019t changed since I was little: they are circular wood chips, and campers write their names in permanent marker right on the wood. Then we string colorful plastic cords through the holes in the chips, so the nametags can hang around necks.</p><p>I glance over at Parker. She\u2019s sitting with two adorable younger girls, both of whom are playing with her plaited hair.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s the King!\u201d a boy says, rushing toward Matt.</p> <p>\u201cThe King?\u201d I mouth at him, and he grins and shrugs. He shakes hands and gives high fives to his fan club. Like, twenty boys have gathered around him to talk.</p><p>\u201cMatt is sooo cute,\u201d a girl named Sophie says. She used purple marker to write her name on the wood chip. She also took the opportunity to draw big purple hearts on the backs of her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they call him the King?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She slings her satchel over her shoulder. \u201cI dunno. He\u2019s just the King.\u201d</p><p>Ian appears next to me and whispers, \u201cLast year, kids started calling me the Princess. It was humiliating.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing.</p><p>Brad and I lead our group back to the Cardinal cabins. The boys are checking out the girls and the girls are checking out the boys.</p><p>Brad rolls his eyes and whispers, \u201cI prefer working with the younger kids. Puberty scares me.\u201d</p> <p>I smile and climb the porch to Cardinal and open the screen door so my campers can file in. Much squealing and screaming ensues.</p><p>The girls all fight over who gets the top bunks and start unpacking clothes and draping them all over the place. Claire, a quiet, tall girl with big, open eyes, stacks a pile of books next to her bed, then begins applying lip gloss. She and Sophie appear to be best friends, but while Sophie is loud and authoritative, Claire hangs back. They remind me of Emily and myself.</p><p>Brad and I go over rules with our group and play the introduction game. Brad is Bison Brad and I decide on Koala Kate this time.</p><p>At lunch, the campers form a long line in the cafeteria, where a humongous wall fan blows warm air throughout the room. It should be really hot in here, but somehow it\u2019s comforting. The counselors form a cluster behind all the campers and start gossiping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that little hellion, Cara Dawson, again,\u201d Andrea complains to Matt. \u201cLast year she got up, like, ten times a night to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaj is in my group,\u201d Matt boasts. \u201cAnd he\u2019s gonna teach me to play \u2018Stairway to Heaven\u2019 on guitar tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say. \u201cA kid is gonna teach you guitar?\u201d</p><p>Matt plays with the cross hanging around his neck and scratches one of his feet with the other. I still haven\u2019t seen him in a pair of shoes yet. \u201cYou should hear this kid play. He\u2019s gonna be performing at the Grand Ole Opry one day.\u201d</p><p>Andrea ignores me and focuses on Matt. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear Taj play again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you and Taj could be in the talent show together,\u201d I suggest to Matt.</p><p>He points at me. \u201cGood idea. That\u2019s the only chance I\u2019d have of winning.\u201d He puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles. \u201cTaj, wanna be in the talent show with me?\u201d</p><p>Taj adjusts his ball cap. It\u2019s turned around backward. \u201cYou owe me, King!\u201d</p><p>Matt clicks his tongue and points at the kid, and I laugh. I pull the talent show sign-up list and a pen out of my back pocket and write their names down. In addition to being the arts and crafts director, I\u2019m in charge of arranging the weekly talent show.</p><p>A boy with a tray of food passes by us. \u201cYum, we\u2019re having chicken o\u2019 rings,\u201d I say, peering at the ringed nuggets. \u201cI remember those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a hot commodity,\u201d Matt says, moving to stand next to me. So close, I can smell him: a mixture of soap and sweat. It\u2019s nice. Andrea gets edged out and is now standing behind us. I don\u2019t want to look at her face \u2019cause I\u2019m sure she looks like the Hulk when he\u2019s angry.</p><p>He goes on, \u201cI was gonna see if you\u2019d trade me your green beans for my chicken o\u2019 rings.\u201d</p><p>My stomach grumbles. \u201cI remember loving those too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I want both.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me sideways. We take a step forward in line. \u201cDo you use honey mustard or barbeque sauce?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I reply. \u201cI never can decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I usually throw ketchup in there too for a little excitement.\u201d He elbows me. \u201cWatch this.\u201d Matt lifts his hands above his head, forms an O with his arms, and yells, \u201cOOOOOOOOOOOO-OOOOOOOOOOOO-OOOOOOHHHHHH-HHHHHHHHHHH.\u201d</p><p>The campers join in, and Matt mutters to me out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me hanging here. Would you bow to the almighty o\u2019 rings already?\u201d</p><p>I start laughing and lift my arms over my head and scream along.</p><p>It feels good.</p><p>At the pool after lunch, Brad doesn\u2019t take off his T-shirt when we\u2019re in the water. Some people who aren\u2019t comfortable with their bodies wear a shirt over their bathing suits, but I can see Brad\u2019s six-pack through the thin cotton.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I whisper to him, nodding at the bruises on his arm.</p><p>\u201cDrop it, okay? Please?\u201d His eyes plead with me. He glances around. What happened to him? He seems like a very normal guy. He takes his job seriously and everyone likes him. Did he get into something bad? Does Megan know? Should I tell someone? Am I the only one who notices he\u2019s wearing a shirt in the pool?</p><p>I skim the top of the water with my hand. The regional conference wouldn\u2019t hire someone questionable. I decide to drop it, like Brad wants me to.</p><p>I peer up at Matt sitting in the lifeguard stand. He salutes me and smiles, and his eyes go back to scanning the pool.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to college?\u201d I ask Brad.</p><p>He scoops water up with his hands and wets his face. \u201cNot sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just graduate from high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A boy from our group suddenly does a cannonball, making a huge splash, drenching me and Brad. When the boy comes up for air, Brad playfully dunks him under the water. The boy jumps on Brad\u2019s back, trying to dunk him back, but Brad doesn\u2019t budge except to pluck the kid off his back and toss him into the water as if he were weightless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this fall?\u201d I ask Brad, wiping water off my face.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cIf I manage to save enough money this summer, I\u2019ll take a road trip across the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that!\u201d I smile, skimming the surface of the pool with my fingertips. \u201cI\u2019d love to drive the entire California coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to see the Grand Canyon...and Yosemite. I maybe want to become a park ranger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo working here is sort of like training to become a ranger?\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cI\u2019d much rather deal with snakes and bears than kids going through puberty. Seems easier.\u201d</p><p>We laugh together.</p><p>Brad seems like a really good guy. A normal guy. So what\u2019s going on with him?</p><p>Before dinner, while the kids are forming a rowdy line, Megan pulls me aside. We sit together on a boulder outside the cafeteria. \u201cHow\u2019s your first day going?\u201d she asks with a smile.</p><p>\u201cGood so far,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI really liked the candles you made in arts and crafts this morning. The campers\u2019 parents are going to love them. I took some pictures to send to the regional conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep up the good work.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself, happy that everything feels a bit lighter today. Keeping busy keeps the bad thoughts at bay.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, when we\u2019re walking back from kayaking at the lake, a kid from our group, Marcus, falls and cuts his leg open on a sharp stick. He bites into his lip as blood gushes out, coating the blond hairs on his shin. The cut looks totally tetanus-shot worthy.</p><p>Brad picks the boy up and throws him over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll patch him up. Can you get the fire and burgers started?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>I swallow and nod, not sure if I\u2019d rather deal with burgers or blood. They both sound equally terrible. I lead the group of nineteen kids back to Cardinal by myself. While the campers change out of their bathing suits, I begin taking the spatula and frying pans out of the milk crates, and glance at the fire pit. Glance at the fire pit some more. I pick up sticks for kindling, narrowly avoiding a patch of poison ivy. Poison oak? Which is it?</p><p>I drop the wood in front of the pit. Set my hands on my hips. The sun is setting lower and lower, and I only have about an hour to get this fire started, cook the food, and get my campers to Great Oak before the talent show starts. Not to mention I have to set up for the talent show too.</p><p>I kneel in front of the pit, matches in hand, and arrange the logs and kindling the way Matt showed me on Saturday morning. Glancing to make sure no one\u2019s watching, I smash some paper towels up under the logs and light them.</p><p>Fire whips through the paper towels. I smile. But then the flame goes out and I have to start over. This happens three more times. I have no idea what to do. Where\u2019s Brad? Was Marcus\u2019s cut that bad? What if Brad doesn\u2019t come back in time for dinner?</p><p>Two boys from our group, Rick and Michael, walk out of Cardinal cabin and head my way, and then I see Sophie and Claire too. The four of them start talking about the sign. Sophie says that she heard that God spoke to a boy through a campfire last year.</p><p>Is God trying to tell me something here? Is that why the fire won\u2019t start? I doubt it. I just stink at all things camping.</p><p>\u201cIs it time for dinner yet?\u201d Rick asks me.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Matt is two cabins away at Bluebird. About a minute walk. I wring my fingers together and follow the path up to his cookout pit, where a fire is roaring. The kids are already eating burgers and sipping lemonade, and he\u2019s lounging in a lawn chair, plucking away at his guitar strings, playing classical music for them as if these woods are a cafe. He\u2019s like the epitome of the perfect counselor, and I can\u2019t even start a fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sees me, sets his guitar against the picnic table bench, and hops to his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good on guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He loops his thumb around the leather cord hanging from his neck.</p><p>\u201cDid you write that? I mean, the song you were just playing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I nod and set my hands on my hips. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved your music.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and scratches the side of his neck. \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop by?\u201d</p><p>I mumble, \u201cOne of our campers got hurt and Brad went to get him first aid...I can\u2019t get my fire started.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows, then turns and starts pawing through a milk crate toppling with supplies. He pulls out a starter log the size of a Kit Kat bar, a roll of paper towels, a book of matches, and a can of Crisco.</p> <p>\u201cThis oughta do it,\u201d he says, dumping the items into my arms.</p><p>\u201cMatt! I found a toad,\u201d a tiny girl says, and he rushes to squat down next to her. They peer into the bushes. It\u2019s really cute.</p><p>I turn around and trudge back to my campsite, where I tuck the starter log inside a bunch of kindling and hold a lit match up to it. I stuff a wad of paper towels next to the burning starter log. The paper towels quickly turn to hot ash, so I drip Crisco onto the wood and a fireball bursts up.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, cool!\u201d a camper named David says, and the boys rush to surround me.</p><p>\u201cGrab more skinny sticks,\u201d I tell them, and soon we have a blazing fire, and then we\u2019re saying grace before eating cheeseburgers hot off the grill. When Brad returns, carrying a heavily-bandaged Marcus over his shoulder, he smiles at my work and says, \u201cNice job.\u201d</p><p>I decide I like being part of Matt\u2019s Crisco cult.</p> <p>A couple minutes later Matt appears at our campsite and salutes Brad. \u201cYo, Bumblebee Brad. How\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Brad winces and looks up from trying to get the knot out of a sparkly pink sneaker.</p><p>\u201cBumblebee Brad! Bumblebee Brad!\u201d Rick and Sophie start yelling, laughing their butts off.</p><p>I cover my grin with a fist. Matt grabs one of the burgers I just cooked and slips it inside a bun. \u201cOw,\u201d he says, sticking his thumb in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe burgers are hot, you know,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta pay for that.\u201d</p><p>He bites into it and chews. \u201cMmmm.\u201d He chews some more and swallows. \u201cThat\u2019s a good burger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, proud. \u201cBut you still owe me for it.\u201d I rub my fingers together, indicating I want cash, and he grins.</p><p>\u201cAs payment, later, I\u2019ll play you a song I wrote, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say with a smile, remembering the girl whose beauty he compared to a redbird. I wipe my hair away from my sweaty face. \u201cI need to go get ready for the talent show.\u201d I have to put out the microphones and speakers and make sure the popcorn is popped.</p><p>By the time I finish frantically running around trying to find the mike (it was under a chair in Megan\u2019s office) and then determining how to plug the mike into the amp, the sun has completely set. The campers take their seats on the grass in front of the Great Oak porch (the stage). Blazing tiki torches and laughter surround me as I step up to the mike and say, \u201cWelcome to the thirty-second annual Cumberland Creek talent show!\u201d</p><p>Everyone cheers, and I\u2019m smiling because I got the fire going. I managed to cook dinner by myself. I say a quick thanks to God.</p><p>I introduce the first act: a girl named Taylor, who\u2019s doing a mime performance. Another girl sings songs while doing interpretative dance, and a boy juggles three bowling pins he found in a closet in the art pavilion.</p><p>I laugh so hard when Ian sings Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect\u201d along with two of his boy campers. They use brooms as microphones and when Ian hits the really high notes, he falls to his knees and clenches his eyes shut. Ian\u2019s not a very good singer. At all. But he still gets a standing ovation.</p><p>When he hops off the Great Oak porch, I say, \u201cAnd you want to get a camp karaoke machine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait until next week.\u201d He winks. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do some Mariah Carey.\u201d</p><p>But the funniest thing\u2014the sweetest thing, is that Matt plays guitar, accompanying six different singers on six different songs. My favorite is when an eight-year-old girl named Lizzie sings \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d in the purest voice, and when she gets scared and I think she might run off the stage, Matt sings along with her as he strums his guitar.</p><p>Leaning against a tree, as bugs chirp around me, as warm wind rustles the branches, that\u2019s when I know it for real.</p><p>I want him.</p><p>bonzo ball</p><p>wednesday, june 6 ~ week 1 of 7</p><p>Before my arts and crafts lesson, Megan calls me into Great Oak for a \u201ccounseling session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you had problems getting your fire started?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the talent show nearly didn\u2019t start on time because of it.\u201d She taps her whistle on her desk, eyeing me.</p><p>How did she find out about my fire problems? Did Matt tell her what happened?</p><p>\u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve ever had to start a fire without help before.\u201d I clear my throat into my fist. \u201cBut I got it going. All the kids enjoyed dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard. I heard they ate nearly forty-five minutes later than scheduled and were starving.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I ought to tell her most of the kids were either:</p><p> 1. reading in the cabins;</p><p> 2. having a water fight;</p><p> 3. talking about members of the opposite sex;</p><p> 4. flirting with members of the opposite sex; or</p><p> 5. searching for critters for the Critter Crawl, which Parker is still trying to get banned.</p><p>Only a couple of the boys complained and, well, boys are always hungry.</p><p>\u201cI will try my hardest not to let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric has offered to coach you, so next week you\u2019ll be co-counselors with him. Parents pay a lot of money for their children to come here, and we have to give them an excellent week, or the regional conference will blame me, understand?\u201d</p><p>She wants that Bible education job bad.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She taps her whistle on the desk some more. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>I swivel around to face her again. \u201cHow did you hear about what happened?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cI heard from Andrea. I believe Matt told her.\u201d</p><p>I nod and leave the cabin, holding my nose so it doesn\u2019t start running, because I want to cry.</p><p>Matt told Andrea about my cooking issue? The backs of my eyes burn as I head toward the art pavilion.</p><p>How humiliating. I get where Megan\u2019s coming from, but she said it herself: the conference hired me for my artistic skills, not for my camping abilities. How could she expect me to be Camp Counselor Extraordinaire after three days?</p><p>I got the fire started! The kids scarfed their burgers and lemonade down like warriors after an epic battle. They loved it!</p><p>I can\u2019t believe Matt blabbed to Andrea.</p><p>My eyes are still burning as I step into the pavilion, where thirty campers are waiting for me. Using the most cheerful voice I can muster, I explain that we\u2019ll be doing decoupage today. Decoupage is where you use clear paste to glue bits of paper to any ole piece of junk, to decorate it. You can use crepe paper or construction paper. Newspaper and magazines work great too. I have piles and piles of junk and magazines.</p><p>\u201cDecoupage is a chance to show who you are as a person,\u201d I explain to the campers. I hold up an old glass Coke bottle covered with pictures of footballs from sports clippings. \u201cWhat do you think the person who made this likes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSports!\u201d a boy calls.</p><p>\u201cCoke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootball!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Titans!\u201d</p><p>When the kids have stopped yelling their thoughts, I muse, \u201cThey might be very patriotic.\u201d I turn the bottle from side to side so everyone can see it. \u201cCoke and football are totally American, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d a bunch of laughing kids yell.</p><p>I hold up the music box I made and lift the lid. The campers go silent. It took me a while to repair the speakers, but now it plays \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d and the little ballerina slowly spins in wobbly circles. I covered the wood in pictures of white flowers cut from various newspapers and magazines.</p><p>When the music stops, I say, \u201cWhat do you think the owner of this music box likes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGardens,\u201d Claire says.</p><p>\u201cThe outdoors?\u201d replies a boy.</p><p>\u201cMusic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife,\u201d says Sophie. \u201cBeing alive.\u201d</p><p>I give her a small smile. \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d is one of Emily\u2019s favorite pieces. And the ballerina reminds me of being little. Some white flowers symbolize innocence, but white lilies mean death. To me, the music box is a symbol of the day I went against my beliefs and helped a friend, going against God.</p><p>\u201cIs it about beauty?\u201d Claire asks. \u201cThe person who made the box loves beautiful things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s great about decoupage,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can make something that says something on the outside, but maybe only you understand what it really means inside. To you, you know?\u201d</p><p>I look up from the music box I decorated to find Parker standing in the doorway.</p><p>I set the box down and clap my hands a few times. \u201cOkay, everybody, start looking for an object that most defines you!\u201d</p><p>The kids scramble away from the picnic tables to dig through my boxes and crates of junk I hauled here in my trunk.</p><p>With a smile on her face, Parker navigates past the kids, seeing what they pick out. Holding my nose again, so I don\u2019t cry, I watch her make her way across the pavilion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my break.\u201d She picks up the music box I made using decoupage. \u201cThis is incredible,\u201d she says, turning it over in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can get you started on making something,\u201d I tell her, slipping my paint brush behind my ear. I lead her over to my milk crates full of junk just begging for a makeover. I love going to yard sales and finding piggy banks and cracked bottles and dusty vases and even scratched records. I love painting new life into them. Part of me wants to tell her this, but it also feels too personal.</p><p>This week had started out great, and now I\u2019m back to where I was. Can I trust anybody here? Yes, this is a job, and yes, it\u2019s important, but did Matt have to sell me down the river?</p><p>I shut my eyes for a sec, praying to God, and then focus on Parker, remembering how she called me judgmental and nasty on Friday night. Then I remember how I thought about college and how I need to figure out my life so I don\u2019t stay lonely. But if I open myself up to new people, like I have with Matt, and then they go and betray me, is it worth knowing people at all?</p><p>Will told me that everyone left Parker, and now she\u2019s standing right here in front of me.</p><p>\u201cPick something out,\u201d I tell Parker, and she sorts through the junk until she finds a tiny wooden box.</p><p>\u201cI could put earrings in here,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I hand her a pair of scissors and sit her down near the toppling stack of magazines with the kids. \u201cCut out anything that you think looks cool and then we\u2019ll decoupage them to the box.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDecoupage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a clear glue.\u201d</p><p>Parker licks her lower lip as she clips pictures: roses, dogs, kittens, lips, a softball glove. She cuts out words: him, me, run, fly, you, touch, kiss.</p><p>When she\u2019s done I show her how to layer the words and pictures on top of each other, and then use patches of cloth and velvet to give the box some texture. I test out kiss next to him and me. Kiss him seems more interesting.</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea you were so artistic,\u201d she says, watching me arrange her words.</p><p>I use my fancy scissors that cut shapes to make a red felt heart. \u201cThanks.\u201d I still haven\u2019t gotten over what she said on Friday. But I\u2019m going to try. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I upset you the other night,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cUm, what I wanted to say came out wrong. I worry about people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried that we\u2019d all have sex and get pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I touch my throat. \u201cOne thing generally leads to another.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head, thinking. \u201cYeah, sometimes...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry I said what I said, but I could\u2019ve explained what I meant better. And I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you before, you know, um, when your mom left.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes meet mine. She plays with a long strand of her messy hair.</p><p>That\u2019s when Megan appears in the art pavilion and lightly toots her whistle. \u201cWhat are you doing, Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing Parker how to do decoupage.\u201d I wipe my hands on a dishtowel.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working with the campers, not another counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m available if anyone needs help\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working with the campers?\u201d she repeats, making my face flush. A few campers notice me getting reprimanded and look from me to Megan and back to me again. Nothing like your boss embarrassing you in front of everybody, eh?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quietly, and move to observe Claire and Sophie decorating vases, but I feel like I\u2019m in their way. That\u2019s the thing about art. You can\u2019t force it. You can\u2019t tell someone else how to do it. You can let them watch you, you can show them examples\u2014like I just did for Parker\u2014but you can\u2019t do it for them, or it\u2019s not their art.</p><p>Art can\u2019t be shared in that way.</p><p>I spend the rest of the art session moving around and watching the campers, feeling like a nagging cough that won\u2019t go away. Parker finishes her little jewelry box, and looking pleased, she sets it to dry on the picnic table in the sun.</p><p>\u201cThanks for helping me,\u201d she says.</p><p>I nod slowly and start collecting paint brushes so I can wash them in the rusty sink.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get you in trouble,\u201d she adds.</p><p>I lift a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I should\u2019ve been working with the campers.\u201d</p> <p>Parker scrunches her eyebrows. \u201cMegan\u2019s not very understanding sometimes if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like, everything has to go exactly her way. She\u2019s like a crazy OCD perfectionist or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that redundant?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIn her case it fits,\u201d Parker says with a laugh. \u201cShe lectured Will \u2019cause she didn\u2019t like the consistency of the homemade ice cream the other night. And she yelled at me after I refused to participate in the Critter Crawl.\u201d</p><p>It makes me glad she\u2019s not specifically targeting me.</p><p>Parker goes on, \u201cEverything has to be perfect or Megan loses it. Carlie\u2019s right. Megan is doing everything she can to make sure she gets that job. Either that or she wants to impress Eric baaaaad.\u201d She makes a kissy face and kissy noises.</p><p>I start to smile along but then I wonder if I would be just as bad as Megan if I was in her position. Would I go out of my way to make sure that everyone does their job exactly right and follows all rules no matter what?</p><p>Following Parker\u2019s lead, I decide to take an afternoon break while most of the campers are doing field events with Brad and Andrea.</p><p>I hope someone knocks Andrea down during the three-legged race or hits her in the head with a whiffle ball or something. I clench my eyes shut, mad at myself for being so mean.</p><p>I carry my sketchbook up and down the trails, wishing I could calm down enough to draw, but it\u2019s not working.</p><p>Breathing in and out, I storm up the path into the clearing where the basketball court is and find Matt squatting on the asphalt beside a pile of wood planks.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d he calls out, waving a drill.</p><p>I ignore him and decide to go back to Cardinal for my break. There, at least, I can sit beside the box fan and cool down a bit. I secure my sketchpad under my arm and stride off.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d I hear him yelling.</p><p>Ignore, ignore, ignore, like the times Paul Markwald would taunt me at school, calling me the Jesus Freakazoid. You\u2019d think the one place I\u2019d fit in is a Christian camp. It\u2019s like, the older people get, the more they change.</p><p>I feel a tug at my elbow and stop walking. Matt turns me to face him.</p><p>\u201cWant to help with my Bonzo Ball court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonzo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game I invented.\u201d He points over his shoulder with his drill. \u201cWanna check it out?\u201d</p><p>I gaze at the planks of wood. I catch his eye for a sec, then shake my head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>His forehead crinkles. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>My eyes start to burn again. \u201cThis job is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>He nods quickly. \u201cIt is, but you\u2019re getting the hang of it pretty fast. You\u2019re smart.\u201d</p><p>Is he lying? I narrow my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks quietly, sliding a hand onto my shoulder. It feels warm.</p><p>\u201cMegan got upset with me for taking too long to feed the kids last night. \u2019Cause I had problems starting my fire...\u201d His face doesn\u2019t change from concerned to guilty, like I expected it to. He just looks concerned. \u201cWhy did you tell Andrea about it?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He lifts a shoulder. \u201cBecause I was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou impressed me last night. You got your fire started and made dinner for twenty people. There\u2019s a reason why new hires are paired up with the most experienced counselors, you know. This is hard work. And Brad\u2019s been camping for forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you told Andrea about it?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifts into a mischievous smile. \u201cI might\u2019ve been bragging about my Crisco Cult. You proved it works!\u201d I playfully smack his forearm, and he keeps on smiling. Then it fades. \u201cDid something happen with Andrea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned me in to Megan for not doing a good job at dinner.\u201d</p><p>He shuts his eyes and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not what I intended to happen...\u201d</p><p>I touch my lips. What if I hadn\u2019t asked Matt about what happened? What if I had just assumed the worst about him?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Matt says softly. He reaches out a hand, as if he\u2019s going to touch my jaw, but then stops. He quickly drops his hand, and I see his Adam\u2019s apple shift as he swallows. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with this Bonzo Ball game you\u2019re inventing?\u201d I ask, changing the subject.</p><p>He gently slaps his drill against his palm. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>The biggest grin appears on his face. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>It takes us about five more minutes to finish building the Bonzo Ball court, which turns out to be a wooden pen of sorts. The pen has eight sides and comes up to the tops of my shins. The pen is about fifteen feet in diameter. Standing inside it makes me feel kind of cramped.</p><p>\u201cSo what I\u2019m thinking is,\u201d Matt says, picking up a rubber ball and tossing it in the air, \u201cis that we play dodgeball inside this wooden enclosure, but you only go after people\u2019s feet. Like, you hit the ball at their legs, and they can slap it away and try to hit someone else. If you get hit in the legs, you\u2019re out, just like in regular dodgeball.\u201d</p><p>I step inside the pen. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><p>Matt drops the ball to the ground and squats like a football player right before the snap. Using his hand, he slams the ball toward my legs and I jump out of the way. The ball bangs against the wooden pen and ricochets toward the right.</p><p>\u201cThis game of yours involves a lot of geometry,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d He laughs too, and moves to slap the ball toward me again. This time I block it with my palms and nudge it away from me a bit, then bomb it at him.</p><p>He leaps out of the way and the ball rolls to the other side of the Bonzo Ball court. \u201cThat one had some heat on it!\u201d Matt says.</p><p>We keep playing for a few more minutes until Brad appears with a group of campers. Field games just ended, apparently.</p><p>\u201cTaj!\u201d Matt says, sounding like a little boy. \u201cYou gotta try out my new game. Y\u2019all, get in the ring.\u201d</p><p>Matt and I demonstrate for the boys and girls, and the game gets a whole lot more cramped but a whole lot more fun as we bat the ball around the pin. Kid after kid is disqualified until it\u2019s down to just Matt and me again. I squat down low, moving from side to side, jumping to avoid the ball.</p><p>The boys are screaming, \u201cGet her out, King!\u201d</p><p>Then the girls start calling me the Queen. \u201cQueen of the Ring!\u201d</p><p>Before Matt slaps the ball toward me, he looks up and finds my eyes, grinning like a madman.</p><p>I\u2019m grinning too.</p><p>making music</p><p>wednesday, june 6 ~ week 1 of 7</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the activities are night swim and s\u2019mores.</p><p>Matt is up in his lifeguard stand, and I keep sneaking glances at him. I\u2019m not the only one\u2014Andrea\u2019s doing that too. It\u2019s quickly turning into a one-way staring contest. Luckily Matt doesn\u2019t seem to notice either of us.</p><p>To distract myself, I grab a Nerf football and throw it to Brad, yelling, \u201cCatch!\u201d</p><p>We start tossing the football back and forth.</p><p>\u201cWhat church do you go to again?\u201d I ask Brad.</p><p>\u201cSummitville. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForrest Sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>He chews on his lip before speaking. \u201cYou guys get to go on all the mission trips, right? Like to Mexico and the Caribbean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur church doesn\u2019t have money to finance stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>I ask, \u201cWhat kinds of stuff do you do in youth group, then?\u201d</p><p>He throws the ball to me. \u201cWe have a pool table and some old arcade games. I used to go there every day after school. We just hang out.\u201d</p><p>I love church, but even I don\u2019t go every day.</p><p>I toss the ball back to him. \u201cAre the people there nice?\u201d I ask, thinking of Parker and how she thinks everyone at our church turned on her.</p><p>He smiles as he catches the football. \u201cYeah. Been going there since I was little. That\u2019s how I got this job\u2014Megan goes to my church and helped move my application along. My mom\u2019s the one who got me hooked on God and church.\u201d His expression suddenly changes, but I don\u2019t get a chance to ask if he\u2019s okay because Megan screeches her whistle at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKate, Brad, no talking.\u201d</p><p>I forgot.</p><p>Megan has this new ridiculous rule that counselors aren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other while campers are in the pool. It makes sense that she\u2019d want us to keep an eye on them, but (1) we have a lifeguard; (2) this rule doesn\u2019t apply when campers are canoeing or kayaking, even though the last time I checked, lakes, creeks, and pools all have water; and (3) the only reason she made this rule is so kids won\u2019t go home and tell their parents that us counselors spend time socializing.</p><p>It\u2019s like a gestapo up in here.</p> <p>But it is pretty cool that Megan got Brad this job. I wish she\u2019d show off more of her good side here, but I guess she can\u2019t let her guard down.</p><p>I wade off through the water to grab a seat on the pool steps with Claire and Sophie.</p><p>Claire asks, \u201cAre Parker and Will dating?\u201d</p><p>Parker and Will aren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other during pool time, so they are settling for staring across the shallow end and waving at each other.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I reply.</p> <p>\u201cAww,\u201d Claire says quietly. Then she and Sophie whisper to each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Sophie asks me.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Claire says.</p><p>\u201cEighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a boyfriend?\u201d Sophie asks.</p> <p>I groan quietly under my breath. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re eighteen!\u201d Sophie says.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Sophie and Claire whisper some more.</p><p>\u201cDo you like anybody?\u201d Sophie asks.</p><p>I splash water on my arms and neck, not allowing myself to gaze over at the lifeguard stand where Matt is holding a flotation device that resembles a giant hot dog. \u201cNot right now.\u201d</p><p>Sophie and Claire roll their eyes at each other.</p><p>During the last three minutes of night swim, Megan allows the counselors to jump in the pool together while the campers dry off and put their sneakers back on.</p> <p>Matt does a cannonball off the lifeguard stand, making a huge splash, making all the campers cheer and squeal. I stand on the edge of the pool, watching for him to emerge from underwater. I always worry people are going to crack their heads open on the concrete bottom. When he doesn\u2019t come up in the deep end, I flex my fingers, feeling panicky. Should I dive in after him?</p><p>That\u2019s when his head pops up right beside my feet.</p><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d I scream, hopping.</p><p>He grabs the side of the pool and stares up at me, beaming. The campers are cracking up.</p><p>\u201cGood one, King!\u201d Taj yells.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me!\u201d I say.</p><p>Matt shakes the water out of his dirty blond hair, which looks black under the night sky. The pool lights illuminate his glistening blue eyes. He lowers his face to focus on my ankle.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he says, gently touching my ankle bracelet. Blue beads are threaded through the hemp.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I made it.\u201d</p><p>He glances up at me, wipes water off his face and focuses on the bracelet again. \u201cMake me one?\u201d</p><p>I touch my cheek, trying to hold back my grin. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>His fingers lightly graze my ankle, tickling my skin. I imagine him tracing my leg, dragging his fingers up and down. I breathe deeply, as shivers race along my spine.</p><p>\u201cWhat color beads do you want?\u201d I add, my voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d he says, then yanks me into the pool. I crash into the water and fight my way to the surface, gasping for breath. Come up for air and hear the squeals and laughter from the kids.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d I say, splashing water at Matt. I chase him over to the shallow end, much to the delight of the little girls. They laugh and yell, \u201cGet him, Queen Kate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt and Kate!\u201d I hear Sophie squeal to Claire.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d Megan blows her whistle. \u201cCounselor swim is over. Let\u2019s go. Get your campers ready.\u201d</p><p>I stop chasing Matt and stand up to my full height. Claire and Sophie look from me to Megan and back to me again. I squeeze the water out of my ponytail, embarrassed that she called me out like that in front of everybody. How will any of the campers respect me if my boss doesn\u2019t? I get that I don\u2019t know much about the outdoors or camping, but really?</p><p>Does she really think being hard on us will help her get that big education job?</p><p>Megan blows her whistle again.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen? Seriously?\u201d I hear Andrea saying to Carlie.</p><p>I turn to walk up the steps and Matt comes toward me, scanning my bathing suit. No boy has ever looked at me this way. His eyes pause briefly at my stomach and chest. If I had one word to describe it?</p><p>Sinful.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want him to stop. I want him to drink me in as long as he wants.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d he asks, stopping next to me. He lightly touches my elbow. \u201cYour knee?\u201d he asks again. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>My elbow tingles. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Can I stop by your cookout pit later? By your cabin? I\u2019ll play that song I owe you.\u201d</p><p>I scoop my towel off the deck and cover my grin with it, not looking at his face.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay for you to leave your cabin when the kids are asleep?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll still be able to hear them. It\u2019s only two cabins away. Besides, Andrea and Carlie go smoke by the lake every single night. And don\u2019t even get me started on what Carlie and Ian do behind the cafeteria sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how about it?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cMidnight?\u201d I dry my hair with a towel, trying to keep my voice steady.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he says. He smiles, then goes into the pool maintenance closet.</p><p>I walk back to our group and Brad shakes his head at me and grins. \u201cKing Matt and Queen Kate, eh? Can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re already married\u2014\u201d</p><p>I swat at him with my towel, and he hops away, laughing.</p><p>Megan\u2019s giving me a look, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Matt wants to share music with me.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep an eye on my cabin tonight?\u201d I whisper to Brad. \u201cAt about midnight?\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cYou meeting up with Matt?\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath. My hands feel sweaty. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are together now?\u201d He throws his towel over his shoulder and we start leading our campers back toward the Cardinal cabins, where we\u2019ll make s\u2019mores.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper back. Sophie is right on my heels, trying to listen in.</p><p>\u201cI think he likes you,\u201d Brad goes on.</p><p>I shake my head quickly. \u201cImpossible. Andrea likes him.\u201d</p><p>Brad glances over at me and smirks again. \u201cIf he wanted that, he could\u2019ve had her a thousand times by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Brad says quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the power here.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. I haven\u2019t felt powerful since soccer season.</p><p>\u201cSo you like him?\u201d he asks, smiling.</p><p>After a few moments, I nod.</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d He smacks my shoulder with his towel.</p><p>It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s becoming a guy friend.</p><p>The night is cool, the girls are asleep, and all I can hear are the whirring box fan and chirping crickets.</p><p>I watch the clock tick down. 11:00 p.m. 11:21 p.m. 11:36 p.m. It\u2019s nearly midnight, and midnight means Matt.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing short plaid pajama shorts and a fitted white T-shirt, something more revealing than I\u2019d normally wear, because I want to show Matt that I can be cute like Andrea. I can act like a girl who wants a boyfriend. I have no idea what he does outside of camp, whether he sleeps around or smokes weed or drinks or what, but here he\u2019s sweet and funny and loves music and makes all the kids laugh.</p><p>And I want to know that Matt. I pray that Matt is the real Matt.</p><p>At 11:58 p.m. I step out of my cabin and tiptoe down the path to my picnic area, where he\u2019s already got a small fire crackling. He\u2019s sitting on top of the picnic table, barefoot (of course), strumming away at his guitar. With my heart pounding like mad, I take a seat next to him and listen to the soft crooning of the guitar.</p><p>He smiles and focuses on his fingers moving swiftly on the strings. He plays the tune over and over again, and I hum along. He softly works lyrics:</p><p>I know you can see, out of those pale green eyes.</p><p>He stops. Tunes his guitar. Tries out a few more notes. Sings more words.</p><p>But maybe you\u2019ve seen too much, \u2019cause you\u2019re hiding behind that disguise. I shouldn\u2019t talk, \u2019cause I\u2019m hiding too. So how can we meet? How can I find you? Will I see you on any other day but Christmas?</p><p>\u201cThat was insanely pretty,\u201d I say when he finishes, hoping the green eyes in the song are the same shade of green as mine. He scoots closer to me. Our hips touch. If not for the chirping crickets, I bet I could hear our hearts. I stretch my legs out and lean back on my hands. Our silence hangs on the warm air, but it\u2019s comfortable with him in the quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get to sleep,\u201d he says with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>He climbs off the picnic table and holds out a hand to help me up. His fingers are warm and I find myself wanting to run a thumb over his knuckles. But I let go.</p><p>Moonlight guiding us, Matt walks me back along the dirt path to my cabin. Once I\u2019m safely back on my porch, he says, \u201cThat was fun. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, waves, and walks away with his guitar slung over his back. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting. A hug? A kiss on the cheek? Something?</p><p>Was it nothing?</p><p>But if it was nothing, why won\u2019t my heart stop racing?</p><p>I climb into bed, cuddle up under the covers, and imagine his fingers touching my ankle. My body tingles again, like it did at the pool. Heat rushes between my legs. My breathing gallops away from me. I want to touch myself. I roll over and clutch my pillow, praying for relief but also not wanting the feeling to go away.</p><p>My camper Claire and I are DJing the Thursday Night Dance. Claire\u2019s best friend, Sophie, has already danced with a couple of guys from our group.</p><p>It\u2019s less than a day until I get to go home for the weekend. On Sunday, I\u2019m going to take Emily half of my paycheck, to see if she needs it. Unless I lose my courage. Thinking of seeing her makes me feel cold all over.</p><p>Claire picks out songs on iTunes, clicking away on my computer. I never really went to school dances in middle school and high school because Brother John railed against secular music all the time. I didn\u2019t even go to senior prom.</p><p>\u201cClaire, are you about to start your first year of middle school?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she says. The computer screen casts a blue glow on her face.</p><p>\u201cWill you go to dances this year?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, looking uncomfortable. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go if they let me DJ.\u201d</p><p>I missed out on a lot because I was scared other kids would be drinking or doing drugs or having sex, and I didn\u2019t want to be around that.</p><p>And because no boys ever invited me.</p><p>\u201cNo one would ask me to dance,\u201d Claire mumbles, echoing my thoughts. She clicks around on iTunes.</p><p>I sip my lemonade. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019re really kind and pretty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Matt says, striding up to our table. He says to Claire, \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She giggles and plays with her earring.</p><p>Matt has a mortified-looking boy in tow. He nudges him. \u201cSo, ladies, Jackson and I were wondering if you\u2019d like to double date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble date?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Matt says, looking at me. \u201cJackson wants to dance with Kate and I want to dance with Claire.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re DJing,\u201d I say, gesturing at the computer.</p><p>Matt looks around the streamer-covered pavilion. \u201cQuincy! Get over here.\u201d A tiny boy no older than nine comes sprinting over to Matt. \u201cYou know how to work iTunes?\u201d</p><p>Quincy\u2019s head bobs up and down quickly.</p> <p>\u201cGreat, you\u2019re DJing for a couple songs while Jackson and I take these lovely ladies on a date.\u201d He stretches out an elbow to Claire, who takes his arm. I raise my eyebrows, smiling, and follow them out onto the dance floor with Jackson.</p><p>Jackson sets his shaking hands on my waist and avoids my eyes. Sweat forms on his forehead and he rocks back and forth. I\u2019m slow dancing with a penguin.</p><p>I\u2019ve gotta start living.</p><p>I look over at Matt, who\u2019s twirling a laughing Claire. Jackson keeps glancing at her. Almost as much as Megan keeps glancing at Eric, who is sitting on a picnic table, whittling yet another stick. Pretty soon this entire forest is gonna be out of sticks if he doesn\u2019t stop whittling.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Claire\u2019s pretty?\u201d I ask Jackson.</p><p>\u201cMatt told me that if I dance with you first, he\u2019ll get her to dance with me.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m laughing now. Matt smiles at me and I return the grin. \u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d I mouth at him.</p><p>Matt raises his eyebrows and steers Claire toward us. He asks, \u201cHey, Claire, do you mind dancing with Jackson so I can dance with Kate?\u201d Matt whispers to her.</p><p>\u201cUhhh...\u201d she says, glancing at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Matt asks. \u201cI really want to dance with Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no problem,\u201d Claire says, rolling her shoulders.</p><p>I wrap my arms around Matt\u2019s neck and he pulls me in close. Over his shoulder, Megan gives us a disapproving glare, and Andrea looks like she wants to stab me, but whatever.</p><p>He\u2019s the perfect height for me. Only a few inches taller. His body fits snuggly against my curves. This is the first time I\u2019ve experienced his cologne. It\u2019s woodsy. He smells like walking in a forest.</p><p>\u201cYour dress is pretty,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cYou dance well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel good.\u201d</p><p>He thinks I feel good?!</p><p>\u201cYou do too,\u201d I mumble, nearly choking on the words.</p><p>\u201cI love your hair,\u201d he says, clutching a clump of it.</p><p>\u201cI love your invisible shoes.\u201d We look down at his bare feet, and laughing, we look up at each other. He shakes the dirty blond hair out of his eyes and holds my gaze, pulling me closer. My heart pounds against his chest.</p><p>I can barely think. All I can concentrate on are his skin and warmth and how I want to press my mouth to his. Like seven years ago. I want him to pull me behind the pavilion again.</p><p>Megan appears behind Matt and clears her throat. \u201cI need you two to chaperone the dance now, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one dance,\u201d Matt says, letting me go. When he\u2019s out of my arms, I feel like I\u2019ve lost a limb.</p><p>\u201cThis is a job,\u201d she says under her breath, throwing me a dirty look. \u201cYou aren\u2019t paid to socialize with each other.\u201d</p><p>So Andrea and Carlie are allowed to go smoke cigarettes by the lake every night, but I can\u2019t share one dance with Matt?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell Matt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell Megan, then head over to DJ again. I change the music to rap and all the kids start jumping around in a mosh pit.</p><p>Matt goes back to pouring punch. He talks to Andrea, Ian, and Carlie, laughing with them, but Megan doesn\u2019t seem to mind. It\u2019s okay for them to socialize on the clock. If Megan pisses Carlie off, Carlie could put in a bad word with her mom, ensuring Megan doesn\u2019t get the job at the regional conference.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re trying to keep me away from Matt. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve had the best judgment in the past. What if I end up sinning again? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the kind of girl who\u2019d ever end up pregnant, but like I told Parker, one thing leads to another.</p><p>Last night when I thought of Matt, my skin flushed. The thought of his woodsy cologne makes my stomach leap into my throat. Being around him makes my body go hot everywhere.</p><p>That dance with Matt just might have been the best moment of my life.</p><p>On Friday morning, before the campers leave for home, we all go to Woodsong Chapel for morning devotion. Megan tells the campers we have twenty minutes to sit and think about God and pray or do whatever we want, so long as we\u2019re silent.</p><p>I decide not to go to the altar, but to bury my face between my knees and stare at the ants marching through the dirt between my flip-flops. To God, we\u2019re all ants.</p><p>I stare up at the sunlight filtering through the trees and wonder how Emily could question whether God exists. This place is perfect. How could any of it be possible without a God?</p><p>He speaks to people here.</p><p>I examine my hand. It\u2019s perfect. Five fingers that allow me to touch, grasp, feel, move, hold, rub, test. How could something so perfect have come into being without God making it so?</p><p>None of the campers have approached the altar\u2014no one wants to be first, but then I see Matt stand and make his way past the log benches. He tips onto his knees and his cross necklace swings like a pendulum as he bows his head. I really want to know what he prays about. Who does he pray for?</p><p>After morning devotion, we walk the campers back to the welcome pavilion, where we\u2019ll see them off. Everyone is exchanging email addresses and signing T-shirts and hugging good-bye.</p><p>I wrap my arms around Claire. \u201cGo to some dances for me this year, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she whispers. \u201cJackson asked for my email address!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice!\u201d I say.</p><p>When I hug Sophie good-bye, I tell her how much her decoupage vase impressed me. \u201cStick with art, okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Then I spot Matt on one knee, speaking quietly with Quincy, the boy who played DJ last night. Matt takes off his wood chip nametag and hands it to him. The little boy puts it around his neck, smiling. I quietly step toward them and see that a phone number is written on the other side. I have no idea what they talked about this week, what sort of bond they formed, but I want to bottle the look on Matt\u2019s face.</p><p>By noon, all of the campers have left to go home and I\u2019m standing here, looking at the empty green field. Thinking about how some parts of this week weren\u2019t that great, but a lot of it rocked. I smile, reliving the dance with Matt, remembering the cheeseburgers I made all by myself, thinking about how Claire grew more confident this week.</p><p>I ran outside again. On actual grass!</p><p>All in only a week.</p><p>Megan toots her whistle. \u201cEverybody gather around me...You need to be back here by six p.m. on Sunday evening, to prepare for Monday. Kate and Parker, if you could please be here by five p.m., Eric will give you some pointers on starting fires and first aid.\u201d</p><p>Parker and I catch each other\u2019s eyes, and we nod at Megan.</p><p>\u201cGreat first week, guys,\u201d Megan says with a smile, and everyone cheers.</p><p>Everyone goes to pack up their cabins and clean. By the time I get my suitcase back to my car beside the tree line, to get ready for my forty-five-minute drive home, nearly everyone else is gone. Andrea\u2019s Camaro and Matt\u2019s Jeep are still here, and so is Brad\u2019s little blue Datsun, but I don\u2019t see him anywhere.</p><p>Andrea and Matt are talking quietly beside his Jeep, so I avoid their faces and pop my trunk.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Matt calls out to me, even though he\u2019s still standing with her.</p><p>She gives me the Death Stare to end all Death Stares.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold up a sec?\u201d he asks me. I nod, and he turns his attention back to Andrea. I lift my suitcase into the trunk of my car, shut it, and then stand here, jingling my keys. I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying.</p><p>A minute later, she climbs in her Camaro and shuts the door. The car bolts up the dusty road out of camp. Matt stares after her for a few heartbeats before walking my way.</p><p>What was Andrea talking about last week, when she said to Carlie, \u201cYou think he\u2019d be over it by now\u201d?</p><p>Matt stops right in front of me, taking in my eyes, ruffling his hair. \u201cSee you Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I twist the purity ring Mom gave me around my finger. \u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me too. You can make my breakfast on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>He glances around, I guess to make sure we\u2019re alone, and then pulls me into a bear hug. His touch makes my knees buckle. His breath is warm on my ear as he whispers, \u201cWhat\u2019s your last name again?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know my last name?! And we\u2019ve been dancing and splashing in the pool and sitting in the darkness together? He was my first dance, my first kiss. Him not knowing my last name makes me feel embarrassed and nervous and excited all at once.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate Kelly?\u201d His blue eyes look happy as his hands settle around my waist. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he says. He lets me go, then jogs over to the Jeep with no doors and hops in and buckles his seat belt. Matt looks back over his shoulder at me and grins and waves.</p><p>\u201cYou need doors!\u201d I call out. \u201cThat Jeep is a death trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an adventure!\u201d</p><p>The real adventure is waiting for Monday, when I\u2019ll see him again.</p><p>I let out a loud groan when I reach my room and collapse onto the bed. I power up my laptop and shut my eyes, trying to relax. I never knew how important air-conditioning and Diet Coke were until now. Thank you, God, for AC and Diet Coke.</p><p>I check my email. Lots of junk. Two emails from Emily that I\u2019m afraid to open. I drum my fingers on my laptop. I will go see her this weekend. I will. I bite down on my thumb, trying to ignore her voice running on repeat in my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a judgmental bitch,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>I resolve to go see her on Sunday before heading back to camp\u2014I worry she doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy food.</p><p>An email from Facebook pops up. Matthew Brown wants to be my friend. My hand shakes as I accept the friend request. I\u2019m scared to check his profile, for fear of finding pictures of him with other girls or something, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>When I see his picture, I grin. It\u2019s of him and a woman that must be his mother. She has the same dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and warm smile. He\u2019s kissing her cheek and she\u2019s laughing.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop staring at his blue eyes.</p><p>Heat rushes through my body as I remember him wading up to me in the pool, his eyes taking in every bit of me by moonlight.</p><p>Another Facebook email pops up. \u201cYou have a message from Matthew Brown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Can I get your number?</p><p>I gasp, shove my laptop off my thighs, and rush to make sure my door\u2019s locked. Should I write back now? Or wait a little while so he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a desperate loser? I peer around my room. Wait, I am a loser.</p><p>Framed sheet music hangs on the wall. Mom put it up after I pulled the pictures of me and Emily down. Books I read in middle school still line my shelves, and my bedding is pink and yellow with ruffles. I need to buy new, adultish bedding immediately. Part of me wants to call Parker, to ask for advice. What does her room look like? I doubt she has a stuffed cow resting on her pillow.</p><p>I walk to my mirror. How could a guy like Matt Brown possibly want my number? Why would a boy like Matt visit my cabin at night?</p> <p>Is God testing me? Seeing if I\u2019ll hang out with Matt, a guy who\u2019s in a frat, a guy who has done questionable things with a banana and maybe has fooled around with Andrea?</p><p>But Matt\u2019s mom is a youth minister. I\u2019ve seen him praying and he wears that cross around his neck. Brother John said we should only date other Christians. Does Matt worship somewhere in the middle? And is that okay?</p><p>I pinch my thigh. Stop thinking so much, I tell myself, and before I can change my mind, I write back to Matt and give him my number.</p><p>I pace around the room, slapping my cell phone against my hand. I stop in front of the mirror and turn sideways, to examine my figure. I am thin, but my boobs aren\u2019t that big. Why does Matt stare at me the way he does?</p><p>The cell rings. I swallow and answer.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d I thought I\u2019d be scared, but I\u2019m calm like a soft breeze.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Matt says. He goes silent for a bit, then says, \u201cYou busy tomorrow night?\u201d He sounds nervous.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I take you to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p> <p>I lick my upper lip. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d love dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pick you up at seven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>He lives in Bell Buckle, which is forty-five minutes from here. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pick me up. I could meet you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would crucify me if I didn\u2019t pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because who\u2019d take you dinner then? Bumblebee Brad?\u201d</p><p>sketch #351</p><p>what happened on april 18</p> <p>Every time I get my hopes up about Matt, I think about how I made a fool of myself in front of Will Whitfield last spring.</p><p>Using my blue coloring pencil, I shade in the outline of my prom dress.</p><p>One evening in April, I had rested my chin on my fist and clicked through the website again and again until the pictures of children burned my eyes. Planned Parenthood. I was trying to figure out options that Emily might consider instead of abortion.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door and Mom came in, dressed for church in a white blouse, slacks, and loafers. I quickly exited out of the site before she could see it.</p><p>\u201cSweetie.\u201d She tsk tsked. \u201cYou need to get dressed for youth group.\u201d</p><p>Mom never let me miss a day of church.</p><p>Normally I didn\u2019t mind that, but today I just wanted to bury myself under the covers and wallow in my own humiliation and sadness.</p><p>She adjusted my curtains and fluffed my pillows, and I sat there staring at the blue prom dress hanging on my closet door. Mom and I had picked it out a couple months earlier because she always thinks the best will happen.</p><p>Brother Michael and Brother John often say that forcing relationships is against God\u2019s will, that if He wants us to be with someone, He\u2019ll make it happen. But He only wants us to date other Christians.</p><p>For years, I\u2019d waited and waited for the right boy to come along, watched as Emily and Jacob fell in love and grew up without me. Sitting there in my room, I knew I should\u2019ve waited for a sign from God, but I had done it anyway.</p><p>I had asked Will Whitfield to prom.</p><p>It was my last chance for high school, and I couldn\u2019t seem to forget about him. He seemed like a good match for me: Christian, a gentleman, friendly.</p><p>Emily used to comb her fingers through my hair and tell me, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You just have to let guys know you\u2019re interested in them. Ask Will out already!\u201d</p><p>So I approached him in AP Chemistry, and cracking my knuckles, I said, \u201cCan we talk after class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said with a brief smile, then went back to checking over his homework. I should\u2019ve noticed that was the sign I\u2019d been waiting for all that time. If a guy would rather triple-check some chemical equation he balanced, he\u2019s just not that into you.</p><p>Later, in the hallway, he seemed distracted as Parker walked by, giving him a long look. He scratched the top of his head and followed her with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I adjusted my backpack straps. \u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d go to prom with me. If you don\u2019t have a date.\u201d I studied my loafers for the longest time, waiting. Waiting.</p><p>Finally he cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t have a date.\u201d</p><p>My head shot up.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d He gazed up and down the hallway before refocusing on me. \u201cI\u2019m interested in somebody else,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>His response sucked the air out of my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to prom with her then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His face seemed conflicted. He felt bad, but I also saw pity there.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I needed to get out of there before I started crying, so I stalked off down the hall without even saying bye. Daddy would be so disappointed that I\u2019d be home on yet another Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking,\u201d Will called out.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I hadn\u2019t had a chance to get with guys before. Besides Bruce Wilson, the creepy captain of the math team, I mean. One time Daddy\u2019s partner came over for dinner and brought his nephew, Scott. The two of us ended up watching a movie in the basement, laughing and talking about school. Emily asked why we didn\u2019t make out or anything, and I told her I just wasn\u2019t feeling it. She said, \u201cNothing wrong with that. If there\u2019s no sparks, there\u2019s no sparks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty dress,\u201d Mom said that evening before church, smoothing the silk with her fingers.</p><p>I make shadows on the paper, to show the folds of the silk. It is a pretty dress. I hope I can wear it one day.</p><p>i\u2019m thinking chili\u2019s</p><p>friday, june 8 ~ end of week 1</p><p>I have Will Whitfield\u2019s phone number because we once did a Culture Fair project together in high school. I take a deep breath and call him.</p><p>So much has changed since I asked him to prom.</p><p>He answers on the second ring. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI love air-conditioning,\u201d I groan, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cMe too. I\u2019ve never sweat so much in my life. So how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Listen, could I get Parker\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I say. I wasn\u2019t prepared to talk to her yet. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m gonna ask. But Will\u2019s already put her on the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cUm, I could use your help.\u201d</p><p>The next evening, Parker and Will show up at my house. He\u2019s carrying a box under each arm and she\u2019s got a bunch of outfits draped over her wrists.</p><p>I bring them in through our side door because Daddy has all these animal heads on the wall in the foyer and I don\u2019t want to upset Parker. Daddy\u2019s hunting dog\u2014our old bloodhound, Fritz\u2014is lounging in the mudroom when we come in. Parker practically has a coronary because she loves the dog so much. She kisses him and pats him all over and Fritz closes his eyes and wallows on the floor, enjoying the attention.</p><p>Will loves it too\u2014he can\u2019t stop grinning at how much fun Parker is having.</p><p>\u201cFritz can come upstairs with us if he wants,\u201d I say.</p><p>Parker gets to her feet. \u201cC\u2019mon, Fritz. Let\u2019s get to work on making Kate as beautiful as you,\u201d she says, following my dog to my room. I shake my head, smiling. Will flops down on my bed.</p><p>I sit at my desk and she starts rummaging through her boxes before approaching me.</p><p>\u201cIs this your first date?\u201d she asks, aiming tweezers at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper. \u201cBut what if it\u2019s not a date? What if it\u2019s just us being friends, getting food together?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a look. \u201cIt\u2019s a date. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I stay silent.</p><p>\u201cI only had my first real date a couple months ago,\u201d she says, throwing Will a smile.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I exclaim. \u263a</p><p>She examines my eyebrows and then begins to pluck. Ow, ow, ow, I think, but I stay cool. I don\u2019t want to be a loser.</p><p>\u201cWill\u2019s my first real boyfriend too.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s grinning and typing on his iPhone. \u201cHow long do you think this\u2019ll take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you guys have somewhere to be...\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good for now. But we have plans tonight,\u201d Parker replies, sounding nervous.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out with Drew Bates...and his boyfriend, Tate,\u201d Will says carefully.</p><p>\u201cDrew Bates is gay?\u201d I ask loudly. I had no idea.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Parker replies, stiffening at my reaction. \u201cBut they\u2019re my best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod made \u2019em that way. Who are we to question it?\u201d Will asks, acting nonchalant. He taps on his iPhone some more.</p><p>\u201cWhere are y\u2019all going?\u201d I ask, trying to get rid of the tension.</p><p>\u201cTo a Nashville Sounds game and dinner,\u201d Parker says softly, her eyes avoiding mine as she brushes eye shadow on me. It seems like she and Will are disappointed in me. Again. They\u2019ve been nothing but nice and supportive. Drew Bates has never once called me a Jesus Freak.</p><p>You\u2019re being a judgmental bitch rings in my head.</p><p>Maybe what Parker said at camp is right. It\u2019s none of my business.</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d I say. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry I was so surprised about Drew and Tate. I hope things are working out for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for saying that,\u201d Parker replies quietly, comparing two colors of blush. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for Drew.\u201d</p><p>Will hugs his girlfriend from behind. He kisses her neck and stares at her with such love.</p><p>If things go well with Matt, will he kiss my neck like that?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this boy coming over?\u201d Daddy calls out from the screened-in porch.</p><p>\u201cMatt Brown,\u201d I reply, carrying my sketchbook into the room. I told Mom about the date earlier today but left out that Matt is twenty and in a frat. I can\u2019t tell my parents that! Not yet, anyway.</p><p>I kiss Daddy\u2019s cheek and sit down next to him at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about this boy, Irene?\u201d Daddy asks Mom. He winks at me, showing he\u2019s just kidding. He eyes the too-short dress I borrowed from Parker.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s mom is the youth minister at Bell Buckle Chapel,\u201d I say, pulling a pencil from behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard wonderful things about that program,\u201d Mom says, swiveling a vase of tulips and lilies, trying to catch the petals in the best light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One thing I\u2019ve always loved about my parents is that no matter what they\u2019re doing, they like being in the same room. So if Daddy is doing paperwork on the patio, Mom is usually sitting there beside him with a pitcher of iced tea and a home decorating guide or the Bible. Today she\u2019s flipping through a brochure because Daddy is taking her on a cruise to Spain in a few weeks for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re doing food baskets tomorrow after services,\u201d Mom says to Daddy.</p><p>\u201cYou know you won\u2019t let me forget,\u201d he says, smiling at her. I swear, she could ask him to enter a beauty pageant and he\u2019d slap a big grin on his face and go forth and conquer. Mom and Daddy have always been big churchgoers and care about God, just like I do. Mom leads a weekly Bible study for elderly people at church and Daddy plans (and usually wins) the annual Chili Cook-off.</p><p>\u201cI saw that the Belmont registration booklet came today,\u201d Daddy says, licking his finger before turning a page in his case file.</p> <p>\u201cYup,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go over it together? Pick out some classes?\u201d</p><p>Technically I have another three weeks to register. I need that time because I have no idea what I want to study. Law, like my family? Physical therapy? Psychology? Art? When Emily came back from D.C., she told me she had met a girl there who was planning to major in The Simpsons.</p><p>Maybe if God doesn\u2019t give me a sign about forgiving me for helping Emily, he will at least tell me what to do with my life. \u201cCan you let me go through the catalog a few more times first?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense to be well-prepared. Good girl.\u201d Daddy puts his pen back in his mouth and pores over his paperwork. It amazes me that he really enjoys reading all that mumbo jumbo. It\u2019s so...black and white? Where\u2019s the color?</p> <p>I open my sketchbook and draw the tulips that Mom can\u2019t seem to get situated. She keeps adjusting the vase and arranging the flowers. How does Daddy handle all that racket Mom makes while he\u2019s trying to work?</p><p>If you hang out with a person for a long, long time, do you just get used to the differences?</p><p>\u201cI ran into Bill Mansfield down at Foothills this morning,\u201d he says. Foothills is this diner where he reads the paper every Saturday morning.</p><p>Bill Mansfield is Emily\u2019s dad.</p><p>\u201cDid he mention Emily?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Daddy says, putting his pen back in his mouth.</p> <p>Mom turns to me. \u201cHave you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>I bow my head and shake it.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to tell us what happened?\u201d Mom asks me. All my parents know is that Emily had a fight with her parents and that she moved out. They know we had a fight too, but I can\u2019t say anything without betraying Emily.</p><p>Without telling my parents what a horrible person I am.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I say quietly. The shame erases the excitement I had about my date.</p><p>My parents look at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep praying for her,\u201d Mom says, and I focus on filling the paper in front of me with tulips until the doorbell rings.</p><p>Daddy leaps to his feet with a pen in his mouth and a case file in his hand, and rushes to the front door. I groan inwardly. From the hallway, I listen as Matt introduces himself to Daddy, then I shuffle over to find Matt standing there with hands in his pockets. He has on flip-flops! This is the first time I\u2019ve seen him in shoes since he was thirteen. He\u2019s wearing holey jeans and a wrinkled, weathered, white polo. The leather cord holding a silver cross hangs around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d he mouths at me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I mouth back, giving him a wave.</p><p>He grins and it\u2019s so cute, I have to catch my breath.</p><p>But I wish he\u2019d dressed up more to meet my parents. And for me, for that matter. Maybe I\u2019ve got this all wrong? Maybe he only wants to be friends? Why would I be so boastful as to think he\u2019d want something more with a girl like me anyway?</p><p>He glances around at our marble foyer and swallows.</p><p>Before I can even say hi, Mom is brushing past me to shake Matt\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cTell your mother I said hello,\u201d she says to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Matt replies. His eyes flash to the moose head on the wall (Daddy shot it last year), then he focuses on me again. \u201cAre you ready to go to dinner now? Or did you want to hang out here for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s best for you,\u201d I say, wringing my fingers together. Should I go change out of this dress into something more casual? Should I call Parker to ask? How could I have been so stupid as to think this was a date? He didn\u2019t even bring flowers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all have fun,\u201d Daddy says, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat time should I have her home, sir?\u201d Matt asks.</p><p>\u201cKate doesn\u2019t have a curfew. We trust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have church in the morning,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cJust call if you\u2019re gonna be real late,\u201d Dad adds.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply, and give Mom a kiss bye. Matt leads me outside and I laugh. \u201cYou put the doors on your Jeep?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI didn\u2019t figure your mom and dad would appreciate it if I put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>Him putting the doors on his Jeep is kind of like giving me flowers.</p><p>\u201cYou look really pretty, by the way,\u201d he says, jingling his keys.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty too,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>He looks over his shoulder toward my porch. I think our house with its eight white Corinthian columns freaks him out. \u201cWhere does your dad work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be cutthroat, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the situation, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain Vincent Moose on the wall in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent Moose?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just named him Vincent.\u201d</p><p>He opens my door for me and I climb in, trying not to flash my undies at him. Parker\u2019s dress is way short. But I loved seeing myself in the mirror, and I wanted Matt to love the way I look too.</p><p>Three things stick out in the Jeep: (1) it smells like cinnamon, (2) the ripped seats have been patched up with duct tape, and (3) when I pull down the visor to shield my eyes from the setting sun, I lift the mirror to check my makeup and a picture of Matt and a girl floats into my lap. She\u2019s beautiful. Brown curls. Perfectly white straight teeth. He\u2019s kissing her cheek.</p><p>He jumps into the driver\u2019s seat and thrusts his keys into the ignition. I bite my lip, trying not to tear up. He has a girlfriend? He said he was a one-girl kind of guy. He said nothing\u2019s going on with Andrea. Is it because he has this other girl?</p><p>As he pulls out of my driveway, I slap a hand on the door handle. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, furrowing his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t go to dinner,\u201d I say, breathing slowly. I touch my forehead.</p><p>He slams on the brakes. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yeah. Kinda.\u201d</p><p>He looks concerned. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the girl?\u201d I ask, handing him the picture, suddenly feeling courageous. \u201cIt fell out from behind the mirror in your sun visor.\u201d</p><p>Matt puts the Jeep in park. He stares at the picture for a sec, then passes it back over.</p><p>I cradle the photo in my hands. \u201cYou love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he says, turning to face me. He tucks a foot under his other leg. \u201cHonestly? I forgot about the picture. It\u2019s been there forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is forever?\u201d</p><p>He stares through the windshield. \u201cWe dated for three years... from when we were fifteen until we were eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up?\u201d</p><p>Matt drums his fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cYou really want to hear all this? Before our first date even starts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a date?\u201d</p><p>His mouth edges into a smile and he gives me a withering look. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a date. You\u2019re gonna be my wingman when we go out clubbing later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a date.\u201d He reaches over and squeezes my hand, but I remove it from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand who Sarah is,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>He lifts a shoulder. \u201cShe was my first girlfriend. My only girlfriend. After high school, she wanted to see other people for a while so she could make sure I was the one. I figured we\u2019d get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to marry my best friend, Tom, instead. Well, my former best friend.\u201d Pain creases his face as he plays with his guitar keychain.</p><p>We sit in silence. I don\u2019t get the feeling he wants my sympathy. I get the feeling he wants to get this explanation out of the way so we can go on our date already. Andrea wondered why he hadn\u2019t gotten over this, right? That must\u2019ve been it. But he asked me out. Maybe he wants to get over Sarah.</p><p>I slip the photo back where it was, in its spot under the sun visor. I quickly squeeze Matt\u2019s hand.</p><p>He gazes over at me for several seconds. \u201cI\u2019m thinking Chili\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to Just Tacos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we could.\u201d He puts the car in drive. \u201cI bet Just Tacos has everything that Chili\u2019s serves anyway.\u201d</p><p>The minute we step into Chili\u2019s, I\u2019m worried again.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d the hostess squeals, skipping into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHaircut, huh?\u201d he says, fluffing the tiny girl\u2019s blond bob. She\u2019s a real-life Tinkerbell.</p><p>I\u2019m on a date with a guy who\u2019s fluffing another girl\u2019s hair. He\u2019s such a flirt, it\u2019s really hard to believe he\u2019s a one-girl kind of guy. Really hard.</p><p>He releases her, then turns to me. \u201cEllie, this is Kate. Kate, this is Ellie, one of my best friends.\u201d</p><p>I shake hands with the girl, who seems very surprised to see me. She glances up at Matt in shock.</p><p>\u201cWant your table?\u201d Ellie asks him, grabbing two menus.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, rubbing his palms together. Matt explains that he comes here all the time as we follow Ellie to a table right next to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d she tells me, handing me my menu. She points at Matt. \u201cYou. Me. We\u2019re talking later. Call me.\u201d</p><p>Matt shakes his head, laughing, and stares down at his menu. \u201cFine. Now go away.\u201d</p><p>She grins and skips off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m looking at this.\u201d He tosses his menu to the other side of the table. \u201cI always get the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? I usually get the bacon cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the ranch burger. I think ranch has nicotine in it, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty. You smoke?\u201d</p><p>He sips his water. \u201cNaw. But there\u2019s gotta be something in the ranch that makes me so addicted. It\u2019s either that or cocaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be doing cocaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordering me around?\u201d He lifts an eyebrow, smiling coyly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t order me around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave fun bailing yourself out of jail,\u201d I say, laughing. He laughs along with me, his blue eyes lit up. I twist my ring around my finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kick you out of my Crisco Cult if you don\u2019t behave,\u201d he flirts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our first date and we\u2019re already arguing.\u201d</p><p>He studies my face, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy parents fight all day every day. This morning they got into it because Dad thinks the toilet paper roll should unravel from the top and Mom thinks it should unravel from the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it should unravel from the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe top.\u201d</p><p>We laugh, and he ruffles his dirty blond hair and looks at the little appetizer flipbook sitting on the table. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the bottomless chips with ranch dressing, right?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as my dad. He\u2019s got serious blood pressure issues because he overindulges and now you\u2019re all eating two helpings of ranch in one dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that,\u201d he says. \u201cRanch dressing exists. Therefore, I must eat it.\u201d</p><p>A waiter takes our drink and appetizer order, then a guy carrying a beer struts up to our table. \u201cBrown!\u201d He and Matt shake hands and do a guy hug, slapping each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d the guy says, sipping his beer and staring me down.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Kate.\u201d</p><p>The guy squeezes Matt\u2019s shoulder and grins down at him. \u201cNice, bro.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s face goes red. \u201cNick, I\u2019ll catch up with you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come to this party later? There\u2019s supposed to be a nude Jell-O wrestling contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Nick,\u201d Matt says with a stern voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the guy says, heading back toward the bar. Beer sloshes out of his glass onto the floor and he nearly slips on it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Matt says, scratching his neck. \u201cOne of my frat brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Nick a big drinker?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night. Everyone drinks on Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019m not really into that.\u201d And I\u2019m really not into the idea of nude Jell-O wrestling parties. He takes in my face and I find his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a beer before, sure,\u201d Matt says. \u201cBut I like lemonade and hot cocoa too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I take it it really bothers you I\u2019m in a frat, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. I take my napkin off the table, unfold it, and stretch it across my lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about any of it. I\u2019ve never been to a frat house or anything.\u201d</p><p>He plays with a coaster, thinking. \u201cLast month? My older sister, Leigh, had a flat tire on the interstate. My parents were on a mission trip and I was crashing for a final. Nick went and changed her tire and made sure she got back home safely. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>Last night, when I called Parker to ask for help, she didn\u2019t ask any questions either. She showed up and did my makeup and gave me a great outfit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have friends you can count on,\u201d I say.</p><p>He points at me with a fork. \u201cOur frat also raises money for charity. We do car washes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Without your shirts on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWhat charity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ASPCA. You know, all those commercials on TV? With pictures of sad dogs and cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww,\u201d I reply, making Matt laugh. He takes his napkin off the table and opens it in his lap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think about frats or other churches. I\u2019ve never gone to another church besides Forrest Sanctuary and the only thing I know about frats is that they have wild keggers and sometimes people get naked and jump in pools. I saw that on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, those kinds of things do happen occasionally, I guess, but you can\u2019t judge all frats and people based on TV. All that really matters is what you think. And I care what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He leans across the table toward me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get the ranch burger too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopycat.\u201d</p><p>We laugh, and that\u2019s when another guy stumbles up and slides into the booth next to Matt. He whispers in Matt\u2019s ear and gropes his chest.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Matt says, slapping the guy\u2019s hand away.</p><p>\u201cBut I want your body,\u201d the guy slurs. I can\u2019t believe how drunk this guy is. It\u2019s only 9:00 p.m. and he\u2019s feeling up Matt!</p><p>\u201cDude, can\u2019t you see I\u2019m on a date?\u201d Matt says.</p><p>The guy pinches Matt\u2019s chest. Then he glares over at me. \u201cCome on, man. She\u2019s not your type. I\u2019m your loooooooooovvvvvvvvvver.\u201d</p><p>A group of guys at the bar are cracking up and pointing at us. I rub my face, hardly believing this is happening. Another boy comes over, sits down, wraps his arm around me, and checks out my cleavage. I shove him away, regretting wearing this dress.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a beer?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a beer,\u201d Matt blurts, looking horrified. \u201cCome on, guys. Get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want your body!\u201d the guy whines again and rests his head on Matt\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d Matt hollers, and she flits over and forces the two guys back to the bar. For a girl who weighs a hundred pounds, she sure has a lot of control over those two.</p><p>The waiter brings our Cokes and chips. I\u2019m so nervous, I suck down a bunch at once and stuff two chips in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on, Brown?\u201d Nick yells from the bar. \u201cYou gonna lavalier this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, you!\u201d Ellie says to him, and all the guys shut up real fast and focus on the Braves game.</p><p>Matt groans. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought you here. My stupid friends...\u201d</p><p>I eat another chip. \u201cThey seem...interesting,\u201d I offer, laughing nervously. I slurp more Coke.</p><p>\u201cThey are, but I\u2019d trust all of them with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of them go to your church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a one of them. They\u2019re all in my frat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust the people at church too, but I have plenty of friends who don\u2019t go to church at all.\u201d He dips a chip in ranch and eats it. \u201cI swear these things have nicotine in them,\u201d he says again, shaking his head.</p><p>I grin and pop another chip. \u201cWhat does lavalier mean?\u201d I ask through a mouthful.</p><p>Matt stuffs a chip in his mouth. \u201cIt means that you give a girl your letters. Like, your frat letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you let a girl wear your letters, it means you love her as much or more than your brothers. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must happen a lot, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Matt laughs. \u201cThe last time one of my brothers lavaliered a girl, some guys tied him to a tree, naked. Then they threw eggs at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was over the top.\u201d</p><p>I gaze over Matt\u2019s shoulder at his friends. Half of them are laughing and messing around, but a bunch of them are staring at me. Like they\u2019re sizing me up or something. I play with the napkin in my lap. If my car broke down on the side of the road, I wouldn\u2019t have that many people to call. My parents. Maybe Will or Parker, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019d ask me to hang out afterward. At this point, I doubt I\u2019d call Emily. I guess I\u2019ll have to rely on AAA the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cYour friends are staring at me,\u201d I tell Matt.</p><p>He looks over his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried?\u201d</p><p>He sips Coke from his straw. \u201cI don\u2019t date often. Hardly ever, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you hook up, right?\u201d</p><p>He smirks and shakes his head. \u201cAre you always this up-front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He swirls his Coke with the straw. \u201cHooking up isn\u2019t the same thing as a date, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d I say, deciding to tell the truth. \u201cThis is my first real date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I brought you to Chili\u2019s?\u201d he exclaims. He cracks up. \u201cI\u2019m such an asshole. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ruined your dreams of a first date at a real restaurant. I\u2019m not even wearing shoes.\u201d</p><p>I peek under the table to find he\u2019s kicked his flip-flops off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda like I\u2019m on a date with you and your frat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better next time,\u201d he replies. A pause. \u201cTell me about your friends.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s face flashes in my mind. I pull a deep breath. I don\u2019t know that I want to talk about her right now, especially when I\u2019m so happy. At that moment, cheers erupt from the bar and Matt swivels around to catch the TV for a sec. One of the Braves hit a homer.</p><p>When he turns back to me, I stretch a hand across the table. It\u2019s comfortable, intertwining our fingers. It\u2019s like it\u2019s where they belong. Our eyes meet.</p><p>Another of Matt\u2019s friends approaches us, and this time, I shake the guy\u2019s hand and ask if he wants to join us, which makes Matt smile the brightest smile I\u2019ve seen in a long time.</p><p>After Chili\u2019s, Matt takes me to the Fun Tunnel at the mall, where we battle it out over Skee-Ball. He wins like a hundred tickets and I only get five.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are terrible at this,\u201d he teases, and I swat him.</p><p>\u201cI played soccer. I wasn\u2019t a bowler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He gestures at my five tickets. I use them to buy Matt a mini Tootsie Roll, which he pops in his mouth, smiling.</p><p>He uses his tickets to buy me a temporary tattoo of a fairy and a sparkly plastic mood ring, which he slips onto my pinky finger. It barely fits\u2014my skin swells around the plastic.</p><p>We go over to the basketball free throw game where we take shot after shot, laughing and bumping into each other as we shoot. My hip brushes against his, and every so often, he\u2019ll stare over at me like it\u2019s hard for him to look away from my face.</p><p>\u201cAnother game?\u201d he asks, slipping two quarters into the slot. Basketballs roll toward us and the game timer starts counting down from two minutes. The timer reminds me of life, and that I\u2019ve never been on a real date before. I\u2019m eighteen years old. The timer ticks down. Matt shoots while I stand there, not wanting to stay still, wanting to take a shot. The timer\u2019s ticking.</p><p>I turn to face him. He takes a jump shot. The ball swooshes through the net. He grabs another ball, but before he can shoot I drag a finger down his arm, from his shoulder to his wrist. He drops the ball and twists to face me, his blue eyes finding mine. And before I can second guess myself or lose my nerve, I get up on tiptoes and steal a kiss. A quick peck on the lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grins and sets his hands on my waist, pulling me closer. \u201cThat was a nice surprise,\u201d he murmurs, then leans back in and kisses me more deeply. His lips are soft, moving gently, exploring. I wrap my arms around his neck and he digs his thumbs into my hips. I taste Tootsie Roll on his tongue.</p><p>A buzzer goes off when the game timer hits zero.</p><p>But we just got started.</p><p>sketch #358</p> <p>what happened last night</p><p>Brother Michael is giving a sermon about caring for the elderly and Meals on Wheels or something, but I\u2019ve got an itch. I grab a little offering envelope and one of those tiny pencils you only seem to see at church and on golf courses. Mom sniffs when she sees what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>I start sketching Matt\u2019s hand.</p><p>Under a full moon and a sky full of stars, we sprinted out of the Fun Tunnel, laughing and holding hands, jumping in circles. When we reached his Jeep, Matt gently leaned me against the door and kissed me so fully, the whole world went dark. It was just me and him and our bodies and a spark that flicked on and wouldn\u2019t go out. His fingers traced from my ear to my chin, from my chin to my cheek, from my cheek to my lips.</p><p>I take care to draw the creases of his hand. I make his nails rugged but clean.</p> <p>He dragged his fingers along the back of my neck as he pulled me forward so his mouth met mine.</p><p>I grin as I shade the dip between his forefinger and thumb.</p><p>Mom keeps sniffing and Daddy keeps looking at me sideways and smiling, so I carefully fold the drawing and stick it in my Bible.</p><p>I put the little pencil back into its holder and try to focus on the sermon.</p><p>tell me what you want from me</p><p>sunday, june 10 ~ week 2 of 7</p> <p>Part of me is still giddy about my date with Matt and can\u2019t wait to see him again in a few hours when counselors return to camp. To be honest, he and I didn\u2019t talk much the rest of the night. He drove me home, where we sat in the driveway and kissed and kissed and kissed. His fingers explored every inch of my face and I couldn\u2019t stop touching his strong shoulders and dirty blond hair. Mom and Daddy were asleep when I finally dragged myself inside. I stayed awake for hours, thinking of Matt, and overslept and nearly missed Sunday school this morning. I kept thinking, Matt, Matt, Matt, and I felt so good inside it felt wrong.</p><p>But the other half of me is terrified to see Emily today. We haven\u2019t spoken since graduation, when we told each other good luck and walked away without even a hug. And according to Mom, Emily hasn\u2019t contacted her parents since they kicked her out of the house.</p><p>The only reason I know where she lives is because Mom got Mr. Munroe, the mailman, to spill the beans about where Emily\u2019s mail is being forwarded to, and maybe I\u2019m invading her privacy, but I need to give her part of my paycheck. To make sure she has enough to eat. It\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Before driving to Nashville, I stop at Sonic to get a cherry limeade, to soothe my nerves, and find Will Whitfield there when I pull into the parking lot. He\u2019s lounging at a picnic table, talking to Sam Henry and Drew Bates.</p><p>I order my drink, then watch the guys chat until Will looks over. He grins and beckons me. In high school, I never would\u2019ve gotten out of my car at Sonic to talk to people, but I slowly open my door and make my way to him. Drew narrows his eyes while Sam shakes his Styrofoam cup, rattling the ice around.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Will says, standing up. \u201cWant to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m on my way to Nashville to see Emily Mansfield before going back to camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her anyway? I haven\u2019t seen Jacob around in weeks. Are they okay?\u201d</p> <p>I clear my throat. \u201cI guess they\u2019re both sad about the breakup,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Will tilts his head. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a class together, right?\u201d Sam asks me, chomping on his ice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I reply. \u201cArt.\u201d</p><p>He points at me. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He grins like he\u2019s seeing me for the first time, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more embarrassing\u2014that I\u2019m forgettable, or that my artwork is forgettable.</p><p>My face flushes and I\u2019m turning to climb back in my car when Will touches my elbow. \u201cHow was the date?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop my smile. \u201cFun. Unexpected. Crazy.\u201d</p><p>Will laughs, nodding. \u201cThat sounds like Matt. You gonna see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see him tonight at work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But another date?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lips together and sneak a peek at Drew, who\u2019s still staring at me. \u201cI hope so, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Will says, patting my shoulder. \u201cYou look happy.\u201d</p><p>Did Will and Parker tell Drew that I was surprised he\u2019s gay and now he\u2019s pissed? My face goes hot when Drew rolls his eyes at me. Will catches him doing it and leans over to whisper in my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. He\u2019s really protective of Parker because they\u2019ve been friends forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Will whispers. \u201cAnd you go to Parker\u2019s church, therefore Drew believes you are evil.\u201d</p><p>I laugh a sad laugh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Will says, patting my shoulder, but I know I will.</p><p>A roller-skating waitress brings me my cherry limeade, so I say good-bye to the guys and get back into my car.</p><p>I sip my drink through the straw, wondering if Sam will forget about me again. I want people I can call if my car breaks down on the side of the interstate. Judging by the way Drew treated me, he only seems to associate me with bad stuff. At the stoplight, I close my eyes and lean my forehead against the steering wheel. I don\u2019t know where I get off thinking I deserve to be remembered.</p><p>In Nashville, I park outside Emily\u2019s new apartment. A few pieces of trash litter the parking lot, which has been overrun by cracks and weeds. I climb two flights of metal stairs to reach her door. A rip runs down the screen. She\u2019s definitely here\u2014I can hear a violin crooning inside. I ring the doorbell and try to figure out what to do with my hands while waiting. I settle for sticking my thumbs in the pockets of my jean shorts.</p><p>I hear locks unlocking and the door whips open to reveal Emily standing there in a white tank and khaki shorts. Her auburn hair is pulled back into a messy ponytail. Darkness rings her eyes. But they brighten a little when she sees me.</p><p>\u201cHey. Want to come in?\u201d She pushes the screen open. I step inside. I had no idea her living room, bedroom, and dining room would all be merged into one. It\u2019s so small. I turn in a circle. A piece of cardboard covers a broken window. Bits of linoleum are flaking away from the floor, like sunburned skin. I bite the inside of my cheek when I see a mousetrap.</p><p>I spin around to find the butterfly painting I painted for her sixteenth birthday hanging over a sagging couch. She remembered my art. My eyes burn.</p><p>She relocks the door, slides the security chain into place, and eyes my shorts. I wore the short ones Mom bought me because I think Matt will like them. Now I wonder if I shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cMom found out. From the mailman.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth forms an O. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I pull my lower lip between my teeth and reach into my back pocket and grab the money. \u201cI wanted to bring you this. You know, in case you needed it.\u201d I cough into a fist. \u201cFor your rent or groceries or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow dark. \u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d want your money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could help\u2014\u201d I thrust the money toward her hand. She steps back.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my calls for a month and now you show up and give me money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to help, you could call me once in a while. Or maybe pick up when I call you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to tell her that just seeing her reminds me of what we did. I put the money back in my pocket and stand in front of the butterfly painting.</p><p>\u201cYou kept it,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>She appears beside me and studies the purple butterfly, its wings bursting open to reveal orange, yellow, red, and white. \u201cThis painting gave me the courage to play for the Youth Philharmonic.\u201d</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t painted this butterfly for her, would she have still gone to D.C.? Because last summer is when she started changing.</p><p>I touch my throat, staring down at the stained linoleum. Mom would have a fit if she knew Emily was living here. She\u2019d insist on redecorating it, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cDo you, um, want to sit down?\u201d Emily asks. \u201cMaybe we can go out for something to eat? I can\u2019t afford much, but I get fifty percent off at the diner where I\u2019m working nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I reply. \u201cI have to be back at camp early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cNot too bad. Um...\u201d Now that I\u2019m here, I know how much I miss her. The pain is deeper, rawer than it is when she\u2019s not around. I want to tell her that. But I need to know something first.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask for forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk who for forgiveness?\u201d Sadness rings in her voice.</p><p>\u201cGod. You know, for what we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to move on already. Can\u2019t you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care about my forgiveness but not God\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care more about yours.\u201d</p><p>The tears start to well in my eyes. Is my friend going to Hell? And will I be there with her? I wipe my cheek with the heel of my hand.</p><p>\u201cYour shorts are cute,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you care about? My shorts?\u201d I\u2019m pissed, but part of me wants her to know why I\u2019m wearing the shorts. Matt. How he can make doughnuts over a campfire and how he invented a new kind of dodgeball.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d she asks, gesturing at her tiny kitchen. \u201cI have water, and, um...\u201d She looks over her shoulder, blushing.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cLook...\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d I find myself crossing my arms across my stomach and inching away from her.</p><p>\u201cI was so angry,\u201d she adds. \u201cI can\u2019t even explain what I felt like. I mean, my parents...it was like I killed part of them by doing what I did...And I needed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed you too. I still feel bad about what I did...Maybe if I hadn\u2019t agreed, you wouldn\u2019t have gone through with it,\u201d I mumble, wiping my nose.</p><p>\u201cIt was my decision,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly I should be allowed to regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes close. \u201cYou really won\u2019t forgive me for this, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you, but we need God\u2019s forgiveness too. It\u2019s not about you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cIt is about me. About me and Jacob.\u201d She covers her face. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t come here\u2014I was finally starting to calm down and get into a rhythm and now you\u2019re back and I feel terrible again and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI just need time and to talk and some help and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She peeks at me from behind her fingers. \u201cI want my friend back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d she says before laughing bitterly. \u201cYou are so far gone I don\u2019t think I can get you back.\u201d</p><p>These are my beliefs, my feelings, what I know to be true, and she thinks I\u2019m too far gone to be helped? \u201cIf you were my friend, you\u2019d understand what I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d I cry.</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe we can\u2019t be friends then,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want your pity.\u201d She points at the door and I quickly let myself out. It slams behind me. I dash down the squeaky staircase and slip into my car.</p><p>I turn the ignition and, before reversing, I look over my shoulder, out into the world.</p><p>I arrive at camp earlier than expected.</p><p>Will I get in trouble with Megan for being here early?</p><p>I park my car at the tree line right next to Brad\u2019s. It\u2019s in the exact same place I left it on Friday. Did he stay here? That\u2019s against the rules. Maybe he just parked in the same spot?</p> <p>I have time before my super special campfire lesson with Eric, and I need to de-stress, so I pull on my knee brace, sports bra, running shorts, sneakers, and a T-shirt, and take off down the trails. I haven\u2019t tried running anywhere except for the big field yet and I should feel scared that I might trip on a tree root or a rock or something, but I don\u2019t. I hurl myself as fast as I can go. The speed keeps the pain away.</p><p>I jog for an hour\u2014for four miles, and by the time I slow down and rest my hands on my thighs, my knee is throbbing and I\u2019m panting, but somehow I feel better.</p><p>I pass by Matt\u2019s Bonzo Ball court and bend over to the spigot to slurp some water. When I look up, I find Andrea stalking toward me.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d she says with a shaking voice.</p><p>I wipe my mouth with my T-shirt. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were at Chili\u2019s last night with Matt.\u201d She bites her lips together.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say quietly. I ran for an hour to de-stress and now my heart is speeding right back up.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I liked him. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d go out with him, knowing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even talk to me last week except to yell at me or tell on me to Megan,\u201d I mumble. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019ll stay with you. He\u2019ll never get over her.\u201d</p><p>Andrea storms off toward Great Oak and I bend down to the spigot again, slapping water all over my face, trying to make myself look sweaty so no one will suspect I\u2019m crying, that I\u2019ve been crying all afternoon.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure which cabin I\u2019m staying in this week, so I grab a change of clothes from my car and head to the bathhouse over in Birdland. There, I stand under the hot water and try to clear my head. I pray to God, thanking him for my date last night. Deep down, I can\u2019t help but think what happened today is what I deserve.</p><p>But is Emily right?</p><p>If I\u2019m doing what the church and Bible and God tell me to do, then why am I so far gone in her eyes?</p> <p>It\u2019s time for me to meet Eric and Parker for extra training in starting fires (too bad they don\u2019t have flame throwers at camp). I get out of the shower and look in the mirror as I dry my red, puffy face.</p><p>What am I supposed to believe?</p><p>After the never-ending campfire training with Eric aka the Best Camper Ever, I stand waiting by the tree line. When Matt\u2019s Jeep pulls up, I see he\u2019s taken the doors off again.</p><p>He climbs out and I say, \u201cThat thing is a death trap.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cNice to see you too.\u201d He glances around, I guess to make sure we\u2019re alone, and presses a kiss on top of my head. \u201cI had fun last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I want to ask if we\u2019re dating now or what, but I\u2019m way nervous. We walk together to Great Oak not holding hands, but his hip bumps against mine. He glances over at me, a small smile on his face. Last night we couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other and now I have no idea what\u2019s next.</p><p>While waiting on the staff meeting to start, we sit together on the porch swing\u2014prime real estate. We\u2019re still not holding hands or anything. Our thighs aren\u2019t touching. It\u2019s hard to keep my breathing steady. I sneak a glance at Andrea\u2014her eyes and cheeks are red. She\u2019s been crying. I\u2019m pretty sure Matt notices because he keeps tapping his bare foot and biting his lip.</p><p>After the meeting, I approach Brad and ask him to walk with me. He runs a hand through his short brown hair, glancing over his shoulder. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Matt is watching me; I hold up my pointer finger, telling him I\u2019ll be a minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Brad asks when we\u2019re away from the group.</p><p>\u201cDid you stay here over the weekend?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He swallows and places a hand on my forearm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s wrong? Did you do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No! Of course not.\u201d He rubs a hand over his head again. Looks around. \u201cI can\u2019t go home, okay? My father and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pauses.</p><p>\u201cYour father...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>I furrow my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d Matt calls.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Brad says, sliding his hands into the pockets of his khaki shorts. His eyes are begging me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d I say. \u201cBut be more careful with your car. Park it in a different spot or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says, smiling meekly, and turns toward Treeland.</p><p>I head over to Matt. He wraps an arm around me and whispers in my ear. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy that,\u201d he replies, leaning his forehead against mine. \u201cWhat were you talking to Brad about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making sure he\u2019s okay. He seemed upset tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t notice \u2019cause I was too busy thinking about last night.\u201d</p><p>I smile, stretching my arms around his waist.</p><p>He says, \u201cWant to roast some marshmallows? I\u2019ll nick a bag from the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>I glance up to find Parker and Will grinning at us while the rest of the counselors are staring. In disbelief? Does wrapping his arm around me in front of people mean we\u2019re official?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Andrea mutters, loud enough for everybody to hear.</p><p>Ian gives her a nasty look before shooting me a look of sympathy. Then mischief breaks out on his face. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Matt and Kate! Woooo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my Lord,\u201d Matt says, shaking his head at Ian, who starts dancing a very inappropriate dance, grinding his hips in our direction.</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Carlie says, sticking out her tongue. \u201cI\u2019ve told you so many times that guys should never, ever grind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally agree,\u201d Parker says, disgusted. \u201cGuys\u2019 bodies are just not meant to work that way.\u201d Will starts moving his hips, which earns him a prompt slap on the chest from Parker.</p><p>Matt is cracking up, as Ian keeps right on doing strange things with his pelvis.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Andrea says.</p><p>\u201cUgh, indeed,\u201d Brad replies, making Andrea snort with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHow about we get those marshmallows now?\u201d I say to Matt.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d He takes my hand, leading me away from the group. I go quiet for a bit because I can\u2019t believe how rude Andrea acts sometimes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks when we\u2019re out of earshot. He rubs his thumb along the back of my hand.</p><p>I hold my chin up. \u201cUm, are you friends with Andrea? Or just acquaintances, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends, I guess.\u201d He drags a hand through his messy blond hair. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not nice to me, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to bring up how she said he\u2019d never get over her. Her meaning Sarah, I guess. It would be terrible dating a guy who doesn\u2019t completely want me. Wait. He hasn\u2019t even asked me out officially.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>The sun is setting into a gorgeous pink puddle in the sky, as Matt takes me by the shoulders and turns me to face him, his warm breath breezing across my face. He lightly touches my cheek. I get up on tiptoes and wrap my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to forget about it,\u201d Matt says. \u201cDid Andrea hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mad I went to Chili\u2019s with you. She must really be into ranch dressing,\u201d I say with a nervous laugh.</p><p>\u201cRanch is serious business.\u201d</p><p>I play with the hair at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her, okay?\u201d He hesitates before leaning in to kiss my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you. It\u2019s between me and Andrea.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the idea of anything being between him and Andrea. Not even friendship. \u201cHave you, um, ever been with her?\u201d</p><p>He shuts his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s tried to make out with me before, yeah, but it was nothing.\u201d He gently moves fingers up and down my arm. \u201cShe was a good friend after Sarah dumped me...I really needed someone to talk to, and she made me laugh and kept me company. We played a lot of Scrabble and did crossword puzzles together...And even though she didn\u2019t mean to start feeling this way, she ended up wanting a lot more from me. But I\u2019ve never felt anything special with her.\u201d</p><p>I nod, stepping closer, wrapping his T-shirt in my fist. No wonder she was crying. Something inside me breaks a little for her.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s marshmallow time.\u201d</p><p>Matt snags marshmallows and Crisco from the cafeteria and gets a fire blazing up at Redwood, the cabin out in the middle of nowhere. Flames burst into the air when he throws a glob of Crisco onto the wood. We jump back, laughing.</p><p>It\u2019s a gazillion degrees outside but we cuddle together next to the fire, spearing marshmallow after marshmallow with our skewers. He feeds me one and I feed him one, and we both gag. Turns out he likes his golden brown and raw on the inside, while I like mine gooey and burnt to bits.</p><p>\u201cI really like you,\u201d he whispers, bumping his knee against mine, staring at me. He leans over and gently kisses my lips.</p><p>\u201cI like you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny and you can paint a mean watercolor painting of apples in a barrel and you\u2019ve got a great body.\u201d</p><p>I accidentally snort and blush, and when I peek over at him, I begin to understand that he probably won\u2019t forget me, that he thinks there\u2019s something inside me worth knowing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking in my art closet, eh?\u201d I ask, thinking of my apples in a barrel painting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a little art gallery in there.\u201d</p><p>He picks a piece of gummy marshmallow off my lower lip, and my stomach flips.</p><p>A few minutes later, I yawn. He extinguishes the fire, and we go get our bags from our cars. I\u2019m staying in Pinecone cabin this week, in Treeland, so I say good night and start to head that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He takes my hand, looking around. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come sleep in Dogwood with all of us tonight?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIs it Andrea? Don\u2019t worry about her. She\u2019ll get over it. Maybe Bumblebee Brad will strike her fancy.\u201d</p><p>I giggle nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s not Andrea...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d He kisses my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right for guys and girls to share a bed before marriage,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>Will and Parker walk past, carrying their sleeping bags. Will is moving his hips like Ian did earlier and she is laughing hysterically, trying to sidestep her boyfriend and his grinding.</p><p>\u201cThey shared a bed last week,\u201d Matt says.</p><p>\u201cSo? We\u2019ve been on one date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA great date.\u201d He grins down at me and wraps his arms around my waist. \u201cThe best date ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because you beat me at Skee-Ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd basketball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to rub it in, eh?\u201d I say with a grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Matt says, pressing his forehead to mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep in Dogwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I reply, sighing a little. But what if he goes to sleep in Dogwood with everybody else? Andrea\u2019s in there...</p> <p>\u201cWant to go running in the morning?\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though my knee is sore. Matt grabs my bedding and suitcase and leads me to Pinecone, where we share a long, passionate kiss good night on the porch. I make my bed and unpack my clothes. I read from the Bible and pray for Brad and his father and whatever\u2019s going on there, then spend some time sketching and studying my work.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, a knock sounds on the door and I shove my sketchbook under my covers. I look up to see Matt standing outside.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asks.</p><p>My heart goes wild. Does he want to make out or something? If I let that start, will he want to spend the night? Will he want to sleep in my bed like Will sleeps in Parker\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll just take a second,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Matt walks in, and like last Sunday night, he drags a bed from inside onto the porch. I watch through the screen as he unrolls his sleeping bag and crawls inside.</p> <p>\u201cGood night, King Crab Kate,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d I say, laughing. I turn out the light and lie down. I focus on the gap between us, wanting to fill the space between. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams,\u201d I say, and face the opposite wall so I won\u2019t give in and invite him inside.</p><p>I flip my pillow over to the cool side.</p><p>Monday morning, after a run with Matt and after my new group of campers have arrived, I spend my break praying in the Woodsong Chapel. I kneel down in front of a splintered log serving as an altar and bow my head, trying to forget about what happened yesterday with Emily, but it recycles over and over in my mind. Minutes later I hear pine needles and sticks crunching beneath feet. I glance up to find Brad making his way down the path.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p><p>He nods back at me and kneels a few feet away. What\u2019s he praying for? I say a prayer for him, and then go back to thanking God for my date with Matt and asking God for forgiveness for helping Emily. When I\u2019m finished, I stand carefully, so I don\u2019t mangle my knee. Brad stands too and gives me a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere you off to?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cArt pavilion. I\u2019ve got a group coming in a few minutes.\u201d We hike up the trail together and I reach out to drag my fingers across pine needles dripping from trees.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Matt, huh?\u201d He grins, slipping his hands in his pockets.</p><p>My face blushes and I grin back at him, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cI so called it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He digs his hands further down into his pockets. \u201cNah...\u201d</p><p>I furrow my eyebrows. Brad is cute, sweet, and nice. Granted, I don\u2019t feel a strong pull to him like I do with Matt, but I am sure plenty of girls could feel like that toward him.</p><p>\u201cI want to get out of here after this summer,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019d be hard if I had someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to get away from? Why did you mention your dad yesterday?\u201d</p><p>He runs a hand over his head and focuses on his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and him. He drinks...he\u2019s gotten worse ever since Mom left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom left?\u201d I exclaim. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause Dad is a nasty drunk, that\u2019s why.\u201d His eyes shift to his upper arm, where I saw the bruises last week.</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure, don\u2019t care,\u201d Brad says quietly. \u201cShe left before Christmas. She missed my graduation.\u201d His voice is soft.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine my parents missing my graduation. They\u2019d buy a bong before that would happen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you stayed here last weekend?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to live anywhere else but at camp this summer. I need to save my money so I can leave...I want to take my road trip and get a job at a park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your dad hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He touches his bruised bicep. \u201cThat\u2019s not what scares me,\u201d he whispers, staring off into the trees. A bird chirps above us. \u201cI\u2019m scared that\u201d\u2014he pauses to take a breath\u2014\u201cIf I stay, I\u2019ll end up like him. And my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>He looks over at me, his eyes begging me not to tell.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Megan? She got you this job, right? She might understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>He quickly shakes his head. \u201cYou know how strict she is. And I don\u2019t want my church involved. It\u2019ll just piss Dad off more.\u201d</p><p>If I keep this a secret and Megan finds out, Brad would get fired. If she finds out I knew, I\u2019d get fired too, and my church and parents would be disappointed in me for lying. Can something like this stay a secret for five weeks?</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to invite him to live with us, but Mom and Daddy would get all nosy and try to fix the situation between Brad and his dad, and it seems like Brad wants to leave.</p><p>\u201cCan you do a better job of hiding your car?\u201d I tell Brad.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He squeezes my shoulder. \u201cHey, I\u2019m glad about you and Matt. You deserve it. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>A good person.</p><p>I shut my eyes, smiling a sad smile. Should a good person lie?</p><p>I trudge over to the art pavilion and start pulling out paint brushes and paper for my lesson, but I can\u2019t stop thinking of Brad and how\u2019s he\u2019s a good Christian, but he\u2019s willing to break a big rule like this. It\u2019s a good rule. If Brad got hurt bad on a weekend, nobody would discover him until Sunday night.</p><p>I\u2019ve always heard that saying, \u201cSome rules are meant to be broken,\u201d but no one ever says that even if the rule is meant to be broken, usually something bad happens when you break it.</p><p>Brad needs more help than just me covering for him.</p><p>He needs a real family and friends and love.</p><p>But I guess not all of us get that.</p><p>Sometimes we get a mess. Like Emily did. And then you have to work past that or drown where you stand.</p><p>Before Tuesday Talent Night, Matt takes my elbow and pulls me behind Great Oak. I tiptoe around the bushes, in case of poison ivy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to start the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201d</p><p>Sticks snap under my feet as he shoves me up against the wooden wall and presses his mouth to mine. Kissing me hard and fast. My skin prickles. I\u2019m panting. He pulls my hips against his.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Megan hears us?\u201d I ask. Her office is on the other side of this wall.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you just can\u2019t wait,\u201d he says between kisses. \u201cLike at Just Tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a taco,\u201d I reply, playfully pushing him.</p><p>\u201cYummy,\u201d he says against my lips. I run my fingers underneath the hemp necklace I made for him, caressing his collarbone.</p><p>I can hear Ian and two campers practicing Madonna\u2019s \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d for tonight. And apparently he enlisted Will for some additional harmonies.</p><p>I gently nudge Matt away. \u201cTo be continued?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d He grins and sneaks another kiss. \u201cBy the way, will you be my date to the dance on Thursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say with a smile, and kiss him again.</p><p>After the girls are in bed that night, I climb the hill to the cafeteria. It\u2019s the only place besides Megan\u2019s office with a phone. And it\u2019s a pay phone, at that. I drop two quarters into it and dial Emily\u2019s cell number.</p><p>She picks up on the second ring. \u201cHello?\u201d She sounds confused. Probably has no idea whose this number is.</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>I hear a click. And then a dial tone fills my ear. And then a voice comes on, saying that if I\u2019d like to make another call, I have to deposit more change.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the noises. I hang up the phone and sneak around the side of the building. So Matt was right about Ian and Carlie doing it behind the cafeteria. Ew. I hustle away, cringing.</p><p>At midnight I sit on my porch and open my sketchbook to start writing her a letter, trying to explain what I feel. She hung up on me. She kicked me out. Why can\u2019t she understand I only want her to pray with me? I wipe a tear away with the heel of my hand.</p><p>When I had surgery, Emily sat in the waiting room the entire time. Afterward, she drove home with me and my parents and curled up in my bed with me. She poured my favorite candy, Milk Duds, into my palm. For days she kept my water glass full and read aloud from trashy Hollywood magazines and told me how, at school, Will Whitfield had asked how I was doing. She played P!nk songs as we lay in bed, singing so loud Daddy told us to shush because Fritz kept howling along.</p><p>I tear the sheet of paper out of my sketchbook and crumple the letter in my fist.</p><p>Why say anything if the person you\u2019re talking to doesn\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying?</p><p>Is our friendship over for good?</p><p>\u201cThis is inhumane.\u201d</p><p>Parker has said that, like, eighty gazillion times, but after she didn\u2019t show up for the Critter Crawl last week, Megan warned her that if she skipped it again, her pay would be docked.</p><p>Therefore, while the rest of us counselors are grappling with the campers, Parker is standing with her arms crossed. Glaring.</p><p>\u201cDude, your girlfriend looks pissed,\u201d Ian mutters to Will.</p><p>One of my boy campers waves a glass jar containing a gigantic spider.</p><p>\u201cThat poor animal,\u201d Parker says. \u201cHe might never see his family again.\u201d</p><p>Ian is in charge of the Thursday afternoon Critter Crawl, so he takes a stick and draws a big ring in the dirt road. Then he makes a smaller circle inside it. At the same time, Megan walks over to Parker. And even though Megan\u2019s talking quietly, I can tell by Parker\u2019s expression that she\u2019s done something wrong.</p><p>Will nudges Ian, pointing at Megan. Ian rolls his eyes and turns his back so the kids can\u2019t see, and makes a jerking-off motion with his hand. The guys speak quietly to each other, then start laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAttention, Critter Crawl participants, attention,\u201d Ian yells, sounding like an announcer in a boxing ring. \u201cThe first critter to make it out of the ring will win eternal glory!\u201d</p><p>The campers roar and jump up and down, hollering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down,\u201d Matt tells a girl carrying a plastic cup, her hand covering the top so her butterfly won\u2019t get free.</p><p>She makes a face at Matt. \u201cI beat you so bad last year, King.\u201d</p> <p>Ian says, \u201cTeam Sparrow\u2019s lizard and Team Dogwood\u2019s cockroach, please come forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cockroach\u2019s name is Harry!\u201d a kid says.</p><p>\u201cYou let your kids capture a cockroach?\u201d Andrea blurts at Eric, who shrugs and keeps on whittling a stick.</p><p>Ian goes on, \u201cThere\u2019s been a last minute change to the Critter Crawl roster. The lizard and Harry have been disqualified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d yells a boy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoooooo,\u201d another boy screams, raising fists in the air.</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds are they disqualified?\u201d Megan asks, rushing forward to inspect the critters in their glass jars.</p><p>I bite down on my thumb, trying not to laugh. These kids are acting like it\u2019s Armageddon. I walk over to Parker. She runs a hand through her plaited hair, staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cFine. If I didn\u2019t need the money so bad, I\u2019d be so out of here...\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cNever fear!\u201d Ian calls out to the hundred campers surrounding the circle. \u201cWe have two new contestants!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA snake?\u201d a boy asks, causing all the girls to start screaming and running around. Megan looks like she might murder Ian.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s even better than a snake,\u201d Ian replies. Will and Ian bump fists, and Ian comes running at me. He throws me over his shoulder and runs around in front of the campers. Will does the same thing to Parker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Critter Kate!\u201d Ian shouts.</p><p>I pound on Ian\u2019s back, yelling, \u201cPut me down! Maattttt!\u201d</p><p>When Ian swings me around, I find Matt cracking up, and even Megan and Eric are laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so breaking up with you,\u201d an upside-down Parker says to Will.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on a ride at the fair,\u201d I say, woozy. \u201cI might throw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Ian says, plopping me down in the center of the ring.</p> <p>Parker slaps Will when he lets her down, and then she goes and slaps Ian, and then she slaps Matt, I guess for good measure.</p><p>Ian claps his hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s Critter Crawl time. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble!\u201d</p><p>The sun begins to set as the campers cheer for their critters. I catch my breath, sitting off to the side with Parker, watching Matt root for his team\u2019s beetle, feeling a bit of heaven inside me.</p><p>After the race is over (Harry the cockroach lost to Team Bluebird\u2019s granddaddy longlegs), I walk with Ian to let the critters go free. He has four glass jars in his hands.</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of you to take the attention off Parker,\u201d I tell him, as I release the lizard back into the woods. He scurries away.</p><p>Ian squats and places the jars at his feet. \u201cMegan needs to get laid. She\u2019s so crotchety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlie said the same thing,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think she and I share the same brain,\u201d Ian replies with a small grin, which quickly disappears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and Matt going out now?\u201d he asks. He opens a glass jar and coaxes the beetle out.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut you want to be, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He screws the lid back on the jar. Stares at it. \u201cMaybe seeing you with Matt will make Carlie want to try it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot officially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you guys, um, are like, behind the cafeteria all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody knows about that.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, his eyebrows pinching together. I squat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cSo Carlie doesn\u2019t want to date?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Ian releases a granddaddy longlegs, thinking. \u201cWe went to the same high school and church, but different colleges. I hadn\u2019t seen her in over a year until we got jobs here last summer...\u201d He glances at me. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cLast summer I told her I wanted a relationship, but she didn\u2019t want that with anybody, you know, right in the middle of college and all. I guess she doesn\u2019t want to get tied down. I was hoping she might want to try for real this summer...but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>He looks up at my face. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pressure her. I\u2019d rather it just happen naturally if it\u2019s going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, why are you sleeping with her if it\u2019s not serious?\u201d</p><p>He laughs a little, seeming even sadder. \u201cI just can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d He stands, wipes off his hands, and grabs the jars, motioning toward the cafeteria. \u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We walk together back up the hill. \u201cThanks for listening,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying about it...but sometimes it\u2019s good to say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. If I said what I helped Emily to do out loud, would it change things? Make me feel better?</p><p>I don\u2019t see how it could.</p><p>sketch #361</p><p>what happened last night</p><p>The campers are showering and getting ready for the dance, so I grab my portfolio and a pencil.</p><p>Last night, Eric made me start the fire and get the hobo packs going all by myself. He basically ignored me while he played with fishing lures. I had no Crisco and no starter log and no hope.</p><p>I sketch the patch of kindling I stuffed under the logs. Bits of hay and grass.</p><p>I used a match to get it going. My flame went out three times, but I kept trying and finally, on the fourth try, the kindling got hot enough to catch a few sticks on fire. From there, the logs didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Eric said to me, smiling, and went back to his tackle box. I grinned to myself and told each camper to tear off a piece of aluminum foil.</p><p>\u201cWrap it like a burrito!\u201d I told them.</p><p>I smile to myself as I draw the scene: a fire blazing next to a bunch of campers stuffing their faces.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly time for the Thursday Night Dance. I hide my sketchbook under my pillow and use the rest of my time to pray, to say thanks for helping me start my fire.</p><p>nothing\u2019s set in stone</p><p>saturday, june 16 ~ week 3 of 7</p><p>I\u2019m making cheese and crackers when Daddy comes into the kitchen and tells me to meet him in his study to discuss college courses.</p><p>I carry my snack down the hall and step over Fritz, who\u2019s napping in the entryway, and take a seat in a stiff armchair. Mom redecorated this room in January, so the cushion isn\u2019t worn-in yet. Not like Daddy\u2019s chair. I swear, the thing must be from 1965. Mom hates it. It\u2019s orange, has multiple ink and coffee stains, and a big rip runs down the back of the upholstery. But she lets him keep it \u2019cause she loves him.</p><p>Pictures of me, Mom, Fritz, and Daddy\u2019s hunting escapades fill the bookshelves and walls. Every other space is filled by dusty plants and gigantic law texts.</p><p>Daddy steps over the dog, carrying the Belmont registration booklet and an ice cream sundae covered with chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, peanuts, and cherries.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to eat that,\u201d I warn.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, smiling as he flops down in his orange chair. \u201cBut you only live once.\u201d He crosses his leg and jiggles his loafer. \u201cSo which classes have you picked out?\u201d</p><p>I pull a deep breath. \u201cNone. I have no idea what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the pre-law track we talked about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just sounds...boring to me.\u201d</p><p>He scoops some ice cream into his mouth. \u201cIs that your way of saying you think I\u2019m boring?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m just not sure what I want to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I supposed to pick out a major before I start school?\u201d I bite into my cheese.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d he starts. He stops to take another bite of ice cream. I give him a look and mutter \u201cblood pressure\u201d before he speaks again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know right now. You can change your mind about what you want to do two years into college. Or after college. You could go back and study something else if you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>I tap my sandals on the floor. \u201cI love art, but I\u2019m not sure I want to do it as a career. It\u2019s just something for me.\u201d</p><p>Daddy nods. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we pick out a bunch of random classes and talk again after next semester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a waste of your money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning is never a bad thing. And neither is changing your mind about things...It\u2019s always good to reevaluate. To think and consider all sides.\u201d</p><p>I bite into a cracker and stare out the window. I don\u2019t like that Matt\u2019s in a frat. I don\u2019t like how Emily\u2019s been treating me. I don\u2019t see how I could ever change my mind about those things. But at the same time, I love everything else about Matt. I love that he wants to run a marathon barefoot and I love that he can\u2019t seem to get enough ranch dressing. I like how he touches my jaw and stares deep into my eyes, like I\u2019m the only girl he\u2019s ever seen.</p><p>He drinks beer and I know he wouldn\u2019t mind sharing a bed with me.</p><p>But this week, when I asked him if he believes in God, he said, \u201cWhat a silly question. Just look at that.\u201d He turned me to face the sun setting above the rolling hills beyond camp.</p><p>If I were to ditch Matt and wait for a guy who\u2019s 100 percent devout, I might end up with a guy who doesn\u2019t stare at me like I\u2019m the only girl he\u2019s ever seen.</p><p>But living with an ugly orange chair is a lot different than putting up with a fraternity.</p><p>\u201cCan we wait to register for classes?\u201d I ask. \u201cI need more time.\u201d</p><p>Daddy smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s hold off for another week or two, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d he says, and I nod. \u201cCan you tell me what happened with Emily? Why you\u2019ve been so out of it?\u201d</p><p>Care fills his voice. I don\u2019t want to lie to him. \u201cWe had an argument about church and God.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. Takes another bite of ice cream. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe in God anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Daddy leans onto his armrest, propping his jaw up with a fist. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I believe. What matters is what you believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in God. He loves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Emily doesn\u2019t believe that anymore...but she\u2019s still your friend.\u201d</p><p>I slowly shrug and stare down at the plate in my lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour truth isn\u2019t everybody else\u2019s truth.

Fritz wakes up and drags himself across the room and plops down at my feet. I pat his head.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on with this boy,\u201d Daddy says, smiling coyly. He scrapes the bottom of his bowl. \u201cMatt.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lower lip, smiling. \u201cI like him. He invited me to dinner tonight to meet his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I can tell he\u2019s something you\u2019re serious about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes you smile when not much does anymore. Even drawing doesn\u2019t make you smile like that.\u201d</p><p>My face grows hot.</p><p>\u201cIs he treating you right?\u201d Daddy asks, looking down at the dog.</p><p>I clear my throat, thinking of how many times we kissed in the past week. I lost count after fifty. \u201cEverything\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>We sit in silence for a few moments. Something is nagging at me, and I just have to ask. \u201cI care what you believe,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cWhen I asked if you believed in God a few minutes ago, you looked away.\u201d</p> <p>He leans back in his chair, shaking his loafer. Our eyes meet, but he says nothing.</p><p>I ask, \u201cWhy did you always make me go to church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made you go to church, Kate. Never. You\u2019ve always enjoyed it...up until Emily left. I know you\u2019ve been upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t really believe?\u201d</p><p>He sets his bowl on the coffee table and leans over onto his thighs, peering up at me. \u201cI\u2019ve thought for years about this, Kate. I just don\u2019t know. Part of me believes that a higher being created evolution.\u201d</p><p>My chest burns. Is he saying he doesn\u2019t believe in God?</p><p>Has he just been going through the motions all this time?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you go to church?\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI have friends there. It makes your mother happy. I like organ music.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you pray?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everybody pray sometime?\u201d</p><p>He is fifty-two years old and still hasn\u2019t figured this out. He\u2019s right that my beliefs matter.</p><p>But why does no one else seem to share them anymore?</p><p>Matt ushers me through his back door and we climb a short flight of steps to enter a madhouse.</p><p>His mom, a thin woman with bags under her eyes, is trying to make room on the table for dinner. She removes a tutu from the table and replaces it with a whole chicken.</p><p>\u201cJere,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the tenth time, put away your tennis racquet. Please.\u201d</p><p>A cute boy about my age doesn\u2019t stop looking at his phone as he yanks the racquet off the table and stashes it under his chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want lima beans!\u201d a girl yells. This must be his littlest sister, Jenn. I remember Matt saying she\u2019s six, about to turn seven in August.</p><p>\u201cBut beans are yummy,\u201d Matt says, sweeping her up in his arms and kissing her cheek. He gives her a raspberry, blowing air against her face, and she\u2019s giggling and squirming. \u201cJenn, I want you to meet someone special, okay?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Matt\u2019s mom and Jeremiah look up and see me. His mom pushes her damp blond hair off her forehead and wipes her hands on a dishtowel before coming to shake mine.</p><p>\u201cMom, this is Kate. Kate, this is my mother.\u201d</p><p>She pats my shoulder and beams at Matt.</p><p>Jeremiah manages to put his phone down for approximately five seconds to say hi to me, but then goes right back to texting. Then Mr. Brown comes into the kitchen and moves a bunch of schoolbooks so his wife can set the bread and water on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to meet you,\u201d he tells me, pushing his glasses up on his nose.</p><p>Mom would have a heart attack if she were to see their kitchen. Every visible surface is covered by toys, newspapers, and kitchen appliances. Why is an umbrella on top of the fridge? Why is a sock hanging from the ceiling fan? I don\u2019t think the room has been redecorated in years, judging by the faded blue-and-yellow-flowered wallpaper. But I love it. It\u2019s cozy and homey.</p><p>Matt wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me closer. Jeremiah watches Matt holding me and raises his eyebrows, then goes back to texting. That\u2019s when five girls strut into the kitchen. One of them must be his sister, Lacey, who\u2019s twelve.</p><p>I figure out which one she is pretty quickly because she pinches Matt\u2019s arm and says, \u201cYou brought a girl home!\u201d Then proceeds to tease Matt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous \u2019cause Dad won\u2019t let you date,\u201d Matt says to Lacey, and she scowls.</p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019re ninety,\u201d Mr. Brown says, placing a roll of paper towels in the middle of the table.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d want to date me then?\u201d Lacey asks, plopping down in a chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be all wrinkly. Gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad says I can date when I\u2019m sixteen,\u201d one of Lacey\u2019s friends says, looking pointedly at Jeremiah, who keeps right on texting.</p><p>Matt whispers in my ear. \u201cSlumber parties freak me out. Last time she had one they played Truth or Dare and someone got dared to launch an Apple Pie Water Gun Kissing Attack at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He shudders. I laugh softly, and he kneads my lower back.</p><p>I catch his mom and dad watching us. They share a meaningful glance before focusing on dinner again.</p><p>\u201cKate, Kate,\u201d Jenn says, patting the table. \u201cSit by me.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice nearly every seat is filled. \u201cOh, um, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>His parents\u2019 heads pop up. I watch them count the chairs.</p><p>\u201cOne second,\u201d Mr. Brown says. He comes back and squeezes an eleventh chair in for me. He moves a pile of Barbies and a pair of shin guards so I can sit down between Jenn and Matt.</p><p>Holding hands, we say grace, and I\u2019m grinning as Matt rubs his fingers back and forth across mine.</p><p>After dinner, Matt and I grab a seat on the couch in the basement. Finally alone.</p><p>Our mouths move together slowly, grazing, testing. He massages the inside of my thigh.</p><p>While he was in the bathroom, I studied the pictures sitting on top of the grand piano in the living room. I was learning the faces of several generations of Matt\u2019s family when his brother came up behind me.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Jeremiah said quietly, as he texted on his phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brother. You\u2019re not messing with him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the last thing I\u2019d ever do.\u201d</p><p>He peeked up from his phone, smiling slightly. \u201cGood. So do you have any sisters? Or cousins?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and that\u2019s when Matt appeared and gave me a piggyback ride down to the basement.</p><p>\u201cI love your family,\u201d I tell Matt, leaning over to press my lips to his.</p><p>\u201cI love them too,\u201d he says back. \u201cBut let\u2019s not talk about them right now.\u201d</p><p>I dip my head and our lips meet again. I can feel him smiling against my teeth.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jenn comes running down the stairs, screaming at the top of her lungs. She\u2019s wearing Little Mermaid pajamas that look so comfortable. Matt breaks away from me as his little sister launches herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cAttack of the killer Jenn!\u201d he says, tickling her. She escapes, but he chases her until she falls onto the floor. She howls and laughs and kicks at him as he tickles her. I\u2019m getting exhausted just watching them play together, but I love that they have a connection. It makes me happy that she invited me to sit next to her at dinner.</p><p>When the Great Tickle Fest is over, he drags himself up onto the couch. Jenn climbs onto Matt\u2019s lap and squeezes his nose. He stares back at her and that\u2019s when I notice their eyes are an identical grayish blue, the color of Normandy Lake. If I ever have a little girl, I want her to sit on my lap and love me like that.</p><p>Was Emily\u2019s baby a little boy or a little girl? Would she have had Emily\u2019s straight auburn hair and green eyes? I find myself reaching out and touching Jenn\u2019s elbow, to feel the skin, the reality.</p><p>\u201cJenn,\u201d Mrs. Brown calls from upstairs. \u201cTime for sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jenn\u2019s bottom lip begins to quiver and Matt wraps her up in a hug and kisses her cheek. \u201cNo tears,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you first thing in the morning. You\u2019ll wake me up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she replies, bopping his nose with a finger.</p><p>\u201cGood. How would I ever wake up without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alarm clock, silly,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOhhh. Right. An alarm clock.\u201d He knocks himself in the forehead, and she giggles again.</p><p>I smile at them.</p><p>\u201cJenn!\u201d Mrs. Brown yells. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Munchkin,\u201d Matt says. His sister jumps off his lap and runs up the stairs.</p><p>I clear my throat and will my tears to dry up. Matt weaves his fingers with mine and we watch TV together, and I want nothing more than to be here with him in the now, but I can\u2019t stop thinking. If I hadn\u2019t agreed to take Emily to the clinic, she would\u2019ve found another way there. If I had done that, would I feel so guilty now? Would I feel guilty just because I know what happened? Maybe if I hadn\u2019t gone, Emily would\u2019ve realized I didn\u2019t support her whatsoever and would\u2019ve come home and decided to keep the baby. Maybe by being there, I somehow validated her decision. Or maybe Emily would have felt abandoned and refused to talk to me after the abortion and sunk into depression and who knows what.</p><p>And now my own father questions the existence of God? I don\u2019t know what to make of that.</p><p>I touch my cheek and focus on my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Matt whispers, taking in my face.</p><p>I lean my head against his shoulder. I can\u2019t tell him what I\u2019ve done. What kind of person I really am. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit down, is all.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand and kisses my hair. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Just be with me, I want to say. But I\u2019m not ready to let on how much he means to me yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean that day at camp?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhen you told me I saved you?\u201d</p><p>He leans his head back against the sofa and pulls me against his chest. \u201cMom was pregnant with Jenn when I met you. And Jeremiah was ten and wouldn\u2019t stop trying to set things on fire, and Leigh was seventeen and wouldn\u2019t stop asking Mom and Dad for a new car...Lacey was five and threw temper tantrums that would scare the devil...Dad worked all the time, teaching drivers\u2019 ed on weekends to earn us extra money. Mom was busy with church and my brother and sisters, and I wanted to make things easy for her, so I kept my head down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally lonely. And I didn\u2019t get along with anybody at school really. I wasn\u2019t very popular and no one cared about my music. No one read books as much as I did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I press my face against his chest, and he tucks my head under his chin, holding me tighter. \u201cI know what you mean,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cKids at school were picking on me about my clothes from yard sales and my songwriting. I didn\u2019t want to give up my music but people kept making fun of me. And I didn\u2019t know what to do...but that week at camp, you wanted to hear my music.\u201d</p><p>I smile and shut my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Jenn was born and I was the only one who could get her to stop crying,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she made me feel good again. I figured if Jenn liked me...and you liked me, I could like me too...So I started living for me. I joined the track team because I love running, and I kept writing music. And then in high school, I started making friends who liked the same stuff I do.\u201d</p> <p>But what if I would rather have a relationship with God than friendships with people who don\u2019t believe in him like I do?</p><p>Why is it cool for some people to do what they want to do, but uncool for others? Why is being on the football team considered cool while being on the math team is not?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy you figured that out about yourself,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He holds me closer. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I met you.\u201d His voice is filled with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be where I am today,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>We kiss gently, a fire blazing in my lips as I try to keep this slow and steady.</p> <p>That\u2019s when his sister, Lacey, appears in the basement with her friends, and they take one look at me and Matt cuddling and start going, \u201cWoooo!\u201d</p><p>He grins and blushes, and his mouth gently touches my earlobe. \u201cWe\u2019d better escape before an Apple Pie Water Gun Attack happens. Want to see my room?\u201d</p><p>Deep inside I know it\u2019s not right but I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather do than see his room. Smell its smells. See if he puts his clothes in a laundry basket or leaves them scattered across the rug. Sit on his bed and hold his hand and be closer to him than to anyone else.</p><p>I nod slowly, and we make our way past the five giggling girls throwing popcorn at each other and climb three flights of stairs to reach the attic area. His door opens to reveal T-shirts and boxer shorts draped everywhere, dirty dishes sitting on the dressers and end tables, and Jeremiah lounging on one of the two twin beds with a car magazine in one hand and a cell phone in the other.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Matt says to Jeremiah, who gives us a knowing smile.</p><p>He points at Matt with his cell phone. \u201cAnnabelle\u2019s coming over tomorrow after church. I expect reciprocity.\u201d He tosses his magazine on his bed, stands, and struts out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cReciprocity?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cJere likes big words...So, this is where it all happens,\u201d Matt tells me, flopping down on his twin bed. He knocks a pile of clothes onto the rug and pats his blue-striped comforter, indicating I should sit with him. I weave around teetering piles of books to join him.</p><p>\u201cAll what happens?\u201d I ask, pulling my knees to my chest. \u201cDo you have girls over a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He gives me a mischievous grin. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a girl here since high school. Since Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you really close?\u201d I glance around at the posters of women and cars on the walls.</p><p>\u201cWe never had sex, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d Matt says quietly, falling backward onto his pillow.</p><p>Is he a virgin? Did they really date for three years and manage not to have sex? Hearing that makes me really happy.</p><p>\u201cNah, I wasn\u2019t wondering that,\u201d I reply, even though I was. This relationship (or whatever we are) will never work if we aren\u2019t truthful. I inhale deeply through my nose. \u201cOkay, so I was wondering that.\u201d</p> <p>Matt chuckles. \u201cI know. I can see right through you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say in a sarcastic voice, laughing. I\u2019m shaking as I lie down next to him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see through me too?\u201d</p><p>I tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cSorta...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you can\u2019t see through me, here you go. I want you bad. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re laughing as we stretch out on his bed. His hands are in my hair and I play with his T-shirt. He positions himself between my legs as we make out. All I can think about is how I want to press my chest to his, my skin to his skin.</p><p>Then the door opens.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d his dad exclaims.</p><p>Matt suddenly rolls off me. \u201cDad! Why didn\u2019t you knock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, son,\u201d Mr. Brown says, grinning. \u201cYour mom sent me up here to make sure your brother didn\u2019t have any girls in your room.\u201d The door clicks shut.</p><p>\u201cThat was so mortifying,\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cAt least we have our clothes on.\u201d He chuckles, pressing his forehead to mine. \u201cOne time Mom caught Jeremiah and some girl completely\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock sounds on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Matt yells, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cYour father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you mow the lawn tomorrow after church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaaaaaaaad.\u201d Matt\u2019s shaking his head and laughing. My mouth has dropped open. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have waited until after Kate goes home to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to forget,\u201d Mr. Brown says from behind the door.</p><p>Matt whispers to me, \u201cThis is his way of saying we shouldn\u2019t be in here alone together.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Matt yells to his dad, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll mow the lawn. Now go away.\u201d</p><p>I smack his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Matt asks, clutching my hands so I can\u2019t hit him again.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t treat your dad that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Mr. Brown says from out in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDaaaaadd, stop eavesdropping!\u201d Matt jumps to his feet and grabs his keys from the nightstand. \u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m taking you home. We\u2019ll never find any peace around here.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop laughing.</p><p>I get Emily\u2019s voicemail. Again.</p><p>\u201cHey, um,\u201d I say into the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Again. I\u2019m just calling to say that I miss you. Call me or my mom if you need anything. Really\u2014anything. Okay, well, bye.\u201d</p><p>I push the end call button.</p><p>On Sunday evening, everyone\u2019s heading for Dogwood, and I suck in a breath when Matt sweeps me into his arms. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll ask me to sleep in there with the other guy counselors.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll say yes.</p><p>\u201cI got a surprise for you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He leads me out into the big field where we do field games, where he and I run every morning. The stars shine brightly on the patch of grass where he\u2019s set up a campfire and has stretched the giant parachute across the grass. Two thin mattresses and our sleeping bags rest on top of the parachute.</p><p>\u201cThought we could sleep out here tonight,\u201d he says, squeezing my hand.</p><p>The air is warm and just right for camping. Our mattresses are about ten feet apart. I glance over at him. I want to lie close enough to whisper to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can move your mattress closer to mine if you want.\u201d</p><p>His face reddens, and he smiles. We move our mattresses, so near they are kissing, but I decide to lie down with him on his, and his hands are shaking and mine are shaking but we\u2019re laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully presumptuous,\u201d he says, as I cuddle up next to him under a sheet he brought. It smells clean and crisp and feels cool against my skin. I twine my feet with his; his blue hospital scrubs tickle my legs.</p><p>We begin kissing gently. More slowly than we did last night in his bed. He keeps touching my face and my hair and I find myself wanting to get as close to him as possible. I press my chest to his and kiss him harder.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d he mumbles, pulling away, our sheet tangling around his body. He rolls onto his back and brushes the hair out of his eyes, staring at the sky.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...It\u2019s just, what are we?\u201d He looks over at me.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we, like, together? Or dating casually? Or what?\u201d</p><p>A lump fills my throat. \u201cUm, what do you think we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t just a casual thing for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d I blurt. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and props himself up on an elbow to stare down at me. \u201cYou want to keep me around for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He drums his fingers on my rib cage. It tickles. \u201cAre we giving a relationship a try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>He grins. \u201cOkay, now that that\u2019s settled, I can permit you to have your way with me.\u201d</p><p>I flick his forehead. \u201cOh, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, whatever?\u201d He starts tickling me and I squirm around. \u201cOh, whatever? You were the one all pushing up against me a couple minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d I say, pulling him in. He touches my bare stomach as we kiss. His fingers inch higher and higher until they reach my bra. I\u2019m about to shove him away from me, but his blue eyes catch mine, and they are so warm and tender, and I just want us to be happy and close as can be.</p><p>He brushes his fingers across my breast and pushes my shirt up. Matt focuses on the little white bow between my breasts, taking it between his fingers. Then he\u2019s kissing me through my bra. He shrugs out of his T-shirt, pulling it over his head in one motion, and I can\u2019t stop touching his strong, smooth chest, and then we\u2019re moving in tune with each other. He presses himself against my cotton shorts.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel nice?\u201d he whispers, rocking his hips against mine.</p><p>I can barely nod because it\u2019s like every nerve ending in my body is primed to explode. And then they do and I feel like I\u2019m falling away and I\u2019m shuddering and gasping for breath.</p><p>We cuddle in silence until he falls asleep next to me, his warm breath tickling my neck as he snores softly.</p><p>The stars above me are blurry because my eyes are watering.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what makes me feel more guilty: that I love how he touched me when I should hate it, when I should have pushed him away, or how I couldn\u2019t hear God\u2019s warnings because of the way Matt made me feel.</p><p>sketch #362</p><p>what happened on june 19</p><p>I\u2019ve always worked hard to control my temper.</p><p>I\u2019m sketching a picture of every happy thing I can think of. Fudge, sunshine, kittens.</p><p>Grandpa Kelly always says, \u201cNever let anyone see your weak point. It\u2019s the opening they\u2019re looking for, to do more damage.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do during lunch: Not get angry in front of Megan or any of the other counselors. Earlier today, she humiliated me.</p><p>\u201cIs this really an art project?\u201d she had asked in front of fifty campers, staring at my decoupaged Coke bottle.</p><p>\u201cI like the footballs!\u201d shouted Liam, an eight-year-old.</p><p>\u201cArt is about expressing yourself in whatever way you want,\u201d I told Megan, digging my thumbnail into my hand. \u201cSelf-expression is an important thing to teach the kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut this,\u201d she said, holding up my Coke bottle, \u201cis not something kids can take home to their mothers as a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that since I\u2019m the arts and crafts director, I get to choose the program. I don\u2019t believe in censorship when it comes to art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the regional conference would be happier if kids could bring home presents to their moms. Why don\u2019t you make more candles or something?\u201d She gave my boxes of junk a junky look and left the pavilion.</p><p>A little girl looked up at me, holding a baby food jar that she was covering with flowers. \u201cIs this not really art?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think it\u2019s art, it\u2019s art,\u201d I replied, and breathed in deeply through my nose, trying not to shake.</p><p>Here in the now, I keep drawing suns and pinwheels and waves.</p><p>falling</p><p>wednesday, june 20 ~ week 3 of 7</p><p>I overdid it on my morning jog with Matt. With his help, I can run four miles again, but I don\u2019t think my knee is cut out for long-distance running anymore, and that makes me want to cry.</p> <p>In high school, if I ever felt down about something, I would run and run and run, and now I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t clear my mind. I\u2019m not part of a soccer team anymore.</p><p>I also keep thinking of what happened with Matt on Sunday night.</p><p>At first when I think of it, a smile flits across my face, but then I feel ashamed. These feelings confuse me, and I want to talk to Emily about it, but after what happened at her apartment, she hasn\u2019t tried to call even once. Besides, she might say I\u2019m childish\u2014that everyone does that with their boyfriends. Matt hasn\u2019t even brought it up.</p><p>How is it possible to have a great boyfriend but still feel lonely?</p><p>My art class with the campers just ended. We made candles by dripping wax into sand holes we dug, and then made stained-glass votives.</p><p>Ever since she made that jewelry box, Parker has been coming to my art classes during her breaks. She doesn\u2019t say much, because she doesn\u2019t want me to get in trouble with Megan again, but she stuck around to help me clean up today.</p> <p>She sweeps sand into little piles while I store supplies on the shelves, hobbling back and forth from the tables to the cupboards.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>The moment she asks that, tears fill my eyes. The emotions just get to me. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say, staying in the closet until I get myself under control. I will not cry in front of her.</p><p>Then she appears behind me and catches me wiping my nose.</p><p>\u201cIs your leg hurting?\u201d she asks, looking at my scar.</p><p>\u201cYeah...I\u2019ve been running with Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you be running on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy therapist said it should be okay, but I\u2019m still trying to figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about soccer.\u201d</p><p>I focus on my watercolor of White Oak. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your parents.\u201d</p><p>Parker bites on her lower lip and drags the broom across the floor. \u201cIt definitely sucked when they split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we weren\u2019t really friends before that happened, but I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve reached out, but...I didn\u2019t understand why you were acting like you were, you know...hooking up with guys a lot. It scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt scared me too,\u201d she admits, clutching the broom handle.</p><p>\u201cWill said your friends turned against you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them, yeah. It was...hard. My best friend told everyone I was probably gay, like Mom.\u201d</p><p>My eyes water again. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the pain from my knee or just my overall state of mind, but I can\u2019t control my tears today. At all. \u201cI lost my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes grow wide. \u201cEmily? From church?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I avoid her stare and walk out of the closet. I stop to drum my fingers on a picnic table, dipping my fingers into the chipped wood where someone named Lily carved her name. \u201cI\u2019m dating Matt now,\u201d I tell Parker, dropping the subject of Emily. \u201cLike a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>Parker squeals and comes to hug me.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you guys kissed? Made out or anything?\u201d</p><p>I swallow and tell myself to ignore the other night. All of our clothes stayed on, but I could feel him through my shorts. It felt great. It felt wrong. \u201cWe\u2019ve kissed, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cI\u2019m so glad he picked you instead of that nasty Andrea!\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. I can\u2019t help it. But I feel a little bit bad, considering Andrea helped Matt get through his breakup and ended up falling for him, even though she didn\u2019t intend for it to happen.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps going on and on about how she\u2019ll be in Cabo at the same time as him,\u201d Parker says.</p><p>\u201cCabo?\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cMexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where Cabo is, but what does Mexico have to do with Andrea and Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess his frat is going with her sorority to Mexico over the Fourth of July.\u201d</p><p>We have that week off from camp, but Matt hadn\u2019t mentioned a trip. And he definitely did not mention a trip with Andrea!</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything,\u201d I tell Parker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that he just forgot,\u201d she says, lifting a shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Parker cuts me off, waving the broom at me. \u201cHe does not like her like that. Trust me. He could\u2019ve had her already. He wants you!\u201d</p><p>I step to the edge of the pavilion and peer into the woods. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a week with nothing to do,\u201d I mumble. Mom and Daddy are going on that cruise and I\u2019m staying home with Fritz the dog.</p><p>\u201cWe can hang out,\u201d Parker says, starting to sweep again.</p><p>\u201cWith you and Will?\u201d</p><p>She glances up at my eyes, looking just as nervous as I feel. \u201cNo, like you and me. Don\u2019t become one of those girls who\u2019s super dependent on her boyfriend, okay?\u201d</p><p>I smile, and then she suggests we walk up to the cafeteria to get some ice for my knee.</p><p>Later that morning after our swimming session, my group is drying off by the side of the pool. The campers are slapping each other with towels and acting like buffoons.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Matt calls out from beside the pool maintenance closet.</p><p>\u201cCan you watch the kids for a minute?\u201d I ask Ian, my co-counselor this week.</p><p>A grin stretches across his face. \u201cNice. The pool shed is a good choice. Not as great as behind the cafeteria\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d I interrupt, making him laugh.</p><p>Ian goes back to scolding a boy for slapping girls with his towel. \u201cWhen you get older,\u201d Ian tells the boy, \u201cthese girls will remember that you smacked their butts and won\u2019t want to date you. So stop it!\u201d</p><p>Glancing around to make sure Megan isn\u2019t at the pool right now, I zip across the concrete to Matt.</p><p>He scans my two-piece bathing suit, smiling, and rests a hand on my shoulder. His thumb grazes my neck as he bends down to whisper in my ear. \u201cI got you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>He reaches for a shelf in the closet and picks up a four-leaf clover. \u201cFor you.\u201d Matt gently sets it on top of my ear, like how women sometimes wear tropical flowers.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, thinking about how he\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Something you don\u2019t find often. I\u2019d be stupid to mess things up with him just because he\u2019s in a frat, especially when everything else about him fits just right.</p><p>He looks from the clover to my eyes. Based on his smile, which is full of friendship and something more, I doubt he\u2019s thinking of Sunday night. He\u2019s thinking of today. Today and me and not necessarily what\u2019s next, but right now. Maybe he\u2019s right\u2014maybe I can see right through him.</p><p>But if that\u2019s true, why didn\u2019t I know about Cabo?</p><p>\u201cI love the clover,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMaybe in trade you could give me your green beans at lunch today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>He gives me a mischievous smile. \u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, listen, can we talk?\u201d</p><p>His face goes serious, like my voice. \u201cNow?\u201d He looks over my shoulder at the towel fight. Ian practically has this kid in a headlock, trying to stop him from smacking another kid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Later is good.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me into the closet and rubs my stomach, dipping a finger into my bellybutton. \u201cI\u2019ll come by your cabin at midnight.\u201d</p><p>I give Matt a smile and go pry Ian off the camper.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are fast,\u201d Ian teases me.</p><p>\u201cPerv.\u201d</p><p>By the time midnight rolls around, I\u2019ve bitten my pinky nail down to the quick. If I confront Matt about going to Cabo over the Fourth of July, will he think I\u2019m one of those controlling girlfriends?</p><p>I check to make sure the girls are asleep, then slip my feet into flip-flops and pad down the trail to my cookout area. Matt\u2019s already there, playing his guitar. As soon as I walk up, he puts the guitar aside and then lifts me onto the table and stands between my legs. He kisses me deeply, exploring my mouth, his fingers grasping my knees.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to distract me?\u201d I ask, weaving my hands in his hair.</p><p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d He kisses me again.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re going to Cabo? Parker told me.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a deep breath through his nose and hesitates for a second. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cI already paid for it. Before you.\u201d He shuts his eyes. \u201cBefore we reconnected\u2014before we started dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to spend time with my brothers.\u201d He means his fraternity. He continues, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go surfing. But I don\u2019t want to miss out on a week with you.\u201d We kiss again. His lips are so warm and soft.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept meaning to bring it up but wasn\u2019t sure what to tell you...\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cParker said you probably forgot to tell me because you\u2019re a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take great offense to that. You are in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>I try to escape but he wraps me up in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re like a straitjacket,\u201d I say, trying to break free.</p><p>\u201cA straitjacket of love.\u201d</p><p>I slap his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that. That\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Does that mean he loves me?</p><p>We are laughing and kissing and then he leans his forehead against mine. I drag my fingers across his lower back, beneath his shirt, and dip my fingers inside his shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou should go surfing and be with your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing away from you for a week will suck,\u201d he whispers. He goes up my shirt while he kisses me, making me shake all over. My nipple hardens under his touch. My body feels like a rubber band ready to snap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs this okay? Should I stop?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The four-leaf clover he gave me pops into my mind. I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>The next two weeks of camp basically go the same way\u2014during the day I hang out with Parker, and at night, after everyone\u2019s asleep, I spend time with Matt.</p> <p>Every morning, I pray in the Woodsong Chapel, asking God to give me the strength to keep my hands off Matt. I haven\u2019t let him go further than touching my chest, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder to stop because I want him to touch me, because I care about him so much. And sometimes I get so sad thinking of Emily that Matt notices. He keeps asking, \u201cWhere do you go inside that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell him. \u201cNowhere.\u201d</p><p>Then he grins a sad, lopsided grin and kisses my cheek.</p><p>The good news is that the fun of camp totally distracts me. One afternoon, the girl counselors challenge the guy counselors to a game of Bonzo Ball. Well, all the counselors minus Eric, who decides to lead a small expedition of campers to look for snakes at the lake because he\u2019s still not convinced I saw one.</p><p>With a hundred campers surrounding us, cheering and stomping, Parker, Andrea, Carlie, and I take on the guys. Much trash talk ensues.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what Bonzo Ball is,\u201d Carlie says to Ian, fake sneering.</p><p>\u201cI do so know what it is. Don\u2019t you remember me beating you five times last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d the boy campers say.</p><p>Carlie sets a hand on her hip. \u201cI let you win because you always cry when you lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d the girl campers chorus.</p><p>Squatting low to the ground, Andrea slams the ball at Brad\u2019s shins, knocking him out of the game. The girl campers cheer like mad, and I give Andrea a high five. Matt, Will, and Ian fake pout.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, girls!\u201d a boy camper yells at us. He\u2019s twelve and clearly has the hots for us.</p><p>Matt points at the boy. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so going down, traitor.\u201d</p><p>The game comes down to Parker versus Ian, and they totally start showing off, doing fancy jumps in the air and rolling out of the way of the ball. But in the end, Parker manages to hit Ian in the ankle, and us four girls jump up and down, hugging each other. It makes me smile that Andrea and I are getting along, at least in the name of girl power.</p><p>Thursday night before our week off, after I\u2019ve said good night prayers with the girls in my cabin, I\u2019m lying with Matt in the big field, staring at the stars.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think heaven is?\u201d Matt asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up there,\u201d I say, pointing past the Big Dipper.</p><p>Emily said she doesn\u2019t buy any of it anymore. Religion. God. Faith. Before I decided to help Emily get an abortion, my life was just fine. My parents love me. I have a beautiful home. All in all, everything was okay.</p><p>Since I sinned, life has been terrible and wonderful. I never had a boyfriend during high school. I didn\u2019t have many friends except for Emily and my soccer team. But after they were taken away, I found out how little I truly had.</p> <p>Now I have Matt and my heart is brimming with emotions, with something that feels like love, but I\u2019m not ready to tell him that yet. We\u2019ve only been dating a month. Can you feel love in that amount of time?</p><p>What if he still loves his ex?</p><p>I snuggle against his chest. \u201cNo girls in Cabo, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo guys in Franklin, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d I tell him, using an exaggerated warning tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in trouble.\u201d He rolls over on top of me and tickles me until I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m screaming at him, probably waking up the entire camp. I try to push him off me but he\u2019s too strong. Then his mouth meets mine and for the first time, he rests his fingers on the button of my shorts.</p><p>I inhale deeply, grabbing his hand.</p><p>He rolls off me, shutting his eyes and rubbing his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to push you to move so fast I just get caught up in you\u2014and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I climb on top of him. \u201cI get caught up in you too.\u201d</p><p>We move against each other and my mind goes away into nothingness and it\u2019s just our bodies, straining to get closer. My shorts are unbuttoned, unzipped, and so are his. He\u2019s wearing light blue striped boxers that I can\u2019t help wanting to touch. His hand gently grazes me through my shorts and then he runs a finger beneath the elastic of my underwear. That\u2019s when I remember I have on plain white panties. I can\u2019t let him see those. I bet Andrea doesn\u2019t even own white cotton underwear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cTo be continued?\u201d he asks, smiling. \u201cWhen I get back from Mexico?\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019ll miss him like crazy, I\u2019m grateful for the break. For the chance to figure out how to balance the physical part of our relationship with the emotional. Andrea would probably give Matt whatever he wants. What scares me is that I want to give Matt whatever he wants. Not because I\u2019m scared of losing him.</p><p>Because I want to show him how much I care.</p><p>Because I\u2019m falling in love with all of him.</p><p>Because I kind of want it too.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go where?\u201d</p><p>Parker and I spent the first few days of break riding bikes, swimming, and lying out in the sun, and that was really fun, but I never imagined Parker would invite me to a Fourth of July party at Jordan Woods\u2019s house. Jordan is Sam Henry\u2019s girlfriend, and like him, she probably has no idea who I am. I, however, know exactly who Jordan is. Former captain and quarterback of the Hundred Oaks High football team.</p><p>Loud rap music rings through the trees. Lit torches with flames reaching toward the sky dot the yard, along with tables and tables of food and drinks.</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d I say to Parker. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a party like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like them much, either,\u201d she whispers back. \u201cWe\u2019ll just say hi and then come up with an excuse to leave, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d</p><p>She jerks her head toward Will. A bunch of boys from the baseball team rush up to surround him, talking about how the Braves blew a 3\u20132 lead in the ninth.</p><p>Will never lets go of Parker\u2019s hand as he talks and even kisses her knuckles from time to time. No one is talking to me, and I wish so bad that Matt were here, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s in Cabo. What if Andrea comes on to him? What if he changes his mind about me while he\u2019s in Mexico?</p><p>Leaving Parker and Will with the baseball players, I make my way toward one of the many drink tables. On my way, a really cute guy catches my eye and smiles. He abandons the guy he was talking to and stalks toward me with a major swagger.</p><p>My breath catches in my throat. The guy must be six-four, and he has these ginormous muscles and gorgeous blond hair. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, checking out my jean shorts.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, not sure of what to do with my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jake.\u201d He thrusts out a hand and I take it.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a friend of Jordan\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, swallowing hard. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan gets pissed if I talk to her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you her brother?\u201d He fits the mold. Tall, blond, Adonis-like. But not as Adonis-like as Matt.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cHer brother\u2019s my best friend.\u201d He takes a step closer to me, where I can see a few freckles on his nose. \u201cWant to go for a walk down by the docks?\u201d he says quietly. He slides a hand onto my shoulder. It doesn\u2019t feel good or exciting. It only reminds me of how much I miss Matt. It scares me a little, to realize I am beginning to depend on him like I depended on Emily. I don\u2019t think I will lose him, but I can\u2019t help but worry about how much I\u2019ve come to count on him being around.</p><p>\u201cI have a boyfriend,\u201d I tell Jake.</p><p>\u201cI can understand why,\u201d he replies, scanning my body again and taking a step closer. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>He grins a lazy grin, then whispers, \u201cDo you believe in love at first sight...? Or should I walk by you again?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to speak, then shut it again. \u201cReally? Did you really just say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReynolds!\u201d I hear a voice yell. Jake jumps away from me, eyes wide. I turn to see Jordan stalking this way. \u201cGet away from her before I get medieval on your ass!\u201d</p><p>Jordan walks right up and takes Jake by the bicep and yanks him over to another guy, who looks a lot like Jordan. He hands Jake a beer. She yells at both guys and points toward the house and basically makes a big scene. The guys laugh at her and go back to drinking their beers.</p><p>I need something to do with my empty hands, so I dip my fingers into a bucket of slushy ice to search for a can of Coke or a bottled water. But all I can see are beer, wine, wine coolers, and more beer. Where are Jordan Woods\u2019s parents anyway? Her dad is a famous football player, so he must travel all the time.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>Jordan has reappeared beside me. She\u2019s wearing a bright gold Purdue T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I say, turning my focus toward the grass. Jordan is like a foot taller than me and she\u2019s supermodel gorgeous and strong and well-respected by just about everybody. I\u2019ve never actually spoken to her but I\u2019ve always admired how she follows her dreams.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Reynolds,\u201d Jordan says, smacking some chewing gum. \u201cHe\u2019s a perv.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly and consider calling Daddy to ask him to come pick me up. Parker and Will are still chatting with people.</p><p>\u201cDid you want a drink?\u201d Jordan asks again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d I reply.</p><p>She thrusts her hand down into the bucket and whips out a root beer, which she passes to me. Then she pulls out another and pops the tab. \u201cI don\u2019t drink either,\u201d she says, taking a sip. \u201cI\u2019m not messing up my body when I\u2019ve got football to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to mess up my body either,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she says, tapping her can against mine. \u201cCheers.\u201d She jerks her head toward a picnic table over by a lush garden full of cornstalks and sunflowers. Sam Henry, JJ, and Joe Carter are playing flip cup and slurping beers. \u201cMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t mind messing himself up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stinks,\u201d I say. Sam\u2019s as popular as Jordan, and I\u2019ve never heard of him being mean to anybody. He does have a reputation, though\u2014Emily once told me he\u2019s fooled around with lots of girls at school.</p><p>I don\u2019t love that Matt\u2019s off in Cabo with his frat brothers right now, but I like him enough to live with it. I guess you can love a person without loving everything about them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know Sam, but he seems like a nice guy,\u201d I say.</p><p>She sticks out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jordan, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate Kelly. We went to school together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She winces. \u201cI heard about your knee. That sucks major.\u201d</p><p>I slip a thumb through my belt loop and toe the grass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan goes on, \u201cAnd you were in my art class last semester.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI liked the collage you made with pictures of Brett Favre and a bunch of monkeys.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Jordan pushes my shoulder. Ow! She\u2019s strong. \u201cDad liked my collage a lot too. He put it up in his office.\u201d</p><p>We sip our root beers.</p> <p>\u201cI liked that painting you did of heaven,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cThe one with the sailboat?\u201d</p><p>Jordan Woods noticed one of my paintings? That one won first place at the fair. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve told you at school, but I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you during art. I could tell it was serious for you. Not like the shit goof-off time it was for me and Henry, you know? He made that papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture of a dog peeing on a fire hydrant.\u201d Jordan rolls her eyes, but she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded if you interrupted me,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it when people bother me during weights or drills. I need to concentrate.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t need concentration, though. I like activity around me. It gives me ideas. Makes me think in dynamic ways. Makes the colors explode.</p><p>Jordan thought I didn\u2019t want to be approached when I did.</p><p>What did I look like in high school? A girl who lived in Emily\u2019s shadow, where it was safe. The only place I broke out of my shell was on the soccer field, and when that ended, I shrunk even further back into the shadow.</p><p>But Jordan saw me even when I thought I was invisible. And she\u2019s strong and does what she feels is right. And besides all the sexist jerks out there, no one has a problem with her going after her goals and dreams of playing quarterback in college.</p><p>But can I still open myself up to new experiences and new people while doing what I feel is right? Especially if other people don\u2019t necessarily believe what I believe?</p><p>Why is believing in football different than believing in God? Why is one more socially acceptable than the other?</p> <p>I look up at Jordan. \u201cAre you looking forward to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m officially moving up to Indiana next week. I\u2019ve already been practicing with the team. And Henry\u2019s shipped his stuff up to Michigan.\u201d She gazes over at him and I can see the pain on her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys gonna keep dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like the only person who\u2019s asked me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014everyone else is scared to ask, I think.\u201d She gulps her root beer. \u201cBut I know we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichigan isn\u2019t that far from Indiana, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. It takes longer to drive across Tennessee than it does to drive from Michigan to Purdue. We\u2019ll still see each other plenty.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s when Sam Henry walks up and wraps his arms around her waist from behind. He sweeps her hair back and kisses her neck.</p><p>\u201cBedtime?\u201d he asks, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like eight-thirty!\u201d she replies, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He stretches his arms and yawns a fake yawn, acting all dramatic. \u201cIt\u2019s super late. I\u2019m so sleepy,\u201d he teases.</p><p>Jordan glances at his face, then focuses on me again. I see the want written on her face. I used to see it on Emily\u2019s face when she was with Jacob. Is that the same look I wear when I want to be alone with Matt?</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNice talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for what you said, about my painting,\u201d I say to Jordan.</p><p>She nods. \u201cFriend me on Facebook so I can see your other art.\u201d</p><p>I watch as she and Sam Henry walk across the yard, ignoring everyone trying to talk to them\u2014it\u2019s like they are in their own little bubble\u2014and go up the back steps into her house. A minute later I see a light flick on upstairs, and then it goes out again.</p><p>Jordan and Sam love each other, but they love their dreams too. They love each other enough that it\u2019s okay to risk being apart. I rub my throat, thinking of Emily and her dream to play violin for the National Symphony. Like Jordan, she wanted that same balance with Jacob. And she lost that balance.</p><p>Matt and I are still figuring out our balance.</p><p>Holding hands, Parker and Will stride up to me. \u201cReady to get out of here?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine to hang out if y\u2019all want to stay longer. Well, except for this guy used the worst pick-up line ever on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Parker says. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>I point out Jake Reynolds and tell her what he said. He sees us pointing and blows me a kiss.</p><p>\u201cHe is so hot,\u201d Parker whispers to me.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Will says, shaking his head and grinning.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re eight times cuter than he is,\u201d Parker says to Will.</p><p>\u201cOnly eight times?\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019m at least ten times\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you guys need me to drive? Did you drink?\u201d I interrupt. I wasn\u2019t watching to see if they drank.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t drink,\u201d Will replies, dragging a hand up and down Parker\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI want a Monster burger,\u201d he whines to her.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a baby.\u201d She gets up on tiptoes and kisses his lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you your burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are making me ill,\u201d I say.</p><p>Will squeezes my shoulder and laughs. \u201cYou and Matt are just as bad.\u201d</p><p>I swat his elbow. \u201cLet\u2019s go get Will\u2019s burger already.\u201d</p><p>I got home from Jiffy Burger after midnight.</p><p>Now it\u2019s two in the morning and my phone just rang, waking up Fritz, who\u2019s curled up in bed with me. Matt\u2019s calling for the first time all week. It\u2019s not like I expected him to call, considering you could buy a small island for what it costs to call international, but to call in the middle of the night?</p><p>I answer and hear music blaring in the background. I can feel the bass through the phone. He has to yell in order for me to hear.</p><p>\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be having a lot more fun if you were here.\u201d He sounds really tired or buzzed.</p><p>I hear a girl calling his name. Is that Andrea? The music is making my head throb.</p><p>I rub my eye. \u201cMatt, I miss you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be one of those girls who is totally dependent on her boyfriend, and I don\u2019t think I am, but it hurts so much to hear him at a party with girls.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d I repeat. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to keep you away from your friends, but I\u2019m kind of freaking out that you\u2019re there partying with other girls.\u201d</p><p>He goes silent. Then the music begins to dim in the background. I think he\u2019s walking away from the noise. The phone line goes silent except for his breathing.</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d he says, \u201cI went to this art gallery called Los Cabos. They have all these pieces made of amber...I bet you\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have called you from a party. I\u2019m sorry...I shouldn\u2019t even be at this party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just worry that some other girl will hit on you or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I worry about the same thing?\u201d</p><p>I tell Matt about how that pervy guy Jake Reynolds hit on me at Jordan Woods\u2019s party and Matt starts laughing and yelling and screaming into the phone. Turns out that Jake Reynolds is some big football star.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to be pissed at me,\u201d Matt says, chuckling. \u201cI get hit on by some random girl in Cabo, but the number one pick in the NFL draft hit on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Matt and I are laughing together now. I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re laughing, but it feels good.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I called is \u2019cause I\u2019m coming home early,\u201d he says. \u201cThe airline will change my ticket for the low cost of seventy-nine ninety-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. All I\u2019ve thought about since I got here is you.\u201d</p><p>I drag my fingers through Fritz\u2019s fur. \u201cEighty dollars is a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney\u2019s just money.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m smiling.</p><p>He goes on, \u201cI\u2019ll be home on Friday, okay? I\u2019ll call you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>We hang up. I let out a long breath and lie down on my pillow.</p><p>I remember this one time when I was little, Daddy and I were listening to a Beatles CD. He told me about how John Lennon had once said, \u201cWe\u2019re bigger than Jesus.\u201d And when I asked Daddy how John Lennon could say something so bad, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWell, it was kinda true at that time. The Beatles were more popular than Jesus.\u201d</p><p>For the first time ever, I\u2019m beginning to feel like something\u2014someone\u2014is more important than anything.</p><p>giving</p><p>friday, july 6 ~ on break from camp</p><p>How is Emily?</p><p>That\u2019s what Jacob\u2019s text reads.</p><p>I\u2019d been clutching my phone, waiting for Matt to call. I jumped when it beeped.</p><p>What do I write back to Jacob? That I have no idea? That she probably never wants to talk to me again?</p><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s thinking about her, even after she dumped him with no explanation. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Matt stopped thinking of me. Jacob truly loves her. Would he have understood about the baby? Would he have agreed with Emily\u2019s choice? Would his love for her trump his morals and beliefs, whatever they are?</p><p>Does being in love mean forgetting everything you know? Or is it about folding that love into your life? Because right now, I have no idea how to balance that.</p><p>Love weighs a million pounds.</p><p>Matt calls me when he gets home at about noon. \u201cI gotta crash for a few hours. I had to get up at like three a.m. for my flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep tight,\u201d I tell him. I wish I could curl up with him and take a nap too, but I doubt his parents would go for that. His dad would totally interrupt us every two minutes to ask for help mowing the grass.</p><p>\u201cWant to hang out tonight?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom bought me The A-Team DVD collection for my birthday,\u201d Matt says. \u201cWe could watch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s The A-Team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of it? That\u2019s insane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>I hear him yawning. \u201cIt\u2019s this show from the eighties where these military people get in trouble for a crime they didn\u2019t commit and they are always on the run from the Man. And Mr. T is in it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Mr. T?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis big black wrestler dude with a Mohawk. He wears tons of gold jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to spend our night watching a big black wrestler dude with a Mohawk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what we do,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI know this bridge that goes over the interstate and hardly any cars ever drive on it. We can go watch the traffic if you want. And by watch the traffic, I mean make out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh. \u201cTraffic fumes sound romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very romantic guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, listen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy parents are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean right now. On a cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means they\u2019re out of town tonight...\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cMine are in town tonight.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWant to come over?\u201d I ask with a shaky voice.</p> <p>\u201cDepends. Are you making me dinner?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cYou bring the dinner.\u201d</p><p>I now have Parker\u2019s number programmed in my cell. She squealed when I called.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to go shopping!\u201d</p><p>I had only been planning to get some new clothes for college, and new sheets and a comforter for the twin bed in my dorm room, but now she\u2019s leading me through the Green Hills mall on a mission to Victoria\u2019s Secret.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need underwear,\u201d I say. This is a complete lie, but whatever.</p> <p>\u201cKate, you cannot go shopping with me and skip the underwear portion of the trip. It\u2019s like refusing to sing \u201cTake Me out to the Ball Game\u201d at a ballgame. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>She grins mischievously. \u201cAu contraire. I think you\u2019ll owe me after we get done in here.\u201d</p><p>I navigate past stands holding skimpy lacy panties and racks wielding barely-there bras. I avoid looking at the lingerie. Lotions and bubble bath lure me over to a shelf. I pop the caps open and start smelling lavenders, vanillas, and sea salts.</p><p>Parker snatches Love Spell out from under my nose. \u201cWe\u2019re not here for lotion. We\u2019re here to revamp your underwear collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevamp my underwear collection.\u201d</p><p>She nods, scanning the room as if planning a siege. \u201cI think you need a stable of cotton panties and bras, all that can be swapped out but will still match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stable of panties,\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>\u201cYou need lots of panties with patterns so you can wear them with different bras,\u201d she says, marching over to where colorful underwear stretch across a table. She holds up a pair to my crotch, as if to measure.</p><p>I smack her hand away and glance around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she says, holding the panties to my crotch again. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first person to ever wear underwear, you know.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face growing hot. \u201cBut what if someone sees?\u201d</p><p>She lifts a shoulder. \u201cIf someone sees, that means they\u2019re here shopping for panties too. Or buying panties for their girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys buy panties for their girlfriends?\u201d I ask, imagining Matt in here trying to pick out something.</p><p>Parker ignores my question. \u201cYou also need a couple of lacy bras and matching panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need those kind,\u201d I say quietly, even though that\u2019s exactly what I need.</p><p>She raises her eyebrows. \u201cHow far have you and Matt gone, anyway?\u201d She\u2019s practically running in place, she\u2019s so excited.</p><p>I bite my lip. Part of me is ashamed to admit I\u2019ve sinned, especially since I\u2019ve questioned people in the past. But I\u2019m proud of Matt and I\u2019m falling for him and I want to tell Parker all about him. How he loves his parents, how he puts the doors back on his Jeep for me, how he sneaks out late at night to make music for me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken our shirts off together,\u201d I admit, examining a pair of boy shorts.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...it was nice.\u201d</p><p>Parker smiles and leads me to a rack of lacy bras. \u201cYou need one of these black ones for sure. Will loves mine.\u201d</p><p>My face heats up, but I smile back at her. I ask, \u201cWhat other colors does Will like?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, and each holding a pink bag, we make our way to the food court, jabbering about anything and everything. She tells me about how her dad just started dating again and that it\u2019s kinda weird but she\u2019s happy for him. We see a poster for a new animated film about a hippo who wants to perform on Broadway and she says her favorite Disney movie is Finding Nemo and I say mine is Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>We each buy pasta, some garlic bread, and a Diet Coke, and grab a table in the middle of the food court, where sun shines through the windows above. I wipe a napkin across the sticky table.</p><p>Parker takes a dainty bite of garlic bread. The cheese stretches out into a long, floppy string and she pushes it into her mouth. \u201cSo is Matt a good kisser?\u201d she asks, chewing.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She sips her Coke through a straw.</p><p>\u201cA couple weeks ago? His dad walked in on us making out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes open wide. \u201cHoly mortifying. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt took me home and we made out in my driveway instead.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and takes another small bite. She never eats much. \u201cWill and I usually hook up in his basement, but his brothers are always accidentally interrupting us. Or his mom asks him to do some chore. Like, last Saturday? We thought we were home alone, so we were kissing and he took my shirt off, and then his mom hollered down the steps for him to come upstairs and hang her new curtains.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face going rosy, but I\u2019m laughing along with her. I like talking to her. I like hearing about her experiences. But it makes me feel ashamed that Emily had tried to talk to me about this stuff and I never wanted to hear it because I thought it was wrong. It is wrong, but at the same time, everything about Matt feels good and I want to talk about him with Parker. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for Emily. I want to tell her I\u2019m starting to understand.</p><p>\u201cAnd then this one time,\u201d Parker whispers, looking from H\u00e4agen-Dazs to the Greek Palace, \u201cWill\u2019s hand was, you know\u2014\u201d She points down and I suck on my lower lip, waiting to hear what comes next. \u201cAnd his brother, Rory\u2014he\u2019s gonna be a freshman at Hundred Oaks this fall\u2014walked in on us and then walked right back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds really awkward.\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunches up in embarrassment. \u201cThat was the first time we\u2019d done that too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really getting into the girl talk, and I feel like I can trust her. \u201cI haven\u2019t done that yet,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI had only done it one other time before Will.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cWith who...?\u201d</p><p>She sips her drink and plucks a bite of bread and pops it into her mouth. She looks around the food court, chewing. \u201cRemember Coach Hoffman?\u201d</p><p>I lean back in my chair, shocked. Last spring, Jacob told Emily and me that Parker had gotten caught kissing the coach of the school baseball team. We heard she seduced him. \u201cThe rumors were true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake...I mean, at the time I thought he was right for me, but he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left, right? He moved away?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glaze over. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just...he left and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. And I don\u2019t care that much because I\u2019m really falling in love with Will. It just sucks I didn\u2019t mean enough to Brian\u2014I mean, Coach Hoffman, for him to check on me after he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d I sip my drink. \u201cSo you\u2019re in love with Will? Have you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet...But I will soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say it back.\u201d I want to reach out and touch her hand, but instead I cradle my paper cup.</p><p>\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t say it back, I still love him and want him to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he loves you too.\u201d</p><p>Parker looks up at me and chews more slowly. She swallows. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Her phone beeps and she checks the screen. She shakes her head as she types. \u201cIt\u2019s Drew. He knows I\u2019m at the mall and he wants me to come see this pair of jeans he likes at Nordstrom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, my voice soft. Does she want to leave already?</p><p>Then Drew appears at our table and sits down next to Parker. He takes a bite of her pasta and sips her drink, and ignores me.</p><p>\u201cCan we check out the pants I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in?\u201d Parker asks me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014I should go anyway.\u201d I grab my purse and Victoria\u2019s Secret bag and push my chair away from the table.</p><p>\u201cCome with us!\u201d Parker says. She nudges Drew, and he lifts a shoulder.</p><p>I find myself following them past Gap, Banana Republic, and the yummy Lindt chocolate store, and while I try to ignore their conversation, I distinctly hear Parker telling him, \u201cShe\u2019s my friend. Would you drop it?\u201d</p><p>At Nordstrom, Parker stands outside the guys\u2019 dressing room while Drew tries on the black jeans he just has to have. Neckties lay fanned across a display table, like a rainbow. I drag my fingers across the silk. Daddy wears a tie every day to work, and when he\u2019s not working, he\u2019s usually in a button-down shirt. Does Matt even own a tie?</p><p>I smile to myself because I never want to see Matt wearing a tie. I like him the way he is, with his ratty T-shirts and tanks and weathered polos. I like that he knows his style.</p><p>Drew struts out of the dressing room in the black jeans, and well, they look terrible with the gray polo he\u2019s wearing. Parker is looking at the jeans and shaking her head, but then I get an idea. I head over to the girls\u2019 juniors section, where I find an extra-large red and black plaid shirt with 3\u20444 length sleeves, and carry it back to the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cDrew, try this on,\u201d I tell him, passing the shirt over the top of the door. \u201cRoll up the sleeves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so not me,\u201d he replies, but when he comes out, he\u2019s beaming. The outfit really works. \u201cMaybe I should wear girls\u2019 clothes more often,\u201d he jokes, checking himself out in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s really artistic,\u201d Parker tells him.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d He flashes me a brief smile.</p><p>\u201cLet me go find some shoes to match,\u201d I tell them, grinning to myself.</p><p>Matt showed up at my front door with a pizza. He remembered that I love pepperoni and mushrooms!</p><p>I kiss his cheek four times and whisper how much I missed him.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d he says, focusing on my eyes. He pecks my lips. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he says, squeezing past me into the foyer. \u201cLacey\u2019s driving me nuts. She thinks I\u2019m her personal chauffeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jeremiah?\u201d I ask, taking the six-pack of Coke from his hands.</p><p>He pauses to think and takes a breath. \u201cOut with some girl named Erin?\u201d</p><p>After a quick tour of the downstairs of my house (Matt is both excited and freaked out by all of Daddy\u2019s antique shotguns and animal heads. I fear his heart now belongs to Vincent Moose), we settle on the living room floor to eat by tea lights. Parker let me borrow her short yellow sundress, so Indian style is a no-go. I have to sit with my back up against the couch with my feet out in front of me. Matt scans my legs and bites into his pizza, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, sipping Coke.</p><p>\u201cWhenever we\u2019re not at camp, you wear these clothes that drive me nuts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile at him. Candlelight flickers across his face. I pull my foot up next to us. \u201cLook, I finally put on the fairy tattoo you won on our first date.\u201d</p><p>He grins, gently running a finger across the tattoo on my ankle. Tingles rush up my leg. \u201cRemember how you kissed me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I grin back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou scandalized me.\u201d</p> <p>I smack his arm. \u201cI did not. You loved it.\u201d</p><p>We dig into our pizza again until he asks what I did today.</p><p>\u201cWent to the mall with Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, barely able to contain my smile. He raises his eyebrows.</p> <p>I go on, \u201cHer friend, Drew, showed up and we helped him pick out some clothes. And when I got home I had some ideas for more outfits\u2014\u201d I reach up onto the couch and pull my sketchbook into my lap.</p><p>Fear rushes through me. I clutch my book to my chest. I\u2019ve never shown anyone my sketchbook, and just now, it was so easy to reach behind me and grab it and open it in front of him.</p><p>How serious are we?</p><p>\u201cCan I see what you drew?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>Pulling a deep breath, I thumb through my sketchbook until I get to the picture of Drew wearing the outfit I picked out. I show the drawing to Matt, who takes another bite of pizza and talks as he chews.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a decent-looking guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad you had a nice afternoon shopping with him,\u201d Matt says with a laugh.</p><p>I close my book and move to set it aside, but he speaks again. \u201cCan I look at your other sketches? I\u2019ll wash my hands first. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, passing him the book, even though I\u2019d rather lock it up in a safe. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about getting it dirty.\u201d But he gets up and washes his hands anyway, and then flops back down on the rug with me. He opens my book carefully to the first page. He doesn\u2019t move an inch as he studies a sketch of himself. Is he breathing?</p><p>Then his finger turns the page, and a minute later, to the next.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re of me,\u201d he says, his voice full of awe. He leans down and presses his lips to my forehead, and then goes back to my drawings, looking at each one carefully.</p><p>When he shuts the book, I curl up against his side, slightly lift his shirt and touch his abs. He shifts under my hand, then pulls me onto his lap, so I\u2019m straddling him. The rug digs into my knees. Beneath my dress he sets his hands on my waist, rubbing his thumbs over my hipbones. His blue eyes stare into mine. Every noise\u2014the entire world, seems to silence around us.</p><p>Finally he breaks it. \u201cHow about a tour of the rest of your house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike, my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially your room,\u201d he growls playfully. I smack his arm and he smacks me back, and then he\u2019s up on his feet and darting toward the staircase with me chasing after him. Our laughter rings through the house. I dart up the stairs as he checks doors on the second floor.</p><p>\u201cIs this Kate\u2019s room?\u201d he asks, opening a linen closet. \u201cAre you like Harry Potter? Do you live in a cupboard?\u201d</p><p>I pinch his elbow. \u201cI sleep on a shelf with the Q-tips.\u201d</p><p>He moves on to my parents\u2019 room, where a pair of Daddy\u2019s dress pants lay on the chest. \u201cAre you cheating on me?\u201d he jokes, strutting into the room.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d I say, pulling him into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hiding this guy who wears the fancy pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hiding him in here.\u201d I walk backward to my room, pulling Matt by an arm. His face goes serious when I push the door open with my butt.</p><p>Silently, he spends a lot of time looking around my room. I\u2019m so glad I got rid of my kiddy bedspread for the soft white duvet and matching pillowcases. I light a few candles while he studies each of my paintings and looks at all of my books, even the ones from middle school, and when he finds the pile of pictures of me and Emily, the photos I took off the wall, he turns each frame over one by one. He laughs silently at the picture of us sitting together in the Forrest Sanctuary dunking booth at Vacation Bible School.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he asks, waving the frame. \u201cYour friend?\u201d</p><p>Not tonight. I can\u2019t tell him tonight. I take a deep breath, holding out a hand. \u201cMatt. Please.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019s moving across the room toward me, sidestepping my laundry basket, a blazing look on his face, and then we\u2019re kissing and falling backward onto my bed. But this isn\u2019t like at his house or on the parachute at camp. This is completely unhindered. I can\u2019t even think as he lifts my dress up and over my head\u2014static from my hair catching the fabric, leaving me in the lacy pink bra and panties I bought today. His eyes slowly scan my body and his breath catches in his throat.</p><p>He tosses his T-shirt and khaki shorts onto the rug, and lies on top of me, his fingers digging in my hair. Our feet twist together. His lips pepper my neck and I can\u2019t breathe. I try to focus on the ceiling fan, going round and round and round.</p><p>\u201cMatt, Matt,\u201d I mumble, delirious.</p><p>He pulls away. His biceps strain as he holds himself above me. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow.\u201d</p><p>We kiss and kiss, pressing against each other until I can\u2019t take it anymore. I ignore the guilt. It\u2019s not strong enough to make me stop. I need relief. My body feels like a bomb. It\u2019s like he senses it, because his hand heads south and he focuses on my face and asks if it\u2019s okay and I say yes, even though I shouldn\u2019t let him touch me there.</p><p>I clench my eyes shut. Clutch the duvet. He gently kisses me through my underwear, and then his fingers move below until tingles rush through my body, leaving me out of breath. Relieved. Then I tug his boxers off and move my hand up and down until he comes. He breathes in and out, panting, his eyes shut tightly, and pulls me up against him.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says, smiling. Just that one word makes me feel so many things. I feel proud, I feel remorse, I feel tingly all over, I feel responsibility. I feel loved.</p><p>I breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you need to leave?\u201d I ask quietly, playing with his hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a curfew. I\u2019ll call my parents later and tell them I\u2019m sleeping at the DTK house...Is it okay for me to stay?\u201d</p><p>I answer him with a long kiss that leaves us both breathless again.</p><p>We relax against each other, cuddling, and he begins tracing the freckles on my arms. He touches everywhere, as if worshipping my body.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d he asks, rubbing a thumb over the purplish bruise on my knee.</p><p>\u201cTripped on a rock in the driveway. I fell.\u201d</p><p>He drags a finger up and down my surgical scar. He talks against my lips, kissing me. \u201cClumsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook away, I\u2019m hideous,\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cFar from it. I\u2019m the hideous one.\u201d He chuckles, but I can hear the emotion in his voice. Does he really believe that?</p><p>He dips a hand between my legs again and guilt courses through me. I clutch at the hair at the nape of his neck, and even though my parents aren\u2019t home, I try not to make noise.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think you\u2019re hideous?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He kisses my chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Tell me.\u201d I trace the soft hair on his lower stomach and wait for an answer.</p><p>\u201cTom\u2019s a lot taller than me, and he got into a better school... Sarah, um, liked him more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who was your best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He rolls over to focus on the ceiling, where candlelight dances. I let him think. He doesn\u2019t say anything, so I slowly begin kissing his neck, and that turns into us making out again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about Tom and Sarah anymore, okay?\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He tucks my head under his chin. And we fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>I sit up straight. Emily\u2019s here. Standing in the doorway. Staring at me.</p><p>I grab my duvet up to my chest, to cover myself. I\u2019m in only my bra and panties. She looks from the discarded clothes littering the rug to Matt, who lifts himself into a sitting position and rubs his eyes, then secures the sheet around his waist.</p><p>\u201cHi\u2014\u201d I begin, but Emily starts yelling.</p><p>\u201cYou hypocrite!\u201d she cries.</p><p>I clutch my duvet tighter. My breathing races.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Matt,\u201d he says, stretching a hand out to her. When she doesn\u2019t take it, he ruffles his hair and reaches down to pick his boxers up off the floor. He doesn\u2019t seem all that concerned he\u2019s naked in front of someone he\u2019s never met.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been giving me such shit for months,\u201d Emily exclaims, \u201cAnd you\u2019re sleeping with some random guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not random,\u201d he says, and I blurt, \u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s okay for you to fool around but I can\u2019t? Jacob and I were in love and you were such a bitch anytime you found out we did something\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I shouldn\u2019t have let him touch me. He shouldn\u2019t have spent the night.</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d I try to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a hypocrite. I can\u2019t believe I wasted my time coming over here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trembling. \u201cWhy did you come over?\u201d</p><p>She looks at the ceiling, shaking her head. Tears pool, filling her lower lids. \u201cI felt bad for how I treated you when you came by. I figured you were off work this weekend...I wanted to apologize...and maybe talk about everything. I knocked and rang the doorbell and you didn\u2019t answer. I noticed a strange Jeep was here...I got scared. I found the spare key.\u201d She glances at Matt, who\u2019s now trying to wrangle himself into his underwear beneath the comforter.</p><p>\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Matt,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>Her eyebrows furrow and lines zip across her forehead. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot y\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was your best friend.\u201d She turns and slams my bedroom door.</p><p>I cover my eyes, letting the duvet fall to my waist. I let out a low cry.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Matt whispers. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What was that all about?\u201d He tries to hug me but I shrug him away and pick my duvet back up, so he can\u2019t see my body. He shouldn\u2019t see any part of me. We\u2019re not married. What was I thinking? We didn\u2019t have sex, but last night was a sin.</p><p>We woke up in the middle of the night and started all over again. I touched him, and when I think about how good it felt when his hands explored my skin, I shudder. When he touched me with his mouth, my entire body relaxed, and I felt sensations I\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>Tears begin to drip down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d he says gently.</p><p>\u201cPlease go,\u201d I say, wiping my face on my duvet.</p><p>He scoots closer. \u201cNo. Tell me what\u2019s wrong. Why didn\u2019t you tell your best friend about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my best friend anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. Please, just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stand up, pulling the sheet around me.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2014please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust go! I can\u2019t do this.

His face contorts in pain. He bites his lips together and his eyes gloss over. \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I go into the bathroom, still wearing the sheet around me like a beach towel, locking the door, sitting down on the toilet. He bangs on the door and says my name. Over and over. Fritz starts barking. I lean onto my knees and count the tiny sky blue tiles because it\u2019s the only thing I know to do.</p> <p>After I don\u2019t know how long, the knocking ends.</p><p>His voice goes away.</p><p>When I come out of the bathroom, I pull on a bathrobe and find Fritz moving in circles. I discover a note written in Matt\u2019s shaky cursive, lying on my bed.</p><p>I care about you more than anything. What did I do wrong? Please, let\u2019s not do this.</p><p>I don\u2019t completely understand what that last line means. But it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>God tested my faith, and I failed.</p> <p>something i can never draw</p><p>what happened on april 27</p><p>The sun was rising when I picked Emily up at her house.</p><p>She told her mom she was riding with me to school, but really we drove to the women\u2019s center in Nashville. I stopped at a Walgreens, to buy all of her favorite candies. Sour Patch Kids, Twizzlers, Jolly Ranchers.</p><p>She clutched the arm rest and her lower lip trembled.</p><p>I kept reaching over to squeeze her hand.</p><p>I turned on the classical radio station for her.</p><p>I listened to her sniffle. Watched the tears fall from her eyes.</p> <p>I handed her Kleenex after Kleenex.</p><p>At the clinic, a nurse escorted us into an exam room, and I helped Emily take her clothes off and slip on a flimsy paper robe. I folded her shirt, bra, underwear, and jeans into a pile. I passed her more Kleenex and tried to ignore the smell. It was probably all in my mind but I felt like chemicals were burning the inside of my nose.</p><p>A woman came in and asked Emily if she was sure, if she had explored all her options.</p><p>\u201cDid you think deeply about this? Did you discuss it with the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emily lied.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Emily\u2019s responses would\u2019ve changed anything, but the counselor had to ask the questions. I never stopped holding Emily\u2019s hand except for when the doctor made me. I couldn\u2019t stop closing my eyes.</p><p>I kept thinking of my butterfly paintings, how colors drip from the wings.</p><p>The doctor gave Emily a sedative and she finally loosened up. The tears dried up somewhat.</p><p>It was over in ten minutes.</p><p>I can\u2019t forget.</p><p>where heaven meets the earth</p><p>july 8 ~ week 5 of 7</p><p>My weekend just got worse.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over group assignments for this week,\u201d Megan says. \u201cEric, you\u2019ve got the all-boys group. Ian, your partner is Parker. Will, you\u2019re with Carlie. Andrea is with Brad. Matt, you\u2019re with Kate.\u201d</p><p>I glance up. He looks hurt and pissed.</p><p>He must\u2019ve called a hundred times since yesterday, and he wrote me ten emails, repeating over and over how much he cares for me, wanting to know what he did wrong, telling me he misses me already. On one voicemail he said, \u201cIs this \u2019cause I haven\u2019t taken you to Just Tacos yet? Because we can fix that right now.\u201d He laughed softly into the phone and quietly said, \u201cSeriously, though? I want to fix whatever went wrong between us. Can we talk? You\u2019re the most important thing, um...\u201d He cleared his throat. Stayed silent. \u201cPlease call me back.\u201d</p><p>I saved the voicemail and started crying all over again.</p><p>I barely pay attention during the staff meeting. Everyone decides to grill hot dogs for dinner, but I\u2019m not hungry. I excuse myself and haul my sleeping bag and suitcase over to Bluebird in Birdland. There, I turn out the lights, curl up in bed, and try not to think, even though the sun hasn\u2019t completely set. I can\u2019t even cry because I\u2019m so confused and upset and my mind is whirring thoughts around like the box fan.</p><p>I\u2019m a hypocrite.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine living without Matt.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine living without Emily, either, but I\u2019ve survived the past two months.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly midnight when I hear the knock on the door. Is it him? I hope it is, but I hope it isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I call out with a faint voice.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay with you tonight?\u201d It\u2019s Parker.</p><p>I climb out of the rickety bed and pad to the screen door. A humid mist hangs around the porch light. She studies my face, which is probably swollen and covered in red blotches. I let her in, and she unrolls her sleeping bag across the bed next to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will?\u201d \u263a</p><p>\u201cSleeping in Dogwood with everybody else.\u201d She fluffs her pillow and kicks off her flip-flops.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather be with him?\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth lifts. \u201cI always want to be with him. But I thought we could hang out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Will told me that Matt said y\u2019all broke up.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my lip and crawl on top of my sleeping bag. Parker flips the light off and we lie down. Matt is the last thing I want to talk about.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you majoring in at college?\u201d I ask, watching a shadow dance on the ceiling.</p><p>Her bed creaks as she gets comfy. \u201cBiology. I want to become a vet, I think...You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I play with the zipper on my sleeping bag. The fan blows warm air across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of design. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good. You\u2019ve got the artistic skills.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells and I nearly reach to squeeze her hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I listen to the crickets and try not to think about anything important. I always think about Matt when I have nothing to distract me. Tomorrow is Chicken O\u2019 Rings Day. It\u2019s so hot in here, I could go creek stomping right now, just to cool off. If I were the camp director, I\u2019d get new mattresses for the cabins.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Kate? Everything seemed to be going great for you and Matt. Did he do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah...but I did.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cHe wants to work things out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about it right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She rolls over to face the wall.</p><p>I fold my hands behind my head and bite down on my tongue to distract myself from the pain in my heart.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d I say into the dark.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of evolution? Do you believe in God?\u201d</p><p>She goes silent for a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty personal question...\u201d</p><p>I bite into my lip.</p><p>She adds, \u201cI do believe in God, but my relationship with him is private...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing against you...I just don\u2019t like to talk about it anymore...with anybody. I don\u2019t even talk about it with my parents anymore. Or with Will.\u201d</p><p>I smile slowly. \u201cThanks for telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that religion is a personal thing. It\u2019s hard for me to share.\u201d</p><p>Matt prays and wears a cross but still goes to parties. He hangs out with people who drink. He worships God but does it in his own way. Just like Parker. That isn\u2019t to say that what Brother Michael and Brother John preach at church is wrong, but what if it\u2019s different for different people?</p><p>I\u2019ve wondered if it\u2019s okay to worship somewhere in the middle.</p><p>But can I fit these people who worship in the middle into my life?</p><p>Can I hang out with people who don\u2019t believe in God at all? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re that much different from me, really.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the noise. Another knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cPark?\u201d I hear Will say. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She sits up and a smile flits across her face. She goes to the door, where she puts a hand up to the screen and he traces her fingers as they talk quietly. I can hear her explaining that I don\u2019t need any guys hanging around tonight upsetting me, and I say a quick prayer, thanking Him for her. The friend who became a friend when I wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>And like that night Matt slept on the porch, Will drags a bed through the door and drops it onto the deck with a thud. Then he comes back in and drags another bed through the door.</p><p>Parker asks, \u201cWhy do you need two beds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s for Matt. His idea, not mine.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath.</p><p>Matt doesn\u2019t speak, but he\u2019s out there. Soon everyone is settled in their beds, and all I can hear are crickets and frogs and other animals.</p><p>Parker speaks again. \u201cI love you, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d he replies.</p><p>She must\u2019ve told him this weekend. Or did he tell her first?</p><p>My stomach leaps into my throat. I want to hear Matt say those words so bad. I wish God would tell me what to do. If I should be with Matt or if I made a big mistake when I sinned. Why would God give me Matt, someone who makes me feel so good, only to take him away? Would God really do something that selfish and mean to me?</p><p>I scrunch my pillow under my head, and the memory of our first kiss plays over and over in my mind.</p><p>When Matt speaks to me, it\u2019s not to tell me he loves me, but somehow it\u2019s even better.</p><p>\u201cKate, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>On Monday morning before the new group of campers arrive, I\u2019m out jogging laps around the big field under a humid sunny sky when Brad runs up next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Matt,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brad shakes his head and even though we\u2019re running, he snaps his eyes shut. \u201cI did something stupid...\u201d</p><p>Honestly, right now, I don\u2019t care about anything except that I\u2019m not dating Matt anymore, but the pull to be a good friend is greater. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday morning I was down at the lake, fishing for my breakfast, and the guy who mows the grass saw me. He knows I was here on a weekend. He told on me to Megan. I told her that you and I were here together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might get fired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t, you won\u2019t,\u201d he stutters. \u201cI told her it was all my idea. I told her you wanted to learn to fish better, so I agreed to meet you here early to practice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d I touch my forehead. \u201cYou could have asked first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time\u2014she put me on the spot and I\u2019m telling you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she fire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He bites into his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cYou used me...\u201d I fold my arms across my stomach.</p><p>That\u2019s when Megan appears on the trail. She blows her whistle, shouts, \u201cKate!\u201d and beckons me toward her cabin.</p><p>I wipe the sweat off my forehead with my T-shirt and climb the Great Oak steps, then pull the screen door open and sit beside Megan\u2019s desk. She settles in her chair and twirls her whistle, regarding me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fold my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why you were here yesterday morning before camp started?\u201d</p><p>I touch my chest. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Eric had suggested I get some pointers on fishing,\u201d I lie. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not very good at it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric suggested this?\u201d she asks, touching her lips. She looks at the wall, thinking.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I lie again. Eric gives so much unsolicited advice, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d say he suggested the extra training if asked. Even though Brad broke the rules, I don\u2019t want him to have to go live with his drunk father. \u201cI asked Brad to give me some extra training. I thought it would be okay since it was just a few hours before camp started and you made me get that extra help in campfires from Eric that time\u2014\u201d</p><p>She holds up a hand. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>Am I about to get fired?</p> <p>She fluffs her curly hair and stares me down. \u201cYou knew the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d I say with a strong voice. We have three weeks left. If Brad were to get fired, he would miss out on a thousand bucks. What if he had to live with his dad again? What if his dad hurt him bad?</p><p>Sometimes it\u2019s okay to do the wrong thing if you\u2019re helping someone, I guess. But I hate lying.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d I say.</p><p>She twirls her whistle and takes a deep breath. \u201cBecause Eric had suggested the training, I\u2019ll let this go with a warning on your written record. But if you make any other mistakes this summer, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to tell the regional conference to let you go. I won\u2019t risk my job or my future on employees who disregard everything I say.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burn. I\u2019ve worked hard this summer. Hard. And it\u2019s not like she tells me I\u2019m doing a good job very often. What if my church finds out Megan thinks I\u2019m a bad employee? My parents?</p> <p>With one lie, I let Brad ruin all my hard work. And even though I understand why he did it, he threw me under the bus.</p><p>I tell Megan, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>I rush out of Great Oak, storm past Brad into the bathhouse, and stare in the mirror as the tears streak my face. The paper towels feel like sandpaper against my skin.</p><p>Carlie comes in to use the bathroom and catches me wiping my cheeks at the sink. Red circles ring my eyes. She washes her hands, and in the mirror, I watch as she gives me a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Matt,\u201d she whispers, stealing a glance over her shoulder.</p><p>I blow my nose. \u201cThanks. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Before she pushes the screen door open, Carlie says, \u201cI know how much he cares about you.\u201d</p><p>I stay in the bathhouse until it\u2019s time for campers to arrive. When I push the screen door open, letting it slam behind me, I find Ian and Carlie talking quietly. He gives me a long hug and says, \u201cI\u2019m here if you want to talk.\u201d</p> <p>As we walk together to the welcome pavilion, I peek at them out of the corner of my eye. They waited for me? They are better friends with Andrea than with me, but staying behind to make sure I\u2019m okay is one of the nicest things anyone\u2019s ever done for me.</p><p>After the kids have checked in, Matt and I lead our group of eight-year-olds along the trails back to the Bluebird cabins.</p><p>It seems that all of the little girls packed way too much. It\u2019s like they were planning to be away from home for months, because Matt has tons of bags draped over his arms and shoulders. I can\u2019t help but smile at him carrying a Hello Kitty purse.</p><p>\u201cWhy did y\u2019all bring so much stuff?\u201d yells Charles, a little boy. I can already tell he\u2019ll be a handful.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Matt says to Charles. \u201cYou never say things like that to a lady. The reason they have so much stuff is so they have all the outfits they need to look beautiful every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww,\u201d says Isabella, a girl with blond curls.</p><p>On the inside, I\u2019m saying awww too. On the inside, it\u2019s killing me that I broke things off with him. But what else am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t control myself when he\u2019s around.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Matt asks me as he lugs all the bags and purses up the rickety wooden steps to my cabin.</p><p>I look over at him and nod, telling myself not to cry again.</p><p>Once the kids have unpacked their stuff, we sit Indian style on Matt\u2019s porch and play the animal introduction game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider Scott,\u201d says a wiry boy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lizard Leslie,\u201d says a girl, chewing gum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Miniature Poodle Matt.\u201d</p><p>The kids roar with laughter. I look into his questioning eyes. I pick at my thumbnail, ripping my cuticle, wishing I didn\u2019t have to be so close to him this week. Miniature Poodle Matt reminds me of our first kiss. It reminds me of how he said I saved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m King Crab Kate,\u201d I say, and he glances away.</p><p>He says, \u201cAfter we go over camp rules, who wants to play my special new dodgeball game?\u201d</p><p>The kids start screaming, \u201cMe! Me!\u201d</p><p>I pull my knees to my chest. On the inside, I\u2019m screaming \u201cMe!\u201d too.</p><p>At lunch, Brad scoots a chair up next to me. \u201cYou okay? Did you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>I deliberately turn to face him. \u201cWritten warning.\u201d</p><p>He blows air out, nodding. \u201cThank you. Seriously.\u201d His eyes dart around.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a written warning?\u201d</p><p>His mouth falls open, then he closes it. He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I ever want a job referral?! I can\u2019t believe this,\u201d I say through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you care,\u201d I hiss. \u201cIsn\u2019t your big plan to blow out of Tennessee in a couple weeks? You didn\u2019t want any connections, right? So why would hurting a friend like me matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles. He gulps down some lemonade, peeking at me out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d I stand, pick up my tray, and move to sit with another group of campers. I grab a seat next to a little redheaded girl who immediately asks if I love Barbies.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I reply with a smile. \u201cI also like American Girl. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She pops a chicken o\u2019 ring in her mouth and chews with her mouth open.</p><p>A few tables away, Matt\u2019s talking with Andrea. She\u2019s up to her same old antics, touching his arms and laughing at everything he says. He smiles back at her, but it\u2019s a blank smile. It\u2019s not the smile I\u2019ve seen so many times. His expression is dark and sad.</p><p>I can understand how Emily got pregnant. When I\u2019m with Matt, I stop thinking about everything but him. It\u2019s just him, him, him, and me. It\u2019s only about us. It must have been the same way between Emily and Jacob.</p><p>I\u2019ve been told my whole life that our God is a jealous God and that he comes first. I\u2019ve done everything He\u2019s ever told me to do up until the past few months. And while following God always felt right, so did helping Emily. It felt right to help her, just like it feels right when I\u2019m kissing Matt or cuddling with Matt or sharing myself with Matt. It felt right to help Brad too, but look at what happened. He betrayed me.</p><p>We\u2019re only on the Earth for a tiny amount of time. God says we\u2019re supposed to love our neighbors. But then my preachers at church tell me we\u2019re only supposed to fall in love with other Christians.</p><p>And it\u2019s all so confusing.</p><p>I want to tell Emily that I understand why she did what she did with Jacob. I may never understand why she decided to get an abortion, but now I know what it\u2019s like to get swept up in love.</p><p>But if I were to try to talk to Emily, would she call me a hypocrite and never want to see me again? Because I wouldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>I play with my chicken o\u2019 rings. I poke my green beans with a fork.</p><p>I look up at Matt, watching him talk quietly with Andrea, and I want to tell him I love him. But I\u2019m still scared of being with him because my body does what it wants\u2014my hands touch him all over and my lips roam everywhere.</p><p>Deep inside, I feel God\u2019s love in my heart, and I know I shouldn\u2019t be with Matt until I can control myself. But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to do that. Is it healthy to have a love like that anyway? A love where you throw aside all caution and dive right in?</p><p>I love him.</p><p>But I can\u2019t be with him.</p><p>I pick up my tray and approach Matt. Andrea gives me her patented death glare, and he stares out the window.</p><p>I scrape my green beans onto his tray. He looks up at me, scratching his neck, his eyes clouded with pain and confusion. I return my tray to the dishwashing window and head outside into the sun to think.</p><p>After the Thursday Night Dance, we take the campers to the Woodsong Chapel for devotion.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019re doing something special,\u201d Megan says. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this every week, but I just felt like we should tonight. If you have something you can\u2019t let go of or can\u2019t forget about, write it down on the piece of paper I handed you and throw it in the fire. You can also pray for someone using this slip of paper. It\u2019s just between you and God.\u201d</p><p>I crinkle the paper between my fingers and thumb. I want God to take it all out of my hands and show me what to do already.</p><p>In front of me, the fire roars. A movement stirs out of the corner of my eye and I turn to see Matt strutting down the path toward the flames. He stands there a moment before wadding up his paper and chucking it into the fire. Then he kneels at the altar, shuts his eyes, and prays. His cross charm swings back and forth.</p><p>I write on my sheet of paper, Please show me the truth.</p><p>No one else has approached the fire yet except for Matt. I follow the same path he took and let my paper float into the flames. I watch it burn into nothing and listen to it crackle. I kneel at the altar and clear my head, focusing on the crickets chirping and the noises of other bugs. Listen to the sound of water running into the creek down by the lake. Smell the pine and cedar. Sometimes nature is the closest thing to God.</p><p>I raise my head and find Matt still bowing with his eyes closed. He scratches his ear. The movement reminds me of how fragile he is\u2014that he put himself back out there after Sarah because of me. Wind whips through the fire. I pull myself to my feet. I kneel next to him and grasp his hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, peeking up at me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek. We shut our eyes, and he gently rubs his thumbs over the backs of my hands. The leaves stop rustling. I can\u2019t hear any kids. I don\u2019t even hear the crackling of burning wood. It\u2019s just me and him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened with Emily,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I reply. \u201cI did a really bad, bad thing.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my fingers. \u201cYou can let whatever it is go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s so bad.\u201d I swallow a sob.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me what happened and I\u2019ll never tell anybody. It\u2019s all you and me. Right here. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Heat flushes my cheeks and my eyes sting, but his hands are wrapped around mine. Tonight I burned the words please show me the truth. As long as I\u2019ve known Matt, he\u2019s worn the clothes he wants to wear, he\u2019s sung the songs he wants to sing. He\u2019s friends with whoever he wants to be friends with, including judgmental Kate Kelly. Me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s the truth.</p><p>\u201cEmily got pregnant,\u201d I begin, glancing around to make sure no one else can hear me. The nearest campers are several feet away. Matt\u2019s gaze never leaves mine as I talk. \u201cShe decided to get an abortion, which is something I would never ever do and I can\u2019t understand how she could do that. But I agreed to help her anyway because she\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>Matt rubs my wrist.</p><p>I keep going, \u201cI drove her to the clinic and helped her get an abortion...I even loaned her money...\u201d I sniffle and wipe a tear away. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about the baby. I drove her there. I paid for it. I helped, you know, to end a life...\u201d</p> <p>Matt tucks my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he mumbles, and fear rushes through me because his eyes move away. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend. I\u2019m glad you were there with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I sinned. The baby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there for Emily. You did something you didn\u2019t believe in because you\u2019re strong. And you care. God definitely forgives you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you just saying that?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles lightly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to the daughter of the killer of Vincent Moose.\u201d</p> <p>I wipe my nose, sniffling and giggling. We grow quiet again. Past Matt, I watch as Ian and Carlie follow our lead, kneeling together at the altar. Ian catches my eye and smiles.</p><p>\u201cAre they official now?\u201d I whisper to Matt, who looks over his shoulder at them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting there, I think...\u201d He squeezes my hand, giving me a mischievous look. \u201cNo changing the subject on me. You should call Emily tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cell reception,\u201d I reply.</p><p>He gives me a look. \u201cThere\u2019s a pay phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d I can\u2019t believe I told Matt my biggest secret. My biggest shame. But I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m standing on the edge of a cliff anymore. I feel like I\u2019m standing on the edge of a cliff with his arms around me.</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you wrote on your paper?\u201d Matt asks, nodding toward the fire. \u201cThe abortion? The baby?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSort of. What did you write about?\u201d</p><p>He glances up at the cross nestled in the trees. \u201cI care about you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd for the longest time, I didn\u2019t date anybody. I didn\u2019t fool around with anybody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on our first date, you said hooking up is different from dating and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t hooked up with anyone,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI never really got over Sarah. I never got over her until that day I saw you again.\u201d</p><p>I exhale, wipe my eye, and then clasp my hands together.</p><p>His mouth lifts into a smirk. \u201cDo you believe in the sign? The rumor that God tells someone something every year at camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe in it...\u201d</p> <p>Matt goes on, \u201cI think God gave you to me, and he gave me to you, so we can both move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove on to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get over what happened to us?\u201d</p><p>He grins a little and takes my hand again. Flames flicker on his face as he looks straight in my eyes. \u201cSo we can live. You can forgive yourself and I can trust again.\u201d</p><p>I bow my head, praying to Him to tell me this is true.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place for this,\u201d Megan says, appearing behind us, interrupting.</p><p>\u201cMegan, give us a minute,\u201d Matt says in a strong voice. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuickly, then,\u201d she says, and goes back to her seat on the log bench.</p><p>Matt is the rock. He makes me want to stand up for what I think is right. Maybe all that matters is that he\u2019s right for me, and I\u2019m right for him.</p><p>\u201cI care about you too,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened with Emily that day. I shouldn\u2019t have stayed the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you there.\u201d</p><p>He leans his forehead against mine. \u201cRemember when I told you about how you saved me when we were younger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He sighs deeply. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you the whole truth. Before I met you, I was so sad. I wanted to end it.\u201d</p><p>Is he saying what I think he\u2019s saying?</p><p>\u201cBut then I prayed here at camp. I hoped I would get the sign. And then I met you. And you were so nice, and you liked my music, it gave me a reason to keep on for a while. Then Jenn was born and I felt like I had a reason to exist.\u201d</p><p>Tears are flowing down my cheeks now.</p><p>\u201cI guess what I mean is,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m here because of you.\u201d</p><p>sketch #378</p><p>heaven</p><p>That night after the kids are asleep, I decide to take a walk out to the big field, to look at the stars. I sit down on the grass and sketch by moonlight, drawing the constellations. My paper looks like a game of Connect the Dots.</p><p>Ever since Matt asked where Heaven is, I\u2019ve thought about it when I\u2019m outside at night. Staring at the stars reminds me of how tiny I am, how I\u2019m just one person. Being in the darkness makes me wonder if there really is a God and a Heaven and a Hell. Even though I can feel God inside me, a small part of me still worries that when I die, nothing will be there.</p><p>The Earth existed before I was born, and it will exist when I die.</p><p>What if all that is me is just gone?</p><p>The thought of that makes me feel more alone than ever. I miss Emily. I miss Matt. I can\u2019t imagine spending my time on Earth without them. Because eternity is a long, lonely time.</p><p>I connect the dots of the Big Dipper. Then I hear the sound of feet crunching grass.</p><p>I look up to find him. I stare and he stares back, and then we\u2019re together.</p><p>I\u2019m kissing him so fast and hard I get dizzy. Before I got my first real boyfriend, I thought about the kissing, but I never imagined the details\u2014how his lips would be warm and wet and how his calloused fingers would feel rough yet soft against my skin. His hands settle in my hair, weaving through the strands. I hug him tight to me, trying to ignore the feelings building in my body. We kiss again and I can tell his body is buzzing like mine.</p><p>When I get back to Bluebird later that night, I finish connecting the dots of the constellations.</p><p>Is Matt right? Did God connect us together?</p><p>What will Matt say when I tell him I can\u2019t move this fast? I\u2019m falling in love with him, but I can\u2019t let myself get into a situation where he and I could have sex. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>friends</p><p>monday, july 16 ~ week 6 of 7</p><p>Will is grinning at me.</p><p>Today I\u2019m using my break to work on an acrylic painting of the big field. And Will just showed up in the art pavilion out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask him, wiping the hair out of my face and going back to my painting.</p><p>He comes toward me, dipping his hands into his khaki shorts pockets. \u201cI was just thinking about how if I didn\u2019t have Parker and you asked me to prom now, I definitely would say yes.\u201d</p><p>That statement hurts, but it\u2019s a good hurt. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re more relaxed. And confident. You\u2019re pretty. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Parker\u2019s makeover that she\u2019s always bragging about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably it then, eh?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hair behind my ears. \u201cI\u2019m kinda glad you didn\u2019t say yes to prom, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. Matt\u2019s a good fit for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Parker is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>I point at him with my paintbrush. \u201cNo cursing in my art pavilion.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>At lunch, I\u2019m sitting with my campers, talking about how we\u2019ll make friendship bracelets later, when Matt leans over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBoo,\u201d he says, making the girls laugh.</p><p>I smile at him, feeling the heat from his cheek warming mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He holds his tray above mine and scrapes his green beans onto my plate. \u201cDon\u2019t you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how much you love them,\u201d he replies with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He squeezes my shoulder and begins to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Matt,\u201d I tell his back. Completely out of the blue. I cover my mouth. Wait for this eternity of a silence to end.</p><p>Slowly he turns around and leans down to quickly kiss my cheek in front of all the campers, who all start going \u201cWooo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>We smile at each other. He throws his backpack over a shoulder, puts his tray away, and heads toward the pool. I\u2019m still beaming when I look up to find Megan staring my way, shaking her head. Whatever.</p><p>On Wednesday, Parker and I are sitting on the dock taking a break, dangling our feet in the lake. She\u2019s wearing a white bikini and I\u2019m wearing a new navy blue one I just bought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want camp to end,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not looking forward to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am...but I\u2019ll miss you and Matt and Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we\u2019re at different colleges, Will and I will be in Nashville with you, and Matt\u2019s less than thirty minutes away, right?\u201d</p><p>I nudge a bit of algae with my toe. \u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for camp to be over. Will and I want to take a road trip to Florida the week before college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his parents? Or your mom or dad?\u201d</p><p>She steals a breath before answering. \u201cJust us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I jiggle my feet, splashing. \u201cSounds fun. I kinda wish I could\u2019ve gone with Matt to Cabo during the Fourth of July break. He told me about this art gallery he found there and now I really want to see it.\u201d</p><p>Parker narrows her eyes at me, her mouth arranged in a knowing smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot this summer.\u201d</p><p>I sit on my hands. \u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I feel like you\u2019re getting to know yourself better, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She swings her feet back and forth. \u201cI spent too long worrying about what other people think.\u201d</p><p>I dangle my feet in the water and splash.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Matt are back together?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI think so...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says slowly.</p><p>\u201cI know you said that your relationship with God is private, but I\u2019m wondering, um, if you\u2019re okay with the physical parts of your relationship with Will? Um, that you talked about that day at lunch at the mall?\u201d</p><p>She stares across the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of between me and Will. Like, any decisions we make, we make together.\u201d</p><p>The conversation with Daddy comes to mind. I can believe in God if I want to believe in God. Parker can do what she wants to do with Will. It\u2019s her decision. Just like I have choices to make when it comes to my boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I broke things off with Matt before is because we went too far too fast.\u201d</p><p>Parker nods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to balance how much I love him with what we do, um, in terms of making out or whatever.

Um\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was uncomfortable. But I felt so close to him.\u201d She folds her arms across her stomach. \u201cI liked it more the second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he like it?\u201d I can\u2019t help but ask. \u201cWas it his first time?\u201d</p> <p>She raises her eyebrows, then nods. \u201cHe can\u2019t wait for this weekend so we can try it again. Boys.\u201d She shakes her head, smiling, and bites her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you and I are friends,\u201d Parker says quietly. \u201cSometimes I wonder if I got the sign this summer. I really needed a friend.\u201d She tucks her chin against her chest.</p><p>I splash the water with my feet. Maybe this is where heaven meets the earth. Or maybe because we think we might get a sign, we\u2019re more flexible to change and new experiences.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s all about a willingness to be open.</p><p>\u201cWant to swim?\u201d I ask, and she launches herself into the lake, where we spend the rest of our break splashing, telling stories, and laughing.</p> <p>That night, I\u2019m walking back from the bathhouse when I hear a guitar crooning in the night. I make my way down the trail past Pinecone to the cookout area, where I find Matt sitting on a picnic table, plucking the strings. He has a lazy smile on his face as he\u2019s playing \u201cRhythm of Love\u201d by the Plain White T\u2019s. I sit next to him and play with his hair until he finishes the song and sets his guitar aside.</p><p>\u201cWant to take a walk?\u201d he asks, slipping his hand into mine. In silence, we go up to the big field and stand under the stars. It\u2019s like we\u2019re the only people left on earth.</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck, and the kissing starts slowly. Then he\u2019s gently pushing me down to the grass. His mouth is on mine and I fit my body against his.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispers, breathing deeply. I tell him I love him back, and he bends to my stomach. He kisses a trail from my belly button down and even though our clothes are still on, I whisper, \u201cMatt, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nods and moves up to lie next to me. I clear my throat. An awkward silence hangs on the air. I love him and want to show him and I can\u2019t stop thinking of touching his soft boxer shorts.</p><p>My fingers move without permission. I unbutton his shorts and unzip them. He cups my face and runs a hand through my hair.</p><p>Then I hear laughter behind me. Matt quickly zips his shorts. We sit up and smooth our clothes.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Andrea says sarcastically, walking by with Carlie. They must\u2019ve been out at the lake, smoking.</p> <p>\u201cNow I\u2019m pissed at her,\u201d Matt says to me with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cJust now?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look and pulls me to his chest. \u201cIan told me that Brad and Andrea hooked up behind the cafeteria last night.\u201d</p><p>I shove his shoulder, laughing. \u201cLies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! They were in Ian\u2019s spot and he got pissed.\u201d</p><p>Still laughing, we lie back down in the grass. \u201cYou never slept with Sarah, right?\u201d</p><p>He curls up beside me and drapes an arm across my stomach, slipping a hand under the hem of my shirt. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat.</p><p>He must think I\u2019m asking to have sex because he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do it out here in the grass...we should wait until we have a bed. And no parental units around asking me to mow the lawn.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I can\u2019t think of a better place than the big field under endless stars, but it\u2019s not the time. \u201cI, um, Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need a long time. To get ready, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent for a while. He twines his fingers with mine and lifts my hand to his mouth, running his lips along my skin. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asks finally.</p><p>It could be years. It should be when I get married. What if Matt isn\u2019t the one?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it,\u201d he replies, and I\u2019m glad he wants to discuss it, because it seems like the mature relationship-y thing to do, but I\u2019m terrified.</p><p>Adult relationships are confusing and scary.</p><p>\u201cBedtime,\u201d he says. He disentangles himself from my arms and helps me to my feet. He keeps an eye on my knee, making sure I don\u2019t bend it some weird way. It would suck if Matt isn\u2019t the one, because I can\u2019t imagine anything better than him.</p><p>But will he wait for me?</p><p>something new</p><p>friday, july 27 ~ week 7 of 7</p><p>On the last day of camp, we\u2019re waving good-bye to the final group of campers. Cars drive down the dirt road leading out of camp, kicking up dust. The sight makes my eyes water.</p><p>Then everyone starts cheering and hugging.</p><p>Megan blows her whistle. I wince. I want to make it my business to snatch that whistle and throw it in the lake.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s clean-up day,\u201d she announces. \u201cEveryone should spend the day cleaning out your closets and packing up your supplies for storage back at regional conference headquarters.\u201d</p><p>Ian whispers in my ear. \u201cIt takes like ten minutes and then we get to spend the rest of the day hanging out at the pool and grilling steaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedium rare, please,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He pats my shoulder, grinning.</p><p>We all go home tomorrow. I look around at these people who have become my friends (and enemies!) and feel a pang of sadness that I won\u2019t wake up to see Matt and Parker every day.</p><p>Sure enough, Ian was right. After we\u2019re done packing, we spend the afternoon lounging by the pool. Even Megan and Eric relax, reading. She thumbs through a magazine about motivational leadership or something and his book is called Build Your Own Swamp. Will goes to the supermarket and brings back soda and chips and cookies and Ian\u2019s steaks.</p><p>I lie on a towel next to Matt and hold his hand. We smile at each other, sharing my iPod\u2014each of us using a headphone. At one point I gaze over Matt\u2019s shoulder to find Andrea and Brad chatting and laughing together. He tucks her hair behind her ear. What...?</p><p>After tanning our brains out\u2014well, Matt tans, and I just get more and more freckles\u2014we stand up and shake the dirt off our towels. Brad waves at me, looking sad.</p><p>\u201cWant me to beat him up?\u201d Matt whispers, pressing his forehead to mine. When I told Matt what happened, I nearly yanked his arm out of its socket, trying to keep him from confronting Brad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I kiss Matt\u2019s nose, then walk over to Brad and touch his forearm. Life\u2019s too short not to forgive.</p><p>\u201cWant to make steak with us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>A smile sweeps across his face. \u201cYeah. Listen, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>I interrupt, \u201cYou have to keep in touch when you leave. Let me know how you are.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a hug, propping his chin on top of my head. \u201cI will. I will.\u201d</p><p>That evening while Ian grills steaks and bakes potatoes over a fire, we have a Bonzo Ball tournament. I get knocked out in the first round. Will and Matt make it to the finals, and we\u2019re all screaming and cheering for them. Matt accidentally sneezes and loses concentration, allowing Will to win the tournament as the sun sets.</p><p>Before dinner, Ian asks, \u201cWho wants to have one last Critter Crawl?\u201d and Parker shoves him. Right as we sit down to eat, Eric emerges from the trees, carrying three trout he wants to grill.</p><p>\u201cI love me some surf n\u2019 turf!\u201d Ian says, and Eric beams.</p><p>\u201cI made some spices using plants I found in the woods,\u201d Eric replies.</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s weed,\u201d I hear Carlie muttering to Ian, and he laughs and kisses her cheek.</p><p>When Megan and Eric leave to make sure the camp\u2019s gate is locked (Ian asks, \u201cIs that what they\u2019re calling it these days?\u201d), the guys decide to play basketball. Andrea and Parker want to watch them, leaving me and Carlie alone.</p><p>She looks over and asks, \u201cCan you weave some of your friendship bracelet string into my hair? Like into little braids or something?\u201d</p><p>We walk over to the art pavilion, where I dig string out of a packed box and perch on top of a picnic table, motioning for Carlie to sit on the bench between my legs.</p><p>\u201cHow about pink, black, and blue?\u201d I ask, sorting through the string.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I braid the colors through her blond hair until the silence is about to kill me. She and I have nothing in common, but she and Ian have been good to me, and I\u2019ll never forget how understanding she was during my temporary split with Matt, even though she\u2019s better friends with Andrea.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you and Ian want to hang out with me and Matt sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a double date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a little sigh. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re in a relationship, huh? You go on double dates. You don\u2019t get plastered and end up in some random guy\u2019s dorm room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cYou go to Chili\u2019s. And maybe the Fun Tunnel.\u201d</p><p>I finish her hair, then we go corral our boyfriends before they end up playing ball all night.</p><p>On my first night here, the sky faded to a brilliant purple and orange. Tonight, it\u2019s the same colors. Then, I sat in my car and prayed for the sign. God gave me Matt and Parker this summer, but my life still isn\u2019t perfect. Emily\u2019s not here.</p><p>I close my eyes and breathe in the sweet summer air laced with honeysuckle. When the stars are shining vividly, I catch Brad and Andrea sneaking off together, and Matt takes my hand and leads me out to the big field, where six mattresses are set up on top of the giant parachute. My body goes tense.</p><p>\u201cIs this for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, Will, Ian, and Carlie are coming too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me about this.\u201d</p><p>His nose crinkles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. We\u2019re all friends, just hanging out.\u201d</p><p>I whisper, \u201cCan you and I have separate mattresses?\u201d</p><p>He furrows his eyebrows, but then he bobs his head up and down. We push our mattresses close together and lie on top of our sleeping bags, staring at each other.</p><p>When Will and Parker arrive, they barely throw us a glance because they are too busy making out. Already.</p><p>Then Ian and Carlie appear off the trail. She\u2019s riding on his back.</p><p>\u201cHands where I can see \u2019em!\u201d Ian calls to Matt, cracking up. He and Carlie collapse onto a mattress on the other side of the parachute and start roughhousing, beating the crap out of each other.</p><p>\u201cThis is totally romantic,\u201d I say, deadpan. Matt turns his face toward mine, laughing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We can share a bed alone anytime we want now. I have my own room at school this semester. Because I\u2019m a junior.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I circle his wrists with my hands. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, not so sure I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo share a bed?\u201d His eyebrow pops up.</p><p>\u201cI told you it would be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t share a bed?\u201d He pulls me closer. \u201cI love lying next to you.\u201d He gently kisses my jaw. \u201cWe\u2019ve already spent the night together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love lying in bed with you too...but it\u2019s not right for me...yet.\u201d</p><p>His body stiffens. He pulls away. \u201cAm I not any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, furrowing my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAm I not any good...?\u201d His voice cracks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, Ma\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t hook up.\u201d</p><p>His hands tighten around my waist; he studies my eyes. \u201cIs this because of Emily? You think you might get pregnant or something? I would never let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that! It\u2019s about me not wanting to do this yet.\u201d</p><p>His eyes go glossy. \u201cWill you ever want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I want to sleep with you tonight, but it is something I want to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I clasp his wrists. \u201cI need time\u2014\u201d</p><p>He drops his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s what Sarah said. And then she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you spend the night with me? We don\u2019t have to have sex. I just want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you too.\u201d I rub my cheek.</p><p>His expression suddenly changes. \u201cI don\u2019t want camp to end,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat if things aren\u2019t the same with us?\u201d</p><p>I grab his hip. \u201cThey will be\u2014I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>We listen to Carlie and Ian screeching and laughing. Then they slip away into the night, probably to fool around behind the cafeteria. Parker and Will are kissing like the world will end in five minutes.</p><p>I turn over and fluff my pillow, trying to ignore the disappointment I feel flowing from Matt. It would be so easy to give him all of me, and I know we\u2019d both be thrilled and happy.</p><p>Free will comes with sacrifice. And sometimes with heartache.</p><p>Jesus sacrificed his entire life for us, but you don\u2019t see Him complaining.</p><p>The next morning, I go to the Woodsong Chapel one last time. At the beginning of the summer, I wondered if I could still love this place without Emily. I can\u2019t love it like I did when she was around, but I love it in a different way. A new way. I sit there on a log bench, thinking of Matt and enjoying the trees and the sounds of animals and rushing water, before walking back to Great Oak.</p><p>I\u2019m signing for my final paycheck when Megan stares me down, as if wanting to ask a question. \u201cTake a seat,\u201d she says, gesturing at the chair across from her.</p><p>I suck on my bottom lip, waiting for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to reapply for a job here next summer?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t really thought about it. I mean, I\u2019m still trying to decide on a major. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>She swings her whistle around a finger. \u201cMaybe you should consider not reapplying. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re right for this kind of work.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>She pulls a piece of paper from her clipboard and examines it. \u201cYou had problems starting fires and occasionally did things I asked you not to. You didn\u2019t have the best discretion in front of the campers. I heard rumors you sleep with Matt in the big field.\u201d She taps her whistle on her desk.</p><p>I duck my head. Yeah, some of that\u2019s true. But what about all the good I did?</p><p>\u201cI worked hard this summer. I can start fires and I\u2019m great at trailblazing and I know about nature and I can pick up crawdaddies now. The campers loved my arts and crafts lessons. I\u2019ve gotten really good at this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to camp on a Sunday morning, when you shouldn\u2019t have been here. What if you\u2019d had an accident? The regional conference doesn\u2019t have insurance for employees on weekends. You could have ruined my career!\u201d Megan goes all red.</p><p>\u201cI apologized for that,\u201d I say, wanting to tell her I never broke that rule.</p><p>I became a great counselor this summer. Megan can believe whatever she wants. For whatever reason she wants. Parker was right when she said Megan is an OCD perfectionist, and if this is the way she wants to run camp? Fine. There\u2019s more than one way to do things and still end up with a great result. It\u2019s not one way or the highway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll apply for the job if I want to apply for the job.\u201d I swallow hard, feeling seven weeks of fury leaking out of me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the regional conference that I did a great job this summer. I learned a lot. I hope they\u2019ll give me a fair shot.\u201d</p><p>She twirls her whistle, as if she\u2019s bored. \u201cI am recommending that you not be rehired. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment, I worry that my church will find out. But then I shake those thoughts out of my head. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I fold my paycheck and slip it into my back pocket. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I turn and march out of the cabin and up the path toward my car.</p><p>I don\u2019t care what she believes. I know what I know. I lied to save Brad, and I\u2019d do it again to keep him away from a drunk parent. If it costs me a job, so be it. Breaking the rules was worth it to help Brad start his new life.</p><p>It\u2019s like with art. You can\u2019t tell someone how to do it, or it\u2019s not her art. You can\u2019t tell someone else how to believe.</p><p>It\u2019s up to God to judge, and for me to help the people I love the best I can.</p><p>At home, I pull on my sneakers and knee brace and fly out my front door, sprinting as fast as I can. It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, but the hurt makes the pain stop. I run around the block fourteen times, then go back home and collapse on my bed.</p><p>The moment I hit my pillow, tears burn my eyes.</p><p>Once you get hurt the first time, the pain never, ever goes away. Maybe it dulls, but it\u2019s always there.</p><p>The pain from some things in my life\u2014kids at school calling me a Jesus Freak, Megan being mean, hurting my knee\u2014will never go away. Helping Emily get an abortion will never leave me. But I can work to run with life again.</p><p>My cell rings. It\u2019s Parker calling to ask if Matt and I want to go out with her and Will tonight. I start tearing up the second she says Matt\u2019s name.</p><p>I\u2019m glad I told him how I feel, and I guess even if things don\u2019t work out with us, I stayed true to myself, and that makes me smile a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCan you come over? Please?\u201d I ask, wiping my nose on my sheet.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>When she gets here, she plops on my bed and pushes the hair away from my face. She opens her bag. \u201cI brought M&amp;Ms.\u201d</p><p>She sits next to me against the headboard and I lean on her shoulder, telling her everything that happened with Matt.</p><p>\u201cSo you told him you won\u2019t share a bed with him?\u201d she asks, choosing a green M&amp;M.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d already spent the night with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkles. \u201cDid you tell him exactly what the issue is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said I can\u2019t sleep over with him.\u201d</p><p>She pours M&amp;Ms into my palm. \u201cAnd then he asked if he\u2019s bad in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I eat a red one and a blue one.</p><p>She leans her head against my shoulder. \u201cYou need to tell him you don\u2019t want to go that far yet and if he\u2019s not okay with that, then you can\u2019t date. But you need to explain what the issue is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were willing to let him sleep over and fool around before but you\u2019re not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got carried away,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid if I sleep over with him, it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably confused and hurt. You need to tell him what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not okay with that, he\u2019s not worth it. He has to respect what you want.\u201d</p><p>I wipe my nose again. \u201cWhat if I want both? What if I want to sleep with him? I know I can\u2019t but I can\u2019t stop thinking of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth options are yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Will ask to have sex a lot before you started?\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes and nods, laughing. \u201cOh, yeah. Will wanted to have sex before we even officially started dating.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>She adds, \u201cBut we only did it when I was ready.\u201d</p><p>She pours M&amp;Ms into her mouth and chews. \u201cI have a question,\u201d she says through a mouthful, and I nod. \u201cWhy the hell do you have all those poor animal heads in your foyer?!\u201d</p><p>After she leaves to meet Will for dinner, I turn my cell phone screen on and off. On and off. I won\u2019t be able to explain over the phone. I open my laptop and start typing an email.</p><p>Matt\u2014I love you. I need to tell you what I believe and what I want...</p><p>Matt doesn\u2019t write back. Not that night. Not the next morning. He hasn\u2019t called or texted. By lunch, I can\u2019t even eat the chicken salad Mom made. I pick the grapes, carrots, and celery out of it and make designs on my plate. Anything to distract me.</p><p>Are things over for me and Matt?</p><p>Then at like 3:00 p.m., Mom calls from downstairs. \u201cHoney! You have a guest.\u201d</p><p>Is it Parker? I don\u2019t bother putting on a bra or changing out of my short pajama shorts before I trudge down to the foyer, where I find Matt standing with Mom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to have your parents over for dinner,\u201d she\u2019s telling him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d like that.\u201d He coughs into a fist before saying hi to me. His Adam\u2019s apple shifts as he swallows, taking me in. Now I wish I\u2019d put real clothes on.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I reply. \u201cCan I get you a lemonade or a sweet tea or anything?\u201d</p><p>He kneads his fingers together. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the other room,\u201d Mom says, squeezing my shoulders. She disappears and leaves me standing with the boy I love more than anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you painting?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was painting?\u201d</p><p>He points at my face and hair. I must have orange and yellow everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI found this picture of the Australian Outback. The desert. I\u2019m trying to paint the contours of the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see it.\u201d He glances at Vincent Moose. I fold my arms over my stomach and try to forget how good his hands felt on my body.</p><p>He steps toward me, his blue eyes blazing. \u201cI got your email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve called,\u201d I say playfully.</p><p>\u201cI was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d I lift an eyebrow. \u201cDid you stop at Just Tacos again?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in big trouble now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d He grabs my hand and tangles our fingers together, and I remember how this felt on our first date. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right and perfect, even though we\u2019re anything but right and perfect.

I told him that I want to do everything with him, but I need time, and I need his support while I figure things out.</p> <p>I love you, I told him in my email. Can you trust me? I want us to work.</p><p>\u201cI think God wanted me to find you again,\u201d I tell him, stepping close enough to wrap his shirt in my fingers. He stares down at my fists, then up into my eyes, giving me that wicked smirk of his.</p><p>\u201cI know God wanted me to be with you,\u201d he replies, pressing his forehead to mine. His mouth meets mine and we kiss gently.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014no way,\u201d I mumble, stopping him from kissing me again. \u201cYou\u2019re totally in the doghouse for not answering my email promptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I get out of it?\u201d His lips graze my cheek, leaving me dizzy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m open for suggestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d I peek up to find Mom standing there next to Vincent Moose.</p><p>Matt and I break apart and smooth our clothes, as Mom goes back into the kitchen. I caught a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cCome onto the porch with me,\u201d Matt says, taking my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get out of the doghouse.\u201d</p> <p>When I step out the front door, I totally wish I had put on a bra and real pants. At least fifty guys are crowded on my street, catcalling and screaming at Matt.</p><p>\u201cYou pussy!\u201d one guy yells.</p><p>\u201cNooooooooo,\u201d Nick, the guy I met at Chili\u2019s, cries.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask Matt. I\u2019m bewildered, and maybe a bit scared, but very curious.</p><p>He reaches into his shorts pocket\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not proposing, are you?\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d He throws his head back and laughs.</p><p>\u201cGood. If you didn\u2019t ask my Daddy for permission he\u2019d bring out his shotgun and then you\u2019d be tacked up on the wall with Vincent Moose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsking your dad for permission to marry you would be easier than what I\u2019m about to do.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow and look from his frat brothers to him. \u201cWhy\u2019s your frat here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my friends.\u201d He looks into my eyes with such a fierce intensity, I know I can never ask him that question again. Regardless of what they made him do with a banana, he cares about them. They are something he believes in.</p><p>He loves his frat.</p><p>\u201cSo when you\u2019re not at camp, do you always travel with this entourage?\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cNot usually...\u201d</p><p>Some guy in the street yells, \u201cBrown is an \u00fcber douche!\u201d</p><p>I ignore that lovely sentiment.</p><p>\u201cThe guys came with me for a reason,\u201d Matt says, nodding over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing a carwash for the ASPCA? For the puppies and kittens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of saying you want me to take my shirt off?\u2019</p><p>I pinch his bicep. \u201cYou behave.\u201d</p><p>He grins. Then he reaches into his shorts pocket and pulls out a silver chain. A charm reading \u0394TK hangs from it.</p><p>\u201cWill you wear my letters?\u201d he asks.</p><p>He cares about me more than his frat? My eyes fill with tears.</p><p>\u201cThat means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I love you more than them,\u201d he says, glancing over his shoulder at all the heckling guys. \u201cI want you to know I can wait...whatever you need, we can work it out.\u201d</p><p>A few months ago, I couldn\u2019t even comprehend love or what it meant to be in an adult relationship or how important it is to follow my instincts.</p><p>Maybe I can have my beliefs and have the guy I love too.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than those guys too,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I think.\u201d He wipes the tears off my face and we kiss while being heckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a girl like that doing with an asshole like you, Brown?!\u201d</p><p>We break apart, and he slips the Greek letters over my head. And not even ten seconds later, a roaring mob of guys storm my front porch and carry Matt away. It looks like he\u2019s body surfing.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Matt!\u201d I yell, then gaze down at the Greek letters. He could\u2019ve put Megan\u2019s godforsaken whistle around my neck and I\u2019d care about him all the same.</p><p>Three guys are shoving Matt onto the bed of a truck now. I smile, thinking about how lucky he is to have a bunch of guys who love him enough to come over here and make a big deal out of his love for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tie him to a tree or anything crazy!\u201d I yell at the guys.</p><p>I kiss the \u0394TK charm and head back inside to call Emily.</p><p>I\u2019ll never understand why she did what she did.</p><p>But if Matt can wait for me\u2014can respect my beliefs\u2014maybe Emily and I can work out our differences too.</p><p>The door to Foothills Diner swings open. The bell dings. Emily appears. She\u2019s not wearing makeup and her auburn hair is pulled back into a messy bun.</p><p>She slides into the booth across from me and cracks her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, clearing my throat. I close my sketchbook and drum my fingers on it.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>A waitress appears, holding a notepad. She pulls a pen from behind her ear. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhubarb pie,\u201d Emily and I say at the same time. We smile sheepishly at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a coffee,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Emily says, and the waitress goes to ring in our order.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d I tell Emily. I left a voicemail, inviting her to meet me here. It surprises me that she showed.</p><p>She pulls two packets of Splenda from the sugar caddy and places them in front of her.</p><p>There\u2019s an uncomfortable silence until the waitress comes back with our coffees. More silence as we fix them. Half and half with no sugar for me. Two Splendas and skim milk for Emily.</p><p>I curl my fingers around my mug. \u201cI, uh, wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She studies my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to believe the same things to be friends,\u201d I go on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I put pressure on you. You didn\u2019t need that, considering everything else.\u201d</p><p>She sips her coffee and makes a face. She grabs another Splenda and stirs it in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t more grateful for how you helped me. I\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>I sniffle. \u201cJacob sent me a text, asking how you are.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze meets mine.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to him?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe really wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She chokes on her words. She pulls a napkin from the little rusty dispenser and holds it to her nose.</p><p>\u201cI think you should tell him,\u201d I say. \u201cHe loves you. Maybe he\u2019ll understand...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither he\u2019ll forgive you or he won\u2019t...Don\u2019t you want to risk it?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at her lap, dabbing her nose with the napkin.</p><p>\u201cYou have a boyfriend now?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, his name is Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d She glances up, flashing me a small smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember him from when we were little? The guy at camp who was always writing songs? He wore glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! That\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She bangs her fist on the wobbly table. \u201cThe one you made out with behind the art pavilion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t making out!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cNot then, anyway.\u201d The side of her mouth quirks up. \u201cYou\u2019re serious with him?\u201d</p><p>I scrunch my napkin. \u201cWe\u2019re serious, but not that serious.\u201d</p><p>She nods quickly. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for me too,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBecause damn, he is hot.\u201d</p><p>I laugh again. \u201cHe\u2019s not just cute?\u201d</p><p>She waves a hand, shushing me. \u201cI under-exaggerated before. He\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>The waitress drops our rhubarb pie off at the table and we grab our forks.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you and Matt get together?\u201d Emily slices into her pie and listens as I tell her all about him.</p><p>Sketch #402</p><p>What happened last saturday night, october 20</p><p>On Thursday night, I walk into the Belmont dining hall and, after pouring myself a bowl of Rice Krispies, I grab a seat and open my backpack. I push aside my Planned Parenthood volunteer folders and pull out my sketchpad.</p><p>The Purdue game is on all of the TVs. It\u2019s getting tons of coverage \u2019cause Jordan Woods is standing on the sidelines in her uniform. I smile up at the screen, knowing there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll get to play today because she already said so on Facebook. But her standing on the field with her team is huge, and I can\u2019t stop grinning.</p><p>During a commercial where some SUV is driving through craters on the moon, I start drawing the tent Matt and I shared last Saturday night. I dot the paper with the stars sprinkled above us.</p><p>He took me camping at Old Stone Fort, and I grilled burgers for dinner and he fried doughnuts for breakfast. We played this game where we made up new names for the stars in the sky. My favorite was Shamu. Matt wanted to zip our sleeping bags together to create a queen-size sleeping bag, but I kissed him and told him to stop being such a troublemaker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop trying to get into your bed.\u201d</p><p>We pushed our sleeping bags as close to each other as they would go and I hugged him all night long, trying to ignore how much I want all of him.</p><p>Next weekend we\u2019re borrowing Matt\u2019s mom\u2019s van and road-tripping with Ian and Carlie to Chicago, so Matt can run the marathon, barefoot. And I can\u2019t wait for the following Saturday, because Matt\u2019s taking me to his frat\u2019s formal at the Opryland Hotel, where I\u2019ll finally get to wear the silk dress Mom bought for me.</p><p>I\u2019m shading his dirty blond hair when Emily shows up and grabs the seat next to mine. I shut my sketchbook, slip my pencil behind my ear, and listen to her talk about orchestra practice.</p><p>\u201cI think I might have a shot at first chair,\u201d she says, wrapping the necklace Jacob gave her around a finger.</p><p>I steal a French fry off her plate and smile at my friend.</p><p>She touches my wrist. \u201cTell me what your professor thought of your painting already!\u201d</p><p>So I do. </p> </body></html>"]
