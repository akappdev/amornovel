He knew this town and he knew these people; he was one of them. Four times now he\u2019d been elected to the office of sheriff by an overwhelming majority.</p><p>Sitting at his desk on this bleak January day, he let his mind wander as he sipped stale coffee. The department stuff was never good, no matter how recently it\u2019d been brewed. As he sat there, he thought about Sandy, his wife of more than thirty years. She\u2019d died last year of complications related to MS. Her death had left a gaping hole in his life. He\u2019d often discussed his cases with her and had come to appreciate her insights. She usually had opinions, carefully considered ones, on what led people to commit the crimes that brought them to his attention.</p><p>Troy would\u2019ve been interested in her views on one of his current cases. A couple of local teenagers had come upon skeletal remains in a cave not far from the road leading out of town. Partial results of the autopsy were finally in, but they raised more questions than they answered. Additional tests were forthcoming, and they might provide further information. He could only hope.... Hard though it was to believe, the body had gone all this time without discovery, and no one seemed to know who it was.</p> <p>Despite this perplexing\u2014and very cold\u2014case and, of course, the loss of his wife, Troy had reason to count his blessings. He had a comfortable life, good friends and his only child, Megan, was married to a fine young man. In fact, Troy couldn\u2019t have chosen a better husband for his daughter had he handpicked Craig himself. In a few months, Megan would give birth to his first grandchild.</p><p>As far as finances went, Troy had no complaints. His house was paid off and so was his car. He enjoyed his work and had strong ties to the community.</p><p>And yet...he was miserable.</p><p>That misery could be attributed to one source.</p><p>Faith Beckwith.</p> <p>Troy had reconnected with his high-school girlfriend, and almost before he realized what was happening, he\u2019d fallen in love with her all over again.</p><p>Neither of them possessed an impulsive personality. They were adults; they\u2019d known what they wanted and what they were doing.</p><p>Then the relationship that had seemed so promising had come to a sudden end\u2014thanks to his daughter\u2019s reaction and to some undeniably bad judgment on Troy\u2019s part.</p><p>When Megan learned he was dating again so soon after her mother\u2019s death, she\u2019d been very upset. Troy understood his daughter\u2019s feelings. It had only been a few months since they\u2019d buried Sandy; however, Sandy had been ill for years, and in some ways, their farewells had been said long before. But the fact that Troy had hidden his relationship with Faith from his daughter had contributed significantly to the whole mess.</p><p>On the very evening Troy had planned to ask Faith to marry him, Megan had miscarried her first pregnancy. As luck would have it, Troy, who\u2019d been with Faith, had turned off his cell phone.</p><p>His guilt had been overwhelming. The baby had meant everything to Megan and Craig, especially so soon after Sandy\u2019s death.</p> <p>In retrospect Troy saw that he\u2019d completely mishandled the situation. Immediately after Megan\u2019s miscarriage he\u2019d broken off the relationship with Faith. He\u2019d acted out of remorse but he hadn\u2019t taken Faith\u2019s feelings into account; her shock and pain haunted him to this day.</p><p>He\u2019d dedicated himself to his daughter and her needs ever since. That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d stopped thinking about Faith\u2014far from it. Thoughts of her filled his every waking moment.</p><p>To complicate this already complicated situation, Faith had sold her Seattle home and moved to Cedar Cove to be closer to her son, Scott\u2014and to Troy. Seeing her around town these days was torture. Faith had made it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him. Troy didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cI have that missing-persons file for you, Sheriff.\u201d Cody Woodchase stepped into his office and set the folder in Troy\u2019s in-basket.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Troy murmured. \u201cYou checked the appropriate dates?\u201d</p><p>Cody nodded, dutifully efficient. \u201cAnd came up blank. The only major case I can personally recall was Daniel Sherman a few years back.\u201d</p><p>Troy was well aware of the outcome. His old high-school friend had walked away from his family for no apparent reason. He\u2019d simply vanished. The case had bothered Troy for well over a year. As it turned out, Dan had committed suicide, his body eventually found in the woods.</p><p>\u201cThat one was solved,\u201d Troy pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Cody said. \u201cAnyway, I pulled all the pertinent missing-persons files and printed them out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Troy reached for the folder as soon as Cody left his office. Cedar Cove was fortunate enough to have a low crime rate. Oh, there was the occasional public disturbance, domestic violence now and then, a break-in, a drunk driver\u2014the sort of crime common to any small town. There was a mystery every once in a while, too. The biggest that came to mind was the man who\u2019d shown up at Thyme and Tide, the Beldons\u2019 B and B. The stranger had the misfortune to die that very night. But that case, which was actually a murder, had been solved, too.</p><p>And now...the human remains, found just before Christmas.</p><p>According to the autopsy, they were those of a young man. A teenage boy between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Based on those bones, there was no obvious cause of death. No blunt-force trauma, for instance. He\u2019d been dead as long as twenty-five to thirty years.</p><p>Twenty-five to thirty years!</p><p>Troy had been with the department back then, untested and eager to prove himself. Sandy was pregnant after miscarrying twice, optimistic that this time they\u2019d have their baby.</p><p>If a missing teenager had been reported in the late \u201970s or early \u201980s, Troy was confident he would\u2019ve remembered it. The files Cody had printed out indicated that he was right. Not a single case involving a missing teenager, male or female, had been left unresolved.</p><p>To be on the safe side, he checked five years before and five years after. Twelve boys, mostly runaways, had been reported missing in that time. They\u2019d all been found, either returning of their own accord or located by friends, relatives or the authorities.</p><p>Surely this young man had family, a mother and father, who must have wondered and waited in anguish. Troy closed his eyes and tried to think of boys he\u2019d known during that time. Random names and faces rushed through his mind.</p><p>Around 1985, he recalled, Cedar Cove High School had won the state baseball championship. He could picture the first baseman, Robbie something, and Weaver, one of his deputies now, who\u2019d been the team\u2019s star pitcher. Troy had attended all the play-off games. Sandy had gone with him and, although she wasn\u2019t a real baseball fan, she\u2019d clapped and yelled her heart out.</p><p>Oh, how he missed Sandy....</p><p>Troy had visited her grave a couple of times over the holidays. Even at the end, when her body had failed her and MS had stolen much of her dignity, she\u2019d been cheerful. He missed her appreciation of life\u2019s simple joys.</p><p>At least he and Megan were over the firsts\u2014the first Thanksgiving without Sandy. The first Christmas. The first birthday, wedding anniversary and Mother\u2019s Day...Those were the big ones, when her loss felt like a burden that would never grow lighter. When he and his daughter both acknowledged that nothing would ever be the same.</p><p>Troy was startled out of his reverie by someone calling his name.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting anything important?\u201d Louie Benson asked, standing in the office doorway.</p><p>\u201cLouie.\u201d Troy rose to his feet. It wasn\u2019t every day he received a visit from the mayor of Cedar Cove. \u201cCome on in. Good to see you.\u201d He gestured toward the chair in front of his desk.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Louie said as he slid into the seat. He rested one ankle on the opposite knee, striking a relaxed pose.</p><p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d Troy said and sat back down. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d The mayor was a busy man and didn\u2019t waste time on unnecessary visits. The fact was, Troy couldn\u2019t remember when Louie had last sought him out. Oh, they ran into each other often enough; that was unavoidable, since they worked in the same office complex. Socially they were acquaintances and he saw Louie at civic functions or the occasional party.</p><p>Louie\u2019s expression grew serious, and he leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of things I want to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Louie looked down at the floor. \u201cFirst, I want to remind you that I\u2019m up for reelection this November. I was hoping for an endorsement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d Troy was surprised the other man felt the need to bring it up so early in the year. Besides, he\u2019d supported Louie\u2019s previous campaigns. Nothing had changed. To the best of his knowledge, no other candidates had declared their intentions to run against him.</p><p>\u201cI value your support,\u201d Louie said. \u201cAnd of course you have mine.\u201d His gaze fell on Troy\u2019s desk. \u201cOn another matter...What can you tell me about those remains that were recently discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the autopsy report a few days ago,\u201d Troy told him. \u201cJack Griffin ran an article about it in the Chronicle over the weekend. I\u2019d hoped someone might step forward with information as a result. Dental evidence is useless because without a name we can\u2019t get a chart for comparison. To date, I have nothing.\u201d</p><p>Louie leaned back in his chair and eyed the open folder on Troy\u2019s desk. \u201cSo...no clue who that unfortunate soul might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t appear to please the mayor. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m pushing you on this is that I got a call from the Seattle paper. Apparently Jack\u2019s story aroused some interest there. They want to do a piece on those unidentified remains.\u201d The mayor\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI tried to steer the reporter away from the subject, but she seems determined to find out whatever she can. I gave her your contact information, so expect a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be a slow news day.\u201d Troy appreciated getting advance notice. \u201cThanks for the heads-up.\u201d Over the years he\u2019d dealt with the press many times and was accustomed to handling reporters. He had nothing against them as long as they didn\u2019t probe where they didn\u2019t belong or print misinformation.</p><p>\u201cMy fear,\u201d Louie went on to explain, \u201cis that a negative story will hurt Cedar Cove\u2019s reputation. We want to attract tourists, not drive them away with...with ghoulish stories about our town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point there\u2019s nothing for them to report,\u201d Troy reassured him.</p><p>\u201cHave you found out anything?\u201d Louie inquired.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Troy shrugged. \u201cPretty much what Jack wrote in that article. The remains are those of a male, between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. He\u2019s been dead since 1980, give or take a few years. No indication how he died.\u201d</p><p>Louie seemed uninterested in the details. \u201cThe thing is, Cedar Cove doesn\u2019t need any bad press. Our initiative this year is to attract more tourists to the area. I hate the thought of Cedar Cove becoming the center of some macabre story about unidentified remains and an unsolved mystery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Troy nodded. \u201cYeah, I hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Louie rose to his feet. \u201cDo your best to solve this as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, too, Troy opened his mouth to assure the mayor he was doing the best he could, but he wasn\u2019t given the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I want you to sweep anything under the rug, you understand?\u201d the mayor said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Louie extended his hand and Troy shook it. \u201cMake sure nothing sensational or misleading gets printed, okay? Like I said, I want Cedar Cove to become a tourist destination, not some freak sideshow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the reporter\u2019s name?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019d forget it. Kathleen Sadler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathleen Sadler,\u201d Troy repeated. \u201cNot to worry, I\u2019ll set her straight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Louie gave him a relieved smile. \u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d</p><p>When the mayor had left, Troy went back to the paperwork on his desk. The phone rang frequently that afternoon, but there was no call from the reporter. He just hoped Kathleen Sadler hadn\u2019t taken it upon herself to investigate the actual location. The cave was still taped off, but a piece of yellow crime-scene tape wasn\u2019t always a deterrent to determined reporters.</p><p>Troy had kept the names of the two teenagers who\u2019d discovered the body out of the Chronicle. However, that didn\u2019t mean Sadler wouldn\u2019t be able to track them down.</p><p>After they\u2019d stumbled upon the remains, Troy had spoken to the teens twice. He was confident Philip \u201cShaw\u201d Wilson and Tannith Bliss had told him everything they knew, which wasn\u2019t much. The conversations had been straightforward. Although Tannith\u2014Tanni\u2014had done a good job of pretending to shrug off the incident, Troy could tell she\u2019d been badly shaken. He was glad to turn the sixteen-year-old over to her mother.</p><p>The last thing Tanni needed was to be questioned by the Seattle press. Shaw was a bit older and Troy felt the young man would cope admirably with a barrage of questions. It might not hurt to give the two of them some warning.</p><p>His phone rang and Troy grabbed it, prepared to talk to the elusive Kathleen Sadler. \u201cSheriff Davis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, I hope I\u2019m not disturbing you unnecessarily.\u201d It was Cody Woodchase.</p><p>Troy caught the hesitation in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a call from the 9\u20131\u20131 dispatcher and apparently there\u2019s been a break-and-enter at 204 Rosewood Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d Troy\u2019s reaction was immediate as he bolted to his feet. That was the address of the rental house where Faith had recently moved. She\u2019d been there a little more than two months.</p><p>\u201cI believe I heard she might be a...friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Troy said curtly, his throat muscles tight.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Cody. Thank you.\u201d Within seconds, Troy had thrown on his coat and reached for his hat. He charged out the office door, unable to think of anything but Faith. He needed to know she hadn\u2019t been hurt, that she was safe from harm.</p> <p>Two</p><p>The moment Faith Beckwith approached her home she recognized that something was wrong. A sense of foreboding stopped her even before she\u2019d unlocked the kitchen door. She shivered but it wasn\u2019t because of the damp chill of early January, although it\u2019d been raining on and off all day, and the wind cut through her winter coat. Her indecision didn\u2019t last long; she shook it off, turned the key and stepped into\u2014chaos.</p><p>Her kitchen floor was strewn with garbage. Someone had upended the trash bin all over the linoleum. Coffee grounds, eggshells and an empty frozen orange-juice container left a trail of grime and filth. Footprints of coffee grounds led into the living room.</p><p>Without thinking, Faith reached for the phone. She managed to restrain herself from calling Troy Davis, pausing before she hit the first number, which she\u2019d memorized long ago. Instead, she punched out her son\u2019s work number, praying Scottie was still at the office.</p><p>The relief that cascaded through her at the sound of Scott\u2019s voice nearly buckled her knees. \u201cScottie...someone broke into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into the house,\u201d she repeated, surprised that she was able to keep her voice level, although she\u2019d begun to tremble with shock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s garbage all over the kitchen floor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Scottie said calmly. \u201cPut down the phone and dial 9\u20131-1, then call me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d She should\u2019ve thought of that. Normally she was a clear-thinking woman; however, stepping into this mess had completely unsettled her.</p><p>\u201cCall me back as soon as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she promised Scottie, then pushed the disconnect button. Taking a deep breath she called emergency services and waited for the operator\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThis is 9\u20131\u20131. How may I assist you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house has been broken into,\u201d Faith blurted. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone any farther than the kitchen. Whoever was here made a terrible mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure the intruder isn\u2019t still in the house?\u201d</p><p>That hadn\u2019t even occurred to Faith. Oh, dear...</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d The chill she\u2019d experienced earlier returned. It felt as if her feet were frozen to the floor. For all she knew, someone could be standing in the other room.</p><p>\u201cAre you on a portable phone?\u201d the operator asked, breaking into the frightening scenarios racing through her mind.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo outside and remain on the line,\u201d the operator continued.</p><p>Faith forced herself to hurry to the door, moving as quietly as she could, which was probably ridiculous since she\u2019d been speaking in a normal tone earlier. Surely if the person responsible was in the house, he or she would\u2019ve already overheard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d the 9\u20131\u20131 operator told her in a reassuring voice. \u201cI have a patrol car on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Weaver\u2019s estimated time of arrival is three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Sheriff Troy Davis\u2019s,\u201d she said and instantly regretted it. Troy was out of her life. Yet he was the person she\u2019d wanted to contact when she realized there\u2019d been a break-in. \u201cI was a friend,\u201d she amended.</p><p>The phone beeped, indicating that there was another caller.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s my son,\u201d Faith told the operator. \u201cHe wanted me to phone him back as soon as I\u2019d reported the...crime.\u201d She wasn\u2019t even sure how to refer to it.</p><p>\u201cYou can return the call in a moment,\u201d the operator told her. \u201cDeputy Weaver should be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Faith sighed in relief when she saw the patrol car round the corner. \u201cHe\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>The phone beeped again. \u201cI\u2019ll need to take this, otherwise Scottie will be worried.\u201d She thanked the operator and clicked off, then waited to connect with her son.</p><p>\u201cMom, is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe officer\u2019s here,\u201d she assured her son.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Unfortunately, Scott\u2019s office was some distance from Rosewood Lane, and it would be at least fifteen minutes before he arrived.</p><p>Still, once she knew Scott was coming, she felt as though she might collapse. As though she didn\u2019t have the strength to remain upright.</p><p>The deputy parked his vehicle at the curb and after she\u2019d spoken with him, he stalked into the house with his weapon drawn.</p><p>Clutching her purse, Faith stood in the driveway that led to the garage. Not more than a minute passed, although it seemed much longer before Deputy Weaver reappeared.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Nodding, Faith started for the house, but Deputy Weaver placed a restraining hand on her arm. \u201cDo you have family in the area?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Faith nodded again. \u201cMy son, Scott, is on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d recommend you wait until he can accompany you inside,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cBut why? You said whoever did this isn\u2019t in the house anymore.\u201d</p><p>The deputy paused. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is something you\u2019d want to see by yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go in with you, too....\u201d</p><p>Faith had trouble taking in his words. \u201cYou mean...the damage is extensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to judge that for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Faith didn\u2019t know how to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cCan you think of anyone who might have a grudge against you?\u201d the deputy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head, taken aback by his question. \u201cI\u2019ve only been living in the area for a couple of months. This is a rental. I...I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience my son and his family by living with them while I searched for a house to buy.\u201d</p><p>Deputy Weaver nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>His gaze was sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but this looks personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal? My goodness, it can\u2019t be! I lived in Cedar Cove years and years ago, but I don\u2019t know many people here these days. I\u2019m working at the medical clinic and, well...\u201d Faith stopped in midsentence when she saw Troy Davis\u2019s vehicle.</p><p>He pulled up and parked behind Deputy Weaver, then climbed out of his car. It took every bit of her self-control not to rush toward him.</p><p>Troy\u2019s eyes immediately sought hers. Despite her best efforts, Faith started to tear up. She hadn\u2019t seen him since before Christmas, and in that time she\u2019d struggled hard to cast memories of him out of her mind. Her success had been limited. Whole days would pass when she hardly thought of him. That was progress, and yet the first person she\u2019d wanted to turn to in this crisis had been Troy.</p><p>Deputy Weaver stepped forward; he and Troy spoke briefly. Then the deputy ambled over to the house next door and Troy started walking toward her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Troy asked, quickly assessing her.</p><p>She lowered her eyes rather than reveal how glad she was to see him. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Somehow she managed a feeble smile that probably didn\u2019t fool him.</p><p>\u201cDoes Scott know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I called him right away. He\u2019s the one who told me to contact emergency services. He said he was leaving the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t get here for another ten minutes, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather wait for him or would you like me to do a walk-through of the house with you now?\u201d</p><p>It must be bad. \u201cWould you come with me?\u201d she asked, her voice a whisper.</p><p>He clasped her elbow and together they headed toward the door off the kitchen. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a terrible mess.\u201d The deputy\u2019s reaction had implied as much.</p><p>As if touching her was a painful reminder that they\u2019d severed their relationship, Troy dropped his hand. Trying to hide the bereft feeling that came over her, Faith opened the narrow closet next to the laundry and reached for the broom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suggest we take a look at the damage before you attempt any cleanup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He walked into the living room, and when she followed him in, Faith gasped. It was as though a cyclone had gone through, leaving its devastation behind. The furniture was toppled and yellow spray paint had been blasted across her piano and bookcase.</p><p>Most distressing of all was what they\u2019d done to the family photos displayed along the fireplace mantel. Shocked, Faith covered her mouth with both hands.</p> <p>\u201cThis has to be personal,\u201d Troy muttered. He reached for the picture of Scott and his wife and children. Each face had an X through it, drawn in bright red ink. The photo of Faith\u2019s daughter, Jay Lynn, had received the same treatment. But a photograph of her late husband, Carl, had come in for the most brutal destruction. His image had been utterly blotted out.</p><p>\u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d Faith cried.</p><p>\u201cHave you argued with anyone lately?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>That was basically the same question Deputy Weaver had asked and the answer hadn\u2019t changed. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Faith,\u201d Troy insisted. \u201cWhoever\u2019s responsible for this\u2014and it could be more than one person\u2014is trying to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d she snapped, \u201cthey\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened.\u201d Troy\u2019s words were gentle, kind. For a moment it looked as if he wanted to take her in his arms.</p><p>Weak and vulnerable as she felt just then, Faith would gladly have slipped into his embrace. She would\u2019ve welcomed the comfort he offered, the reassurance that, in his arms, she was safe and secure.</p><p>Thankfully he remembered that they weren\u2019t a couple anymore, and that his touch was no longer appropriate. He dropped his arm and took a small step in retreat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bedroom?\u201d Faith asked in an effort to disguise the uncertainty of her resolve.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d Troy asked.</p> <p>Would anyone be? \u201cI...I\u2019ll need to face it sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Again he led the way.</p><p>They were forced to step over drawers that had been dragged into the hallway, over chair cushions and books and lamps\u2014and what appeared to be every piece of clothing she owned. It seemed as though the contents of her entire home had been emptied in the hallway.</p><p>When she saw her bedroom and the chaos there, tears filled her eyes and she couldn\u2019t stand to look at any more. With a sob, she turned and hurried out of the room.</p><p>Anger surged through her. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d done this. Whoever it was wanted to disrupt the peace and serenity she\u2019d worked so hard to achieve since moving to Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell if anything\u2019s been taken?\u201d Troy asked. She suspected he was trying to distract her from all the wreckage.</p><p>She walked into the living room and took several deep breaths. \u201cNo...not yet.\u201d The knowledge that this might be more than vandalism upset her all over again. Whoever had broken in had probably taken whatever valuables they could find.</p><p>Why target her? Faith didn\u2019t own more than a few pieces of expensive jewelry, some of which she was wearing. The other pieces\u2014her wedding band and the pearls that had been her mother\u2019s\u2014were tucked away in a safety-deposit box at the bank.</p> <p>\u201cIs anything obvious missing?\u201d he continued.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing I want you to do is get a new lock,\u201d Troy said, examining the front door. \u201cMake it a dead bolt. Consider an alarm system, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it.\u201d His suggestion kept her from dwelling on what had happened, but not for long.</p><p>\u201cMy family,\u201d she whispered. She stared at the photographs of her children and grandchildren. \u201cAre they safe?\u201d</p><p>Troy shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cMy guess is this is a scare tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s face creased in a dark frown. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that. I wish I could tell you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know why...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d he said, \u201cand I promise you I\u2019ll do everything in my power to find whoever\u2019s responsible.\u201d</p><p>That was fine, but Faith\u2019s biggest concern remained her family. \u201cWhy would anyone cross out their faces? I won\u2019t be able to sleep at night if there\u2019s any chance my grandchildren might be at risk.... It\u2019s all because of me,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cWhat could I have possibly done to deserve this?\u201d</p><p>Troy took her by the shoulders and his hold was all that kept her from collapsing.</p><p>\u201cFaith, listen,\u201d he said, sounding stern and official. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right. I\u2019ll schedule patrol cars to drive past your place and Scott\u2019s, too. I don\u2019t want you to worry, understand?\u201d</p><p>It was almost more than she could do to nod in simple acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d She heard Scott\u2019s voice coming from the front porch.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, Troy spoke on her behalf. \u201cWe\u2019re inside the house,\u201d he called out. Releasing her, he moved toward the door and opened it.</p><p>Scott charged into the house and did a double take. He was struck silent, his eyes wide with shock and dismay. Once he\u2019d recovered, he turned to Troy to supply answers, the same way Faith had moments earlier.</p><p>Faith reached out to her son. She was close to both her children and her grandchildren, too, but refused to be a burden to them. Her independence meant everything, and she was determined to preserve it. After Carl\u2019s death, she\u2019d adjusted to being a widow, rambling around that large Seattle house on her own. Now she\u2019d come back to Cedar Cove, but as much as possible, she still took care of whatever needed attention without calling her children for assistance.</p><p>So far she\u2019d managed well, but this...this monster who\u2019d invaded her home had overturned more than her furniture, he\u2019d unsettled her entire world and destroyed her peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cDeputy Weaver\u2019s talking to the neighbors,\u201d Troy said. \u201cI\u2019ll check with him and see if he has any information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever did this came through the front door?\u201d Scott asked incredulously. He slid one arm around Faith\u2019s shoulders. She was grateful for his support.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that way,\u201d Troy answered.</p><p>\u201cIn broad daylight? Wasn\u2019t anyone on the street home?\u201d</p><p>Faith looked up. \u201cThe Vesseys are in Arizona for the winter and...and\u2014\u201d she faltered a bit \u201c\u2014everyone else on the block is either at work or at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d Troy asked, his eyes revealing his reluctance to leave. But now that Scott had arrived, there was no reason for him to stay. He\u2019d done his duty. No, he\u2019d gone above and beyond anything duty required.</p><p>Calling on all her strength\u2014and an acting ability she hadn\u2019t known she possessed\u2014Faith reassured him with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Thank you, Troy. It...it meant a great deal that you came yourself.\u201d</p><p>He touched the brim of his hat and, with a nod in Scott\u2019s direction, turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Three</p><p>Olivia Griffin spooned up the last of her soup and set the empty bowl in the kitchen sink. The homemade tomato basil was one of her favorites and her mother made sure she had an abundant supply every week. Jack would be pleased that she\u2019d finished her lunch. She\u2019d received her first chemotherapy treatment the previous week and it had gone better than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>But then her expectations hadn\u2019t been optimistic. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months before, Olivia had been afraid her life was almost over. To say the news had shocked her was putting it mildly. She\u2019d always eaten properly, exercised regularly and taken all the recommended vitamins.</p><p>The important lesson she\u2019d learned about cancer was that the disease wasn\u2019t fair; for that matter, life wasn\u2019t fair. And at her age, that was something she certainly should\u2019ve known. Did know. Losing one of her children at thirteen, the failure of her first marriage...But somehow, she\u2019d foolishly come to believe she could control her body, her health, if she did the right things. That loss of control was difficult to accept, yet she had no choice. She was a woman who rigorously managed her environment\u2014no clutter in her house. She realized she\u2019d become more that way after Jordan\u2019s death.</p><p>She\u2019d taken a leave from her position as a family court judge and was gearing up, both emotionally and physically, for the treatments scheduled during the next three months. She knew some people worked through their chemo, but everyone had urged her not to. \u201cGive yourself a break,\u201d Jack said, and so she had.</p><p>The sound of a car door closing alerted Olivia to the fact that she had company. Glancing out the large kitchen window, she noticed that her visitor was none other than her mother. No surprise there.</p><p>Olivia frowned slightly when she saw that Charlotte was alone. Since her mother had married Ben several years ago, they were practically always together. They\u2019d returned from a Caribbean cruise on Christmas Day and her mother had been a daily visitor ever since.</p><p>Knowing Charlotte preferred to park at the side of the house and use the back entrance, Olivia opened the door off the kitchen.</p><p>Her mother smiled as she entered the house. \u201cI hoped I\u2019d catch you before you had a nap,\u201d she said. She placed the basket on the table and quickly divested herself of purse and coat, hanging them on the hook by the door. Charlotte rarely stopped by without bringing some kind of treat, generally something homemade.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia joked, \u201cI outgrew naps when I was four, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear,\u201d Charlotte said, without taking offense, \u201cbut you need your rest, especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept in this morning.\u201d Olivia\u2019s normal routine had her out of bed at six and in the courthouse by eight-thirty. The sheer luxury of not setting the alarm each night could become habit-forming, she thought.</p><p>\u201cSlept in until what time?\u201d Charlotte asked as she folded back the basket\u2019s red-checkered cloth and brought out a tin of cookies and an orange Bundt cake that just happened to be one of Jack\u2019s favorites.</p><p>\u201cNearly eight.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked over her shoulder and pretended to gasp. \u201cMy, that\u2019s so late.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cWell, for me it is\u2014and it was divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack got ready for work on his own and didn\u2019t wake you?\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact, her husband had awakened her, but in the most romantic way. Jack had brought her a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Then he\u2019d kissed her\u2014repeatedly\u2014before he\u2019d left for the newspaper office. The memory of his kisses stirring her from a deep sleep filled her with a warm glow of happiness.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea, Mom?\u201d Olivia asked. Usually she had coffee only in the morning and tea after that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an invalid,\u201d Olivia protested, although she knew it was pointless to argue. Without waiting for a reply, she pulled out a chair and sat down, watching as her mother bustled about the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia tended to let Jack and her mother pamper her these days. There was so little either of them could do for her, and these small indulgences\u2014coffee in bed, some home-baked goodies\u2014made them feel better, too.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d she asked as her mother put water on to boil and added tea bags to the pot.</p><p>\u201cHome, in his lazy chair,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling a bit under the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make him some of your chicken noodle soup?\u201d This was her mother\u2019s surefire remedy for just about anything that ailed the people she loved.</p> <p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s simmering in the Crock-Pot at this very moment.\u201d She took two teacups and saucers from the cupboard as she spoke. \u201cBen\u2019s tired out from the cruise, and then, well, this whole business with David and the baby has really upset him.\u201d</p><p>On Christmas Eve, a young pregnant woman by the name of Mary Jo Wyse had arrived in Cedar Cove looking for David Rhodes, Ben\u2019s youngest son. David was the father of her child, and he\u2019d told the naive young woman a pack of lies. Aside from the more serious lies\u2014like telling her he loved her and wanted the baby\u2014he\u2019d led Mary Jo to believe he\u2019d be spending the holidays with Charlotte and Ben. David knew very well that his father and stepmother would be on a cruise; he\u2019d obviously assumed that Mary Jo wouldn\u2019t try to find him.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t expected was that she\u2019d actually come to town, let alone that she\u2019d go into labor and give birth to her daughter here, in Cedar Cove. It turned out to be a miraculous night, one Olivia and her best friend, Grace Harding, would long remember.</p><p>\u201cHas Ben been in touch with David?\u201d Olivia asked. The last she\u2019d heard, no one had reached David to tell him Mary Jo had given birth to a daughter.</p><p>Charlotte nodded just as the kettle started to whistle. She lifted it off the burner and filled the teapot, which she covered with a cozy and carried to the kitchen table. Next, she brought over the cups and saucers. All her movements were economical and precise, Olivia thought, testament to all those years of working in the kitchen, bringing comfort to others.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t a pleasant conversation,\u201d Charlotte said with a sigh. \u201cBen is dreadfully disappointed in his son.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the first time. Far from it...</p><p>\u201cDavid tried to deny that he even knew Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>The weasel. The jerk! Attempting to squirm his way out of responsibility was typical, of course. Olivia\u2019s first exposure to David had been when he\u2019d attempted to swindle Charlotte out of several thousand dollars. Thankfully, Justine, Olivia\u2019s daughter, had managed to thwart him.</p><p>Charlotte released another deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Ben and David argued. Ben didn\u2019t say much afterward and I didn\u2019t pressure him, but you can imagine how he feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got a beautiful granddaughter out of this mess, though,\u201d Olivia reminded her mother.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, and he\u2019s thrilled about Noelle. I know he\u2019s already had his will revised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Mary Jo?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to her a couple of times this week. She sounds well, and the baby\u2019s thriving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her brothers are crazy about little Noelle.\u201d</p><p>The memory of Christmas Eve produced a smile as Olivia recalled the three Wyse brothers rushing to Grace and Cliff\u2019s ranch in an effort to find their little sister. They\u2019d fumbled and bumbled their way across the Puget Sound area and eventually arrived, just in time to see their newborn niece. Mary Jo had been staying in the apartment above Cliff\u2019s barn at the ranch, where she\u2019d gone into labor.</p><p>\u201cWhen we spoke yesterday, Mary Jo said Mack McAfee had stopped by to see the baby,\u201d Charlotte told her.</p><p>\u201cHe went over to Seattle, then?\u201d The young firefighter had been with Mary Jo during much of her labor and had delivered the baby. It was his first birth. Olivia could clearly recall how excited he\u2019d been. Mack\u2019s face had shone with such joy, you\u2019d almost think he\u2019d been the child\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and Mary Jo said he brought Noelle another stuffed animal.\u201d Charlotte removed the cozy and picked up the pot, pouring them each a cup of steaming green tea. Shaking her head in amusement, she looked up at Olivia. \u201cBetween Mack and Mary Jo\u2019s brothers, that baby has enough toys to last her whole childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice,\u201d Olivia said, reaching for her cup.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about Faith Beckwith?\u201d Charlotte opened the tin and offered Olivia an oatmeal-raisin cookie.</p><p>\u201cThat she moved back to town, you mean?\u201d This was old news as far as Olivia was concerned. She bit into her cookie, which as always was just right.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Charlotte took a sip of tea. \u201cThat her home was vandalized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Olivia was horrified. \u201cOh, dear, does Grace know?\u201d</p><p>The rental belonged to her best friend, who\u2019d agonized over whether to sell the house or keep it. Her first tenants, a young navy couple, Ian and Cecilia Randall, had barely settled in when Ian was transferred to another duty station. The next tenants had gotten months behind in their rent and seemed determined to work the system and live there rent-free as long as possible. Apparently the couple and the hangers-on who lived with them knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>The experience had been terrible for poor Grace. Fortunately, the renters had moved of their own accord\u2014with a little help from Jack and Grace\u2019s husband, Cliff, who\u2019d come up with a rather inventive means of persuading the gang of deadbeats to vacate the house quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Charlotte murmured as she set aside her cup. \u201cI forgot. Grace asked me not to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>The one thing Olivia wished was that her family and friends would stop treating her as if she\u2019d faint at the smallest hint of bad news.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Grace later, but first tell me about Faith.\u201d</p><p>Her mother held her teacup in both hands. \u201cOh, she\u2019s fine. The minute I heard about the break-in, I went over to help her clean up. So did Grace and Cliff, of course, and Corrie and Peggy and a bunch of others. The place was a mess.\u201d Charlotte grimaced. \u201cAn awful mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Faith handling all this?\u201d</p><p>Her mother leaned against the back of her chair. \u201cYou know Faith. She\u2019s a strong woman, but this break and enter rattled her. Thank goodness the vandal was gone by the time she got home.\u201d</p><p>Olivia could easily guess how unsettling this must have been for Faith. \u201cWas anything taken?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw her, she wasn\u2019t sure, and we were all so busy cleaning up the house it was hard to tell. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll know until she has a chance to go through everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else came to help?\u201d This was something Olivia loved about Cedar Cove. Neighbors were more than neighbors\u2014they were friends who willingly pitched in when needed.</p><p>\u201cWell, naturally, her son and his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan Bloomquist was there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Faith and Megan have struck up quite a friendship.\u201d</p><p>This was surprising. \u201cWhat about the sheriff and Faith?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte set her teacup in its saucer, her frown thoughtful. \u201cThat, unfortunately, is a delicate situation. I hear they\u2019ve decided not to see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Olivia was sorry about that. She remembered that the two of them had dated in high school. Recently there\u2019d been rumors that they\u2019d reconnected, which seemed like such a satisfying idea. It saddened her to think that everything wasn\u2019t going to fall neatly into place. But, as she very well knew, not every romance had a happy ending.</p><p>Both were silent for several seconds. \u201cThe locksmith showed up while I was there,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cTroy suggested a dead-bolt system for the house, and Grace got it installed immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront and back doors, and the garage, as well.\u201d Her mother grinned. \u201cLloyd said he\u2019d defy anyone to get into that house again.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd Copeland was the town\u2019s locksmith and had twenty years\u2019 experience. If he said the house was secure, then it was secure. The only way in would be through a window, but Olivia recalled that Grace had installed ex-trastrong glass in the downstairs panes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cFaith needs the peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that.\u201d Charlotte finished her tea and stood to bring her cup to the sink. \u201cAnything more I can do for you, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas your brother been by lately?\u201d Charlotte asked as she headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWill phoned this morning.\u201d</p><p>The immediate frown told Olivia that her mother wasn\u2019t pleased. She expected Will to visit at least three times a week, to commiserate and hold her hand.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d she protested. \u201cWill\u2019s busy. He\u2019s working on getting the art gallery up and running, plus remodeling the living space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t bother to argue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him since Christmas though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Actually, Will had come over on Christmas Day, looking a bit depressed. He\u2019d gone to Shirley Bliss\u2019s home and\u2014to his astonishment\u2014she hadn\u2019t been there. Her brother had a massive ego and assumed that the world revolved around his schedule. It had never occurred to him that Shirley, one of his artists and a widowed mother of two, would be anywhere but at home, waiting, longing, for a visit from him. Olivia hoped her brother had learned from this.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget I brought you my orange Bundt cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly forget.\u201d Although Jack would appreciate eating it more than Olivia. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to fatten me up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI\u2019ll cook you a batch of my special lasagna next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia said laughingly, \u201cI won\u2019t fit into any of my clothes if this continues.\u201d Although she was far from having to worry about that. Her suits hung on her because she\u2019d lost weight before Christmas, fighting off a serious infection. However, Olivia wanted her mother to know that while she valued everything Charlotte did for her, she was well on the road to recovery.</p><p>\u201cLet me spoil you a bit longer,\u201d her mother said. \u201cPlease, honey?\u201d</p><p>Olivia gave in with a smile. \u201cAll right, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte put on her coat and scooped up her purse and the empty basket. \u201cI\u2019m off to see Bess.\u201d One of her many friends. \u201cYou\u2019ll call if you need anything?\u201d she asked. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Olivia assured her.</p><p>Her mother grasped the doorknob. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let Jack eat that cake all by himself, you hear?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia laughed again. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Mom.\u201d</p><p>With a saucy wave, her mother was out the door. Olivia just hoped that when she hit eighty, she\u2019d have as much energy, optimism and charm as her wonderful mother.</p><p>Four</p><p>There was someone pounding on Christie Levitt\u2019s front door as she stood over the bathroom sink, brushing her teeth. She rinsed her mouth and methodically set her toothbrush in the holder, then splashed cold water on her face. She had no idea who\u2019d be at her door this early in the day.</p> <p>\u201cHold your horses,\u201d she shouted and winced. Her head throbbed with what threatened to become a blinding headache.</p><p>Whoever was at the door was certainly persistent. On her way through the hallway to her bedroom, she did a quick mental review of the bills she\u2019d paid. Yes, she specifically remembered that she\u2019d mailed off checks to the electric and water companies.</p><p>Both utilities had been shut off before and in her opinion the companies were rather sneaky about it. No one had come to the door, at least not that she recalled.</p><p>Grabbing a housecoat, she slid her arms into the sleeves and belted the waist, doing her best to ignore the throbbing in her head.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she demanded as she unbolted the lock. Her head ached, her eyes stung. What she really needed was a cup of strong, hot coffee. The stronger the better, and it couldn\u2019t come any too soon. Waking with a mouth so dry it felt as though it was stuffed with cotton, she\u2019d brushed her teeth first. Coffee was going to be her next step.</p> <p>The moment she opened the apartment door, her sister pushed past her.</p><p>Christie groaned. She\u2019d tried to avoid Teri. Her sister\u2019s persistent phone calls had gone unanswered. Christie had torn up the note Teri had slipped under her door without bothering to read it. No need; she knew what it said. She should\u2019ve realized that Teri didn\u2019t know how to take a hint.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Christie winced again at the pain that felt like a spear going through her head.</p><p>Teri, five months pregnant with triplets, glared at her indignantly. \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Christie walked into the kitchen and reached for the coffeepot. \u201cDon\u2019t mince words or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never have and I\u2019m not about to start now.\u201d Teri followed her into the room, and without waiting for an invitation pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cPut some water on for tea if you would,\u201d she said. Her hands automatically went to rest on her protruding belly, and she raised her feet to the seat of the opposite chair, as if she intended to stay a while.</p> <p>Great. Just great. Not only did Christie have a headache to contend with, she was stuck with Teri, too. In a minor act of rebellion, she started the coffee before filling a cup with water and slamming it into the microwave. She hit the timer button savagely.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she ventured to ask, although she could easily guess. This visit had to do with James Wilbur, Teri and Bobby\u2019s former chauffeur. Even mentally saying his name brought a flash of pain.</p><p>The scum.</p><p>The rat.</p><p>Christie had been convinced she was in love. Deeply, truly in love. Oh, she\u2019d loved before, always unwisely as it turned out. She\u2019d been married and divorced and had gone through a succession of men who all said they loved her...and fool that she was, Christie had believed them.</p><p>With James it\u2019d been different; this time everything seemed right. But then he did what every man had done to her. He\u2019d dumped her. He\u2019d left her a cryptic message and taken off, and in the process broken her already wounded heart.</p><p>Well, no more. Never again.</p><p>Christie was finished with men.</p> <p>Done.</p><p>She meant it this time. Loving someone, loving a man, simply hurt too much.</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2019s parked outside the Pink Poodle,\u201d Teri announced, watching her closely as she moved about the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Christie returned flippantly. Where she chose to leave her car was none of her sister\u2019s business. The microwave made a beeping noise but she ignored it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Teri echoed in the same sarcastic tone, \u201cyou\u2019ve been drinking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it? My friends are there.\u201d It wasn\u2019t any big deal if she chose to have a couple of beers with the guys after work. A few hours at the Poodle helped break the monotony and fend off loneliness. Going back to an empty apartment and spending the night in front of the tube wasn\u2019t much incentive to rush home.</p><p>\u201cThese guys are your friends? Yeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you\u2019re here to lecture me, then save your breath. I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Teri scowled. The way they were snapping at each other was reminiscent of the relationship they used to have. Over the past year that had improved, thanks in large part to James and to Bobby Polgar, Teri\u2019s chess-playing husband.</p><p>Teri broke eye contact, lowered her head and sighed. She sounded either hurt or offended, Christie wasn\u2019t sure which. But this reaction was so unlike her bossy forthright sister that Christie was immediately concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Various possibilities raced through her head. A complication with the pregnancy, or trouble with Bobby, or maybe the problem, whatever it was, concerned their younger brother, Johnny. Or\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the pregnancy,\u201d Teri blurted out. She closed her eyes. \u201cI get light-headed from time to time. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just that carrying three babies is taking its toll.\u201d</p><p>Christie felt a jolt of alarm. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Teri said, gesturing dismissively with her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said my blood pressure would fluctuate and I\u2019d have off days. Apparently this is one of those days and the kidlets are making sure I know they\u2019re there. But it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Despite her sister\u2019s reassurances, Christie was worried. She shouldn\u2019t have ignored Teri\u2019s attempts to reach her. As a result, her sister had come in search of her. In every likelihood Teri had gone against doctor\u2019s orders by leaving the house, and all because Christie refused to pick up the phone.</p><p>The coffeemaker made a gurgling noise, signaling that the brewing was complete. Christie grabbed a mug, inspecting it to be sure it was clean before filling it to the brim. She pulled Teri\u2019s tea water out of the microwave and brought both to the table, along with an herbal tea bag, and sat across from her sister.</p><p>\u201cAll right, talk to me,\u201d Christie said and sipped her coffee, gasping as it burned her lips.</p><p>Teri slowly breathed in and out, her eyes closed. \u201cI blame you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What\u2019d I do?\u201d She did blame herself but wasn\u2019t prepared to admit it.</p><p>\u201cAll...all you think about is yourself.\u201d For a moment it sounded as if Teri was about to break into tears. Her voice quavered and her lower lip started to tremble.</p><p>Christie blinked. Teri was the strong, determined one in the family, and not usually given to emotional outbursts. Christie was the volatile sister\u2014and this role reversal made her uncomfortable.</p><p>Whatever was bothering Teri, she couldn\u2019t seem to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Christie repeated.</p><p>Teri fumbled for a tissue and blew her nose with an inelegant honk before stuffing the tissue back into her purse. \u201cYou never thought about Bobby\u2019s feelings or mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe miss James, too. Bobby hardly knows what to do with himself. You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s hurting!\u201d</p><p>Her sister was right. Christie hadn\u2019t stopped to consider what James\u2019s leaving had meant to Bobby and her sister. James had been Bobby\u2019s closest friend for many years. He was Bobby\u2019s confidant as well as his driver.</p><p>Recently an enterprising reporter had revealed that James was once a chess prodigy himself, and that he\u2019d suffered an emotional collapse in his early teens and spent time in a mental institution. Afterward he\u2019d disappeared from the chess world. When the news story broke, Bobby\u2019s friend had panicked and run.</p><p>The fact that James had deserted her and Bobby and Teri was cruel enough. And Christie knew she hadn\u2019t been much comfort to them because she was too devastated by what he\u2019d done. She\u2019d tried not to fall in love with him; again and again she\u2019d rebuffed him, and still he\u2019d pursued her.</p><p>James was unlike any man she\u2019d ever known. He hadn\u2019t rushed her into bed, although she would\u2019ve gone willingly if he\u2019d asked. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he\u2019d broken down her resistance, bit by bit, ever patient, undemanding and kind. No woman, no matter how emotionally strong, could resist such tender persuasion. Christie certainly couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Just before he disappeared, she\u2019d laid out her past to him and she hadn\u2019t prettied it up, either. She\u2019d told him everything, about the men she\u2019d been with, the marriage that had crumbled under the weight of alcoholism and physical abuse. She\u2019d left nothing out. If he was going to love her and be part of her life, she didn\u2019t want anything hidden in the shadows, to leap out at some unexpected time.</p><p>James had listened quietly, had held her and kissed her\u2014and hadn\u2019t said a single word about his own history.</p><p>Christie had offered him her trust, something she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never give another man. She\u2019d even started thinking about being married to James, having a baby with him.... What hurt so badly was that he hadn\u2019t loved her enough to share his past.</p><p>Well, that was that. Another painful lesson learned. James was out of her life now.</p><p>For good.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter if he returned, and everyone seemed to assume that eventually he would. She was through.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come for Christmas,\u201d Teri complained. Apparently it still rankled that Christie had missed the big family get-together. But as far as Christie was concerned, Christmas dinner with her ragtag family wasn\u2019t any real loss.</p><p>\u201cI was volunteering, remember?\u201d This was true, but she\u2019d already decided not to show up at Teri and Bobby\u2019s place before she made that arrangement.</p><p>Teri looked over at her with big brown doe-eyes. \u201cYou were...volunteering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I told you. I served meals in Tacoma at the homeless shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI delivered Christmas baskets to needy families, too, but that was before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Teri shocked her when she suddenly began to laugh. \u201cAnd I accused you of not paying attention to me. I\u2019m almost as bad. I completely forgot you were doing that. Here I thought you were probably in some tavern, instead of with Bobby and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about it, but at Christmas she\u2019d still felt emotionally shaky. Being with Teri and Bobby was risky\u2014there were too many memories associated with James at her sister\u2019s home. And it was hard to watch those two, with their romantic bliss and cozy domestic life. Her pain was too close to the surface. She was better now, stronger than she\u2019d been in a long while.</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you answered my calls?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christie didn\u2019t have an explanation for that. All right, so maybe she wasn\u2019t as strong as she thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few beers. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t get drunk.\u201d Although she\u2019d downed enough alcohol to leave her with a killer headache. She figured the booze had affected her like this because she hadn\u2019t been drinking much lately.</p><p>\u201cYou were too drunk to drive.\u201d</p> <p>Christie denied that. She wasn\u2019t stupid; she knew her limit.</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t seem to believe her. \u201cThen why is your car at the Pink Poodle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t start.\u201d Christie didn\u2019t want to think about that piece of junk. Every day the engine fired to life was a day to be grateful for.</p><p>A few months ago, James had managed to jury-rig it into running again but there were too many things wrong with her sad excuse for a car.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone gave me a ride.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s gaze shot toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cNo one spent the night, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>Teri had the good grace to look a little embarrassed. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be the first time if someone did,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Christie couldn\u2019t argue with that. When it came to men she was batting zero. As Teri had once said, Christie attracted losers the way an ice cream truck attracts children. Not that Teri should talk; she\u2019d been fortunate enough to break the pattern of harmful and unfulfilling relationships when she met Bobby. Christie had been so sure that James was her Bobby.... He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Teri drank some of her tea and sent Christie a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t alone over Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, too. It helped, you know?\u201d Christie took a tentative sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cInstead of sitting home and feeling sorry for myself, I took the initiative and did something for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t appear to be completely mollified. \u201cYou could\u2019ve spent the day with Bobby and me. Johnny was there, and Mom came by. I wish you\u2019d been there, too,\u201d she added plaintively.</p><p>In retrospect it probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt to make a token appearance. \u201cHow is Mom?\u201d she asked, hoping to distract her sister.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>Christie had lost count of how many stepdads and \u201cuncles\u201d she\u2019d accumulated through the years. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she marries these guys.\u201d She had to be on her fifth or sixth husband. Christie had stopped making an effort to remember their names; they never seemed to last long enough to bother. The fact was, she hadn\u2019t seen her mother in more than a year.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she marries them, either,\u201d Teri said. \u201cAt least she didn\u2019t get bombed this time. Maybe because what\u2019s-his-name wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bobby put her purse by the front door again?\u201d</p><p>Teri grinned at the memory. As Christie recalled, her mother had vowed never to return. That vow, like every other one she\u2019d made through the years, had turned out to be meaningless.</p><p>\u201cI think Bobby was tempted to show Mom the door, but for my sake he restrained himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cHe is,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Johnny doing?\u201d Their little brother held a special place in Christie\u2019s heart. Between them, the two sisters had practically raised him.</p><p>Christie was as proud as any mother when Johnny was accepted into the University of Washington. Having Bobby Polgar as a brother-in-law hadn\u2019t hurt. Teri had never said as much, but it didn\u2019t take a college degree to add two and two. Johnny never could have afforded the tuition and other expenses on his own, and there hadn\u2019t been any scholarships.</p><p>\u201cHe made the dean\u2019s list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for him!\u201d She\u2019d have to call Johnny soon, congratulate him.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Teri sipped her tea. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Christie\u2019s declarations of strength and independence were a lot of bravado. Spending Friday night at the Pink Poodle was testament to that. Waking up with a hangover wasn\u2019t the way she wanted to live the rest of her life. It wasn\u2019t the way she intended to live it, either.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I was thinking?\u201d Christie said a bit sheepishly, half afraid Teri would laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me.\u201d</p><p>She gave a self-conscious shrug. \u201cI handed out charity baskets with that group from the Methodist church at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were nice people.\u201d</p><p>Teri laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she was. Christie had expected those church people to make some comment about her lifestyle. Instead, everyone was friendly and welcoming. She hadn\u2019t been back, although she wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to church.\u201d Having said as much, Christie held her breath and waited for Teri\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say it like that?\u201d Teri asked in a puzzled voice.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re standing up at an AA meeting and making a confession. Lots of people attend church, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go every now and then, and I always feel good afterward. I don\u2019t have anything against going to church and you shouldn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to live a better life,\u201d Christie said, remembering how she\u2019d felt when she was delivering the charity baskets. Instead of being so self-absorbed, so consumed by her own loss, she\u2019d reached out to help others less fortunate.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want, too,\u201d Teri echoed. \u201cA better life than our mother\u2019s, a better life for my child...er, children.\u201d Teri grinned as she said it.</p><p>\u201cPastor Flemming wrote a note to thank me for volunteering,\u201d Christie said. The letter sat on the kitchen counter and she picked it up. When it first arrived, she\u2019d been feeling depressed and had given it a cursory glance. The only thing she remembered was something about a backpack program sponsored by the church. She decided to find out what that was.</p><p>\u201cWill you come to church with me on Sunday?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d get up and hug you,\u201d Teri said, \u201cbut I\u2019m too comfortable where I am.\u201d</p><p>Christie laughed and stretched out a hand to clasp her sister\u2019s.</p><p>Five</p><p>Sheriff Troy Davis closed the file concerning the break-in at Faith\u2019s home. Unfortunately, there\u2019d been no progress, and he felt he should deliver the disappointing news in person. As he drove his patrol car toward Rosewood Lane, he reviewed the little he knew about the situation.</p><p>He\u2019d spoken to his lead detective regarding the break and enter. Detective Hildebrand had assured Troy that his staff had done everything that could be done\u2014the neighbors had been interviewed, and comparisons made with similar crimes in Cedar Cove and in nearby jurisdictions.</p><p>Instead of letting Hildebrand or his assistant call or visit Faith, he\u2019d stepped in and volunteered to do it. She was, after all, his friend. Or at least, she had been. Mostly this visit was prompted by Troy\u2019s need to see how Faith was faring after the break-in.</p><p>When he\u2019d parked in front of the house, he didn\u2019t leave the car immediately, mentally preparing himself for the meeting. He knew that seeing her would be hard. Faith had made it clear that she didn\u2019t want any further contact and he\u2019d respected her wishes. This, however, was official business\u2014even if it didn\u2019t have to be his business.</p><p>He marched up the steps leading to her front door, rang the bell and waited, hat in his hand.</p><p>She answered the door cautiously, and her eyes brightened when she saw him. That spark was quickly gone, however, replaced by a faraway look, flat and emotionless. In that moment, it demanded all his discipline not to pull her into his arms and beg for another chance. He needed Faith, loved her, wanted to marry her\u2014and had destroyed any possibility of that happening.</p><p>\u201cI have the report from the investigating officer,\u201d Troy said briskly, conveying that this was police business and not a social call.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d She unlocked the screen door and held it open for him to come inside.</p><p>Troy paused to examine the lock and was relieved to see that Faith had taken his advice and installed a dead bolt. Or rather, Grace and Cliff Harding, the owners, had arranged for it. Not surprisingly, Grace had been horrified by what she\u2019d seen. This had been her home for decades\u2014and Faith was her friend. Megan had told him that both Grace and Cliff had helped with the cleanup.</p><p>The house was tidy once again and back to normal. That couldn\u2019t have been an easy task. The aroma of baking reminded him that he\u2019d worked through his lunch hour.</p><p>\u201cI just took some bran muffins out of the oven. Would you like one?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time since Troy had tasted anything home-baked. He wondered if she offered because she\u2019d heard his stomach growl or if she\u2019d noticed that he\u2019d nearly swooned when he entered the house. Or maybe she was simply being polite. Whatever the reason, he wasn\u2019t about to turn her down. \u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d he said, hoping he sounded casual.</p><p>\u201cI have coffee on, too. Can I get you a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He followed her into the kitchen and watched as she poured the coffee and took a muffin out of the pan, setting it on a small plate. He waited until she was seated before he pulled out the chair across from her. It seemed to take her an inordinate amount of time to look at him. One quick glance in his direction, and then she lowered her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d she asked, folding her hands neatly in her lap.</p><p>Troy wished he had something positive to share with her. \u201cUnfortunately, the news is...inconclusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Your people were here for hours, dusting for fingerprints. They wouldn\u2019t let me straighten a thing until they\u2019d finished. The deputy said they managed to lift a number of solid prints.\u201d Her eyes pleaded with him to explain this nightmare. Troy wished he could; he wanted to prove to Faith that he was her hero...and that she could trust him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The crime-scene technician was able to lift a number of fingerprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were all mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all of them. But the clear ones weren\u2019t out of the ordinary. That\u2019s why we took the elimination prints.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe suspect the intruder wore rubber gloves.\u201d</p><p>She looked confused. \u201cA professional, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, we can\u2019t say. My guess is this isn\u2019t the first home this person has broken into.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. \u201cI\u2019d hoped\u2014I was sure with so many prints...there\u2019d be at least one that would identify whoever did this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe checked each and every fingerprint and they were all ones we could identify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t disguise her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cHave you made a list of what\u2019s missing for Detective Hildebrand?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe items taken. They\u2019re mostly things of sentimental value. Like you said earlier, this break-in seemed...personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example.\u201d</p><p>She unfolded her hands and gestured helplessly. \u201cThey took a picture album I made when the grandchildren were born. You saw what they did to Carl\u2019s photograph. I had\u2014oh, it\u2019s too silly to mention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her lower lip trembled before she regained her composure. \u201cA toy train...It was from Carl\u2019s boyhood. I had it sitting on the bedroom dresser. Scottie\u2019s son likes to play with it when they visit and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was stolen?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded again. \u201cI never thought of it as a valuable antique, but perhaps it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about jewelry, cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t keep anything of real value lying around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart.\u201d Thinking over what she\u2019d told him, Troy peeled away the paper from his muffin. It was still warm enough to burn his fingers, and he left it to cool a moment while he doctored his coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened to me!\u201d Faith cried, then inhaled a deep, calming breath. When she spoke again, her voice shook slightly. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>He sympathized with her and knew how she felt\u2014angry, violated, afraid. \u201cI want to assure you the department\u2019s doing everything within our power to find whoever is responsible,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she asked, her eyes wide and imploring.</p><p>Troy longed to reach across the table to take her hand. \u201cI wish I could answer that, but as you said, none of this makes sense. I\u2019d like to think it was a random act of violence, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Regardless of who did this and why, you were an easy target. From this point forward you won\u2019t be again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d Faith straightened, tensing her shoulders as if to say she\u2019d dare anyone to try breaking into her home again. Troy had encountered that determination of hers more than once and almost felt sorry for anyone who earned her wrath.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you can tell me?\u201d Troy asked. \u201cYou never know where a small piece of information can lead, no matter how insignificant it seems.\u201d He remembered a case years ago, when he was still a deputy. A break-in had occurred, and Troy had stopped to talk to some kids at a bus stop, asking if they\u2019d seen anything unusual. A kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than eight or nine, mentioned a white Jeep. The man who drove it wore a Mariners\u2019 baseball cap and had long, blond hair. The boy had claimed the man looked \u201cmean.\u201d</p><p>A couple of days later, Troy had passed a white Jeep parked at a gas station. When the driver came out, he had on a Mariners\u2019 baseball cap, covering long, stringy blond hair. Suspecting this might be the same person, Troy ran the license plate number\u2014and discovered that the Jeep had been reported stolen. He followed the man and arrested him without incident. It later turned out that this man was responsible for a series of break-ins all around Cedar Cove. The best part of the story was that the majority of valuables had been recovered.</p><p>At his question, Faith hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this means anything,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLet me be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d A vulnerable look came over her. \u201cI have a feeling that the person who broke into the house has been back.\u201d</p><p>Without revealing any outward sign of alarm, Troy asked, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Faith stood and walked over to the kitchen sink and pointed out the window. \u201cThere was graffiti on the back of the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI painted over it the next day.... The words were ugly and I didn\u2019t want my grandchildren to see them.... Or anyone else for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Faith grabbed a coat from the peg by the back door and led him outside. He shivered in the January cold as he followed Faith to the far side of the garage. He could see the fresh layer of white paint. \u201cAlthough it might be embarrassing, tell me exactly what the message said.\u201d</p><p>Faith stared down at her feet and told him. She was right; they were ugly words. He wished she\u2019d told him about this earlier, since it might have yielded evidence. Now, however, it was too late.</p><p>Troy frowned. \u201cYou think whoever was responsible for the break-in came back and did this?\u201d It was definitely a reasonable assumption.</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cThe other night...I woke up and heard noises. At first I was too terrified to move. I was afraid they were inside the house. It took me a few minutes to realize the sound came from the garage.\u201d She was obviously making an effort to control her voice, but despite that it started to tremble.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called 9\u20131\u20131,\u201d he said urgently.</p><p>\u201cI know...I wish I had. Oh, Troy, I\u2019ve been so scared.\u201d</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t bear to see Faith upset. Instinctively he slipped his arms around her\u2014and she willingly moved into his embrace. He felt her shudder and his hold tightened. He wanted to reassure her that he\u2019d do whatever he could to prevent anything like this from happening again.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called 9\u20131\u20131,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it was nothing? I thought my imagination might be running away with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you saw the graffiti....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next morning,\u201d she confirmed, \u201cand I realized I\u2019d been foolish not to call the authorities right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have,\u201d he said. There was no telling what might\u2019ve happened while she hemmed and hawed, afraid to risk a little embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cFaith, listen to me.\u201d He cupped his hands around her face and raised her head so that their eyes met. \u201cI would rather you had peace of mind. I don\u2019t want you lying awake at night, worrying that someone\u2019s on the property.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping nights...I haven\u2019t slept more than two or three hours at a time since the break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I was ridiculous. I won\u2019t ignore any noises again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas this happened more than once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know...I don\u2019t think so. I sleep so lightly now. I\u2019m afraid someone will break in.... My emotions are all askew\u2014just look at me. I\u2019m not a weak woman! I hate being vulnerable. I\u2019m on the verge of tears, and all because I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to affect my ability to do my job. The worst thing\u2014\u201d she paused \u201c\u2014is the fear. Night comes and I\u2019m terrified all over again.\u201d</p><p>Troy pressed his hand against her head, weaving his fingers into her thick dark hair. He was almost overwhelmed by the temptation to bury his face in the clean freshness of it. He\u2019d missed her more than he\u2019d dared admit, even to himself.</p><p>He wished he knew how to reassure her. But no matter how strong that desire, he refused to whisper platitudes, nor would he mislead her by making promises he couldn\u2019t keep.</p><p>Faith must have recognized that she\u2019d said more than she\u2019d intended. She eased out of his embrace and glanced self-consciously at the street. She folded her arms around her waist, as if she suddenly felt cold.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this inside,\u201d Troy suggested, placing his arm around her again as they headed back to the house.</p><p>Once inside, Faith removed her coat and hung it by the door, first straightening the shoes and boots that stood there. Then she refreshed their coffees. Troy could tell that this busywork was an attempt to regain her composure.</p><p>For his part, he would\u2019ve been content to spend the next ten years holding Faith, even if it meant standing in full view of the street on a bitter January day. With the woman he loved in his arms, physical comfort didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d hardly noticed the damp or cold\u2014until she\u2019d stepped out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another bran muffin?\u201d Faith asked. Before he could answer, she added, \u201cI believe I got this recipe from my mother. If you like, I could pass it along to your daughter. I saw Megan the other day. Did she mention that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d Troy took off his damp coat and hung it over the back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl, Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said a bit more loudly this time.</p><p>She clutched the kitchen counter with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI know how distressed you must be.\u201d</p><p>She spit out a laugh as though his statement had been an exaggeration. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Tired, but...Okay, I\u2019ll confess this break-in has me unnerved. But wouldn\u2019t anyone feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they would. Now, promise me you won\u2019t hesitate to call 9\u20131\u20131 if you suspect someone\u2019s on the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she finally said, \u201cif I really think there\u2019s someone here.\u201d</p><p>Troy figured this half promise was about all he could wheedle out of her.</p><p>They stood just looking at each other for a moment, neither of them inclined to speak.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to stop by one evening?\u201d he asked, hoping she\u2019d agree to that, too. Maybe she\u2019d let him come over occasionally and then, given time, he\u2019d have the opportunity to regain her trust.</p><p>She considered his question, then slowly shook her head. \u201cI appreciate your willingness to look in on me, but...but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Personally Troy thought it was brilliant.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I phoned and checked on you in the morning?\u201d Maybe he was pressing his luck, but he had to try.</p><p>\u201cI suppose...but only this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly this once,\u201d he echoed. \u201cI won\u2019t call again after tomorrow.\u201d The crack in her resolve to keep him out of her life was barely discernible but it was there.</p><p>Reaching for his coat and hat, Troy saw that he\u2019d left a small portion of his bran muffin on the plate. He popped it in his mouth and gave Faith a lopsided grin. He swallowed, wishing he\u2019d accepted a second one when she\u2019d offered it. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Megan to get the recipe from you,\u201d he said on his way to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to share it.\u201d</p><p>Troy lingered at the front door, but there was nothing else to say. Leaving Faith never seemed to get any easier.</p><p>Six</p><p>Will Jefferson knew he needed to play his cards carefully if he hoped to have a relationship with Shirley Bliss. Now that his divorce from Georgia was final, he was a free man. Of course, a wedding ring hadn\u2019t been much of a detriment in the past. He\u2019d had a number of affairs, which wasn\u2019t something he took pride in. It was just...a fact. Georgia had repeatedly forgiven him, and he always meant to be faithful. His intentions were good\u2014the best\u2014but then he\u2019d meet someone and the attraction would be there and, well, when it came to beautiful women, he was weak. That was all he could say about it. He didn\u2019t even attempt to defend himself, although, to be fair, it did take two to tango\u2014and to do certain other things.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He experienced more than a twinge of guilt about cheating on his wife. Ex-wife. They should never have gotten married. The marriage hadn\u2019t worked for either of them. They were mismatched, and as time went on, there\u2019d been less and less to hold them together. He hoped Georgia didn\u2019t resent him. But he\u2019d begun a new life here in Cedar Cove, returning to his hometown, where he\u2019d spent some of his happiest years. He wanted to become that person again, wanted to redeem himself, in his own eyes and those of his family and friends. Maybe Shirley Bliss would help him....</p><p>He\u2019d met Shirley, a widow, when he\u2019d purchased the art gallery. He\u2019d felt an immediate attraction, but it was more than that. She was a widow, and therefore available, so perhaps that meant he\u2019d moved beyond his compulsion to seduce women already involved with other men. Whatever the reason for his urge to stray\u2014boredom, the thrill of conquest, the need to prove his own masculinity\u2014he wanted to overcome it. Besides, he was genuinely interested in Shirley and impressed by her talent.</p><p>Will wandered over to his desk. The Harbor Street Art Gallery was doing well, better than he\u2019d expected. That was due, in no small way, to Shirley. She\u2019d given him some excellent suggestions, many of which he\u2019d used. The idea for the new display cases had come from her. They\u2019d cost more than he\u2019d budgeted for, but they were worth it.</p><p>In appreciation for all her help, he\u2019d made Shirley, who worked with fabrics, the featured artist for January and would be pleased to inform her that over the weekend he\u2019d sold the largest piece she had on display. He had a check for her, and he thought she\u2019d be as excited about this sale as he was.</p> <p>When he picked up the phone, he did so with a sense of anticipation. Aside from his pleasure in her success and consequently his own, he felt challenged by her. And not merely as a potential lover. This was the perfect opportunity to get to know her better. She hadn\u2019t revealed any interest in him, however, which was puzzling. Not to brag, but he knew he looked good; at sixty he\u2019d gained a stateliness that suited him. He was intelligent and had a natural charm, as so many other women\u2014including Georgia\u2014had told him. The possibility existed that Shirley was still in love with her dead husband. From what Will understood, it\u2019d been a year or so since the accident that had claimed his life.</p><p>Will knew his own strengths and his weaknesses. He hadn\u2019t gotten this far without identifying his assets and using them. He didn\u2019t mind admitting that he was a man who generally got what he wanted; he\u2019d also admit that this trait hadn\u2019t always been to his benefit. Georgia had called him a \u201cserial philanderer,\u201d claiming he only wanted women he couldn\u2019t have\u2014and when he got them he lost interest. He didn\u2019t deny it but he believed that Shirley would change all that.</p><p>He dialed her number and waited for her to answer. After four rings the answering machine came on. Then, just as he was about to leave a message, he heard someone pick up.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Shirley sounded a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Will returned, smiling, glad they\u2019d been able to connect.</p> <p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d she demanded, irritation in her voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Will. Will Jefferson from the Harbor Street Art Gallery,\u201d he told her. That she hadn\u2019t recognized his voice stung his ego. He\u2019d hoped, despite her previous reticence, that she\u2019d been thinking about him, too. Apparently that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>Her hesitation was just long enough to be noticeable. \u201cI apologize if I snapped at you.\u201d</p><p>Will was more than willing to forgive her. \u201cI\u2019m guessing I phoned at a bad time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually try to work while Tanni\u2019s in school.\u201d</p><p>Tanni was Shirley\u2019s teenage daughter. He\u2019d met her twice. The girl was dating a young man with an unusual first name. Shank? Shiver. Shaw...that was it. Shaw.</p> <p>The kid had talent. So did Tanni, although she was the one who\u2019d brought Shaw\u2019s work to Will\u2019s attention. Shaw\u2019s portraits, especially, had a lot of promise. He\u2019d shown the kid\u2019s work to an old friend of his, Larry Knight, who was a successful and influential artist, and who happened to be in Seattle recently. Larry had confirmed Will\u2019s assessment. The way Will figured it, Shirley would be grateful for his help. And Will most definitely wanted to obtain Shirley\u2019s gratitude.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI\u2019ll remember to call either early in the morning or closer to dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour exhibit\u2019s done well,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t seem inclined to continue the conversation, Will charged ahead. \u201cI wanted to know if it would be convenient for me to stop by later this evening.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated again. \u201cIs there a reason?\u201d</p><p>The question put him slightly on edge; he\u2019d expected a warmer welcome. He was disappointed that he needed an excuse, but then he\u2019d already made more than one incorrect assumption with Shirley. \u201cYes, a very good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a check for you. The wildflower panel sold this weekend.\u201d The piece, a fabric collage, was a stunning work. Everyone who\u2019d viewed it, including Will, had been enchanted.</p> <p>Shirley squealed with delight. \u201cIt sold! It really sold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Will had never heard her sound so uninhibited. \u201cAnd the woman who bought it is interested in a couple of your other pieces, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cI could drop off the check if you like.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to think he was pressuring her.</p><p>\u201cAh...unfortunately I have plans this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could visit tomorrow if that would be more convenient.\u201d He was trying not to come across as pushy; at the same time, he was curious to know what her plans might be.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cMaybe it would be best just to drop it in the mail.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s head was spinning. She didn\u2019t want to see him, or not at her house, anyway. That was a disappointment. \u201cI have a better idea. Why don\u2019t you come to the gallery and pick it up?\u201d</p><p>She leaped on the suggestion. \u201cSure...that would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would be a good time?\u201d he asked, implying that he was busy, too, and they should schedule this meeting.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could make it into town later this afternoon,\u201d she said.</p><p>They agreed on four-thirty and Will set the phone back in its cradle, smiling. He\u2019d gone out of his way for her daughter\u2019s boyfriend at Shirley\u2019s request\u2014or with her approval, at any rate. Shaw had talent, but talent was cheap. He was giving the teenager a leg up, and he wanted to make sure Shirley valued his effort and the fact that he\u2019d called in a favor from a friend.</p><p>Now that their meeting was set, Will closed the gallery a half hour early, then took the time to comb his hair and change his shirt. Before returning to the main part of the gallery, he glanced at his reflection in the mirror.</p><p>Normally he would\u2019ve been confident he looked good, but Shirley\u2019s reluctance made him feel somewhat insecure\u2014not a familiar sensation.</p><p>While he waited for Shirley, he checked his watch every couple of minutes. He exhaled a sigh of relief when he saw her park in front of the gallery. She climbed out and started toward the entrance, paused, then turned back to her vehicle.</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t about to let her walk off. He hurried over to the front door and threw it open.</p><p>\u201cShirley,\u201d he called. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She turned around. \u201cThe sign says the gallery\u2019s closed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed lightly. \u201cIt is for everyone but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>He opened the door wider and gestured her inside.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the check?\u201d she asked the moment she crossed the threshold. Then, as if she understood how rude she\u2019d been, she added, \u201cI, uh, know how busy you are and I don\u2019t want to detain you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the office.\u201d When she didn\u2019t move, he repeated, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, she came all the way into the gallery.</p><p>Will closed the door and walked toward his small office, with her following. He handed her a white envelope, which held her check. \u201cYou know, I never heard if you received the wine-and-cheese basket I left on your doorstep during the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.... I apologize. I should\u2019ve written a thank-you note.\u201d</p><p>She did seem appropriately contrite. Will had paid a premium for that basket. This wasn\u2019t some run-of-the-mill wine-and-cheese ensemble, either. Everything had been imported from France.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I just wanted to be sure you got it,\u201d he said nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you bring it by?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cChristmas Day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope you weren\u2019t alone on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cI was, but it wasn\u2019t any big deal. I had a couple of invitations, but...I didn\u2019t feel well.\u201d He\u2019d rather not admit he hadn\u2019t accepted those invitations\u2014from Olivia and his niece, Justine\u2014because he\u2019d thought he could spend the day with Shirley. He\u2019d made the mistake of assuming she\u2019d be home and alone, the same way he\u2019d been. He knew her kids would be there, but kids that age didn\u2019t enjoy hanging around with their mothers. As a result of his mistaken assumption, he\u2019d ended up going to Olivia\u2019s for dinner and then watching White Christmas on TV in his apartment for what had to be the twentieth time.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for not sending you that thank-you note,\u201d she told him again.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I only wanted to make sure you found the gift.\u201d He brightened. \u201cBut...\u201d he said in a teasing voice \u201c...you could make it up to me.\u201d He\u2019d keep it light, easy, relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, frowning instantly. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a widow.\u201d</p><p>She took a small step in retreat, as though the subject wasn\u2019t one she intended to discuss with him. That was fine; Will had no desire to draw her dead husband into the conversation. He just wanted to establish her availability\u2014and his.</p><p>\u201cAs I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m on my own, too. I thought we could get together one evening,\u201d he said, \u201cor maybe we could meet one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Shirley took another small step away from him. Now that she had her check, she seemed eager to leave.</p><p>\u201cNothing formal, you understand,\u201d Will clarified. \u201cLunch or coffee, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a slight smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be a date,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would be a chat over coffee, a getting-to-know-you session, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d love to hear more of your ideas for the gallery,\u201d he added, to remind her of the conversation they\u2019d already had back in the fall. \u201cI\u2019m free now, if you are. I hear the Pot Belly Deli has an excellent selection of coffees and teas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mean now? As in right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s convenient. We can walk down the hill. It\u2019s not far.\u201d At least she hadn\u2019t immediately turned him down\u2014that was encouraging.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another time,\u201d she said after a long moment.</p><p>\u201cSure, whenever.\u201d He shrugged off her rejection.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d she said next, as if to suggest she\u2019d prefer it if he didn\u2019t call her.</p><p>Okay, on to plan B. \u201cI had some news regarding Shaw,\u201d he told her, hoping to give her extra incentive to accept his invitation.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Her interest was piqued, he could see. That was good. He hated to resort to manipulation but she wasn\u2019t leaving him a lot of options. In the past, he\u2019d rarely had to be so blatant.</p><p>\u201cI had another talk with the friend who looked at Shaw\u2019s work.\u201d Will didn\u2019t offer any more information than that. Nor was he disposed to do so. If she wanted an update, she\u2019d have to meet him for coffee.</p> <p>With the check in her hand, she waited for an awkward minute or two, and when the information regarding Shaw wasn\u2019t forthcoming, she made her excuses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to the door,\u201d Will said, walking beside her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p><p>He was tempted to extend the conversation, delay her parting. He could bring up any number of topics she\u2019d find relevant or interesting. However, he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d she murmured as she stepped into the darkening afternoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Will closed the door and locked it behind her, knowing she\u2019d hear the turn of the lock. That was intentional. He didn\u2019t want her to think he was begging or that he was desperate for her company. And yet, it was increasingly how he felt. She intrigued and attracted him and he felt intuitively that they could be good for each other. And, he had to acknowledge with a hint of shame, he wasn\u2019t immune to the thrill of the chase.</p> <p>Briefly he wondered if something was holding Shirley back\u2014some gossip she\u2019d heard about him. He frowned. He didn\u2019t think Grace Harding had mentioned their Internet relationship. His sister wouldn\u2019t have, either. No, that couldn\u2019t be it.</p><p>What had happened with Grace was regrettable. Little did Will know then that within a few years he\u2019d be returning to live in Cedar Cove. That whole situation, which had begun as a mild flirtation via the Internet, had become extremely unpleasant, and he was happy to put it behind him. He\u2019d been genuinely fond of Grace, still was. Her husband was a nice guy\u2014and not someone he wanted to cross. He was glad her marriage had worked out. Besides, he didn\u2019t believe in fouling his own nest, so to speak.</p><p>Will turned off the gallery showroom lights and went upstairs to his small apartment. He\u2019d made the transition from his previous apartment to the space above the gallery because he\u2019d found someone to sublet the place he\u2019d first rented. Mack, the son of P.I. Roy McAfee down the street, had recently joined the Cedar Cove fire department, so the timing was perfect.</p><p>His residence in the gallery still needed plenty of work, but it was adequate for now. Sighing, he decided to relax with a glass of wine. He had no idea how long he\u2019d been sitting in front of the television when the phone rang, jolting him out of his stupor.</p><p>Caller ID informed him it was Shirley Bliss.</p><p>With a knowing smile, he muted the volume on the TV and reached for the receiver. \u201cHello, Shirley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Will...Is that invitation for coffee still open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He tried not to reveal how pleased he was to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She sounded anxious to see him now.</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like to meet?\u201d He set his wineglass on the side table and leaned back in his recliner.</p><p>\u201cCould we make it this evening, like you suggested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late now. Can I convince you to dine with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her response was clipped. \u201cNot tonight.... As I said, I have a previous engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019d forgotten that. Coffee it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we meet at Mocha Mama\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He didn\u2019t particularly care where they went. He hoped to put her at ease, and if everything went as he wished, this \u201cprevious engagement\u201d would disappear as the evening progressed.</p><p>\u201cShall we say in fifteen minutes?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cI can manage that.\u201d Will lowered his feet from the ottoman.</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if I brought my daughter along?\u201d</p><p>That definitely wasn\u2019t part of his game plan. \u201cWhy...sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw\u2019s at work. When I mentioned to Tanni that you had some information for Shaw, she called him and he\u2019d like to join us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he\u2019s working...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Shirley elaborated. \u201cAt Mocha Mama\u2019s. We\u2019ll see you in fifteen minutes,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d But she\u2019d already hung up.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Rachel Peyton lightly sprayed Grace Harding\u2019s hair and turned the stylist\u2019s chair around so she could see the full effect in the mirror. Grace held up the small hand mirror, then shook her head and watched as her hair swung forward.</p><p>She\u2019d told Rachel she\u2019d been looking for a new style, something short, sassy and easy to care for. \u201cI like it,\u201d Grace said, smiling.</p><p>It was always a relief to have a customer confirm her own feelings. \u201cThis is shorter than I\u2019ve ever seen you wear your hair.\u201d Initially she\u2019d had her doubts that such a breezy style would suit Grace, the town\u2019s head librarian, but she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cSeeing that Olivia has short hair now, it seems only fitting that I do, too. We\u2019ve always been best friends.\u201d Grace laughed. \u201cActually, she\u2019s completely bald. I love her, but I\u2019m not willing to go that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair will grow back,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cbut it might be a different color or texture.\u201d Olivia had come in earlier that week and had what remained of her hair shaved off. She\u2019d started her regimen of chemotherapy, and after the second session her hair had fallen out in clumps. Rachel had cut it quite short before the chemo, so the change wasn\u2019t as great as it might have been.</p><p>\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d Grace continued, \u201cOlivia and I can let our hair grow back together\u2014unless I like this style so much I don\u2019t want to change.\u201d</p><p>Rachel unsnapped the cape and removed it.</p><p>\u201cI heard you and Bruce Peyton got married,\u201d Grace said as she stood. \u201cRight around Christmas, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We were crazy to have our wedding at that time of year but we didn\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to plan it yet. We\u2019ll take one later, probably around Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Which was when their wedding was originally scheduled to take place. \u201cIt\u2019s just that with Bruce\u2019s work schedule, Jolene\u2019s schedule and mine, it\u2019s hard to find a time that fits everyone.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s smile was warm. \u201cCliff and I ran into that problem, too. In the end we simply eloped, although I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cUnfortunately we upset a lot of people, but afterward we had a huge party and everything worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently we\u2019ve done the same thing,\u201d Rachel told her. The girls at the shop had felt hurt about being excluded. Everything had been so rushed. In retrospect, perhaps they should\u2019ve waited until February, after all. But circumstances had prohibited that, since Rachel had given up her rental house, which had a new tenant. Bruce had been eager to marry her, and she\u2019d felt the same way. They\u2019d gone ahead despite her reservations, but even now Rachel wondered if they\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cThese things tend to take care of themselves,\u201d Grace said. \u201cCliff and I are happy and I can see you are, too, if the new-bride glow is anything to go by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Grace reached for her purse and paid for her haircut at the front counter. She also made another appointment for early March, about six weeks away.</p><p>With a small broom, Rachel swept up the brown curls that circled the styling chair. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say she was happy. She was, gleefully so, but she also felt sexually frustrated. Bruce did, too, and it was fast putting a strain on their relationship.</p><p>What Rachel hadn\u2019t expected, or Bruce, either, was Jolene\u2019s reaction to their marriage. Jolene, at thirteen, felt threatened by the upheaval in her life.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s daughter had been Rachel\u2019s special friend for years. They\u2019d started meeting after Stephanie Peyton\u2019s tragic death in a car accident. Jolene had only been five at the time. She\u2019d badly needed a woman in her life and had latched on to Rachel when she\u2019d given the little girl a haircut.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s own mother had died when she was young and she\u2019d been raised by an unmarried aunt. Because she understood what it was like to be a motherless child, Rachel had voluntarily stepped in. The two of them had quickly bonded.</p><p>Jolene had often played the role of matchmaker between Rachel and Bruce. But obviously she\u2019d never realized what would happen once Bruce and Rachel fell in love....</p><p>Rachel\u2019s marriage to Jolene\u2019s father had changed the dynamic within the family. Jolene was too immature and vulnerable to accept that. She feared being excluded or losing her place in Bruce\u2019s life. The girl had been demanding and unreasonable ever since the wedding.</p><p>Rachel and Bruce rarely had a moment alone. Making love had become a challenge. Jolene had always been a light sleeper and the slightest noise woke her. Her timing was impeccable; three times in the past week alone, Jolene had inadvertently interrupted their prologue to lovemaking. Or was it inadvertent? At any rate when she went back to bed, Bruce was either asleep or so irritated that the opportunity had been ruined.</p><p>\u201cYour next appointment just called and canceled,\u201d Joan, who handled the reception desk, told her.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that the color job?\u201d</p><p>Joan checked the schedule. \u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>That was two free hours. Two whole unexpected hours. Rachel\u2019s heart raced as she glanced at her watch. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other appointments this afternoon, right?\u201d</p><p>Joan checked again. \u201cNot that I can see.\u201d</p><p>An idea was taking shape. \u201cTerrific. Thanks.\u201d She grabbed her purse, pulled out her cell phone and punched speed dial to connect with Bruce.</p><p>He answered on the second ring. \u201cBruce speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWorking, what do you think?\u201d Bruce ran a small independent computer-support business, with a couple of employees.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose...Any special reason you want me home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rachel giggled, and no doubt sounded like a schoolgirl. \u201cOh, yes, there\u2019s a very special reason. My last appointment canceled and Jolene\u2019s got basketball tryouts after school.\u201d</p><p>Bruce caught on right away. \u201cYou mean we would be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d She giggled again.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Rachel closed the phone and held it against her heart, grinning wildly. She saw Joan watching her, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t want me to schedule anything for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Rachel hurried into the back room where she threw on her coat. She was a woman with a mission.</p><p>She got home first and tore into the bedroom, where she closed the drapes, then pulled off her clothes and hopped into the shower. Her best friend, Teri Polgar, had bought her a sheer negligee as a wedding gift, which Rachel had yet to wear. She was finally going to initiate it.</p><p>The front door opened and Bruce dashed inside. \u201cRachel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn here,\u201d she called back, hoping she sounded sultry and sexy. She climbed onto the bed and lay on her side, facing him, the provocative black negligee revealing far more than it concealed. Her chin was propped on one hand.</p><p>Bruce came into the room and stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cLooking for someone?\u201d Rachel purred.</p><p>He swallowed visibly. It was a moment before he was able to move or speak. \u201cI need a shower,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>Rachel rolled onto her back. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll try.\u201d He started throwing off his clothes as he trotted toward the bathroom. His shirt fell onto the carpet next to the bed. It was a testament to the quality of the garment that the buttons hadn\u2019t been ripped off in his haste. His shoes were next; one was kicked under the bed and the other bounced against the wall and into the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cWe have all afternoon, you realize,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I pour us a glass of champagne?\u201d</p><p>The shower door opened. \u201cChampagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother gift from Teri and Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure...\u201d His gaze was riveted on her. \u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you make me feel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>While Bruce showered, Rachel went into the kitchen. Although it was an odd contrast with the negligee, she wore her old terry-cloth robe, not wanting to risk being seen through the windows. She opened the refrigerator and sorted through the milk and yogurt and eggs to the farthest reaches of the bottom shelf, where she\u2019d stored the champagne. Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, something she\u2019d never expected to taste.</p><p>By the time she heard Bruce, the flutes were out and ready. She\u2019d lit several scented candles, too. The mood was set except for the music. She found an appropriate CD and put it on.</p><p>A minute or two later, Bruce met her in the kitchen. He was barefoot and naked with a towel around his waist. His dark hair fell in wet tendrils, dripping moisture onto his neck and shoulders. As far as Rachel was concerned, he\u2019d never looked sexier.</p> <p>Rachel turned to greet him with a shy smile. She held the champagne bottle in her hand and removed the wire top. \u201cSomeone once told me that the correct way to open champagne is to twist the bottle and not the cork. When properly opened, it should sound like a contented woman.\u201d</p><p>Bruce pretended to leer. \u201cI\u2019m more than eager to hear the sound of a contented woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe champagne or me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Rachel attempted to follow the opening directions for champagne, and the cork popped much more loudly than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cYou can be as noisy as you want, too,\u201d her husband joked, taking the bottle out of her hands. He filled both flutes and gave her one. Clutching his own, he leaned forward and pressed his mouth to hers. Their lips clung as the kiss deepened. Although only their mouths touched, an overwhelming physical response rippled through her.</p><p>Bruce groaned and put down his champagne. \u201cMaybe we could drink this later?\u201d he asked, hardly sounding like himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d she asked as he took the flute from her and set it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit warm in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have too many clothes on.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled. \u201cYou could be right.\u201d She glanced out the kitchen window, saw no one, then peeled off her robe.</p><p>Bruce led her down the narrow hallway to the master bedroom, then lifted her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cBruce, I\u2019m too heavy,\u201d she protested but not too strenuously.</p><p>\u201cWell...it\u2019s not far from here to the bed.\u201d He shoved the door with his foot, closing it partway.</p><p>Looping her arms around his neck, Rachel nibbled at his earlobe and felt his body shiver with excitement. She was excited, too. The freedom to make love without fear of waking or disturbing Jolene was heaven.</p><p>Bruce reverently placed her on the bed, his eyes glowing with love and wonder. \u201cThese past few weeks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Reaching for her husband, she urged him down so that he was sprawled across her. They kissed until Rachel was breathless with desire. \u201cOh, Bruce,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI want you so much.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had the words left her lips than the front door opened and closed.</p><p>Bruce froze.</p><p>Rachel did, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jolene doing home?\u201d Bruce whispered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be at basketball tryouts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Jolene called out. \u201cAre you home? Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d Rachel called back as Bruce scrambled off her. He\u2019d just managed to grab the towel and cover himself when his daughter appeared in the doorway.</p><p>A look of sheer horror came over her. She scrunched up her face and cried, \u201cGross!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene.\u201d Rachel hurriedly hid her negligee with a pillow. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here, remember?\u201d She knotted both hands into fists at her sides.</p><p>Rachel could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d kindly give us a few minutes of privacy,\u201d Bruce said from between clenched teeth. Keeping his hand clamped on the towel around his waist, he walked to the bedroom door and closed it completely.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would happen,\u201d Jolene cried from the other side. \u201cIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t even live here anymore. All you think about is...that.\u201d</p><p>Apparently that was a synonym for sex.</p><p>The girl marched down the hallway to her room and slammed the door. The sound reverberated through the house.</p><p>\u201cJolene, that\u2019s not true.\u201d The kid had no idea of the restraint she and Bruce had employed since they\u2019d been married.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be,\u201d Bruce said with a disgusted sigh. \u201cThis is getting ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rachel was disappointed, too. She stepped up behind him and slipped her arms around his waist. \u201cShe needs time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been less than a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she wanted us to marry,\u201d Bruce argued.</p><p>\u201cShe did. Only she\u2019s afraid of what it\u2019s going to do to her relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d Bruce muttered. He broke away long enough to jerk on his pants.</p><p>\u201cBut, Bruce, it has. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, no.\u201d Every movement conveyed his frustration and anger. \u201cWe\u2019re married, and I want to make love to my wife. It isn\u2019t right for us to be sneaking around because we\u2019re afraid Jolene might know what we\u2019re doing. She should know. That\u2019s what married couples do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Bruce, I\u2019m as frustrated as you are, but we need to be sensitive to Jolene\u2019s feelings. We should never have rushed into this.\u201d</p><p>Bruce whirled around, his face contorted. \u201cSo now you regret marrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she insisted. \u201cI love you and Jolene more than I could ever express. What I wish is that we\u2019d given Jolene time to get used to the fact that I was going to be moving into the house.\u201d Rachel didn\u2019t want her husband to think for even an instant that she didn\u2019t want to be married. \u201cFor seven years it was just the two of you and I was conveniently tucked away for whenever Jolene wanted to visit or chat. Now I\u2019m here 24/7, and she feels threatened.\u201d</p><p>Bruce sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed his face. \u201cThis is torture.\u201d</p><p>Rachel sat next to him and leaned her shoulder against his. \u201cIt is for me, too. But remember, there\u2019s always tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cis to be able to make love and not worry about the bed creaking.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t funny but Rachel couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope it\u2019s soon.\u201d Bruce left the bedroom, and a few minutes later Rachel heard the front door close. He must have gone back to the shop.</p><p>Wondering how best to approach her stepdaughter, Rachel changed out of the negligee and into her clothes. She gently tapped on Jolene\u2019s bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had basketball tryouts after school,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe notice said it was today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t. Tryouts got canceled because the coach is sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stood by her stepdaughter\u2019s bedroom door for a long time and tried to cajole Jolene into coming out so they could discuss this.</p><p>After a while Jolene stopped answering her.</p><p>Rachel turned the handle, figuring that if Jolene wouldn\u2019t come to her, she\u2019d go to Jolene.</p><p>Only the bedroom door was locked.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Troy was still in the parking lot outside city hall when Mayor Benson came charging toward him. He\u2019d just returned from a speaking engagement at the local Rotary, but other than that, it hadn\u2019t been a good day. Two of his deputies had phoned in sick. The flu bug had hit his department hard, and he was stretched to the limit. His conversation with the Seattle reporter, Kathleen Sadler, hadn\u2019t improved his mood, either. The woman was demanding responses to questions he simply couldn\u2019t answer. Judging by the angry look on the mayor\u2019s face, Troy\u2019s day was about to get even worse.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Louie?\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with Kathleen Sadler.\u201d</p><p>Troy wanted to close his eyes and groan. When he hadn\u2019t supplied the information she was after, the reporter had obviously called Louie. No wonder the mayor was in such a state.</p><p>\u201cKathleen Sadler,\u201d Mayor Benson repeated. \u201cI thought you were going to take care of it. I already told you how important it is that we keep this story out of the public eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did speak to her,\u201d Troy said. \u201cShe refused to accept what I told her. She kept saying there has to be more to the story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was afraid of.\u201d Louie clenched and unclenched his fists.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to avoid her, you should\u2019ve forwarded the call to me.\u201d Troy didn\u2019t understand why Louie felt obligated to talk to the woman, especially since she seemed to be making a pest of herself. If there was a story behind those remains, the facts would come out eventually. But at this point, there was nothing either of them could tell her.</p><p>\u201cI did suggest she contact you,\u201d Louie said, \u201conly it turns out you were at the Rotary meeting and, fool that I am, I took the call.\u201d</p><p>In Troy\u2019s opinion, that was the mayor\u2019s problem. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her again, if you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Apparently she\u2019s coming to Cedar Cove on Wednesday and wants to interview the teenagers who discovered the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d Troy would do everything within his power to make sure of it. Philip Wilson, better known as Shaw, was of legal age but his name hadn\u2019t been released to the press. Tanni Bliss, the other teenager, was still in high school. He\u2019d contact their parents and give them a heads-up about this reporter. Both kids had been pretty shaken, as Troy recalled\u2014Tanni more so than Philip.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Louie said and gave a satisfied nod of his head. \u201cYou deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it fast. I gather she\u2019s bringing a photographer to take a picture of the cave. She\u2019s writing a feature story on this, and with our tourism initiatives, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. You\u2019ve got to convince her there\u2019s nothing to report.\u201d</p> <p>Troy shrugged. \u201cWhy do you suppose she\u2019s so interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Louie flared. \u201cLike I said earlier, this is bad timing. Jack\u2019s doing a feature on tourism for the Chronicle that we hope will get picked up across the state, and this woman\u2019s article is bound to overshadow his. Cedar Cove could do without the negative press.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the half of it, either. The council just put together a request for state funds to enhance tourism in our area.\u201d He looked up at the heavens. \u201cWhy is all of this happening now?\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t have an answer for him. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to make it go away.\u201d</p><p>Louie seemed slightly mollified. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d He handed Troy a slip of paper. \u201cIn case you need it, here\u2019s that reporter\u2019s phone number. You try and reason with her.\u201d</p><p>Troy sighed. The thing he\u2019d noticed about reporters was that the more fuss he made, the keener their interest. Any bit of information he fed them was never enough; they demanded more. Then they\u2019d dig around until they found what they wanted\u2014or a reasonable facsimile thereof. Over the years, Troy had learned that the best policy was to say nothing, or at least nothing of substance. He was polite and cordial, but his lips were sealed.</p><p>After the mayor left, Troy hurried to his office. He\u2019d just sat down at his desk when his cell phone chirped. He rarely received personal calls. A quick check told him it was his daughter.</p> <p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy. I wanted to tell you I saw Faith.\u201d</p><p>Hearing Faith\u2019s name produced an instant flash of anticipation, immediately crowded out by regret.</p><p>\u201cShe gave me something for you.\u201d</p><p>Troy sat up straighter. \u201cShe did?\u201d He hated the hopefulness that elevated his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for bran muffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His hopes quickly deflated.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d been over to her house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a routine call. I stopped by to follow up after the break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible that someone would do that to Faith.\u201d</p><p>Troy agreed.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen much of her lately?\u201d his daughter inquired. She sounded as if she\u2019d been taking classes from a trained investigator.</p><p>\u201cJust that once since the break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Megan said. \u201cFaith looked good, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>In Troy\u2019s opinion, Faith always looked good. \u201cYes, she did,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe said you really enjoyed the muffins and suggested I bake them for you.\u201d</p><p>As he recalled, he hadn\u2019t had anything to eat that particular morning and had skipped lunch. The fact was, he would\u2019ve eaten sawdust if Faith had served it.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d bake these for you and bring them over this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, thank you.\u201d A reminder of Faith was the last thing he needed.</p><p>\u201cCan I drop them off after dinner? I mean, you\u2019ll be home, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>This was obviously an exploratory question to see if he\u2019d be with Faith.</p><p>\u201cCraig wanted to run a couple of errands tonight and I figured I\u2019d go with him, then we\u2019ll stop at your place. Should I call first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She seemed disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around seven. We won\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome anytime, Megan, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes before Troy closed his cell and slipped it back inside its case. His daughter sounded better than she had since Sandy\u2019s death. Troy was well aware that she missed her mother, but Megan had come to terms with her grief, the same way he had.</p><p>Before he went home, Troy left a message for Kathleen Sadler at the Seattle paper. For the second time, he asked that she direct all future calls to him. She probably felt Louie Benson was an easier target, but Troy planned to put a stop to that. He\u2019d prefer the mayor not question him in the parking lot again.</p><p>On his drive home, Troy decided to swing past Rosewood Lane. He didn\u2019t expect to see Faith, although he hoped he would. It\u2019d been more than a week since they\u2019d talked.</p><p>As it happened, he saw her struggling with a heavy bag of groceries, dragging them from the backseat of her car. She glanced up just as he drove slowly past. Since she\u2019d already seen his vehicle, Troy pulled over to the curb and parked.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d he said, moving toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But even as she said it, she surrendered the two heavy bags.</p><p>Troy trailed her up the back steps and into the kitchen, where he set the groceries on the counter.</p><p>Faith stood against the stove, hands braced behind her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d How polite and stilted they sounded, like strangers brushing past each other on the street.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I make a habit of driving by your home, Faith,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Deputy Walker to make a couple of detours this way during the course of his shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said again. She lowered her gaze as if she found something on the floor of infinite interest.</p><p>\u201cHow are you sleeping?\u201d he asked, reluctant to leave.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cBetter,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cAny more unexplained noises?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cFaith, if there\u2019s a problem I want to hear about it. You aren\u2019t the kind of woman who imagines things.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt was probably nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have heard something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night...\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t finish, Troy prompted her. \u201cWhat about last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I thought I heard someone in the side yard. I got up and turned on the porch light and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you decided to investigate on your own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Troy, I\u2019m not stupid. I didn\u2019t wait for a storm, light a candle and then go walking on the cliff\u2019s edge like some gothic heroine, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting. I did phone 9\u20131\u20131, but while I waited for a patrol car I turned on the house lights and made a bunch of noise, as if I was ten people instead of just me.\u201d</p><p>A smile tilted his lips. \u201cExactly how did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, grinning, too. \u201cI banged a few pots, put the television on and started talking loudly to my imaginary son, who happens to be a professional wrestler.\u201d</p><p>Troy laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhen the officer arrived, whoever was outside\u2014if there was anyone outside\u2014had long since left.\u201d</p><p>Troy supposed that was why he hadn\u2019t heard about this. He didn\u2019t want to downplay its seriousness, nor did he want to alarm her. \u201cNext time let the officer do his job and don\u2019t distract the intruder. We want to catch whoever\u2019s doing this, Faith.\u201d</p><p>It took her a long time to respond. \u201cYes...It\u2019s just that...well, it\u2019s hard to wait around and do nothing. I don\u2019t want this...this intruder to get the idea that I\u2019m a willing victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to do something while you\u2019re waiting for a police response, phone me.\u201d Although he made the suggestion sound offhanded, he meant it. He needed to know she was safe.</p><p>Faith shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an option, Faith. I\u2019ll come, no questions asked.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know you would.\u201d She glanced toward the back door as if to signal that it was time to go.</p><p>He knew he should take the hint, but Troy couldn\u2019t make himself do it. \u201cI got a call from Megan this afternoon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I expected she\u2019d contact you.\u201d The phone rang and she immediately reached for it, no doubt relieved by the interruption. \u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Troy remembered when he used to call Faith and how his heart would race each time she answered. She\u2019d always sounded so pleased to hear from him....</p><p>After a moment, Faith hung up. \u201cA wrong number, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten many of those lately?\u201d he asked, his suspicions rising.</p><p>She exhaled slowly. \u201cNow that you mention it, I seem to be getting more than usual.\u201d</p><p>Troy frowned. \u201cWhat did call display tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt said \u2018private caller.\u2019 That\u2019s what it said before, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an unlisted number,\u201d she was quick to inform him.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t much help, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who really wants your information can get it. Having it unlisted doesn\u2019t make the number inaccessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who have a bit of computer savvy can find whatever they want.\u201d Having said that, Troy walked over to the phone and punched in the callback code. Nothing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have automatic callback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was necessary when I got my phone service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrder it, and the next time someone calls and hangs up, get the phone number.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her forehead. \u201cYou think it would be a good idea for me to return the call?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo! Give the phone number to me and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d When he saw the worry in her eyes, Troy wondered if he\u2019d frightened her. \u201cWill you do that?\u201d</p><p>The stubborn look was back.</p><p>\u201cIf not for your own peace of mind, then for mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you insist,\u201d she said with a resigned shrug.</p> <p>\u201cIdo.\u201d</p><p>Once again she glanced at the door.</p><p>Troy started in that direction. \u201cHave a good evening, Faith,\u201d he said, touching the brim of his hat in farewell.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>She followed him to the front door and watched him walk away. Troy felt her eyes on his back and wondered if she had as many regrets as he did. He wondered if she missed him half as much as he missed her.</p> <p>By the time he got back to his house on Pacific Boulevard, it was pitch-dark. Troy let himself in and, without thinking, picked up the television remote control. He didn\u2019t actually watch many programs. Mostly he appreciated the noise.</p><p>The local Seattle news flashed across the screen as Troy hung up his coat. He was about to close the closet door when he saw a reporter with a microphone in a setting that was far too familiar.</p><p>Troy stared. It was the area outside the cave where the skeletal remains had been discovered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jean Everson with a story that\u2019s more suited to Halloween than January,\u201d the young woman said, her voice low and intense. \u201cI\u2019m here in Cedar Cove to report that the unidentified remains of a young man have been found in this cave directly behind me. A youth. No one in Cedar Cove is talking. No one appears to know who this young man might be. The autopsy report indicates that he was sealed inside this cave for approximately thirty years. However, local law enforcement has apparently made no progress in resolving this tragic case.\u201d</p><p>All Troy could hope was that Louie Benson hadn\u2019t seen this news item. The woman\u2019s voice droned on in the distance, and she finally ended with something about \u201c...this sleepy town, where dark secrets might be buried along with those unidentified remains. This is Channel 7 Eyewitness News. Jean Everson reporting from Cedar Cove, Washington.\u201d</p><p>After a day like the one he\u2019d had, this wasn\u2019t what Troy wanted to see on his TV.</p> <p>No more than a minute later his phone rang. He didn\u2019t need to check caller ID to figure out who it was. Louie Benson wanted to talk to him for the second time that day.</p><p>Nine</p><p>All week, Mack McAfee had been looking forward to seeing Mary Jo Wyse and her infant daughter. He\u2019d delivered the baby on Christmas Eve at the Hardings\u2019 ranch. Appropriately enough, Mary Jo had named her Noelle.</p><p>It had been Mack\u2019s first delivery, the only time he\u2019d ever witnessed, let alone participated in, a birth. Being with Mary Jo, being the very first person to hold Noelle, had been one of the most emotional experiences of his life. Later on Christmas Day, when he\u2019d gone to visit his parents, he hadn\u2019t been able to stop talking about it. He\u2019d never felt anything like this before\u2014this exhilaration, this sense of joy, of significance. Everything else he\u2019d ever done paled in comparison. He\u2019d been overwhelmed by the power of that moment.</p><p>Mack was a firefighter with EMT training. He\u2019d worked at a number of jobs and trades through the years, but being part of the Cedar Cove fire department suited him best. He felt it was where he belonged, the kind of work he was meant to do.</p><p>He turned down the radio as he crossed the Narrows Bridge in Tacoma on the drive to Seattle. His thoughts were hectic and disorganized; he needed to settle down before seeing Mary Jo again. Noelle was two days shy of being a month old. A lot could have changed since his visit a couple of weeks earlier.</p><p>When they\u2019d last spoken, Mary Jo had sounded pleased to hear from him, but she had bad news. The insurance company where she\u2019d worked had downsized and she\u2019d been given a severance package. The future felt uncertain and he could tell she was trying hard to be optimistic. Wanting to encourage her, Mack had phoned twice since his previous visit, and their conversations, although short, had gone well. Still, he wished there was some way he could help her. Frankly he couldn\u2019t think of anything. She wouldn\u2019t accept financial assistance from him; she didn\u2019t even like taking it from her brothers.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d rather not live with them but there really weren\u2019t many options, especially now that she was unemployed. She tried to minimize her growing frustration, but Mack sensed how she felt.</p> <p>Having lived in the Seattle area for most of his life, he had no problem navigating the route to Mary Jo\u2019s address. As he\u2019d already discovered, it was a nice house in a pleasant neighborhood. He knew she\u2019d been raised in this very home, the youngest of four children. Her brothers considered themselves her guardians and had done so ever since their parents had died in an automobile accident.</p><p>Holding the huge teddy bear he\u2019d bought, Mack walked up the pathway that led to the house. He stared at the front door for a long moment, his heart pounding, before he pressed the bell.</p><p>Mary Jo answered almost right away. She carried Noelle, supporting the baby against her shoulder. The baby cried, a steady, plaintive whimpering, her tiny head wobbling.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she returned, smiling up at him.</p><p>Mary Jo looked...dreadful. No other word for it. She was dressed and her hair was brushed, but her makeup didn\u2019t disguise her paleness or the circles that darkened her eyes. Those tired eyes did light up when she saw him, though.</p><p>She moved aside so Mack could step into the house, which he noted was tidy. A white bassinet was set up in the living room close to the sofa, and there was a stack of disposable diapers on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI planned to have Noelle bathed and ready to receive company...but she had a bad morning.\u201d She patted Noelle\u2019s back. \u201cAnd consequently, so have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d Mack told her.</p><p>Mary Jo made a halfhearted effort to stifle a yawn. \u201cNoelle kept me up most of the night. I thought she\u2019d be tired this morning, but no such luck. Whenever I put her down, she starts to cry all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she sick?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI talked to the nurse and she said it\u2019s a classic case of colic. It generally hits at about three weeks.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAll Noelle does is fuss and cry. I don\u2019t think I slept more than an hour all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve phoned. We could have rescheduled.\u201d He would\u2019ve been disappointed but could easily have stopped by some other time.</p><p>\u201cI probably should have,\u201d she agreed, \u201conly I\u2019d been looking forward to showing you how much Noelle\u2019s changed since you saw her.\u201d</p><p>On his initial visit Noelle had been sleeping peacefully, wearing a tiny pink knit hat. She\u2019d slept the entire time, so he hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to do more than gaze at her admiringly.</p><p>Mack set down the teddy bear and saw that Noelle had already acquired a dozen or so stuffed animals.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers spoil her terribly,\u201d Mary Jo said, pointing to the heap of plush lions and puppies and bears. \u201cEspecially Linc. He\u2019s the oldest, and really should have a family of his own by now. His problem is that he takes his responsibilities\u2014or what he sees as his responsibilities\u2014too seriously. I think that\u2019s what caused his breakup with...Oh, you don\u2019t want to hear all this.\u201d She nodded toward the sofa. \u201cPlease make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>Noelle squirmed in Mary Jo\u2019s arms.</p><p>Mack took a seat, feeling awkward, since she was still standing. Mary Jo paced and patted the baby\u2019s back, but Noelle sent up a wail that startled him with its intensity.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any good.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo looked as if she was about to fall asleep standing up.</p><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll right. Thank you. I\u2019ll put on a pot of coffee. I need caffeine if I\u2019m going to function for the rest of the day.\u201d She placed Noelle in his arms.</p><p>Mack hadn\u2019t spent much time\u2014virtually none, in fact\u2014around babies, so this was a new experience. Noelle continued to yell and thrash her arms and legs. He stared down at her. Her small face was red and fierce with anger as she lay on his lap. Not knowing how to calm her, Mack offered his finger, which she instantly grasped. Then he rested his large hand on her tummy and began to hum a tune he remembered his mother singing to him. He didn\u2019t recall the words, but the melody had stayed in his mind.</p><p>Noelle blinked up at him and suddenly went still. Then her eyes opened wide. Although it was highly unlikely, it seemed to Mack that the baby recognized him.</p><p>Mary Jo poked her head into the room. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow did you convince her to quiet down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...hummed,\u201d he replied, a bit embarrassed. \u201cAs soon as she heard my voice, she stopped crying. I think she remembers me.\u201d If her hold on his finger was any indication, Noelle was happy to see him. The feeling was mutual.</p><p>Mary Jo watched the two of them. \u201cYou certainly have the touch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>When he glanced down, he saw that had closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. The poor kid was probably as exhausted as her mother. \u201cI\u2019ve often heard I have this mesmerizing effect on women,\u201d he joked.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled and Mack smiled back. He felt bad about the way David Rhodes had lied to her and mistreated her. The man wasn\u2019t just scum, he was an idiot to walk away from someone as wonderful as Mary Jo.</p><p>A few minutes later, she brought in a tray holding two filled coffee cups, along with a small pitcher of cream and a sugar bowl. She placed it on the table in front of the sofa, then took Noelle from his lap and tucked her inside the bassinet.</p><p>While she covered the infant with a knitted blanket, he added cream to his coffee.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time she\u2019s slept since about five,\u201d Mary Jo whispered, obviously afraid of waking the baby.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much she\u2019s grown in just a month.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s gaze rested on her sleeping daughter. \u201cI know...What I can\u2019t believe is how demanding motherhood is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers don\u2019t help?\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the other end of the sofa and reached for her coffee with a soft laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? All three of my brothers are scared to death of Noelle,\u201d she said as she spooned in sugar and stirred. \u201cI don\u2019t think Linc\u2019s held her more than once and he looked terrified the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mel and Ned?\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew. \u201cIf Noelle even burps, they come running for me. As for changing diapers, there\u2019s no way.\u201d</p><p>Mack could understand their fear. Noelle was so small, so fragile, so helpless. It was all too easy to imagine dropping her....</p><p>The conversation fell off, and Mack broached the subject that had been on his mind. \u201cHave you heard from David Rhodes?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo stiffened noticeably. \u201cNo, and I\u2019m glad of it.\u201d</p><p>Mack was disgusted with the other man for abdicating responsibility for his child, and he couldn\u2019t resist commenting. \u201cHe is Noelle\u2019s father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mary Jo shook her head as if anything to do with David Rhodes distressed her. \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss him,\u201d she said tersely.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He supposed it wasn\u2019t polite to bring up such an unpleasant subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by how gullible I was,\u201d she went on, \u201cand how willingly I accepted his lies.\u201d</p><p>Mack just nodded. Mary Jo was the one who\u2019d said she preferred not to talk about Noelle\u2019s father, but once she\u2019d started she couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p> <p>\u201cHe fed me all this garbage about loving me and wanting our baby. He claimed to be thrilled that I was pregnant, and he said that once he had his finances straightened out, we\u2019d get married.\u201d</p><p>She became more agitated as she spoke. Mack wanted to assure her that it wasn\u2019t necessary to tell him all this. But she was in mid-rant, and he couldn\u2019t get a word in.</p><p>\u201cThen, of course, I didn\u2019t hear from him for weeks on end. I even put off taking the birthing classes because when we did speak he told me how much he wanted to be with me when the baby was born. Yeah, right. And then\u2014\u201d she paused and took in a shuddering breath \u201c\u2014then he told me he\u2019d be in Cedar Cove for Christmas with his family, which, as we both know, was another big, fat lie.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cHis father and stepmother were on this cruise, and when I arrived in town there was no one, and I had to depend on the kindness of strangers. You\u2019d think by this time I\u2019d be smart enough to question anything he said. But did I? Oh, no, I swallowed that lie like all the rest.\u201d</p><p>As if she could no longer sit still, she vaulted to her feet. \u201cAfter Noelle was born, Ben let David know he had a daughter. You might expect him to contact me, but not so.\u201d She started pacing, her arms tightly crossed. \u201cNot that I wanted to hear from him, mind you. I might be a slow learner but once I figure something out, I don\u2019t forget.\u201d She wagged her finger at Mack. \u201cI never want to see or talk to David Rhodes again as long as I live. I mean that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to accept a penny from Ben Rhodes, either. He offered, you know. His son\u2019s a real problem to him. Ben didn\u2019t say that outright but I could tell. I thanked him\u2014it was a lovely, gracious thing to do\u2014but Noelle isn\u2019t his responsibility. She\u2019s David\u2019s. I don\u2019t expect him ever to do the right thing, though. Neither does Ben. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have offered.\u201d Another quick breath. \u201cI did let him set up a trust fund for Noelle, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Mack waited a moment before he attempted to speak. When her tirade was apparently over, he ventured a comment. \u201cIn my opinion, Noelle\u2019s better off without David in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you! Not that I have any worries there. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her\u2014or with me. Which is just as well. But one thing\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, in a slow, stately movement. \u201cI won\u2019t be so easily fooled again. Men aren\u2019t to be trusted, especially the good-looking, sweet-talking kind. Like David\u2014you could frost a cake with his words!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour brothers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started on them,\u201d she broke in. \u201cLinc\u2019s a stubborn know-it-all, and as for Mel and Ned, they\u2019re oblivious. A woman who got involved with one of my brothers would need her head examined.\u201d She paused long enough to breathe. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love my brothers. They\u2019ve been wonderful about Noelle, but they\u2019re clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d Mary Jo blurted out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that they\u2019re at the garage all day and aren\u2019t exposed to females in the workplace. Except for women who bring their cars in, of course. And they\u2019re always impressed.\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was impressed with Linc, too, when I met him.\u201d Mack felt he had to tell her this. He and Linc had talked for a good thirty minutes after the aid car had taken Mary Jo and Noelle to the hospital. At the time, Mack had been excited, and so had Linc. He was an uncle now and thrilled with the idea.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d side with my brothers,\u201d Mary Jo muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m finished with men. Done. Forever. You know what they say, once burned and all that. Well, I\u2019ve got third-degree burns and there is no way in this lifetime that I will ever trust a man again.\u201d</p> <p>Mack didn\u2019t like the sound of this. \u201cWhat exactly does that mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The look she shot him said it all. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, because you\u2019d feel obliged to defend the male gender and it would only end with us agreeing to disagree. You can\u2019t tell me anything Linc hasn\u2019t already said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms again, she sighed loudly. \u201cThat all men aren\u2019t like David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. My dad was a wonderful husband and father, and there are still a few decent men left in this world. Cliff Harding, for example.\u201d</p><p>He noticed he hadn\u2019t been mentioned but decided not to take it personally. \u201cIf you believe that,\u201d he said, \u201cthen why are you finished with men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, leaning forward, \u201cI know there are good guys. That\u2019s not the problem. The problem is being able to tell who\u2019s good and who\u2019s a jerk. Unfortunately, my jerk detector is clearly out of whack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Because you know something? David wasn\u2019t the first.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI mean...I never went as far...got as involved with a man the way I did with David. But before I met him, there was a guy at work who completely charmed me. Not until later did I discover he was married. We never really went out or anything\u2014I just had lunch with him or a drink after work. Nothing more than that. But I had no idea he was lying, too. Lying by omission, anyway.\u201d She glanced at Mack over her shoulder as she paced. \u201cOther women seem to have that filter, you know, the instinct that tunes them in to a man\u2019s motives. I don\u2019t, so I can\u2019t trust myself with men. Another relationship isn\u2019t worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>Setting down his coffee cup, Mack mulled over her words. \u201cSo I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I have my daughter, and from now on it\u2019ll be just the two of us. As soon as I find another job, I\u2019m going to get an apartment and move there and live on my own, free of my brothers and free of men entirely.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo looked over at him as if daring him to comment.</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be a good time to ask you out on a date, then, would it?\u201d</p><p>Her head reared back in surprise and she smiled. \u201cAre you sure you mean that?\u201d</p><p>Mack grinned up at her. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Grace Harding was working in her small office at the library when Sally Overland, a recent hire, knocked politely at her half-open door. Grace wondered how she\u2019d be able to concentrate on the endless stack of paperwork if she was constantly interrupted. The morning was already gone, and she\u2019d hardly made a dent.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called. None of her other assistants would\u2019ve waited for permission.</p><p>Sally stuck her head in the door. \u201cThere\u2019s someone by the name of Olivia who\u2019s here to see you. She said she\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>Grace leaped to her feet, nearly upending her chair. \u201cOlivia\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Sally, who was young and somewhat lacking in confidence, widened her eyes. \u201cYes. I hope I did the right thing. I told her you were busy, but she said you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Sally stepped aside and Olivia entered the office wearing her long black wool coat and a bright red knit cap.</p><p>Grace walked around her desk and gave her closest friend a careful hug. Olivia was pale, but then she had been for months. Pale and thin...and now bald.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Grace demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Olivia asked in the same tone of voice. \u201cI brought back a library book and wanted to see if you\u2019d had lunch yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you feel good enough to be out and about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise,\u201d Olivia stated with perfect logic. \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou choose,\u201d Grace said. She knew Olivia didn\u2019t have much of an appetite and whatever appealed to her was fine with Grace.</p><p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cAnyplace will do. What sounds good is a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPot Belly Deli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled, and Grace grabbed her coat, scarf and purse. Together they headed toward the main library door. Grace quickly told Sally where she\u2019d be.</p><p>Although the deli was less than three blocks away, Grace insisted on driving. She didn\u2019t want Olivia to risk catching a chill while her immune system was compromised because of the cancer treatments. Nor did she want her to get tired out from the walk.</p><p>Just before Christmas, Olivia had been hospitalized with a massive infection. A shiver of fear skittered down Grace\u2019s spine at the memory of how close they\u2019d come to losing her. No, she wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re treating me as if I\u2019m made of porcelain,\u201d Olivia complained, but not too strenuously, Grace noted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were bossy,\u201d Olivia said as she slid into the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Grace wasn\u2019t about to let her friend have the last word.</p><p>Thankfully, she found a parking spot directly in front of the deli. It was late enough that the noon crowd had left, so they had their pick of tables.</p><p>As soon as they were seated, Grace smiled at the young waitress. \u201cWhat\u2019s your soup for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCream of broccoli,\u201d the girl, who didn\u2019t look more than eighteen, told her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both have that,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cWith tea,\u201d Olivia added. \u201cEarl Grey, please.\u201d</p><p>The girl made a notation on the pad and disappeared. Once she was out of earshot, Olivia leaned forward. \u201cMom\u2019s got the best broccoli soup recipe. I think she had it here first and then went home and created her own version. My mother should have a cooking show, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t you picture it? Chef Charlotte making muffins and chatting up celebrity guests.\u201d She removed her scarf and unfastened her coat, then folded it over the back of her chair. \u201cShe\u2019d be terrific. And she can make anything taste wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded, smiling. \u201cShe believes in cooking with quality ingredients\u2014and love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen your mother in passing since the cruise. She had a good time?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe did. Ben, too, although they were hit with the news about David\u2019s baby the minute they got home, which upset them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Grace said, her voice grim. She blamed David, maybe not for the pregnancy, since both partners had played a role in that, but he\u2019d clearly lied to the poor girl about his intentions. And his behavior afterward had been appalling\u2014his refusal to acknowledge the baby or accept his responsibilities as a father.</p><p>\u201cI think this is the final straw as far as Ben is concerned,\u201d Olivia said, smoothing her napkin across her lap. \u201cApparently he\u2019s only spoken to David once since they got home from the cruise. He told Mom that if David phones again, he doesn\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand why Ben\u2019s so upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking this hard. Ben\u2019s such an honorable man that his son\u2019s behavior\u2014deceiving and deluding a sweet girl like Mary Jo\u2014makes it all the more painful.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop by to discuss David, though. The subject depresses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you what Mom\u2019s been doing lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than visiting you?\u201d Grace joked. It was common knowledge that Charlotte made a habit of checking up on Olivia every few days.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been collecting all her favorite recipes for Justine\u2019s tearoom. Which means she\u2019s writing some of them down for the very first time.\u201d</p> <p>Grace had driven past the construction site that morning and was astonished by the progress that had been made in the past month. \u201cThe building\u2019s really coming along, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my daughter wants something, she tends to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s another Charlotte in the making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and more,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cShe\u2019s starting a brand-new business, balancing that with looking after her family and getting ready for the baby....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, she says. She\u2019s just begun to show. I hope she has a girl this time.\u201d Olivia hesitated as if she\u2019d suddenly realized what she\u2019d said. \u201cOf course we\u2019d welcome another grandson with equal enthusiasm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are your girls?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen and Kelly are doing great.\u201d</p><p>The door opened at that moment and in walked Sheriff Troy Davis. He touched the brim of his hat when he saw them, a habitual gesture of his, then stepped up to the counter and ordered coffee to go.</p><p>As Grace was filling Olivia in on the latest news about her grandchildren, Troy came to their table, clutching his take-out mug.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you both,\u201d he said. He frowned at the wool cap Olivia wore, then quickly glanced away.</p><p>Grace could see that Olivia was trying to squelch a smile. \u201cHey, Sheriff, don\u2019t be so worried. I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. So, what are you two doing here at\u2014\u201d he looked pointedly at his watch \u201c\u2014the middle of the afternoon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on leave,\u201d Olivia said, although she knew he was well aware of that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a late lunch,\u201d Grace added.</p><p>He motioned toward the front window. \u201cIs that your vehicle in the disabled parking space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t see the sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. Did you give me a ticket?\u201d Usually she was more observant than this.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d advise you to move it before one of my deputies does.\u201d</p><p>Grace scooped up her purse, grateful for the warning. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Troy said. He seemed to be watching her as she left.</p><p>Grace saw that as soon as she was out the door, Troy slid into her seat. Not until she reached her vehicle did she realize the disabled space was one down from where she\u2019d parked. She was perfectly legal exactly where she was.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Troy to make that kind of mistake, and she started back toward the deli. Then it dawned on her that Troy had purposely sent her on a wild-goose chase because he wanted time alone with Olivia. Assuming that was the case, she\u2019d accommodate him.</p><p>Grace slid inside the car and circled the block twice, then located another slot close by. She figured that would give Troy ample opportunity to divulge whatever he had on his mind. Naturally she intended to drill Olivia the instant they were alone.</p><p>When she returned to the deli, their soup and tea had been served, together with a basket of sourdough bread. When Troy saw her, he stood and made his farewells.</p><p>The moment the door closed behind him, Grace said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t parked in a disabled space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy just wanted to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s spoon hovered over her soup. \u201cI know that, too. He asked me to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Grace waited for an explanation that didn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming. She couldn\u2019t understand why her friend was suddenly so tight-lipped. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me why he found it necessary to speak to you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d Olivia answered with an exaggerated sigh.</p><p>\u201cOlivia! Don\u2019t hold out on me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Olivia said, doing her best to hide a smile. \u201cHe wanted some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Grace narrowed her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you and Troy were such bosom buddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t. He just knows me better because of my years on the bench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows me, too! Good grief, we all went through twelve years of school together. What could he possibly say to you that he couldn\u2019t say to me?\u201d She felt a bit hurt that Troy had sought out Olivia and not her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you must know,\u201d Olivia said, \u201che wanted to ask me about Faith Beckwith.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cFaith\u2019s our tenant, remember? If he needed to find anything out, he could\u2019ve asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he told me the two of them had a thing going, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not news! Although they don\u2019t seem to be dating now. I wonder what happened....\u201d She let the rest fade, hoping Olivia would fill in the blanks.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately Troy didn\u2019t have time to go into detail,\u201d Olivia said. She looked at Grace with mock disdain. \u201cIt might have taken you a bit longer to find a parking spot, you know.\u201d</p><p>Grace had no intention of responding. She wanted facts\u2014now. \u201cOkay, so they had a \u2018thing\u2019 going and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really say other than that he broke it off, regretted it and, when he wanted to get back together, Faith wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but we both know Troy isn\u2019t fickle. Faith should give him a bit of leeway, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Grace considered that. \u201cDepends.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to get caught up in a debate about the right or wrong of his decision, not when there was obviously more to the story. \u201cSo what else?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he didn\u2019t have time to give me any details.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, which Grace ignored.</p><p>\u201cAnd now Troy\u2019s upset because he loves Faith and wants her back.\u201d How like a man!</p><p>Olivia took Troy\u2019s side. \u201cShe broke his heart.\u201d</p><p>Grace pretended to be sympathetic, but in her opinion he got what he deserved. \u201cPoor Troy,\u201d she said in a perfunctory tone.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly what he wanted to talk me about, though.\u201d</p><p>Oh! This was getting interesting. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want advice about Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sort of. Something else happened that\u2019s got him in a real state.\u201d</p><p>When Olivia didn\u2019t immediately continue, Grace snapped, \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t stop there! What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, on his way home, Troy saw Faith having dinner with another man.\u201d</p><p>Grace picked up her spoon, then put it down again. This was far more intriguing than cream of broccoli soup. \u201cWhat do you mean, he saw her with someone else? What did he do, drive his patrol car through a restaurant door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He was hungry and felt like some Chinese food, so he ordered takeout from Wok \u2019n\u2019 Roll. He walked inside to pick up his order\u2014and who should he see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Grace answered.</p><p>\u201cYes, Faith, and she was with...a man. She had her back to him but Troy knew it was her and she seemed to be having the time of her life.\u201d</p><p>Grace had another question. \u201cSo, who was he?\u201d she asked, lowering her voice. \u201cThis man she was with.\u201d</p><p>Olivia acted as if Grace hadn\u2019t even spoken. \u201cPoor Troy was devastated. He said it was all he could do not to march up to the table and tell...this other man to stay away from Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a smart idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did he do?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing much. He paid for his dinner, left and then seethed for the rest of the night. Judging by his expression, I\u2019d say it\u2019s still bothering him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Faith see him?\u201d Grace wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks she might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, they probably both feel bad. Because Faith would know he was upset, and she isn\u2019t the kind of woman who enjoys hurting someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell me who Faith\u2019s hot date was.\u201d</p><p>Olivia paused, and Grace\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHe\u2019s married, isn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. In fact, once I say his name it won\u2019t surprise you at all.\u201d</p><p>So Olivia was going to make her guess. That wasn\u2019t fair\u2014and then it came to her. Shocked, she pressed both hands against the table and half stood. \u201cNo way?\u201d</p><p>Olivia knew immediately that Grace had figured it out. Slowly, with her eyes closed, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour brother, Will Jefferson, is dating Faith?\u201d</p><p>Olivia exhaled sharply. \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...he\u2019s divorced and she\u2019s a widow. So I guess there\u2019s nothing really wrong with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the last I heard,\u201d Olivia said, \u201che was interested in Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>Grace tore a piece of bread. \u201cI know Will\u2019s your brother and you love him, but I also know a basic fact about him. He\u2019s not a one-woman man.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t deny it, at least going by previous experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to say anything to Faith?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Olivia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>This was so embarrassing. Unfortunately, Christie didn\u2019t have any alternative. She needed a vehicle; otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get to work except by walking or biking. A bicycle might be okay once spring arrived, and she could probably buy one secondhand, but that didn\u2019t help her now. So far, winter had set all kinds of records for cold and snowfall. Slogging through slush and fierce wind left much to be desired. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sad reality was that after many temporary fixes, her car was dead. There was no possibility of reviving it. The junkyard had offered her a flat hundred bucks and she took it. That hundred dollars, however, wasn\u2019t going to provide reliable transportation. Her only recourse was to ask for a loan\u2014and the only person she could approach was her sister, Teri.</p><p>With a knot in her stomach, Christie made the call. Teri answered so quickly, she must\u2019ve been sitting next to the phone.</p><p>\u201cCan you talk?\u201d she asked, trying to keep any hint of anxiety out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather do this face-to-face,\u201d Christie told her. She felt like weeping, which was an anomaly on its own. She didn\u2019t easily give in to emotion. Oh, she\u2019d cried her share of tears, but generally it took a crisis like having her bank account emptied by some low-life scum she\u2019d been convinced she could reform. She\u2019d wept buckets over that, and her divorce, too. What upset her this time was the fact that it wasn\u2019t a man but a stupid car.</p><p>\u201cCome on by,\u201d Teri said. \u201cI\u2019d love the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...the problem. I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Christie didn\u2019t want to go into all of that now. \u201cHas Bobby hired a new driver?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. Bobby\u2019s positive James will return. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t talk about James,\u201d she interrupted stiffly. Even his name was enough to make her stomach tense.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a taxi to the house and I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Although Christie appreciated the offer, she refused to do that. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChristie, don\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Buses run regularly this time of day.\u201d</p><p>Still Teri hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d come and get you myself but the doctor doesn\u2019t want me driving.\u201d</p><p>Christie wasn\u2019t surprised. Teri was due in May, although with triplets she\u2019d probably deliver early. \u201cWhen did he say you couldn\u2019t drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my last visit. Doc wants to play it safe. Okay, I know it\u2019s for a good reason, but I have to tell you I\u2019m going crazy sitting around the house. I could definitely use a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a taxi,\u201d Teri insisted again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Actually, Christie already had and she\u2019d dismissed the idea. She was coming to Teri for a loan as it was and she didn\u2019t want her sister having to open her wallet for cab fare before they\u2019d even begun the conversation. And no way was she spending fifteen hard-won dollars herself if she didn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>There was nothing wrong with the bus. She would normally have considered it for transportation to her job, but she worked the early shift at Wal-Mart and the bus schedule was extremely limited at that time of the morning.</p><p>The queasiness in her stomach hadn\u2019t lessened as she made the long trek down Teri and Bobby\u2019s driveway. Walking to the house, she automatically glanced at the garage and the apartment above it, where James had once lived. She chastised herself for looking.</p><p>James was out of her life, out of all their lives. Bobby might be deluding himself that his driver and best friend would return. Best friend, now that was a joke. Some friend James had been!</p><p>When she finally reached the door and rang the bell, her nose had lost feeling. Her winter jacket was little protection against the wind, which seemed to slice straight through her. She kept her hands clenched in her pockets for warmth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frozen!\u201d Teri shrieked when she saw her. \u201cI told you to take a cab.\u201d</p><p>Rather than start an argument, Christie conceded. \u201cYeah, I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in.\u201d Teri pulled her into the house and helped her off with her coat and gloves.</p><p>Mutely Christie followed her sister into the kitchen and gladly accepted a mug of hot herbal tea. The first sip burned all the way down her throat, but Christie didn\u2019t care. The taste and aroma of the tea revived her.</p><p>Slipping onto a stool at the breakfast bar, she braced her elbows there, clutching the mug with both hands, as she considered the best approach to asking her sister for the loan. This was even more difficult than she\u2019d expected. It made her feel like such a failure when she was working so hard to get her life on track. Her credit had been ruined by yet another deadbeat she\u2019d thought she could transform. There\u2019d been a transformation, all right\u2014a negative one. The guy had become an even bigger jerk, and he\u2019d ripped her off, to boot. Why was it lessons like this had to be so painful, with consequences that lingered for years?</p><p>Teri seemed to be waiting for her to say something.</p><p>\u201cI took your advice,\u201d she said conversationally.</p><p>Teri set her mug on the counter and clambered onto the stool directly across from her. \u201cWhat advice was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when you said I should make some positive changes in my life? You were right. I\u2019ve signed up for two courses at the community college in Bremerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Teri seemed impressed.</p><p>Actually, Christie was impressed with herself. \u201cI never figured I\u2019d be hanging around a college campus at my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not old.\u201d</p><p>Christie laughed. \u201cI am compared to most of those kids.\u201d Shaking her head, she sighed. \u201cWere we ever that young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were born old,\u201d Teri said with a sad look. \u201cThe education we got wasn\u2019t in history or literature, it was in the ways of the world.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Having grown up with an alcoholic mother and a series of stepdads and \u201cuncles,\u201d Christie knew they\u2019d both been robbed of a normal childhood.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me\u2014\u201d Teri changed the subject \u201c\u2014what are you taking?\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s heart raced with excitement as she said the word. \u201cPhotography.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhy photography? I didn\u2019t know you had any interest in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t until recently.\u201d She might as well let it all out. \u201cI went in to the agent to pay my car insurance premium\u2014while I still had a car\u2014and he was on the phone.\u201d It\u2019d been one of those rare instances, Christie realized later, when an opportunity had presented itself at precisely the right moment. \u201cHe was bemoaning the fact that there isn\u2019t anyone locally to document household inventory for home insurance purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when he got off the phone, I asked him what would be involved in learning to do this, and he told me. On his advice, I registered for Basic Photography and Elementary Business. He said if I was willing to follow through, he had two assignments coming up that he could give me. Plus, he\u2019d pass the word along to other agents in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>Christie shrugged. \u201cI started the class last week and there\u2019s a lot more to taking a picture than you\u2019d think. This isn\u2019t just point and shoot. I have to learn about lighting and lenses and all kinds of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s confidence in her was reassuring. Christie sipped her tea again, then decided she couldn\u2019t delay this any longer. With a deep breath, she looked up at her sister.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t answer; instead, she reached for her own tea. Her dark hair was pulled away from her face and secured at the nape of her neck and she wore no makeup at all. Under ordinary circumstances she wouldn\u2019t consider herself dressed without styling her hair and applying lip gloss. That was the bare minimum.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to play guessing games?\u201d her sister asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Christie straightened and met her eyes. \u201cI need a loan.\u201d</p><p>There, it was out, although the words had nearly stuck in her throat.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need reliable transportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a new car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, no. A used car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill five thousand be enough?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>Christie nearly swallowed her tongue. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I meant five thousand would be far too much.\u201d Christie fully intended to pay back every penny, with interest. If her credit rating hadn\u2019t been ruined, she would\u2019ve applied for a bank loan. But that was out of the question now. Reestablishing her credit was taking far longer than she\u2019d thought it would.</p><p>\u201cThree thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of one thousand,\u201d Christie said. She should be able to repay that amount within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough! You\u2019d only be getting yourself another junker. We\u2019ll begin with five thousand,\u201d Teri insisted.</p><p>\u201cTeri...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Undecided, Christie bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to talk this over with Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Teri sipped her tea. \u201cI already did. He only had one stipulation.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Christie should\u2019ve been surprised that her sister had known the purpose of her visit, but she wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you let someone help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding the right car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to admit how inadequate she felt when it came to purchasing a vehicle. Generally she looked at the interior. The cleanliness and appearance of the car indicated how well the previous owner had cared for the engine\u2014at least, that was her theory. Perhaps not a very accurate basis for judgment, but Christie knew next to nothing about anything mechanical.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby has a friend who\u2019d be willing to do the research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guy in the business. Let Bobby handle it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Christie had no objection to that; in fact, she was grateful. \u201cFine by me. If this guy doesn\u2019t mind, have him pick it out and buy it. I don\u2019t need to be there,\u201d she told her sister. Besides, between her job at Wal-Mart and her photography and business classes, she didn\u2019t have spare time to be running around checking out used cars.</p><p>Then, because she was afraid she hadn\u2019t adequately expressed her gratitude, Christie added, \u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d Teri said. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I have a sister.\u201d For far too long they\u2019d done their best to ignore each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign loan documents.\u201d Christie had a stipulation of her own. She wasn\u2019t a charity case and wanted Teri to understand she wouldn\u2019t accept this money as a gift. This was a loan and an opportunity to prove herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay that money back, plus interest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Teri sounded as if repayment was of little concern to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than what I want, Teri,\u201d Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Teri smiled down at her tea.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Christie asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy little sister\u2019s finally grown up.\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easy to take offense at that comment, with its implication that Christie was\u2014or had been\u2014immature. However, her sister\u2019s willingness to fork over the money precluded that. And, in all honesty, Christie couldn\u2019t completely disagree.</p><p>Bobby walked into the room just then. His eyes went instantly to his wife. He didn\u2019t seem to notice that Christie was there, too.</p><p>\u201cHello, Bobby,\u201d she said, loudly enough to catch his attention.</p><p>He inclined his head slightly in acknowledgment. \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d he asked, directing the question to Teri.</p> <p>Bobby Polgar was a man of few words, but Christie could never doubt that he loved her sister. From a very young age Bobby\u2019s world had revolved around chess; it had been his whole life until he met Teri. According to her, the defining moment in their relationship had come the day Bobby confessed that his whole existence was about thinking. Chess required strategy, deliberation and the ability to forecast consequences, and he\u2019d transferred those cerebral skills into every aspect of his life. But Teri made him feel.</p><p>Christie realized that James had just the opposite effect on her. For most of her adult life, her decisions had been driven by emotion. But he\u2019d made her think. He\u2019d made her reconsider the way she was living\u2014from one day to the next with no greater ambition than getting to the end of the week and going to the Poodle for a beer. Because of him she had goals and purpose. His defection had made her even more determined. James had hurt her, and hurt her terribly, but this time, for the first time, she was using the pain inflicted by a man to learn and to grow.</p><p>Christie dismissed the thought. James was no longer part of her life.</p><p>Teri caught her eye. \u201cHe phoned.\u201d</p><p>Playing dumb was her only option. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d Bobby said excitedly.</p> <p>Christie stopped herself from asking where James was living now and how he was doing. No doubt he\u2019d escaped to someplace far from Washington. It didn\u2019t matter. Nothing that happened to James Wilbur or Gardner, or whatever he called himself now, concerned her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was all she was capable of saying.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what he said?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Teri huffed out a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019re dying to hear the details, but you\u2019re too stubborn to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head more adamantly, Christie denied that. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sorry,\u201d Bobby said. He stood behind Teri, his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>No man would ever look at her the way Bobby Polgar regarded her sister, Christie realized. She wasn\u2019t jealous; she ached to be in a relationship as caring and real as the one Teri had with her husband. Well, get over it, she mused. Because it\u2019s not going to happen. Nor would the children she\u2019d always dreamed of having...</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s sorry?\u201d she asked, continuing the pretense.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d Teri rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty transparent, little sister, so drop the act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an act.\u201d Christie slid off the stool. \u201cAnyway, I should get home.\u201d She had a long walk to the bus stop and didn\u2019t want to waste time on idle conversation with her sister. Especially if James Wilbur was going to be the topic.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Teri said in that superior way of hers. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d She made her skepticism abundantly clear.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hungered for information about James but refused to ask, refused to let Teri or Bobby say one word about him. She wasn\u2019t giving James an opportunity to creep back into her thoughts or her life.</p><p>Teri insisted on calling a taxi and tucking a twenty into Christie\u2019s pocket. Although she made a fuss, Christie was thankful. Before she left the house, she hugged both Teri and Bobby, and Teri promised to call as soon as she heard about the car.</p><p>True to her word, Teri phoned less than twenty-four hours later. Bobby\u2019s friend had located an older vehicle in relatively good condition for under five thousand dollars. The gas mileage was low; it even had a CD player and automatic locks.</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Christie said, so happy she could barely hold still. \u201cWhat color is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d Teri repeated. \u201cWhite.\u201d</p><p>Christie couldn\u2019t squelch her disappointment. \u201cI was hoping for blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have it repainted later if it bothers you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m just being silly. I\u2019m so grateful to have a car.\u201d And if it was as reliable as her sister seemed to think and had such nice extras, she wasn\u2019t about to complain.</p><p>\u201cShall I have it delivered to your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThank you, Teri,\u201d she said, \u201cthank you, thank you. I promise I\u2019ll pay you back\u2014with interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019ll get there soon.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the knock on her door told her that her new car had arrived.</p><p>When she saw James Wilbur standing on the other side of the torn screen, she followed her instinctive reaction, and that was to slam the door. A torrent of emotion overwhelmed her as she leaned against the wall. Her knees gave out, and she started to slide downward.</p><p>There was another knock, this one louder and more insistent. She had to answer, Christie thought reluctantly. Any kind of reaction would encourage him and that wasn\u2019t Christie\u2019s intention.</p><p>Collecting herself, she straightened and opened the door again. She had to admit James looked good, although she made every effort to stare right past him.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cThe door, uh, got away from me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her explanation as though it amused him. Well, fine, he could be as amused as he liked. But not at her expense.</p><p>She was furious with Teri and Bobby. They\u2019d tried to pull a fast one on her\u2014and they\u2019d succeeded. Christie supposed she should have figured it out. Teri\u2019s vague talk of a friend \u201cin the business,\u201d the sudden mention of a phone call from James...Why hadn\u2019t she asked more questions? Teri would be hearing a few angry words about this.</p><p>No, she decided. She\u2019d put her anger aside and overlook their trick in gratitude for all their help\u2014although she wouldn\u2019t forgive them a second time.</p><p>\u201cI brought your car,\u201d he said and held up the keys.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, keeping her voice emotionless. Indifferent. But her awareness of him had never been sharper than it was just then. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019d rather keel over dead than give James Wilbur any indication of her feelings.</p><p>\u201cCan I show it to you?\u201d James asked. His eyes burned into hers, sending silent messages\u2014that he needed to talk to her, be with her.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, but thank you for offering.\u201d She opened the screen door far enough to pluck the keys from his hand. Then, with a polite smile, she quietly closed the door.</p><p>To be on the safe side, she turned the dead bolt\u2014unsure whether this was an attempt to keep him out or her in.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Footsteps. Faith Beckwith heard them outside her bedroom window. Whoever was there made no effort at stealth. Someone was about to break into the house and didn\u2019t care if she knew.</p><p>Paralyzed with fear, Faith stopped breathing. The clock radio said 2:14. At first she\u2019d assumed the movements, which couldn\u2019t be more than a few feet from her window, were just her imagination. But now there was no question\u2014someone was there, crunching through the hardened snow in the backyard. Whoever it was might even be looking inside. Although she was buried under blankets and the blinds were closed, Faith felt the trespasser\u2019s stare, felt his presence as clearly as if he was standing over her bed.</p><p>Her breath came again in gasps as her mind raced frantically. Rolling carefully onto her side, she reached for the bedside phone and drew it under the sheets with her. Then, hidden under the covers, she used the lighted dial to punch out 9\u20131-1. Whispering, she told the operator that someone was outside her bedroom window.</p><p>The operator assured her a deputy was on his way. Without thinking, Faith disconnected the line. Oh, dear, that was foolish. Then she understood what her heart had been telling her from the first\u2014it wasn\u2019t a 9\u20131-1 operator she wanted reassurance from, it was Troy Davis.</p><p>Troy had said she should call but she couldn\u2019t. Not in the middle of the night and, really, what could he do?</p><p>He\u2019d been on her mind ever since the evening he\u2019d come into the Wok \u2019n\u2019 Roll when she was dining there with Will Jefferson, a friend from her high-school days. He\u2019d been two years ahead of her and a real heartthrob.</p><p>Naturally, Troy pretended he hadn\u2019t seen her with Will. She\u2019d done exactly the same thing and acted as though he was invisible. If anything, she\u2019d gone out of her way to prove she could enjoy another man\u2019s company. It\u2019d seemed like a good idea at the time; now, in retrospect, she wasn\u2019t so sure. She couldn\u2019t resist letting him think she had an active social life.</p><p>Will Jefferson, while charming and as good-looking as ever, didn\u2019t interest Faith. For that matter, he wasn\u2019t interested in her, either. He happened to be eating alone when she came in, and Will had invited her to share his table. They\u2019d spent an hour catching up and exchanging news of mutual friends, laughing frequently at various reminiscences. They\u2019d had a friendly visit\u2014and that was it. Faith hadn\u2019t heard from Will since and didn\u2019t expect to, which suited her fine.</p><p>The footsteps outside her window seemed to be receding. Faith exhaled and then, acting purely on impulse, grabbed the phone again. She hesitated; she had plenty of time to change her mind, plenty of time to be ruled by reason rather than emotion.</p><p>Troy answered on the second ring. \u201cDavis here.\u201d He sounded awake. Alert.</p><p>\u201cTh-there\u2019s someone outside my bedroom window,\u201d she said, struggling to speak coherently.</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang up and call 9\u20131-1.\u201d Each word was spoken clearly and distinctly.</p><p>\u201cI already did. You suggested I phone you, too\u2014it was silly. I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.... Your deputy will be here any minute. I\u2019m sorry to bother you, Troy.\u201d She disconnected. With her fingers trembling violently, she felt more than a little embarrassed to have given in to her impulse. Her weakness.</p><p>Faith could hear a car pull up and hurried out of bed. She threw on a housecoat, then waited by the door until the sheriff\u2019s vehicle came into view. Turning on the porch light, she stepped onto the porch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2014at the back of the house, near the bedroom on the south side,\u201d she called out, pointing in that direction.</p><p>Wrapping the housecoat more securely about her, she returned to the house. As she waited, she paced the living room. When she heard a loud knock at her front door, she rushed to answer it\u2014and found Troy Davis standing there, looking grim and hard-faced.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He sounded angry, as he had every right to be. What an irrational, irresponsible thing she\u2019d done in calling him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m...shaken up,\u201d she told him, hoping that would be enough to explain why she\u2019d behaved so illogically.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he said and left her.</p><p>Faith lowered herself into her favorite rocker. She sat there for long moments, unmoving, not knowing what to think or why someone had targeted her.</p><p>That was obviously the case. She\u2019d done her best to ignore the fact, pretend this couldn\u2019t be happening. Now, whoever this person was, he\u2019d come back, bolder and even more aggressive. After the initial break-in, he\u2014or she\u2014had spray painted her garage. Now\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of someone outside your bedroom window,\u201d Troy said sternly as he came through the front door. \u201cDeputy Walker saw footprints in the snow.\u201d His tone was almost...accusatory.</p> <p>Faith looked up at him and blinked, bewildered.</p><p>Troy\u2019s nod was curt and professional as he prepared to leave.</p><p>But Faith sensed his hesitation.</p><p>\u201cDid you lock the dead bolts before you went to bed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She confirmed that she had. \u201cI also purchased a pair of old work boots from Goodwill and set them on the porch. I bought the largest size I could find\u2014fourteen. Then I added a huge dog dish and a bone, so it would look as if I have a dog.\u201d She figured that since she was pretending she had a dog, she might as well make him big. Her son and daughter had found her antics amusing. Troy apparently didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a real security system?\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>That she hadn\u2019t done. This was a rental house and she had a six-month lease. She hoped to buy a home within the next few months. It seemed a waste of time and money to invest in a security system when she didn\u2019t intend to live here much longer. And she didn\u2019t feel an alarm system was the landlord\u2019s responsibility.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen I recommend you do so.\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded.</p><p>Troy turned to leave again.</p><p>Frightened, she didn\u2019t want to be alone, but she didn\u2019t know how to stop him. \u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>Troy\u2019s back was to her. He held himself stiff, and then she saw his shoulders deflate as he faced her. He didn\u2019t seem to have an answer.</p><p>\u201cIt was wrong of me to call you. I apologize, I really do.\u201d She didn\u2019t remind him that he\u2019d been the one to make that suggestion. It had stayed there, in her mind, like a thorn caught on a piece of fabric. In her weakened state she\u2019d done what she\u2019d wanted to all along and now regretted it.</p> <p>Still Troy didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t move or give even a hint that he\u2019d heard her.</p><p>\u201cI realize I shouldn\u2019t have....\u201d</p><p>He accepted her answer with a curt nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it plain you don\u2019t want me in your life.\u201d</p><p>Heat rose in her cheeks, embarrassing her even more. \u201cYes, I know. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why, when you felt you were in danger, did you reach out to me?\u201d</p><p>He was obviously determined to make this difficult. She told him the truth, since she couldn\u2019t come up with any other explanation. \u201cI feel safe with you.\u201d</p><p>He glared across the room at her.</p><p>It felt awkward to be sitting while he loomed over her, even if he was on the other side of the room. Faith stood abruptly. She hated to let him see how upset she was by this latest disturbance.</p><p>\u201cI need some coffee,\u201d she said, knowing there was no point in going back to bed now. \u201cWould you like some, Troy?\u201d she asked, refusing to allow his anger to affect her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound as if he meant that, so she proceeded into the kitchen, immeasurably pleased when he came, too, a few paces behind her.</p><p>\u201cI have the names of a couple of companies who install security systems,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Megan pass them on to you.\u201d</p><p>Faith continued to prepare the coffee. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that. Thank you, Troy.\u201d</p><p>He seemed on the verge of leaving again. She resisted the urge to stop him, although she didn\u2019t want to be alone. No, it was more than that. She wanted Troy with her. She needed him.</p><p>\u201cI saw the TV report about the cave and the skeleton on that Seattle station,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cI hear everyone in the area\u2019s talking about it. I hope all this media attention hasn\u2019t caused your office any problems.\u201d The reporter had started all kinds of speculation, and as a result Kitsap County seemed to be alive with rumors, some of them pretty ridiculous.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t answer, but he didn\u2019t walk away, either.</p><p>She glanced over at him, waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cMayor Benson isn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d he finally said. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt puts a lot of pressure on you and your staff, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d She brought a mug to the kitchen table and set it down while the coffee filtered into the pot. \u201cIs that the reason you\u2019re so cranky?\u201d</p><p>Again he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cOr does it have to do with Will Jefferson?\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s jaw tightened, but he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cYou did see us, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she said.</p><p>Once more he declined to respond, but she went on as if he had.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>Troy remained stoic. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the two of you were seeing each other,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, we aren\u2019t.\u201d She went on to explain that she\u2019d run into Will at the restaurant. If her explanation satisfied him, he didn\u2019t say. He seemed determined to keep her out of his life. Well, that was what she\u2019d wanted, wasn\u2019t it? What she\u2019d asked for.</p><p>The coffee gurgled behind her, and the slow dripping sound came to an end.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business who you have dinner with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I felt you should know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as though acknowledging the information. That was encouraging.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t talk you into having coffee with me? It\u2019s almost four, and there probably isn\u2019t enough time to go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He hovered uncertainly in the kitchen doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that such a difficult decision?\u201d Faith asked, half joking.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to hide her disappointment. \u201cI understand.\u201d Thankful for an excuse to turn away, she filled her mug and added cream. When she turned back, she discovered that Troy had taken a few steps into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBefore I do, I want you to tell me again what happened tonight. Start with the fact that someone was at your bedroom window.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her coffee, letting the warmth seep through her. \u201cYes. I heard the footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard noise out by the garage on another occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was that spray-painting incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas there been anything since?\u201d he asked. \u201cBefore tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should be aware,\u201d he said in a brusque voice.</p><p>Faith exhaled slowly, unaccustomed to dealing with Troy when he was angry. This was a side of him she wasn\u2019t familiar with. Troy Davis had never revealed a temper in her presence, not in the past and not recently. Until tonight.</p><p>His mouth tightened.</p><p>\u201cI...I probably should keep closer tabs on the garage and the house, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel foolish.\u201d</p><p>Troy ignored the comment. \u201cHave the interior security system installed, and ask Grace and Cliff to place a motion light above the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that at the first opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put it off,\u201d Troy warned.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Troy,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>For a long moment he didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI appreciate knowing you\u2019re not involved with Will Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Troy looked down at the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s not a good match for you, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who do you think is a good match for me?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>This time Troy Davis didn\u2019t hesitate. His eyes met hers. \u201cWe both know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Faith. It\u2019s always been me.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Will Jefferson glanced at his watch. It was Saturday night, and he\u2019d made reservations at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove. The restaurant was one of the nicest in town and he intended to impress Shirley Bliss.</p><p>They\u2019d seen each other twice now. Once for coffee at Mocha Mama\u2019s, when she\u2019d brought her daughter. The meeting hadn\u2019t gone badly. With Tanni there, Shirley had been relaxed and easygoing. Shaw and Tanni had bantered back and forth, and they\u2019d all laughed. He\u2019d enjoyed it, somewhat to his surprise, and he could tell that Shirley had, too.</p><p>Their second date wasn\u2019t technically a date, either. They\u2019d met by accident late one Sunday afternoon outside the mall. Will had been at loose ends and apparently she had, too. He\u2019d invited her to the movies. The day was dreary and cold, and it\u2019d been an offhand suggestion. He\u2019d been delighted\u2014and astonished\u2014when she agreed.</p><p>He ate popcorn. She didn\u2019t. As the credits started to roll he offered to take her to dinner. He was eager to discuss the movie, which was a complicated drama about the meaning of identity, real and fake. However, as soon as they left the theater, Shirley seemed to find it essential to get home. He let her go but spent the next few days wondering how to proceed with her. It might have worked out better if Tanni had been with her that night, too. One thing was apparent\u2014at least to him. Shirley was frightened to death of falling in love again. Will hoped he\u2019d be the man to allay her fears.</p><p>If he wanted a relationship with Shirley, he\u2019d need to be patient, gentle, persistent. Her nervousness around him had puzzled him at first\u2014but it meant she was aware of him. That gratified Will because he was certainly aware of her. She might be just the woman to tame his restless spirit....</p><p>After their movie date, Will had bided his time. Seven restless days later, he\u2019d risked phoning her. He had a good excuse\u2014another of her pieces had sold.</p><p>Again he offered to deliver the check, and again she\u2019d refused. But she\u2019d come to the gallery the next day. She seemed distracted and a bit troubled, and he suggested it might help to talk about her problems. He\u2019d felt her hesitation, but in the end she\u2019d agreed to meet him at D.D.\u2019s for dinner on Saturday night. Will had been walking on air ever since. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waitress brought him a glass of his favorite New Zealand sauvignon blanc. He thanked her with a smile. She was pretty enough. Young, too; no more than thirty-five, with nice legs.</p><p>He savored the wine while he waited. He\u2019d arrived early and was already on his second glass when Shirley entered the restaurant. Standing, he greeted her. Always a gentleman, he helped remove her coat, then lightly brushed his lips against her cheek.</p><p>He recognized his mistake immediately. He\u2019d moved too quickly for her, presumed too much. He needed to remember that.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Shirley said, a little breathless, as she slid into the booth opposite him.</p> <p>Caught up in his thoughts, Will had lost track of the time. A quick check showed that she\u2019d kept him waiting twelve minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Tanni and I had an argument,\u201d Shirley said, fumbling with her linen napkin as she placed it on her lap. Her face was flushed and he wondered if it was due to the dissension with her daughter or the cold.</p><p>Never having had children, Will wasn\u2019t sure he should comment. \u201cThe teen years can be difficult,\u201d he ventured, although he had little or no experience with that age group.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seeing too much of Shaw,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>Will motioned to the waitress to take Shirley\u2019s drink order. He was pleased when she accepted his suggestion to try the New Zealand wine. \u201cBring us a bottle,\u201d he told the waitress.</p> <p>Shirley hurried to stop him. \u201cOh, no, that\u2019s far too much! I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t drink more than a glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my favorites. What you don\u2019t want, I\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>Shirley glanced at the parking lot.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I walked. It\u2019s only a few blocks from the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Walking...that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>The waitress returned with a bottle, which Will examined. \u201cMy ex-wife and I visited the Marlborough region of New Zealand a few years ago and discovered their exquisite wines.\u201d He hoped to put Shirley at ease and distract her from the difficulties she\u2019d experienced earlier with her daughter. As he recalled, Tanni was sixteen or seventeen. She\u2019d probably be out of the house soon, attending college in Seattle or elsewhere.</p> <p>Shirley took her first sip and he could see that she liked the wine. Settling back in the booth, he studied her.</p><p>\u201cTanni and I seem to be at odds more and more,\u201d she murmured, her eyes darting around the room.</p><p>Obviously this situation was weighing on her and she seemed incapable of setting it aside.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I should still meet you for dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve canceled if I\u2019d been able to get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully he must\u2019ve already left the gallery and she didn\u2019t have his cell number.</p><p>\u201cThis argument with Tanni is about Shaw, you said.\u201d If talking helped her, then he was willing to listen.</p><p>Shirley gripped the stem of her wineglass and stared into the distance. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly together. It\u2019s...dangerous. Tanni\u2019s at a vulnerable point in her life\u2014she was close to her father and she misses him desperately. She and Shaw are too serious, and now that they discovered those remains, it seems everyone wants to question them. I don\u2019t know how the press got hold of their names\u2014probably from other kids at school,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThe sheriff asked Shaw and Tanni not to say anything but Tanni\u2019s been tricked into talking to reporters more than once.\u201d</p><p>Will sent her a look of sympathy. He\u2019d heard about those skeletal remains; it\u2019d been in the news for weeks. Every time there was the tiniest bit of information, it was blown out of all proportion, and interest was revived. One of the Seattle television stations appeared to be leading the way.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d think, with economic problems, political scandals and natural disasters, there\u2019d be more important things for them to report on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why this story is so interesting to people\u2014it\u2019s a distraction. An escape. And it\u2019s local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so. And everyone loves a mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose reporters have made life for Shaw just as difficult,\u201d she went on, \u201ccatching him at Mocha Mama\u2019s, hounding him for more details. The poor kid doesn\u2019t know what to say or do. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>Will was finished with this topic\u2014he didn\u2019t have anything else to add\u2014but she seemed preoccupied and unsettled. The more she mentioned the incident, the more agitated she became. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s doing what he can, but for heaven\u2019s sake, those bones have been there for years and years!\u201d</p><p>Will nodded; that was true enough.</p><p>\u201cAll this negative attention has drawn Tanni and Shaw closer together. I think they both need breathing room. A break from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Will agreed. After a moment, he said, \u201cShaw\u2019s a talented artist. Especially of portraits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanni is, too,\u201d she was quick to remind him.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, although she doesn\u2019t want her work displayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it. Ever since we lost...my husband, Tanni insists her work is for her alone. I\u2019d hoped that once Shaw\u2019s portraits were displayed in the gallery, she\u2019d be willing to place a couple of her pieces there, too.\u201d</p><p>Will had also hoped for that. Not because he felt her work would sell easily. It wouldn\u2019t. Her paintings and drawings were dark, moody and didn\u2019t really appeal to him. But he believed in presenting a range of work. And if he were to display Tanni\u2019s art, he\u2019d have more of an opportunity to talk to Shirley. Maybe not the most commendable of motives, but he couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw Tanni before Christmas,\u201d he said, \u201cI talked to her about putting her art in the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Shirley\u2019s gaze shot to him.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s as good as Shaw, and she\u2019s more versatile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He supposed that eventually she\u2019d agree, but he hadn\u2019t pressured her. The girl seemed to champion her boyfriend, wanting to give him the edge. She\u2019d soon learn what a mistake that was, he thought cynically.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate what you\u2019ve already done for Shaw.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Again, his motives had been far from pure. Yes, Shaw was talented, but Will knew very well that he might not have taken the kid\u2019s work to Larry Knight if not for his connection to Shirley.</p><p>\u201cI might be able to help you,\u201d he said, reaching for his wine.</p><p>That immediately got Shirley\u2019s interest. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe friend I mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Larry Knight.\u201d</p><p>Shirley pressed her hand to her heart. \u201cThe Larry Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s from San Diego, but the two of us worked together on a charity function some time ago in Atlanta. We\u2019ve kept in touch through the years.\u201d Actually, Georgia, his ex, had done a lot of the work, heading up the volunteer committee. But she\u2019d never been comfortable in the limelight, unlike Will, who enjoyed being the center of attention. So she\u2019d asked him to handle the public functions.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say Larry Knight\u2014one of the best-known artists in the country\u2014is the one who looked at Shaw\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I might ask another favor of Larry,\u201d he said. Picking up his menu, he read through it, giving Shirley a chance to consider his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d Her voice was guarded.</p><p>Will glanced over the top of his menu. \u201cAs you know, Larry has a...certain amount of influence with art schools around the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...I imagine he would,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Will was determined not to offer; he wanted Shirley to ask, wanted her to understand that she was in his debt. He\u2019d had plenty of experience at cajoling and persuading women. Interesting how those skills, for lack of a better word, kicked in so automatically.</p><p>\u201cYou...said he was impressed with Shaw\u2019s work?\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cLarry had quite a bit to say about Shaw.\u201d Will set his menu aside. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll have the fried oysters. This says they\u2019re from the Shelton area.\u201d</p><p>She nodded absently.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDecided?\u201d Her eyes met his; a moment later, she appeared to realize he was referring to her dinner order. \u201cOh, sorry, I haven\u2019t looked.\u201d She scanned the list. \u201cTheir crab Louie\u2019s always been one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try something different.\u201d</p><p>Her brow creased in a frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe...cause,\u201d he said, dragging out the word, \u201cif you\u2019re anything like me, you tend to order the same dishes from the same restaurants. Before you know it, you\u2019re in a rut.\u201d</p><p>The lines on her forehead gradually relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s exactly what I do. I order chili rellenos when I\u2019m eating Mexican and the chicken hot-sauce noodles when I order Chinese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsistency is comforting,\u201d he said, \u201cbut every once in a while it\u2019s good to venture out, try something new. Take a risk.\u201d He hoped she understood that he was talking about more than food\u2014that he was referring to their relationship, too.</p><p>He guessed she\u2019d been with one man her entire adult life and the thought of being with another intimidated her. Will hoped his advice would expand her view of more than just meal choices.</p><p>Shirley picked up the menu again and studied it carefully.</p><p>\u201cI recommend the fried oysters,\u201d he told her. \u201cI had them for the first time a few weeks ago. See?\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI tried something new and I liked it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI already know I don\u2019t like oysters.\u201d</p><p>Not easily discouraged, Will asked, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you ate them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cI could order the seafood sampler\u2014it includes oysters and shrimp and cod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all that fried food...\u201d She frowned.</p><p>Will listened to her go through practically the entire menu, discussing each selection in detail and dismissing one after the other. The waitress returned three times before Shirley was finally ready to order.</p><p>She looked at Will and grinned sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019ll have the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOysters,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cThe lady will try the oysters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I won\u2019t,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cI\u2019d like the crab Louie.\u201d She threw Will an apologetic glance. \u201cI\u2019d rather stick to something familiar.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if there was a message to him in these words\u2014a response to his message. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one of my oysters and you can try it.\u201d That seemed a fair compromise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The waitress left and Shirley had a little more of her wine. \u201cYou were telling me about Larry Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d He rested his back against the polished wood bench and lifted his glass. \u201cLike I was saying, Larry has a lot of sway with art schools around the country.\u201d</p><p>Shirley soaked in every word. \u201cDo you think he might open doors for Shaw? I mean, I don\u2019t know what Shaw\u2019s financial situation is. I seem to remember Tanni telling me his father disapproves of Shaw\u2019s dream of being an artist. He\u2019s an attorney and wants Shaw to attend law school. He\u2019d probably need a scholarship.\u201d</p> <p>That was understood; one look at Shaw was enough to convince Will that the kid didn\u2019t have a dime to his name. \u201cI figured he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to do that for Shaw? To ask Larry?\u201d</p><p>But Will knew she also welcomed the prospect of Shaw\u2019s departure, for her daughter\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you believe Shaw\u2019s talent is sufficient,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d she said earnestly.</p> <p>Will set his glass on the table, holding on to the stem, gently swirling the wine. \u201cI\u2019m sure Larry gets these sorts of requests all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does. I didn\u2019t mean to imply that he should recommend Shaw unless his talent warrants such an advantage.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve already had him look at Shaw\u2019s work, so Larry\u2019s familiar with what the boy can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll ask?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll call Larry on Monday morning, then let you know what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>Shirley\u2019s face lit up with a huge smile. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t resist the thought that maybe, when the time came, she could show him. No, that was the old Will talking, he reminded himself. The new Will wanted something more genuine with this woman. Something lasting.</p><p>Their meal was splendid and, true to her word, Shirley sampled one of his oysters.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked, confident that she\u2019d order them the next time they dined at D.D.\u2019s. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>She smiled across the table at him. \u201cIt was better than I remembered. But then, it\u2019s hard to find fault with anything deep-fried.\u201d With a wry grimace, she added, \u201cThat\u2019s why I usually stay away from that kind of food.\u201d</p><p>Will chuckled. \u201cMe, too. But I allow myself extravagances on special occasions.\u201d He wanted her to understand that being with her was one of those occasions.</p><p>\u201cAll in all, though...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he said, eager to hear her verdict.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with the crab Louie.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cCut off a little more on the sides,\u201d thirteen-year-old Jolene instructed Rachel, examining her reflection in the bathroom mirror.</p><p>Rachel had set her up in the small hallway bathroom for a haircut. Some of their best conversations came while she was busy with Jolene\u2019s hair.</p><p>Over the years, Rachel had developed a theory about why that was the case. When she was working on a customer\u2019s hair, Rachel was in that person\u2019s space\u2014by invitation. This proximity created a sense of intimacy that made clients feel comfortable enough to share some of the most private details of their lives. She figured that was also why so much gossip got started\u2014or at least spread\u2014at hair salons.</p><p>\u201cIt looks really cute,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Jolene turned her head from side to side. \u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked, her voice uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Rachel plugged in the electric razor. \u201cLean forward and tuck your chin down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Dad will like my hair this short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Rachel assured her, although she wasn\u2019t sure. Jolene bowed her head, and Rachel clipped the hair at the base of the girl\u2019s neck.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, Jolene raised her head and their eyes met in the bathroom mirror. Slowly Jolene exhaled. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you and my dad anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It\u2019d been an uncomfortable week or so after Jolene had caught the two of them in bed in the middle of the afternoon. Rachel could laugh about it now.</p><p>Not Bruce.</p><p>He\u2019d been in such a state\u2014of embarrassment, frustration and anger\u2014that it\u2019d taken him days to put the incident behind him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jolene had given them both the silent treatment for nearly a week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my stepmother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I am, too.\u201d Rachel held the girl\u2019s gaze in the mirror. \u201cI like being your stepmother.\u201d</p><p>Jolene pointedly broke eye contact. \u201cIf I tell you something, do you promise not to be mad?\u201d</p><p>Rachel wasn\u2019t about to make that kind of promise. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to be. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d With an exaggerated sigh, the girl repeated, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my stepmother,\u201d then added, \u201cbut I really wish you and my dad weren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>The words stung and Rachel couldn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cI love you and your father very much, Jolene. It\u2019s important for me to be part of your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Dad needs you...and I do, too. I feel selfish and mean for...for complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should talk about it.\u201d Rachel needed to put aside her own emotions and listen carefully to what Jolene was saying. \u201cTell me why you feel this way.\u201d</p><p>Rachel sat on the edge of the bathtub, hands braced on either side, ankles crossed, hoping that if she looked relaxed, she\u2019d encourage Jolene to confide in her.</p><p>\u201cBut...I don\u2019t want you to get mad at me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head and reached out to give the girl\u2019s shoulder a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Jolene kept her head lowered. \u201cBefore you and Dad got married, I was afraid that if...if you moved into the house, Dad wouldn\u2019t have time for me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>That was good, because Rachel knew Bruce had put a lot of effort into spending extra time with his daughter. He did more than drop her off at basketball practice these days. Twice now he\u2019d stayed and watched, just so Jolene would know he was interested. Naturally, when the actual games started, Bruce and Rachel would attend them together.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not exactly?\u201d she asked, unwilling to leave the smallest detail unexplored.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just Dad,\u201d Jolene whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always my...special friend. I could talk to you about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d At least, not to Rachel it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, it has,\u201d Jolene insisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cTell me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d The girl seemed at a loss. Then she blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see how my dad looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith love?\u201d she asked, hoping that was the answer.</p><p>Jolene shook her head. \u201cHe wants to get you into bed so you can do...that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love,\u201d she elaborated. This was what she\u2019d expected...and feared. It was probably best to have the conversation, bring it out in the open once and for all. \u201cMarried couples make love, Jolene. It\u2019s a normal and healthy part of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad wants to do it all the time.\u201d Jolene sounded mortified. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think I notice, but I do. And that\u2019s not all. You\u2019re my friend and now I have to share you with my dad and I don\u2019t want to and...and I have to share my dad with you.\u201d This came out on one long breath. Jolene\u2019s eyes met hers in the mirror again. \u201cAm I making any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Rachel told her. \u201cYou\u2019re making a lot of sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are...different. Just like I was afraid they\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Rachel couldn\u2019t argue with her. But perhaps she could explain it to Jolene in a way she\u2019d find more reassuring. \u201cThat happens when a couple\u2019s first married,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019ll stop?\u201d the girl asked hopefully.</p><p>Rachel did her best to hide a smile. \u201cNot...completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that answer your questions?\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at her fearfully. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d she asked, as if this would be truly dreadful, the most dreadful thing she could imagine.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Rachel felt it was critical to address Jolene\u2019s concerns about her marriage to Bruce before they even thought about adding to the family.</p><p>\u201cI know you were afraid that once your father and I were married, we\u2019d be so involved with each other you\u2019d feel excluded.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s gaze held hers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried very hard to make sure that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>Jolene shrugged, raising one shoulder. \u201cYeah, but I wish...you know.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Rachel did. This was becoming more than a minor problem, not only for Jolene but for her and Bruce, too. Being discovered that one afternoon had had a devastating effect on their love life. They\u2019d barely touched since.</p><p>If, as Jolene claimed, Bruce looked at her longingly, there was a very good reason. They were both experiencing sexual frustration.</p><p>That evening Rachel had dinner ready by the time Bruce walked into the house. \u201cHow are my girls?\u201d he asked, pausing to kiss Rachel on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She waltzed into the living room and twirled around so her father could see her new haircut. \u201cRachel said you wouldn\u2019t mind if I got it cut real short. You like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Rachel cast him a pleading glance.</p><p>\u201cIt takes some getting used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like it?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and managed to nod enthusiastically.</p><p>Overjoyed, Jolene rushed to his side and threw her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cWould you set the table, please?\u201d Rachel asked her. She followed Bruce down the hallway and into the bedroom. He usually showered as soon as he got home from work.</p><p>The moment their door closed, Bruce pulled her into his arms and kissed her hungrily.</p><p>Rachel eased her mouth from his. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, later, after Jolene\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have other plans for then.\u201d</p><p>Rachel dropped eager kisses along his neck. \u201cI do, too, but we need to talk first.\u201d</p><p>When he started to protest, she kissed him again. \u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while,\u201d she said seductively.</p><p>Sliding his hands up and down her arms, Bruce\u2019s eyes melted into hers. \u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d</p><p>Quietly she slid out the door and hurried back to the kitchen.</p><p>Jolene frowned at her and set the water glasses on the table with a lot of unnecessary noise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rachel was willing to be patient and understanding, but she couldn\u2019t allow a thirteen-year-old to dictate the terms of her marriage.</p><p>\u201cI love your father, Jolene,\u201d she said, looking directly into the girl\u2019s eyes, \u201cand if I want to talk to him alone for a few minutes that shouldn\u2019t upset you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded contritely. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p> <p>The evening passed, with everyone involved in various tasks\u2014laundry, homework, bill paying\u2014and other than Bruce making exaggerated yawning noises and darting glances at the master bedroom, everything went smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it your bedtime?\u201d he asked Jolene when the clock chimed nine-thirty. He and Rachel were watching TV by then.</p><p>She closed her textbook and kissed them both on the cheek. \u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to watch the news,\u201d Rachel announced. She wanted Jolene to understand that they weren\u2019t going to jump into bed the minute she was out of sight.</p><p>\u201cI guess I will, too,\u201d Bruce muttered.</p> <p>Jolene walked past Rachel and rolled her eyes. The kid wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>When their daughter\u2019s bedroom door shut, Bruce shifted closer to Rachel. \u201cOkay, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had been waiting for this moment all evening. \u201cJolene and I had a good discussion today while I cut her hair. She talked about you and me and her place in this family.\u201d Rachel wouldn\u2019t tell him everything Jolene had shared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bruce grimaced, unwilling to listen. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting sick of this. I\u2019ve done my best to be sensitive to Jolene\u2019s feelings. I\u2019ve spent more time with her in the past two months than at any\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe frustration is killing me, Rachel. I want to make love to my wife. I\u2019m sick and tired of tiptoeing around my daughter and her insecurities. The longer we kowtow to her, the more complicated and difficult this becomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Bruce\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again he cut her off. \u201cWhat we need is time away, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she countered swiftly. She couldn\u2019t disagree more. \u201cThat\u2019ll make every insecurity Jolene already has that much worse. She\u2019s feeling excluded as it is. Sharing me, sharing you...If we abandon her for even a weekend, it\u2019ll feel like a betrayal.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stared at her for several seconds before throwing his head back, eyes closed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been married very long. Give Jolene a chance. The two of us made progress today.\u201d</p><p>Bruce exhaled and finally nodded.</p> <p>The ten o\u2019clock news came on, and they cuddled together on the sofa. They held hands, and every now and then he\u2019d lean forward to kiss the side of her face. Rachel\u2019s eyes drifted shut as a river of awareness flowed through her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s asleep yet?\u201d Bruce whispered after the last news segment.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I do...\u201d</p><p>Turning out the lights as they went, Bruce led Rachel down the hallway to their bedroom. He didn\u2019t bother with the light. Rachel heard him slip out of his clothes. She did, as well.</p><p>They got into bed, and Bruce reached for her. Rachel moved into his arms. They kissed passionately, caressing each other, until she was weak with longing.</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d Bruce whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo far very good,\u201d she whispered back and the kissing continued.</p><p>The bed creaked, and it seemed to reverberate through the room. They both froze.</p><p>There was a long hesitation, in which they held themselves suspended, afraid to move or even breathe.</p><p>Then they heard Jolene\u2019s bedroom door open.</p><p>The sound of the door was followed by the patter of feet going down the hallway to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she comes in here?\u201d Rachel whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Bruce muttered fiercely.</p><p>Rachel ran her hands tenderly down her husband\u2019s back. \u201cDo we risk it? Remember what happened last time.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Bruce rolled away from her. Without a word, he marched into the master bathroom and a moment later she heard the shower.</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t need him to tell her he\u2019d turned on the cold water.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Megan wailed.</p><p>Troy Davis had just walked into his house when the kitchen phone rang. He picked up, not surprised to hear his daughter\u2019s voice; she\u2019d left a message at the office but he\u2019d forgotten to call her back. Troy\u2019s day had been interesting and he was eager for an opportunity to analyze what he\u2019d learned that afternoon. The coroner\u2019s office had finally sent him the complete report on the remains discovered in the cave, and the information had given him pause, to say the least. He needed an opportunity to digest what had been revealed and decide how to proceed. His one hope was that media interest had died down sufficiently to let this latest development pass without attention.</p><p>\u201cDad, are you listening to me?\u201d Megan asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want me to do something about?\u201d Troy asked, just so she\u2019d know he\u2019d heard her the first time.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t return my call,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s what Cody said, but I asked him to explain that this was important.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s assistant had mentioned the phone call and that Megan had sounded upset. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart, I had every intention of phoning you back, but time got away from me.\u201d He didn\u2019t want Megan to feel he didn\u2019t consider her calls important; however, since she\u2019d gotten pregnant, his daughter seemed to be in a perpetual state of crisis. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said, setting the mail on the kitchen counter. The microwave clock told him it was ten to seven, which explained why his stomach was growling. He hadn\u2019t even had a chance to remove his coat. A light rain had begun and tapped against the kitchen window.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Faith,\u201d Megan began.</p><p>Troy stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened now? Has there been another disturbance?\u201d He\u2019d been worried about the prowler and wondered if she\u2019d taken his advice and installed an alarm. He hoped she\u2019d asked Grace and Cliff about a motion sensor light, too. He\u2019d recently checked with his deputies about the neighborhood; according to Deputy Weaver, things had been quiet on Rosewood Lane. If anyone was pestering Faith, she hadn\u2019t reported it, nor had she contacted Troy.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened at the house that I know of\u2014not that Faith\u2019s said, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed and he was afraid she might break into tears, an occurrence that had become commonplace in the past few months. It\u2019d been the same with Sandy, Troy recalled. His wife\u2019s emotions had been volatile during her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cFaith\u2019s moving,\u201d Megan said, her voice low.</p><p>Frankly, Troy didn\u2019t blame her. In fact, he approved.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Megan demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, what? Actually, I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that,\u201d Megan said with a gasp. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You can\u2019t let Faith move away! You just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Clearly Troy was missing something. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go over this again. Start from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Megan said impatiently. \u201cI met her for lunch. We do that every so often, you know.\u201d</p><p>Troy did, and was grateful for any information his daughter could provide regarding Faith.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s helping me with the blanket I\u2019m knitting for the baby. I\u2019m practically finished and it\u2019s really nice.\u201d</p><p>Troy smiled, excited all over again at the prospect of becoming a grandfather. He knew one thing for sure\u2014his grandchild was going to be a very spoiled baby.</p><p>\u201cShe almost didn\u2019t tell me. In fact, I had the distinct feeling Faith wasn\u2019t going to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe realized you\u2019d eventually pass it on to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Megan agreed. \u201cAt any rate, just as we were leaving and Faith was putting on her coat, she said she\u2019d decided to move. She said that coming back to Cedar Cove had been a mistake. Her home in Seattle sold so quickly, she hadn\u2019t thought everything through. Now she thinks it might be better if she left the area entirely.\u201d</p><p>Shock rippled through Troy.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. Faith wasn\u2019t moving from one house to another; she\u2019d be moving to another town. Troy knew why. She wanted to get away from him.</p><p>\u201cI...see,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to let her leave, are you?\u201d Megan asked, sounding like a little girl who wasn\u2019t happy with the answer she\u2019d been given.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>The shock was still fresh and he hadn\u2019t absorbed this new information. So Faith was leaving town. He wanted to protest, demand she reconsider, but he had no right to ask. All he could do was stand back and keep his opinions to himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing Faith anymore,\u201d he reminded Megan.</p><p>\u201cBut you love her.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t deny it. He did love Faith. Her plan to leave Cedar Cove cut him to the quick, but he couldn\u2019t think of a single thing he could do to change her mind.</p><p>\u201cHow do Scott and his family feel about this?\u201d Troy asked. One reason Faith had moved to town was to be closer to her son and grandchildren.</p><p>\u201cI asked her that,\u201d Megan told him. \u201cAnd she pointed out that her daughter, Jay Lynn, lives in north Seattle. Jay Lynn said that after all the problems Faith\u2019s had in Cedar Cove, she should consider leaving.\u201d</p><p>He doubted Jay Lynn was referring only to the prowler. He felt she was insinuating that the disappointment he\u2019d brought into Faith\u2019s life was a problem, too\u2014a good reason to leave. Troy couldn\u2019t blame her family. They were concerned about their mother\u2019s physical and emotional welfare.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you have to do something,\u201d Megan said again.</p><p>Troy leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d Although he had no idea what that would be...</p><p>\u201cI like Faith so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He liked Faith, too\u2014more than liked her\u2014and he wished he could persuade her to stay in Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy. You\u2019ll find a way. I\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes later, the conversation ended with Megan inviting him to dinner the following weekend, and Troy replaced the receiver.</p><p>The day just seemed to get more complicated. Needing a distraction, he walked into the living room and switched on the evening news, wondering if the Seattle TV stations had gotten wind of the coroner\u2019s report. Thankfully there was nothing.</p><p>After half an hour or so, he decided it was time to eat. Searching through the cupboards, he found a can of chili. Opening it, he dumped the contents into a bowl, which he set in the microwave. While his meal warmed, he sorted through the mail, his thoughts still on Faith. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d He said the word aloud. Megan was right; he had to talk to Faith, convince her that leaving Cedar Cove would be wrong. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to talk her out of this\u2014or if he even had the right to try. The thing was, he couldn\u2019t idly stand by because Faith meant too much to him. She belonged here.</p><p>He reached for the phone just as his chili was done. Ignoring it, he punched out her number. The phone rang four times before the answering machine informed him that no one was home. Rather than leave a message, he hung up.</p><p>More depressed than ever, Troy paced the kitchen, gulping down spoonfuls of chili as he considered his options.</p><p>Perhaps it was just as well that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Faith, he told himself. If she felt she had to escape Cedar Cove, then maybe he should simply let her go.</p> <p>That conviction stayed with him for five whole days\u2014until late Wednesday afternoon. On his drive home, Troy saw Faith\u2019s car in the Safeway parking lot. He needed bread, anyway, he reasoned, and pulled into a space as far from hers as he could find. He didn\u2019t want Faith to assume he was seeking her out\u2014although, in truth, he was.</p><p>The weather, overcast and gloomy, matched his mood. Ever since Megan\u2019s phone call, his appetite had vanished and he wasn\u2019t sleeping well. Although he longed to talk to Faith, he realized he couldn\u2019t ask her to remain in Cedar Cove, and yet...he had to. If she left, he\u2019d always regret it.</p><p>After their last meeting, he\u2019d felt hopeful that at some point they\u2019d be able to put their differences behind them. He didn\u2019t know anymore. Although he\u2019d developed good instincts about people and situations in his years of police work, he couldn\u2019t read Faith or understand her feelings.</p><p>Two weeks ago, when she\u2019d called him about the intruder outside her bedroom window, reconciliation had actually seemed possible. He\u2019d been depressed after seeing her with Will Jefferson, but that night he\u2019d let her know how much he loved and needed her. He hadn\u2019t used those precise words but he couldn\u2019t have made his feelings any more obvious.</p><p>The way he figured it, the next move was hers. He hadn\u2019t pressured her, assuming his patience would eventually be rewarded. Apparently he\u2019d been wrong.</p> <p>By the time Troy had walked across the Safeway parking lot and grabbed a cart, his coat was damp. Once inside, he did a wide sweep of the perimeter, hurrying past the deli, the fresh fruits and vegetables and then the frozen-food section. Finally he spotted Faith halfway down one of the center aisles. She appeared to be reading the back of a box of pasta.</p><p>Attempting to look casual, he entered that aisle and slowed down as he drew close. Faith glanced up and her eyes widened when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Troy.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head in acknowledgment and maneuvered his empty cart next to hers. He wished he\u2019d had the foresight to toss in a few items to give her the impression that he\u2019d been in the store a while.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>They stared at each other a long moment, and Troy decided to wait her out, let her speak first. Silence was a common investigative technique; most people felt uncomfortable with a gap in the conversation and rushed to fill it. They often revealed more than they intended.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked awkwardly after half a minute of silence.</p><p>When he was speaking to a suspect, Troy generally answered a question with one of his own. He did that now. \u201cDid you have that security system installed like I suggested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did and it was worth every penny,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s given me peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>He reached for a bag of spaghetti noodles and dropped it into his cart, as if that was the sole reason he\u2019d come grocery shopping. Her reaction to his next question would tell him everything he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s moving day?\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cOh, so Megan told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she looked down at her cart as though she\u2019d forgotten something on her list and couldn\u2019t remember what it might be.</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d he repeated, unwilling to let her sidestep the question.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. \u201cI suppose I did,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have phoned me yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...1...\u201d She shifted her weight and stared down at the floor; he could tell his questions unsettled her. \u201cEvery time I see you lately, you\u2019re angry.\u201d She looked up and met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to live wherever you wish. If you want to move away from Cedar Cove, then be my guest.\u201d He snapped his mouth shut before he could say another word.</p><p>Faith\u2019s head flew back. Her eyes narrowed and he could see the anger welling up inside her. Biting her lip, she placed both hands on her cart and began to walk away.</p><p>He started after her, shoving his cart ahead of him. \u201cFaith! Hold on a minute.\u201d</p><p>She disregarded him, rounding the corner with long strides. He was catching up, feeling like a participant in a stock-car race, when he heard a familiar voice behind him.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis!\u201d</p><p>Troy reluctantly came to a halt, and glanced over his shoulder to find Louie Benson wheeling his grocery cart toward him. Not now, Troy thought. But he was trapped. Much as he wanted to hurry after Faith, he dared not ignore the mayor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you,\u201d Louie said.</p><p>Troy offered him a weak smile. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the coroner\u2019s final report but haven\u2019t had a chance to discuss the details with you. I assume you\u2019ve read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Troy replied crisply, trying to defer this. He wanted to apologize to Faith, make amends if it wasn\u2019t already too late.</p><p>The mayor hesitated. \u201cDid you see the statement that, judging by the skull, the young man had Down syndrome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis opens up an entirely new front in your investigation, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope the media doesn\u2019t pick up on it,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Troy said. He was off duty and wanted out of this conversation. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, there\u2019s someone I need to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Sorry if I interrupted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Troy said, rushing down the aisle, abandoning his cart. If he was lucky, he might still be able to catch up with Faith and apologize.</p><p>Luck was with him, and he saw her at the checkout stand. He waited outside until she\u2019d finished paying for her groceries.</p><p>As soon as she stepped through the doors into the gloomy afternoon, he approached her. \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she asked, moving past him.</p><p>Troy had seen that expression before and knew it wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI came at you like...like an angry bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she countered, walking purposefully toward the parking lot.</p><p>Troy followed her.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said. \u201cI was foolish to mention my plans to Megan. It was the coward\u2019s way out and I was immediately sorry I\u2019d done it.\u201d Her pace clipped, she headed for her vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to know.\u201d She\u2019d admitted to using Megan to inform him of her plans. He couldn\u2019t help feeling encouraged by that.</p><p>Perhaps Faith had done this, spoken to Megan, because she secretly\u2014or not so secretly\u2014hoped he\u2019d talk her out of it. Maybe this was her way of telling him she\u2019d prefer not to leave, that she wanted him back in her life. Instead, Troy had gone on the attack. He felt like kicking himself for being so insensitive.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it was wrong of me to tell Megan, knowing she\u2019d pass the word along,\u201d Faith said stiffly. \u201cYou see, I didn\u2019t want to phone you directly, because I was trying to avoid unnecessary contact. The less we see of each other, the better. I\u2019m sure you agree.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>Faith opened the car door and shoved her shopping bags inside.</p><p>Not giving him a chance to respond, she climbed into the front seat and slammed the door shut. The engine roared to life and she pulled out of her parking space before Troy could say another word.</p><p>Well, that was that.</p><p>His prospects with Faith couldn\u2019t look any worse.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>With property values lower than he\u2019d ever seen them, Mack McAfee figured there was no better time to purchase a house. He\u2019d been looking on and off for an investment ever since he\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove. When the real estate agent had shown him the duplex on Evergreen Place, he\u2019d made his decision.</p><p>A few years earlier, Mack had bought a home in north Seattle that was badly in need of repair. He\u2019d managed to get it cheap and spent most weekends putting on a new roof, replacing the kitchen countertops, installing new carpeting and doing whatever else was needed to update the house. He\u2019d put a lot of effort into the improvements, most of which he\u2019d done himself. Over the years he\u2019d picked up various skills doing odd jobs. When he\u2019d finished the house, right down to the landscaping, he\u2019d planned to move in, but someone had driven past one afternoon, stopped and made him an offer on the spot. A healthy six-figure profit had been sitting in the bank ever since, collecting interest.</p><p>The duplex was the perfect house to invest that money in. It was an older place, one story, with two doors on either side of a shared walkway. The building was in decent shape, but there was room for improvement. With a substantial down payment, he could live in one half and rent out the other. He put in an offer, which was accepted the next day. He\u2019d just signed the papers and was driving home when his cell phone jingled, indicating that he had a text message.</p><p>He waited until he\u2019d pulled into the apartment parking lot before checking his cell. When he saw Mary Jo\u2019s name on call display, he reacted immediately, his heart speeding up with excitement. They communicated quite a bit, usually by texting. She sent him regular updates on baby Noelle, often including photographs. He was careful not to overdo it with Mary Jo, since she was still emotionally fragile after her experience with David Rhodes. He\u2019d been tempted to send her flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day, but felt that was too much, too soon. Mack was willing to bide his time. He knew he wanted to pursue a relationship with Mary Jo; meanwhile, he enjoyed their \u201cconversations\u201d and occasional visits.</p><p>Today it wasn\u2019t a picture of Noelle that she\u2019d sent. Instead, it was a request. Can U meet me this afternoon?</p><p>He typed his response, eager to see her and the baby. Tell me when &amp; where. Fortuitously this was one of his days off. He pushed the send button and sat in his truck, awaiting her response. It wasn\u2019t long in coming.</p><p>I\u2019ll take Bremerton ferry. Gets in 2:30.</p><p>I\u2019ll pick U up. He punched out the letters as fast as his fingers could type.</p><p>It was now quarter after one. Mack bolted down a sandwich, then showered and changed his clothes. He\u2019d started cleaning the apartment but caught sight of the time and rushed out the door.</p><p>When the Bremerton ferry slid into the dock, Mack was standing outside the terminal. The walk-on passengers disembarked first, and he saw Mary Jo with the baby almost right away. She smiled and waved, and he returned the gesture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noelle was bundled up in an infant carrier that doubled as a car seat. Only her knit cap was showing, above a yellow blanket. Mack hurried to meet Mary Jo and took the heavy carrier from her hands.</p><p>He moved the blanket aside, smiling down at the baby. Noelle stared up at him and gurgled a greeting\u2014at least, he chose to interpret the sound as one of recognition and greeting. A smile broke out across his face. He was sure that what he felt for this baby was love, pure and simple. He\u2019d read about the bonding phenomenon and wondered if he\u2019d been susceptible to it, since he\u2019d brought her into the world. Maybe she\u2019d imprinted herself on his heart when she was born.</p><p>And Mary Jo...He found himself thinking about her far more than he should. Over the years he\u2019d gone out with plenty of women, but no one had captivated him the way she had. He realized she wasn\u2019t ready to enter into a new relationship, but he wanted her to understand that he was nothing like Noelle\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could meet me,\u201d Mary Jo said as they reached his truck.</p> <p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d he murmured. He tucked the baby carrier in the back and buckled it in place, then helped Mary Jo climb into the passenger seat and got in himself.</p><p>Once they were inside with the heater blasting warm air, he waited for Mary Jo to tell him why she\u2019d found it necessary to escape in the middle of the week. \u201cSo, are you here for any particular reason?\u201d he asked, which was probably more direct than he should\u2019ve been.</p><p>\u201cNothing really,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to get away for a while. I hope I didn\u2019t interfere with your plans. I remember you telling me you had Tuesdays off this month. Was I being presumptuous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He wanted her to know her company was always welcome.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...well, an afternoon out sounded like a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour brothers?\u201d Mack asked. Linc, Mel and Ned were often a topic of conversation between them.</p><p>Mary Jo fastened her seat belt and, without glancing in his direction, nodded.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind. I haven\u2019t been back to Cedar Cove since the night Noelle was born and...\u201d She let the rest fade. A moment later she resumed the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve kept in touch with Grace and Cliff. They\u2019re the nicest people.\u201d</p><p>Mack shared her opinion. He was beginning to make friends in Cedar Cove, and the Hardings were people he wanted to know better. \u201cI was surprised\u2014but definitely pleased\u2014to get your message,\u201d he told her truthfully.</p><p>Her smile was shy. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I like texting you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m talking to a good friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Generally she initiated their conversations, which was fine with him. He knew he had to let Mary Jo set the pace.</p><p>\u201cAnyplace you\u2019d like to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if we stopped at the library and visited Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Grace had opened her home and her heart to Mary Jo on Christmas Eve; it was only natural that she\u2019d want to see the woman who\u2019d been so kind. \u201cOff to the library we go.\u201d</p><p>The drive around the cove took about thirty minutes, and Mack used that time to draw Mary Jo out regarding her three brothers. She didn\u2019t say much other than that they were suffocating her with their concern. Mack was properly sympathetic but careful not to seem too critical. The baby slept the entire way. According to Mary Jo, Noelle seemed to be suffering less with colic these days. The doctor had said it could last as long as three months but rarely beyond that.</p><p>When they entered Cedar Cove, Mack pulled up in front of the library and helped Mary Jo and Noelle out. Then he went in search of a parking spot in the adjacent lot. By the time he returned, he found Mary Jo at the checkout desk chatting with Grace, the head librarian. Grace smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI called Olivia,\u201d she said, \u201cand told her Mary Jo was coming in for a visit. She asked to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He tried to sound enthusiastic, but he was slightly jealous that these ladies would have Mary Jo and Noelle to themselves when he\u2019d been looking forward to being alone with them.</p> <p>\u201cI arranged for tea and cookies in the break room,\u201d Grace added. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Now he was expected to be part of a tea party. If the crew at the fire station heard about this, there\u2019d be no end to the razzing. The whole situation was just too...feminine. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the three of you visit while I run a few errands,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s eyes begged him to reconsider. \u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...okay. Unless I\u2019m intruding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Grace told him.</p><p>Mary Jo touched his arm, mutely imploring, and Mack didn\u2019t see how he could decline. Without further protest, he joined Grace and Noelle in the back room.</p><p>As Mary Jo unbundled Noelle, Olivia Griffin arrived. She wore a knit cap over a head scarf, but it was easy to see that she was bald underneath. Still, despite the cancer, despite the treatments she was undergoing, the judge exuded vitality. He\u2019d met her Christmas Eve, the night of the birth, and he\u2019d always heard good things about her. His parents only had praise for Olivia, as a friend and as a judge; he could certainly understand why. This was one impressive woman.</p><p>Grace and Olivia paid plenty of attention to Noelle. The baby laughed and cooed, and Mack experienced a sense of fatherly pride he had no right to feel. Noelle gripped his finger, apparently determined not to let go.</p><p>\u201cI asked Mack to pick me up at the Bremerton ferry this afternoon,\u201d Mary Jo explained as Grace poured tea all around. \u201cI had to get away for a few hours. The boys are driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer brothers,\u201d Mack said, leaning forward.</p><p>He left his tea and unfastened Noelle from her carrier, adeptly scooping her up as if he\u2019d done exactly this dozens of times. While the women chatted, he walked around the room, gently stroking Noelle\u2019s back. Her head wobbled a little; then she rested it against his shoulder and promptly fell asleep. Every once in a while, he met Mary Jo\u2019s eyes and they smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on with your brothers?\u201d Grace asked, holding out a plate of oatmeal cookies.</p><p>Olivia shook her head, while Mary Jo accepted one.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh...they all seem to know what\u2019s best for me and the baby. Before I met David, I was saving money to get a place of my own. I had quite a bit set aside. Then I found out I was pregnant. After that, with all the stuff I needed for the baby, I didn\u2019t have any choice but to stay with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling the need to move out?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cOh, yes. They mean well and I appreciate everything they\u2019ve done for me, but...it\u2019s time. Noelle\u2019s almost two months old and I need to think about getting a job again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t return to the place you worked before,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cThey can\u2019t fire you for having a baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe insurance company had to downsize, and my position disappeared right after the first of the year. I got a severance package, but that won\u2019t last forever. I have to find a way to support Noelle and me and still be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>Although he wasn\u2019t part of the conversation, Mack interjected his opinion. \u201cYou could always move to this side of Puget Sound.\u201d He\u2019d probably come across as too eager but he couldn\u2019t contain his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d Olivia agreed.</p><p>Grace nodded and brushed her hands free of cookie crumbs.</p><p>Mary Jo glanced from one to the other. \u201cI\u2019d like that, I really would, but as I said I\u2019d need a job and a place to live, and it all seems impossible at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw my brother last week,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAnd he mentioned that he\u2019s looking for part-time help.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s eyes brightened and then just as quickly dimmed. \u201cI\u2019d need more hours if I was going to pay for child care and our living costs. Babies are expensive.\u201d</p><p>Olivia seemed undaunted. \u201cWill said the position would expand as the gallery picked up more business. Do you have accounting and office skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mary Jo told them. \u201cIn fact, I worked in the accounting department at the insurance company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Olivia clapped her hands delightedly.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s day care and rent...and who\u2019s to say your brother would find me a suitable employee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAs for day care\u2014\u201d Grace jumped into the conversation \u201c\u2014my younger daughter told me just this morning that she\u2019s looking for a means of adding to their family income. Kelly\u2019s a stay-at-home mom with a baby of her own. Taking care of Noelle would be perfect for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know of a place to live,\u201d Mack said. \u201cA duplex that\u2019s about to become available. The rent\u2019s extremely reasonable.\u201d He hadn\u2019t consciously thought of this before, but maybe the idea had been there all along....</p><p>Everything was obviously moving much too fast for Mary Jo. \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wise,\u201d Olivia said as Grace nodded. \u201cThis is a big step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a necessary one,\u201d Mary Jo murmured. Glancing up at Mack, who still held Noelle in his arms, she said, \u201cAnd there\u2019s someone other than me to consider now. A move will affect Noelle, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a good way,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Mary Jo spoke hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019ve made so many wrong decisions in my life that if I do move to Cedar Cove, I\u2019ll have to work everything out beforehand. Just to be sure...\u201d</p><p>The women talked for another ten or fifteen minutes and then Mack noticed that Olivia seemed to tire. Grace noticed it, too, and got up to carry the tea things to the staff kitchen while Mary Jo bundled up Noelle. Mack had reluctantly handed over the sleeping infant, hoping he\u2019d have the chance to hold her again.</p><p>When they left the library, Mack drove them to his apartment. It was small, but the view of the cove was unbeatable. While he hurried about straightening up the place\u2014he wished he\u2019d done that earlier\u2014Mary Jo stood in the living room, gazing thoughtfully out at the water with the navy ships gleaming in the distance.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me what\u2019s really going on with your brothers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Abruptly she turned to face him. \u201cThey want me to go after David,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mack frowned. \u201cGo after him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor child support. I understand what they\u2019re saying, and they have a point. On the surface, anyway. David has a responsibility to support Noelle. She is his child and a blood test will prove it.\u201d</p><p>An automatic objection formed, but he managed to quell it. Biologically\u2014and in no other way\u2014David was Noelle\u2019s father. The man was nothing more than a sperm donor.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t want David in my life,\u201d Mary Jo said emphatically, \u201cand I certainly don\u2019t want him to have access to Noelle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBased on everything I\u2019ve heard, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful you agree with me. Linc\u2019s adamant that David pay support. I\u2019ve told my brother that David has constant money problems, but Linc still believes he should pay. How\u2019s he going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, there\u2019s no getting blood out of a turnip.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo glanced down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if he had all the money in the world. I still wouldn\u2019t want my daughter anywhere near him.\u201d</p> <p>Again Mack agreed.</p><p>\u201cBen Rhodes has generously set up a trust fund for Noelle, like he did for David\u2019s other daughter. He also offered to help me financially, knowing his son either couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember. Are you sure you should turn him down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mary Jo was quick to tell him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d</p><p>Mack understood\u2014and shared\u2014her point of view.</p> <p>\u201cI really like this town,\u201d Mary Jo said next in a transparent effort to change the subject. \u201cFrom the moment I stepped off the ferry on Christmas Eve, I felt at peace here, almost as if...as if I belonged. I suspect that when I asked to visit this afternoon, I was secretly hoping to find a way for Noelle and me to live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy if you did.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes held and Mack felt the tension building between them. Under other circumstances he might have kissed her but he was afraid of frightening her off.</p><p>Mack was a patient man, though. He knew what he wanted, and every minute he spent with Mary Jo and Noelle made him more aware of what that was.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Charlotte Rhodes worried about Ben as she poured his first coffee of the day while he retrieved the morning paper from the porch.</p> <p>Ben just hadn\u2019t been himself since returning from the cruise. Even her special homemade coconut cake didn\u2019t interest him, and that was highly unusual.</p><p>When they\u2019d come home from the Caribbean, she\u2019d assumed his malady was physical. In the weeks since, she\u2019d realized that what ailed him was emotional. Her husband was depressed.</p><p>\u201cThe Seniors\u2019 Potluck is this afternoon,\u201d she reminded him as she carried in his coffee. Harry, her cat, had curled up on Ben\u2019s lap and made himself comfortable. Harry hadn\u2019t initially accepted Ben, but once he had, the cat had become her husband\u2019s constant companion.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I skipped it this time?\u201d Ben mumbled from behind the paper.</p><p>Charlotte started to protest, then stopped herself. \u201cAren\u2019t you feeling well?\u201d she asked, sitting on the ottoman by his chair. She rested her hand on his knee and gazed up at him, wanting so desperately to help.</p><p>Ben lowered the paper and looked at her briefly, then stared into the distance. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said with a halfhearted smile. \u201cI\u2019d just prefer to stay home this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, dear, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He reached out his hand to squeeze hers. \u201cThanks for understanding.\u201d</p> <p>After lingering for a moment, Charlotte returned to the bedroom, where she dressed and got ready for her day. She\u2019d never, ever thought Ben would purposely avoid the Seniors\u2019 Potluck. It was the social highlight of their month, when they saw their dearest friends. Half the widows in town were in love with Ben, and Charlotte knew why. He wasn\u2019t only handsome, charming and witty, he was a man of integrity. He\u2019d truly blessed her life.</p><p>All their friends were bound to ask about him and she wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Well, she\u2019d think of something. Poor Ben. She had to assume his depression stemmed, at least in part, from his son David\u2019s appalling behavior. She wished she knew how to help him through this, yet she felt at a loss. Offering comfort and reassurance was all she could do.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d finished dressing, Charlotte went back to the kitchen to prepare her contribution for that day\u2019s potluck. As in most family homes, the kitchen was the center of activity. Not only did she do her cooking and baking there, but her best thinking took place while standing in front of the sink, washing dishes. Most serious discussions with her children had taken place here, as well.</p><p>What to bring to the potluck? Her broccoli lasagna had been a huge hit in January, and she\u2019d received numerous requests for the recipe. In fact, these meals generally turned into a recipe exchange. Some of her favorite ones came from the potlucks, and from wakes, too. The recipe for the best casserole she\u2019d ever tasted had come from the wake for her husband Clyde\u2019s dearest friend, Sam. Every time she served it, she thought of him. Of both of them.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d she said, stepping out of the kitchen as she tied her apron around her waist. \u201cShould I bring the stuffed peppers or my chicken potpie?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away, as if he was considering the decision. \u201cThe potpie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I was leaning toward that myself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make three, so there\u2019ll be plenty for you, and I\u2019ll take one over to Olivia and Jack this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea.\u201d He set aside the paper to pet Harry, who slept contentedly in his lap.</p><p>Charlotte returned to the kitchen and got out the flour and lard. None of those store-bought piecrusts for her! She had the time and a recipe she\u2019d inherited from her mother, one that couldn\u2019t be matched.</p><p>\u201cCome and chat with me,\u201d she called out to Ben as she kneaded the flour and lard. The dough was soft and supple; her mother had always warned her not to knead it too long, but the timing had become a matter of instinct. Charlotte sighed. Her mother, God rest her soul, had been a wonderful cook.</p><p>Some of the recipes she\u2019d been collecting for Justine and her new restaurant were from Charlotte\u2019s mother. Admittedly, there were a few that were a bit challenging to translate for a modern kitchen\u2014and a cook who couldn\u2019t spend all day preparing them!</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d Ben asked as he slid into a kitchen chair.</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just thinking about my mother and her recipe for dumplings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor years she told me it was a secret family recipe. Some secret. Flour and water were the two main ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there are a couple of other things, but no big deal. The real secret was in cooking them for a good long while. That\u2019s what she used to say\u2014a good long while. I decided that was too vague and imprecise for Justine, so I left the recipe out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you given them to her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the collection\u2019s nearly ready.\u201d Many of the original recipes had been lost over the years\u2014or never written down\u2014and Charlotte had to reconstruct them from memory. The project had helped fill the dreary winter days. With Ben so depressed lately, she\u2019d stayed close to home.</p><p>\u201cI feel guilty using grilled chicken from the deli in this potpie,\u201d Charlotte confessed. She\u2019d picked up two of them the day before, since they came in handy and never went to waste.</p><p>Ben dismissed her concern. \u201cNo one will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but it\u2019s nearly as tasty and it does save me time.\u201d</p><p>Ben got up and poured himself a second cup of coffee. \u201cI heard from David yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s hands momentarily stilled. The call must have come while she was out getting groceries. She waited for him to elaborate, and when he didn\u2019t she felt compelled to remain silent. Ben would tell her as soon as he was ready.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted another loan.\u201d</p><p>That was hardly a shock. The only time his youngest son called was when he needed financial assistance. David was a user and had no skills when it came to money management. No ethics, either\u2014he\u2019d lie about anything to anyone, including that young girl who\u2019d just had his baby. And his father.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he got angry with you.\u201d This was a pattern. Ben had held firm to his stipulation. He refused to lend his son any more money until David paid back the loans he\u2019d already made. Over the course of their marriage, Ben had received a few checks from David, but they\u2019d all bounced due to insufficient funds.</p><p>Nothing had upset her husband more, however, than discovering that his son had fathered a child and then abandoned the mother\u2014and this was after his divorce. Naturally David denied that he was responsible for Mary Jo\u2019s pregnancy, but given his history and given the girl\u2019s sincerity, that denial was just another lie.</p><p>\u201cWe had an argument,\u201d Ben murmured, obviously distraught.</p><p>Charlotte dumped the pie dough on a floured board. \u201cI have a son who\u2019s disappointed me, too,\u201d she said, wanting to reassure him that many parents faced such trials. She rarely referred to Will as a disappointment, but the fact that he\u2019d been repeatedly unfaithful to his wife had distressed Charlotte deeply. Like any mother, she wanted to believe the best of her child. Sadly, she recognized that was no longer possible with the man Will had become.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cWill\u2019s transgressions are bad enough, but they don\u2019t come close to David\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so...\u201d At least Will hadn\u2019t tried to steal from her or, she was positive, anyone else. And he\u2019d been a good brother to Olivia during her illness.</p><p>\u201cI keep wondering what I could\u2019ve done to set David straight when he was young,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Charlotte countered quickly, \u201cany more than I can blame myself for Will\u2019s...weaknesses.\u201d</p><p>Ben seemed to agree with her. \u201cIntellectually I know you\u2019re right, but that doesn\u2019t wipe out the regrets.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte identified with his sorrow. When she\u2019d learned how Will had taken advantage of Grace Sherman, how he\u2019d lied and misled her, she\u2019d been horrified. Acknowledging character flaws in one\u2019s child was a dull ache in a parent\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cBesides, Will\u2019s straightened out his life,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIt sure looks like it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte fervently hoped that was the case, but she couldn\u2019t be positive. He\u2019d never shown her that deceitful side of himself. Outwardly he was the perfect son but she couldn\u2019t ignore the less-than-salutary aspects of his behavior.</p><p>\u201cI talked to him recently,\u201d she said, \u201cand the gallery seems to be doing well. It\u2019s good to see him excited about what\u2019s happening there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he\u2019s seeing Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had heard that bit of local gossip, too. The artist had immediately caught her son\u2019s eye. She hoped this relationship was right for them.</p><p>Ben wandered back to the living room and his paper, and Charlotte continued her cooking. After she\u2019d placed the bottom crusts in three different casserole dishes, she made the gravy and added the cut-up chicken and saut\u00e9ed vegetables. When she\u2019d finished, she poured the mixture into the piecrusts, arranged the strips of lattice on top and set all three dishes in the oven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She threw a load of laundry in the washer, then joined Ben in the living room. He was doing the crossword puzzle and she sat across from him and picked up her knitting. For forty-five minutes they worked quietly while the pies baked, lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>Just before eleven-thirty, Charlotte removed the hot dishes from the oven, put on her coat and retrieved her purse. This was the first potluck she and Ben hadn\u2019t attended as a couple since they were married.</p><p>Ben carried the warm chicken pie to the car and kissed her before she left. \u201cHave a good time.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him back. \u201cI\u2019ll be home as soon as I can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to rush. Harry and I will hold the fort.\u201d</p><p>Despite his encouragement to linger and visit with their friends, Charlotte returned to the house two hours later, her head buzzing.</p><p>Ben met her at the door and took the empty casserole dish from her hands. \u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I always do. Everyone asked after you and I said you were a bit under the weather.\u201d Thankfully, she\u2019d managed to sidestep other questions. A number of their friends had pressed her for details, certain Ben must be suffering from a nasty virus currently going around. She\u2019d reassured everyone that Ben was fine, and physically he was. Emotionally, that was another story.</p><p>He brought the empty dish to the kitchen sink and looked at her, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, but I do have some interesting news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and tell me.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pulled out a kitchen chair. \u201cSheriff Davis stopped by to speak to the group,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ben reached for the notice mailed once a month to seniors who belonged to the center. Charlotte had propped it on the kitchen table. He quickly scanned the details. \u201cIt says here that Grace was supposed to be the guest speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she was, and she did a fabulous job.\u201d Although Charlotte volunteered at the library, it never ceased to astonish her how many books she hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cGrace was kind enough to bring in a box of bestsellers and she gave a short synopsis of each. Oh, Ben, they all sound like such good stories. I made a list of several I knew we\u2019d both enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Sheriff Davis speak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Grace. He came by unexpectedly and asked to address the group.\u201d Troy visited once or twice a year but generally as a scheduled speaker. Charlotte had always been fond of him and appreciated his tips for seniors.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he have to say? Another warning about not giving out personal information over the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time. He asked for our help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte drew her chair closer to the table. \u201cYou remember reading about the remains in the cave outside town, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It was a little before Christmas. And there\u2019ve been a few press and TV stories since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and now there\u2019s additional information. According to the coroner\u2019s report, the remains are those of a young man who had Down syndrome. The sheriff asked if any of us remembered a family with a Down syndrome boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas someone able to help him?\u201d Ben asked.</p> <p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cThere was plenty of discussion, and Bess had a vague recollection of a woman with such a child. I do, too, but for the life of me I can\u2019t remember who she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will in time.\u201d</p><p>One of the most annoying effects of aging was this forgetfulness, these infernal memory gaps. The name was there, right on the edge of her consciousness, but it remained just out of reach. This was going to bother her until she came up with it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably think of it in the middle of the night,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>His confidence in her was reassuring.</p><p>\u201cAfter Troy left, Bess and I talked about who it might be. We threw around a few names but none of them felt right. It seems to me the woman was a relative of someone who once lived here\u2014a cousin, aunt or some such. Why can\u2019t I remember?\u201d She tapped the side of her head with her index finger.</p><p>Ben sat back in his chair. \u201cTell me what you do remember and maybe that\u2019ll jog your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I met the boy once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, his aunt had him, I believe.... At least, that\u2019s what I seem to recall. She complained to me that his mother kept him inside most of the time. The mother, whose name has completely escaped me, was terribly protective of him, sheltering him from just about everyone. She was something of a recluse herself, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. It\u2019d been so many years now.... \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure, three or four decades ago. Maybe more. His aunt or whoever it was had taken him to the waterfront park. He was enthralled with it. She said it was probably the first time he\u2019d ever set foot in a park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven now I can see that boy on the merry-go-round. He was laughing, so happy to be outside in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Her memory was slowly coming back. Talking about it was helping, just as Ben had suggested.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes. \u201cHis aunt seemed delighted by everything he did.\u201d She smiled at the memory, although she couldn\u2019t picture the woman clearly. Oh, why couldn\u2019t she remember her name? \u201cThe mother loved that child. The aunt, too. If anything happened to him, I\u2019d stake my life on the fact that neither of them had anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing to say this is the same child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Charlotte nodded. Nevertheless, she suspected it was the same boy. Frowning, she stood.</p><p>\u201cLet your mind rest,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThe name will eventually come to you.\u201d</p><p>He was right, only it was difficult advice to take. She knew this family or had known them at one time, and she kept worrying away at it.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you wanted to bring Olivia one of the pies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I\u2019d nearly forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like company?\u201d Ben surprised her by asking.</p><p>The spark was back in his eyes, and that encouraged her. \u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided I can\u2019t let my son\u2019s weakness disrupt my life. All I can do is make an effort to be the best grandfather I can.\u201d Ben\u2019s gaze met hers and he took her hand. \u201cShall we go, my dear?\u201d</p><p>He was going to be all right; she was sure of it.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>It was almost the end of his workday\u2014if a cop\u2019s day ever ended. Megan had asked him to stop by the house before he went home, and Troy had agreed. She hadn\u2019t said why, but she\u2019d let him know it was terribly important. Seeing that the last time he\u2019d ignored her request he\u2019d been sucker punched by the news about Faith, he thought he should make at least a token appearance.</p><p>The phone rang just as he was leaving the office. He considered not answering but, with a sigh, reached across his desk and grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis.\u201d</p><p>The call was from Kathleen Sadler, the Seattle reporter who\u2019d been on a mission to embarrass Cedar Cove. She wanted the latest update on the skeletal remains.</p><p>Polite but firm, Troy gave her a stock answer, made his excuses and disconnected. He\u2019d addressed the seniors\u2019 group earlier that week to request help and information, and that had brought his most promising lead to date. He\u2019d acted on impulse, dashing into their monthly gathering. Sometimes crimes were solved in unexpected ways.</p><p>Because of the phone call, he was a few minutes later than he\u2019d told Megan. Even before he got to the front door, she\u2019d flung it open; it was as if she\u2019d been looking out the window, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to come,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d be here.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand why it was so all-fired important that he show up on a Thursday evening. She must\u2019ve rushed home from work herself.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cNever mind. Come in. I baked your favorite oatmeal cookies.\u201d</p><p>After the day he\u2019d had, Troy was grateful for an excuse to relax. Sitting heavily in a kitchen chair, he muttered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as a late Valentine\u2019s Day gift.\u201d</p><p>This year\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day had been a disaster. He\u2019d bought a large box of expensive chocolates for Faith. He\u2019d never expected to pay that much for candy. He\u2019d bought a bouquet of red roses, too. They should\u2019ve been gold plated for what they cost. As it turned out, he might as well have flushed all that cash down the toilet. The day before he\u2019d intended to drop them off, he learned that Faith was leaving town.</p><p>So much for romancing her with flowers and candy! The roses were wilting in a vase on the mantel and he\u2019d stuck the chocolates in the fridge. If she wanted to go back to Seattle\u2014or wherever\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to stop her. Not that he had the power to do so, anyway. The woman had a mind of her own, and he could see that it was already made up.</p><p>\u201cDo you want coffee or tea with your cookies?\u201d Megan asked, standing attentively beside his chair.</p><p>\u201cCoffee.\u201d Anything was better than the stale brew at the station. The stuff was often as black as tar and just as thick.</p><p>His daughter brought him a plate holding four cookies and a mug of coffee with a touch of half-and-half, which was exactly the way he liked it. \u201cI assume you want something?\u201d Treats like this generally came at a price.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Megan put her hands on her hips, her expression one of shock. \u201cHow can you even suggest such a thing? We hardly ever have time to talk anymore, just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what shall we talk about?\u201d He crossed his legs and leaned back. He was certain this little rendezvous was leading somewhere.</p><p>Before his daughter could respond, the doorbell rang. A look he could only describe as panicked flashed across Megan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged and glanced away. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Megan hurried to the front door and in that instant everything became clear to Troy. This hadn\u2019t been a random invitation. His daughter had decided to do some matchmaking.</p><p>Troy stood, pushing aside the cookies and his coffee, and entered the living room. \u201cHello, Faith.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell when she saw him. She was obviously as surprised as he was\u2014perhaps more so.</p><p>\u201cMegan asked me to stop by so she could show me the baby blanket she finished knitting.\u201d Faith\u2019s tone implied that she wasn\u2019t a party to this arrangement.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t need anyone to tell him the entire setup was Megan\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the blanket,\u201d Megan said cheerfully, acting oblivious to the tension between Faith and Troy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two talk while I...find my knitting.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Megan left the living room, the silence seemed louder than any words they might have said. Troy wondered which of them would speak first. He\u2019d decided it wasn\u2019t going to be him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apparently Faith had made the same decision. They both stood there examining the carpet, each pretending to ignore the other.</p><p>Okay, fine, he\u2019d take the initiative. \u201cI apologize for this,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI had no idea Megan was setting us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either,\u201d Faith told him.</p><p>It was pleasant not to be snapping at each other. Only months ago, they used to talk for hours on end. They\u2019d laughed together and shared memories and dreams.</p> <p>Troy exhaled a sigh. \u201cListen, about the other night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week in the grocery store\u2014\u201d Faith started speaking at the same time.</p><p>They both stopped and stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cLadies before gentlemen,\u201d Troy said and gestured toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke first.\u201d She motioned back at him.</p> <p>Troy hardly knew where to begin. He made a couple of awkward attempts. \u201cWhen I saw you...\u201d He paused. \u201cI never should\u2019ve said the things I...\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled and her expression softened. \u201cAre you actually apologizing, Troy Davis?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and conceded with a nod. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the words always get stuck in your throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you they seem to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a sad commentary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He had to agree.</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. \u201cI admit no one has the power to unsettle me as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>They continued to stand in their respective areas, Faith near the front door, Troy on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She took a moment to consider. \u201cA bit of both, I guess.\u201d</p><p>With that, it seemed they\u2019d said everything there was to be said. The strained silence returned. When Troy could no longer stand not knowing, he asked, \u201cAre you still planning to move?\u201d</p><p>Faith broke eye contact. \u201cI don\u2019t know.... I think it might be for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at that. \u201cWhy is it men always assume they\u2019re the sole reason for a woman\u2019s decisions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask that as if I\u2019m going to give you a punch line.\u201d She shook her head in amusement. \u201cI guess the answer is that men tend to be self-centered.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue with her. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>Troy thought he saw Megan poke her head around the corner, but she didn\u2019t return with her \u201cfound\u201d knitting.</p><p>His pride felt like a lump in his throat. Somehow he managed to speak around it. \u201cDon\u2019t leave, Faith.\u201d If she moved away, he knew he\u2019d regret that he hadn\u2019t asked her to stay. He\u2019d regret that he hadn\u2019t tried to stop her.</p><p>To his utter astonishment, her eyes filled with tears. He had no idea what he could\u2019ve said to cause such a reaction. Every time he opened his mouth he upset her. That was the last thing he wanted. Feeling completely helpless, he covered the distance between them and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>At first she resisted and then, gradually, he felt her resolve weaken as she leaned against him. Troy held her enclosed in his embrace.</p><p>Megan cleared her throat as she entered the room.</p><p>They broke apart like guilty teenagers.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the blanket,\u201d his daughter announced in an unnecessarily loud voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me see,\u201d Faith said with more enthusiasm than warranted. Almost eagerly she walked away from Troy and toward Megan.</p><p>Troy could see that Faith\u2019s skin was flushed with embarrassment. While she examined Megan\u2019s knitting, Troy\u2019s mind whirled with hope and excitement, and his spirits felt lighter than they\u2019d been in weeks.</p><p>In his heart of hearts, he was convinced Faith loved him as much as he loved her. This being apart was ridiculous. He knew what he wanted, and that was to have Faith in his life. They were meant to be together. He felt sure that, given time, she\u2019d admit it, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, Megan, you\u2019ve done a splendid job.\u201d</p><p>His daughter fairly beamed at Faith\u2019s praise. \u201cDid you notice the mistake I made here?\u201d she asked, pointing to what must\u2019ve been a small flaw in the blanket.</p><p>\u201cNo, and no one else will, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I have to look for it. Remember what you told me when I first started knitting?\u201d</p><p>Faith frowned and gave a slight shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou said,\u201d Megan reminded her, \u201cthat if it bothered me I should rip it out and repair the mistake, but if it was something small and barely noticeable I should simply forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember there are three stitches in knitting. Knit, purl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and rip,\u201d Megan completed for her. \u201cThat isn\u2019t technically a stitch, but it\u2019s certainly part of my knitting process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of everyone\u2019s process,\u201d Faith said, and they both laughed.</p><p>Faith made a couple of other complimentary remarks about the blanket while Troy waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cI should be going,\u201d he said pointedly when Megan brought out the new yarn she\u2019d purchased. It was obvious that she and Faith had become good friends and shared an easy camaraderie.</p><p>Faith turned and her gaze immediately found his. \u201cI should go, too. Oh, look at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cCraig will be home soon, won\u2019t he? You two will want to have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Megan said. Troy supposed she figured her work was done.</p><p>Troy held the door for Faith and was about to follow her when Megan placed her hand on his arm, stopping him. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>Troy looked over at Faith and saw that she stood next to her car, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to do something, and I could see you were too stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Stubborn?\u201d Troy protested. \u201cWhat about Faith? She\u2019s the stubborn one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but I doubt it.\u201d Megan rose up on the tips of her toes and kissed his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t let her get away, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She gave him a gentle shove. \u201cNow what are you doing standing here? Go talk to Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I plan to do.\u201d He bounded down the steps and met Faith in the driveway.</p><p>The words he\u2019d planned to say were trapped in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stop by the house for a little while?\u201d Faith asked when he reached her.</p><p>By some miracle he managed to nod.</p><p>\u201cShall we say in fifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d he suggested instead.</p><p>Faith laughed. \u201cFive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just follow you home?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Troy started toward his own car. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy?\u201d Faith stopped him, sounding uncertain.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He turned to face her again.</p><p>She paused. \u201cI want to settle these...these differences between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...Oh, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said softly, walking back to stand in front of her. \u201cLet\u2019s not make any decisions yet. Let\u2019s talk honestly and openly, and if we both decide a relationship is wrong, we\u2019ll lay it to rest once and for all. Does that seem fair to you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes vulnerable, exposing what was in her heart. \u201cIt does,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He touched her cheek, then hurried to his car.</p><p>On the short drive, Troy felt almost drunk. Drunk on love and hope.... For no real reason he burst into laughter.</p><p>They were finally going to resolve this situation between them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Troy made the turn onto Rosewood Lane that he saw the twirling lights of two patrol cars. Both were parked outside Faith\u2019s house.</p><p>Troy was out of his vehicle before Faith had even pulled into her driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked Deputy Weaver, who met him halfway up the walk.</p><p>\u201cThe alarm company phoned in a breach.\u201d</p><p>Faith hurried toward him, eyes wide and frightened. \u201cTroy, what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears someone broke into the house.\u201d In an effort to calm her, he slipped his arm around her shoulders. \u201cThe alarm company alerted my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA 9\u20131\u20131 call came in from a neighbor, as well,\u201d Deputy Weaver added.</p><p>Faith covered her mouth with both hands. \u201cIs this ever going to stop?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat do these people want from me?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Troy didn\u2019t have any answers.</p><p>After conferring with his deputies, he entered the house with Faith. The destruction was minor\u2014a broken window, a lamp on the floor and a toppled vase. Still, it was bad enough. Faith gasped and he put out a hand to steady her.</p><p>Troy stayed while his deputies finished their report. After they\u2019d left and the house was quiet again, he turned to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you straighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said and shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this now. I\u2019m going to spend the night with Scott and his family.\u201d</p><p>Troy could understand how upset she must be. He\u2019d give just about anything to solve this and to find out why Faith, of all people, was being targeted.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d she said, her voice quavering, \u201cthat while you\u2019d like me to remain in Cedar Cove, someone else wants me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>It was the first Tuesday of March and Christie had driven her almost-new car over to Teri\u2019s. She tried to visit every few days, especially now that Teri hardly ever left the house anymore.</p><p>Christie carried the teapot into the family room, where Teri sat with her swollen feet propped up. \u201cYou look wonderful,\u201d she told her sister. Despite everything\u2014Teri\u2019s obvious discomfort and the inconvenience of enforced bed rest\u2014it was true.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a blimp.\u201d Teri rested her hands on her protruding abdomen. \u201cI\u2019ve got three and a half months to go and by the time I\u2019m ready, they\u2019ll have to get a forklift to move me.\u201d</p><p>Christie laughed. Triplets! Something like this would only happen to Teri. Triplets\u2014and without fertility drugs, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably deliver early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Teri said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou feel okay, though. Right?\u201d Christie placed the tray with the teapot and two cups on the coffee table and sat on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI feel like Sigourney Weaver in that movie. You know, where she gives birth to an alien. You wouldn\u2019t believe what it\u2019s like to have three little soccer players kicking away at my ribs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWipe that smirk off your face.\u201d</p><p>Christie couldn\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have so much fun with your babies.\u201d</p><p>Her sister shrugged. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to have fun with them myself. I\u2019m going to love being an aunt.\u201d She knew she\u2019d probably never be a mother, so Teri\u2019s babies would have to be hers, too.</p><p>Teri and Bobby were both elated, and Christie had never seen a husband more attentive and caring than Bobby. He\u2019d brought Teri real happiness; she\u2019d told Christie that when she\u2019d imagined she was happy in the past, those feelings didn\u2019t even compare to what she felt now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a while, Christie believed she\u2019d found that same kind of happiness with James Wilbur, but as was so often the case, she\u2019d been wrong. He was like every other man she\u2019d ever cared about\u2014only it\u2019d taken him a bit longer to reveal his true nature.</p><p>As if her sister had been reading her thoughts, Teri glanced speculatively at Christie. \u201cJames\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start,\u201d Christie warned. Teri seemed convinced that Christie could be as fortunate, as contented, as she was; Christie knew better. She poured the herbal tea, and handed Teri a cup.</p><p>Her sister gratefully accepted it. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore James forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t?\u201d She crossed one leg over the other and swung her foot to hide her nervousness.</p><p>Teri\u2019s eyes grew sad. \u201cYou love him and you know it. I had no idea you could be so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d Christie returned, remembering their youth. Her sister was more familiar with her character flaws than anyone. \u201cYou want to defend James and that\u2019s your choice, but I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames loves you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he does. That\u2019s why he walked out on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe panicked,\u201d Teri said, defending him. \u201cIt had nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d That just proved her point; when he was in trouble, when he\u2019d needed help, it hadn\u2019t occurred to him to confide in her\u2014the woman he supposedly loved.</p><p>But Christie didn\u2019t want to argue with her sister. They\u2019d done enough of that through the years. \u201cWould you mind if we didn\u2019t discuss James?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>One look told her how disappointed Teri was.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you about my classes,\u201d Christie said. To her own surprise she liked her courses. The photography was an interesting challenge, and she\u2019d mastered the basics. She\u2019d been working with a camera provided by the school but planned to buy her own. She\u2019d met Jon Bowman, Grace Sherman\u2019s son-in-law, once or twice; maybe he\u2019d be willing to recommend a digital camera. And since she was starting her own business, she knew she needed some accounting skills. To her delight, she\u2019d discovered that she thoroughly enjoyed the classes and had no problem with the homework.</p><p>Even as a kid Christie had always had a head for math. She never had difficulty remembering phone numbers after hearing them only once or twice. Her skill with figures was one of the reasons she\u2019d made cashier at Wal-Mart. Balancing her bank account had never been a problem, either\u2014especially since her balance generally hovered around zero.</p> <p>\u201cYou sent back his Valentine gift.\u201d She paused. \u201cThe flowers were gorgeous\u2014I know because he ended up giving them to me.\u201d</p><p>Christie forcefully expelled her breath. \u201cAre you back to James again?\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s gaze pleaded with hers. \u201cExplain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you\u2019re so unforgiving. Why can\u2019t you accept the fact that once the news story broke, James felt he had no option but to run. Surely you can put yourself in his position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Teri said. \u201cPoor James, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe walked out on you and Bobby, and he walked out on me, just like every other man I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChristie, you\u2019ve got to know James isn\u2019t like anyone else. He\u2019s James. His childhood was hell. His parents drove him to mental collapse, to the point that he ended up in a psych ward. Once it was obvious that he couldn\u2019t play chess anymore, they turned their backs on him\u2014their own son! If it wasn\u2019t for Bobby, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem all that grateful to Bobby\u2014or at least that\u2019s how it looks from where I\u2019m sitting,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhen Bobby needed him, James left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you needed him, James left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she flared. \u201cI thought James was different. I thought I could trust him. What an idiot I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came back because of you,\u201d Teri said quietly.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Teri pretended not to hear. \u201cJames realized it didn\u2019t matter what kind of ugly sensationalism that reporter put out there. He decided to stop hiding.\u201d</p><p>She paused as though she expected Christie to appreciate how hard it\u2019d been for James to confront his past. Okay, Christie could understand his fears; still, that didn\u2019t justify the way he\u2019d abandoned her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you imagine what it must have been like for him?\u201d Teri asked rhetorically. \u201cHe\u2019s stayed in the shadows all these years and then to be thrust into the limelight without his knowledge or consent. It was his worst nightmare. Instinct took over, and he ran. Who\u2019s to say what either of us would\u2019ve done in the same situation? But once his head cleared, he came back, and the first person he asked to see was you.\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s resolve remained unchanged. \u201cI learned something important about myself through all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need a man.\u201d It\u2019d been a liberating insight. After each breakup, she\u2019d instantly gone in search of a new relationship, afraid to be alone. Afraid that on her own she hadn\u2019t been enough. All those associations had been with a certain type\u2014drunks, drug addicts, assorted losers. Men she felt she could rescue with sufficient love, sympathy and understanding. Not to mention money...</p><p>In the dark, lonely hours after James\u2019s defection, Christie had arrived at some conclusions. First, she was good enough\u2014and no man would ever make her feel whole or complete. That had to come from within herself. Second, she had an excessive need to be needed. She recognized that about herself now and wasn\u2019t about to fall back into the same patterns.</p><p>While she enjoyed her job, she wanted more. With her photography and business classes, Christie was going to establish a career. Initially, she\u2019d take photographic assignments on her off-hours, while she still had the protection of a steady paycheck. No matter how long it took, she wasn\u2019t about to let a man, any man, ruin her chances or stand in her way.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re feeling hurt,\u201d Teri said, \u201cbut I wish you\u2019d give James another chance.\u201d</p><p>Unwilling to bend, Christie shook her head.</p><p>Once she succeeded in steering the conversation away from James, she enjoyed the visit with her sister. Although Teri was positive and uncomplaining\u2014other than in humorous asides\u2014Christie knew this pregnancy had taken a toll on her. Teri was an active, social person, and she found being confined to the house extremely difficult.</p><p>Even though Christie preferred to avoid any possible contact with James, Teri needed her. She promised she\u2019d stop by again in a day or two.</p><p>Bobby walked her to the front door, which was unusual. She figured he wanted to tell her something out of earshot of his wife. He glanced furtively at the family room, where Teri was still sitting.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing well,\u201d Christie said reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cAll three are boys,\u201d Bobby announced without preamble.</p><p>\u201cYou know already?\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded. \u201cI saw the picture. Teri wouldn\u2019t look but I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree sons,\u201d Christie repeated, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cTeri wants a girl,\u201d he said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, my sister won\u2019t be disappointed,\u201d Christie told him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll want to get pregnant again\u2014until she has her girl. I\u2019m just not sure she should.\u201d</p><p>Christie knew he was concerned about Teri\u2019s health and the physical demands of this pregnancy. But she also knew the power Teri had over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean is that if my sister wants something and you can make it happen, you will. Right?\u201d</p><p>Bobby lowered his eyes.</p><p>Christie had to struggle not to laugh. He adored Teri so much, he could refuse her nothing. Oh, to have a man who loved her that intensely. Christie hoped Teri knew how lucky she was.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d she said again. \u201cOnce these babies are born, the last thing Teri will think about is getting pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>Alarm crossed his face. \u201cShe\u2019ll still...you know...\u201d The rest of his words fell away as though he assumed she\u2019d grasp his meaning.</p><p>Christie did. Only Bobby would ask something like this. \u201cOh, I imagine she\u2019ll be as warm and loving as always, probably even more so.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s shoulders sagged with relief.</p><p>Leaning forward, Christie kissed his cheek, then walked out the front door.</p><p>When she got to her car and opened the driver\u2019s side, she gasped. There, on the seat, lay a single, perfectly shaped, long-stemmed red rose.</p><p>Anger rushed through her. She snatched up the rose and marched across the driveway to the garage. James used to live in the apartment above; presumably\u2014obviously\u2014he was back. Christie charged up the steps, breathless when she reached the landing.</p><p>Pounding on the door with her fist, she suddenly realized what she\u2019d done but didn\u2019t have time to retreat. James was there, standing in the doorway. Seeing her, he smiled, his eyes warm...and loving.</p><p>Everything she\u2019d intended to say disappeared. Confronting him had been a mistake. A big one.</p><p>The urge to cry nearly overwhelmed her, but thankfully that passed quickly, replaced with a fresh surge of anger. This rose nonsense was a trick he\u2019d played on her before. Every time Teri had sent him to pick her up or drive her home, there\u2019d been a rose on her seat. In the beginning, Christie had thought the flowers were put there by her sister. Not until much later did she learn they were from James.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d His voice was soft, almost a whisper.</p><p>She continued to stare at him but suspected she only looked foolish. Hurling the rose at his feet, she whirled around and stormed back down the stairs, practically stumbling in her haste.</p><p>James followed at a more sedate pace.</p><p>She ran ahead, intent on climbing into her car and speeding away. However, when she went to open the door, she discovered she must have inadvertently locked it. Furious when the door refused to open, she staggered clumsily backward, straight into James\u2019s chest. He caught her by the shoulders.</p><p>She broke away from him, shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, as calm as she was annoyed, \u201cI think about touching you quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t.\u201d Shaking the hair out of her face, she fumbled with her car keys and in her frustration dropped them on the pavement.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d James said politely and bent down to retrieve them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever bring me another rose. Understand?\u201d</p><p>He handed back her keys. \u201cI do understand. Unfortunately I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, force yourself.\u201d Turning away from him, she inserted the key in the lock.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His words were gentle. Sincere.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>This was not supposed to be happening! Her plan was to react to him with cool indifference; instead, he\u2019d flustered her so badly that she was on the verge of weeping, intelligible speech beyond her. Gulping for air, choking, she couldn\u2019t manage a single word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To Christie\u2019s horror, tears rained down her cheeks. Then, all at once, the lump in her throat eased and she could breathe again. And speak again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love you.\u201d She pronounced each syllable emphatically.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She was embarrassed that he could so easily see through her facade. \u201cI admit I did love you at one time, but not anymore,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want.\u201d Unwilling to become involved in a useless verbal exchange, she slipped inside her car and slammed the door. Blinded by tears, she started the engine and backed up without looking behind her. If James was stupid enough not to get out of her way, then it was his own fault if she ran over him.</p><p>Once she got home, it took her a full hour to stop shaking. She paced and chewed her fingernails, a habit she detested. Then she turned on the television and sat down to watch for about thirty seconds before she was on her feet again.</p><p>Sleep was impossible that night.</p><p>She was still working the early shift so she could attend her afternoon business class. The sky was dark when she walked out to the apartment parking lot the next morning. Her breath made small clouds in the chilly air, and she rubbed her bare hands together to chase away the cold.</p> <p>She opened the car door\u2014and when the interior light flashed on she saw another beautiful, long-stemmed red rose.</p><p>Christie closed her eyes in frustration. Then she grabbed the flower, threw it on the ground and stomped all over it.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Grace had been planning this surprise for Olivia for almost two weeks. As soon as she\u2019d mentioned it to Peggy Beldon, Peggy had called Corrie McAfee. Soon Faith was part of the scheme, too. Within a few days Charlotte had spread the word to a number of Olivia\u2019s friends, and Grace had more volunteers than she could use. Olivia was loved by everyone who knew her.</p><p>All they needed was a day without drizzle. In the Pacific Northwest the month of March was notoriously\u2014in a word\u2014wet. Friday morning, however, Grace woke to clear skies and sunshine. After weeks of continual misty rain, this was a welcome change.</p><p>The television weatherman predicted sunshine for the rest of the day, with cloudy skies and rain to follow overnight. Grace figured a few hours of sunshine was enough to accomplish what she had in mind.</p> <p>Reaching for the kitchen phone, she was about to punch in Peggy\u2019s number when Cliff wandered into the kitchen and poured himself a mug of coffee. He\u2019d already been in the barn to feed his horses. He never slept past seven; his horses\u2019 schedule didn\u2019t permit it.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sweetheart,\u201d Cliff said. He took a gulp of coffee, then set his mug down and slipped up behind her to nuzzle her neck.</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she chastised, laughing. \u201cI have to call Peggy.\u201d She breathed in deeply. He smelled of fresh hay and leather, and the combination struck her as immensely virile. These were the scents she associated with her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t complaining last night,\u201d he reminded her as she made her call.</p><p>He had a point. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t on the phone then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Thyme and Tide,\u201d Peggy said with her usual friendliness. She had a gift for making people feel appreciated, even over the phone.</p><p>\u201cMeet me at Olivia\u2019s at eleven,\u201d Grace said, trying to ignore her husband\u2019s roaming hands. \u201cCan you...can you let Corrie know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Peggy told her. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at Ace Hardware in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d That was all Grace could manage with Cliff nibbling on her neck. She sighed with relief as she hung up the phone, then twisted around in her husband\u2019s embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for trouble, Cliff Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He kissed her soundly on the lips.</p><p>Grace loved his playfulness and responded in full measure.</p><p>After a few minutes, Cliff released her but his eyes were still closed. \u201cYou make me mighty glad I\u2019m a married man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now hold that thought until I get home later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Grace opened the refrigerator and took out a small container of yogurt. That, together with coffee, would constitute her breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you and Peggy?\u201d he asked. He got the peanut-butter jar and dropped two slices of whole-wheat bread into the toaster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Olivia, remember?\u201d</p><p>When he seemed uncertain, she explained. \u201cA few of us are getting together and planting flowers in Olivia\u2019s yard. It\u2019s sort of a get-well-soon bouquet on a larger scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember now. But isn\u2019t it a bit early to be planting flowers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSome varieties do well in this weather, and when April comes they\u2019ll be in full bloom.\u201d</p><p>His toast popped up and Cliff set both pieces on the counter, slathering them with a thick coating of peanut butter.</p><p>Grace opened the cupboard and pointedly handed him a plate.</p><p>He accepted it with a lopsided grin. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Leaning against the counter, Cliff took a bite of his breakfast while Grace retrieved a spoon from the cutlery drawer and sat at the table. Years ago, she\u2019d read a diet book that said never to eat standing up. She\u2019d followed that advice ever since.</p><p>\u201cBack to Olivia,\u201d Cliff continued. \u201cShe\u2019s getting through this cancer ordeal, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, but it\u2019s really too soon to tell. I thought this would lift her spirits. She\u2019s gone through a rough patch, and I figured she could use a bit of cheering up.\u201d According to Jack, the second and third sessions of chemo had been harder on her than the first.</p><p>\u201cPeggy and Corrie wanted to help,\u201d Grace went on, \u201cand then Faith joined in. Charlotte\u2019s going to bring us all lunch.\u201d</p><p>Cliff pulled out a chair and sat down across from her. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace dismissed his praise with a shake of her head. \u201cOlivia\u2019s my best friend. This is the very least I can do for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help, too,\u201d Cliff offered.</p><p>She smiled gratefully at his willingness to pitch in. \u201cThanks, honey, but I think we have it covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but let me know if there\u2019s anything you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised, finishing her yogurt. She deposited the container in the garbage and started to leave when Cliff stopped her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you let Jack in on this plan of yours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Actually, she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll take care of that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>By nine-thirty, Grace and her accomplices met at the local Ace Hardware next to the craft store. Peggy arrived in her pickup, with Corrie sitting in the front seat beside her. Faith had come in her own vehicle and Charlotte was waiting in the parking lot, along with Ben.</p><p>When Grace parked next to her friend\u2019s truck, Peggy climbed down and hugged her. \u201cBob built four flower boxes for Olivia\u2019s front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a sweetheart,\u201d Grace said delightedly.</p><p>\u201cRoy wanted to contribute, too,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cSo he painted them. They\u2019re white, and they really look nice\u2014I know Olivia\u2019s going to be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte has so much food in the backseat, she could feed an entire navy fleet,\u201d Ben told her.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that, Ben Rhodes?\u201d Charlotte muttered. \u201cI just hope I brought enough. After all that physical labor, these girls are going to be hungry.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the store, they each grabbed a cart. After they\u2019d chosen their supplies and selected a variety of seedlings, they loaded everything into Peggy\u2019s truck. Then they set off en masse.</p><p>The caravan got to Olivia\u2019s home on Lighthouse Road just before ten-thirty. Jack met them on the front porch. \u201cHi, everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it Cliff got hold of you?\u201d Grace asked, hurrying up the walkway to meet him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a terrific idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Olivia know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d let you tell her.\u201d</p><p>Grace ran up the porch steps. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing today?\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated. \u201cShe had a rough night.\u201d</p><p>Grace suspected Olivia had gone through a lot of those recently. When they\u2019d spoken on the phone yesterday, Olivia had sounded tired. The last chemo had weakened her, left her exhausted.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cI think you\u2019re already doing it.\u201d</p><p>Grace walked past Jack and into the house. \u201cOlivia,\u201d she called out, her voice echoing through the living room. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack here.\u201d She heard Olivia\u2019s thin, weak voice from down the hallway.</p><p>Grace found her in the back bedroom, where Olivia had set up a sewing machine. She\u2019d decided to make a quilt for her oldest granddaughter; she\u2019d been working on it for weeks, doing a little each day until she was too tired to continue. The project had given her purpose and helped take her mind off what she was enduring.</p><p>She sat at the sewing machine, pale and slumped. Grace struggled to hide her reaction. Olivia\u2019s bald head glistened in the light and around her shoulders she wore a prayer shawl knit by one of the ladies from church.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell me you were coming by?\u201d Olivia asked in puzzlement, as if she must have forgotten. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, why are you dressed like that?\u201d She gestured at Grace\u2019s torn jeans and faded Mariners sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cCome outside and see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather show than tell,\u201d Grace persisted.</p><p>Olivia got slowly to her feet, correcting her balance as she did, then trailed Grace into the front room. The door was wide open.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out here?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cCome and see.\u201d Grace ushered her out. On the front lawn, pitchforks and shovels in hand, stood Peggy, Corrie and Faith. They\u2019d emptied the truck bed; boxes of annuals and perennials lay spread about the lawn.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone doing with all those flowers?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t guess?\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked at Grace for an explanation. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to spruce up your yard and bring a bit of spring,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Olivia blinked rapidly, but couldn\u2019t fend off the tears that filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cComing through!\u201d Jack said, carrying a huge box from the trunk of Charlotte and Ben\u2019s car, Ben on his heels with an equally large carton. Both were packed with containers and covered bowls.</p><p>\u201cYour mother provided lunch.\u201d</p><p>Olivia seemed to have trouble speaking. \u201cOh...oh, my goodness,\u201d she finally murmured. \u201cWhose idea was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think?\u201d Jack said, joining them on the porch. He slid one arm around Olivia\u2019s thin shoulders and drew her close.</p><p>\u201cGrace. Oh, Grace.\u201d Olivia reached for her hand and squeezed tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, go back inside where it\u2019s warm,\u201d Grace said urgently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got things to do out here. We\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re done so you can inspect our work.\u201d</p><p>Olivia dashed away tears and nodded.</p><p>As soon as she was safely back in the house, Grace and company began their task. With everyone pitching in, it took only an hour to get the flower beds weeded and planted.</p><p>Peggy, an experienced gardener, turned the soil and added mulch before Corrie inserted the tender plants into the rich-looking earth.</p> <p>With Jack\u2019s assistance, Grace and Faith set the flower boxes on the ledge around the front porch and arranged ivy and pansies in each.</p><p>Charlotte and Ben were inside, getting everything ready for lunch.</p><p>Just as they broke off before going in to eat, Sheriff Davis\u2019s patrol car turned the corner and stopped directly across the street. He got out, strolling toward them. \u201cI received word of a disturbance on Lighthouse Road,\u201d he said in mock-serious tones.</p><p>Everyone laughed, but although he\u2019d addressed the whole group, his eyes sought out Faith. Grace glanced over at her companion, whose face was flushed with what Grace assumed was pleasure.</p><p>The last she\u2019d heard, they\u2019d ended their relationship. Judging by Faith\u2019s heightened color and the intense look in Troy\u2019s eyes, there\u2019d been some kind of reconciliation. However, neither seemed prepared to speak.</p> <p>Grace thought it was time to intervene. \u201cHello, Sheriff,\u201d she said, pulling off her gloves. \u201cWhat can we do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came by to see if there was any way I could help. I, uh, heard about what you\u2019re doing and I\u2019d like to be part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got everything under control, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were about to stop for lunch,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCare to join us?\u201d</p><p>Troy hung back. \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s enough?\u201d he asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte did the cooking,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cSo, trust me, there\u2019s more than enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that case, thanks. I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Grace said with genuine happiness\u2014a feeling visibly shared by Faith. She wondered what had happened to change things between those two.</p><p>They took turns washing up. By the time they were all finished, Charlotte invited them into the dining room to eat. Grace smiled at her yellow apron with its sunflower-shaped bib.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re serving buffet style,\u201d she announced, waving her arms expansively.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this,\u201d Olivia said, standing next to her mother. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted you to know how much we care,\u201d Peggy said, plate in hand as she circled the table. \u201cWow, look at this fabulous food.\u201d There were three different kinds of salads, deviled eggs and freshly baked bread with ham, turkey and cheese slices for sandwiches. Charlotte had also included canned goods from her garden\u2014sweet pickles, dill pickles, pickled beets, plus jams, jellies, peaches and pears.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, I nearly forgot,\u201d Grace said. She hurried to the door. \u201cI left something in the car. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Grace returned two minutes later, carrying a pie box. \u201cGoldie sent this over from the Pancake Palace.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia\u2019s face broke into a delighted smile. \u201cCoconut cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>They served themselves and sat in a circle around the room, balancing their plates on their laps.</p><p>\u201cI feel like the luckiest woman alive,\u201d Olivia said, once more sounding close to tears.</p><p>\u201cWe love you and want to see you well again,\u201d Corrie told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd back in the courthouse where you belong,\u201d Sheriff Davis added.</p><p>He\u2019d taken the chair beside Faith\u2019s.</p><p>Grace was startled by a sudden knock at the door; before Jack could get up to open it, in walked Cliff, Bob Beldon and Roy McAfee.</p><p>\u201cI hoped we\u2019d timed it so we\u2019d be here for lunch,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourselves, boys,\u201d Charlotte said. She stood and got them each a plate and a napkin, while Jack and Ben brought out three chairs from the kitchen. The new arrivals filled their plates and joined the circle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever be able to thank everyone,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need any thanks,\u201d Grace told her. \u201cWe wanted to do this. In fact, it\u2019s been in the planning stages for weeks\u2014I actually had to turn people down. So many of your friends wanted to contribute. You are loved, Olivia, and this is just our attempt to let you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve done a more than adequate job....\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked around the room, her gaze resting on each one in turn. She wiped the tears from her cheeks and smiled tremulously at Grace. \u201cI\u2019ll have a piece of that coconut cream pie now.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cI got a job!\u201d Mary Jo\u2019s excited voice burst over Mack\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>He turned away from the other men in the break room at the fire station and concentrated on his phone. He hadn\u2019t expected a call from Mary Jo and it jolted him, since they almost always communicated by texting. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d He mentally reviewed their past messages and he couldn\u2019t recall her mentioning another job interview.</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have phoned you at work, but I\u2019m so thrilled I can hardly sit still. A job changes everything.\u201d</p><p>He assumed the job was in Seattle, and his heart sank. The interview with Will Jefferson hadn\u2019t led to employment; the owner of the Harbor Street Art Gallery had only been able to offer a part-time position. Will couldn\u2019t tell her when the job would become full-time\u2014\u201ceventually\u201d was the most he could promise\u2014so Mary Jo felt she had to pass. Mack didn\u2019t blame her, although he\u2019d been disappointed.</p><p>Meeting Will Jefferson had given her confidence, and she\u2019d decided to start applying elsewhere, presumably in Seattle; she hadn\u2019t referred to any particular places.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your job,\u201d he said, trying to hide his own lack of enthusiasm. Ever since he\u2019d talked to Mary Jo about moving, he\u2019d created the ideal scenario in his mind. He pictured Mary Jo and Noelle living next door to him and imagined the three of them spending time together. A lot of time...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be working in an attorney\u2019s office,\u201d Mary Jo was saying, \u201cwhich I thought would be perfect, because, well...you know?\u201d</p><p>This seemed to indicate that she\u2019d have a built-in resource should David Rhodes try to interfere with her and Noelle.</p><p>\u201cThe money isn\u2019t as much as I could make in Seattle, but the cost of living in Cedar Cove is quite a bit less, right?\u201d</p><p>It was 4:00 p.m., and the shift change was taking place as they spoke. Mack waved to his friends, cell phone to his ear, and started out of the station house. \u201cWait!\u201d Not until he was close to his car did it hit him. \u201cAre you saying you have a job here\u2014in town? In Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sounded surprised by his question, as if he should know. \u201cI\u2019ll be working for Allan Harris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMocha Mama\u2019s,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m celebrating with a latte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d Five, if he could manage it.</p><p>Mack snapped his phone shut and trotted the last few steps to his car. He\u2019d had plans but they could wait; seeing Mary Jo was more important. His next shift at the fire station wasn\u2019t until Friday, which gave him two full days to finish painting both units. Once that was accomplished, he\u2019d be all set to rent out the other half of the duplex. He\u2019d already moved in, but for the moment was more or less living in chaos.</p><p>He knew exactly who he wanted as a tenant. Mary Jo would need a place to live\u2014and what better place than right next door to him? He\u2019d mentioned it once but in a vague way, not identifying himself as the owner. He didn\u2019t feel completely comfortable with the deception, but wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react if she knew. Mary Jo was cautious and uncertain about men, all men. Given her history, Mack could understand it. He\u2019d like to meet David Rhodes in a back alley someday, but that wasn\u2019t likely to happen; for one thing, the guy was obviously avoiding Cedar Cove.</p><p>Mack drove down the hill to Mocha Mama\u2019s and parked nearby. As he hurried inside, through yet another light rain, he saw Mary Jo sitting by the window, sipping her latte. She smiled when he walked in.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, brushing the moisture from his coat and hair.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she returned, grinning widely, her happiness unmistakable\u2014an uncomplicated joy he hadn\u2019t seen since the night Noelle was born.</p><p>He suddenly realized Noelle was nowhere in sight. \u201cWhere\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine is watching her this afternoon. This is the first time I\u2019ve been away from Noelle, and I feel like part of me is missing. Jenna said I have to stop phoning, because whenever I do I wake the baby.\u201d</p><p>Mack glanced over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll get an espresso and join you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>The young man he recognized as Shaw was behind the counter. They exchanged greetings, then Shaw brewed Mack his double shot. Back at Mary Jo\u2019s table, Mack sat across from her, draping his coat on the empty chair beside him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, leaning toward her. \u201cTell me how you came to hear about the job with the attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly Jordan told me Mr. Harris was looking for an assistant and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, who\u2019s Kelly Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace Harding\u2019s daughter. Don\u2019t you remember, Grace was the one who suggested Kelly as a possible day-care provider? It was the day we met at the library.\u201d She smiled. \u201cKelly\u2019s little girl, Emma Grace, is starting to walk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He had a dim memory of the conversation; he\u2019d been too occupied with Noelle to pay much attention. \u201cSo you found someone to do day care before you had a job? That was smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I had to be okay with whoever was going to be taking care of Noelle before I could even think about employment.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMen just don\u2019t consider things like that,\u201d she went on. \u201cI know Linc didn\u2019t, but then my big brother can be pretty dense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, your big brother. How\u2019s Linc doing these days?\u201d Mary Jo\u2019s brother was overprotective to the point of obtrusiveness, and she resented his domineering attitude. Mack sympathized with her, but he also understood Linc\u2019s point of view.</p><p>Mary Jo stirred her latte. \u201cAs you might\u2019ve guessed, Linc\u2019s not very happy with me at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d But of course he had guessed.... With a job in Cedar Cove, she\u2019d presumably be moving away from her brother\u2019s house\u2014and his control.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for me to leave Seattle,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cAccording to him, family should stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that, too,\u201d Mack told her, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to live in the same house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed. \u201cLinc doesn\u2019t understand why I feel he\u2019s suffocating me. He seems to assume that the minute I\u2019m out of his sight, some terrible fate will befall me.\u201d</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t bother to remind Mary Jo that she\u2019d met David Rhodes while living with her three brothers. He wondered where Linc had been then. He suspected she hadn\u2019t told her brothers about David until she was already pregnant.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want to talk about Linc,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cNot when there\u2019s so much else to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me.\u201d Mack struck a relaxed pose, leaning back in the chair and stretching out his legs.</p> <p>\u201cDid I tell you the attorney is Allan Harris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d He frowned as he tried to remember where he\u2019d heard the name. \u201cOf course! His assistant\u2019s the one who was arrested just before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mary Jo\u2019s hand flew to her throat. \u201cMr. Harris didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. His legal assistant stole jewelry from one of Harris\u2019s clients. Apparently, Geoff\u2014that was his name, Geoff Duncan\u2014tried to frame Pastor Flemming for the theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Mary Jo looked thoughtful. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t apply for the job because I don\u2019t have any paralegal background. But Mr. Harris said he wanted to hire someone who was willing to do on-the-job training. I think this is how he plans to keep a close eye on his employee. I\u2019m just grateful he\u2019s willing to give me a chance. He said he\u2019d interviewed quite a few candidates and felt I\u2019d work out the best.\u201d There was a sparkle of excitement in her eyes. \u201cI interrupted your story,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized as he was by her, Mack couldn\u2019t recall what he\u2019d been talking about.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harris\u2019s assistant,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Geoff Duncan. Fortunately, Sheriff Davis saw through his ploy. According to my dad, Allan Harris was pretty shocked. He didn\u2019t have a clue Geoff would do anything like this. The crime was bad enough. Implicating an innocent man makes it that much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would his assistant do something so stupid? He was bound to get caught sooner or later, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Mack shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure. The gossip is that he was trying to impress his fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would stealing stuff impress her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Lori Bellamy\u2019s from a wealthy family. The Bellamys own quite a bit of property on the Kitsap Peninsula. Geoff must\u2019ve got in a credit crunch and didn\u2019t want to tell Lori he couldn\u2019t afford the things she wanted and then panicked. I guess he wanted to act as if he had the same kind of money she did. Maybe he was afraid that if he couldn\u2019t keep her in the lifestyle she was used to, she\u2019d leave him. I heard that he pawned the jewelry for cash\u2014and now he\u2019s behind bars.\u201d Mack had discussed the case with his older sister, Gloria, who worked for the sheriff\u2019s office. He\u2019d only learned of Gloria\u2019s existence a few years ago and had been making an effort to develop a relationship with her. Since he and Gloria both lived in town now, they managed to have dinner or drinks at least once a month. Despite that, he still felt a reserve in her. A hesitation that was difficult to explain. He hadn\u2019t said anything to his parents but couldn\u2019t help wondering if they\u2019d noticed it, too.</p><p>\u201cSo when do you start work?\u201d he asked Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>That gave her less than a week to get all her arrangements in order. \u201cNot a lot of time,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe next thing I need to do is find somewhere to live.\u201d</p><p>Mack wondered if she remembered the suggestion he\u2019d made that February afternoon at the library, and suspected she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI can always commute from Seattle with Noelle if I have to,\u201d she was saying, \u201cbut that would make for a very long day.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo had just handed him the perfect intro. His one fear was that if she knew he owned the duplex she might be leery of renting from him. A landlord-tenant relationship could complicate things.</p><p>He decided to gauge the situation with a comment. \u201cI, uh, might have mentioned it, but I recently moved into a duplex and the second half is empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He forged ahead. \u201cThe rent\u2019s reasonable, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...reasonable?\u201d</p><p>He named a figure that was about half the going rate, which was what he speculated she\u2019d be able to afford.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Mary Jo sat up straight. \u201cThere must be something wrong with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Oh, it could use a bit of paint and cleaning, but basically that\u2019s about it.\u201d Then, pressing his luck, he added, \u201cThe owner\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s currently...out of town, but you can meet him later if you like. I\u2019m acting as his manager.\u201d That was an inspired idea, he thought, and not a lie. He was the manager. And this conveniently \u201cout-of-town\u201d owner would appear sometime in the future. Mack had no intention of misleading her for long; his objective was to get her moved to Cedar Cove. Once she\u2019d made the transition he\u2019d find a good opportunity to tell her about the \u201cowner.\u201d In the meantime, he\u2019d have her write the rent checks to his accountant, Zachary Cox.</p><p>Nibbling on her lower lip, Mary Jo mulled this over. \u201cWould it be a problem...you know, having me and Noelle next door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA problem?\u201d he repeated. \u201cNot for me. What about you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI think it\u2019d be great. But I wouldn\u2019t want to be a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that happening.\u201d In fact, he had to work at not showing how thrilled he\u2019d be to have Mary Jo and Noelle as his next-door neighbors.</p><p>Mary Jo continued to look speculative as if her instincts were telling her this wasn\u2019t a wise decision.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the duplex?\u201d he asked, hoping to distract her.</p><p>\u201cOh...sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was painting before my shift at the fire station, so it\u2019s pretty messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you painting?\u201d she asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the landlord\u2019s responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally it would be,\u201d Mack said, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cI offered to do it in exchange for a reduction in rent. He, uh, wants first and last months\u2019 upfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that in savings, so I\u2019m not concerned.\u201d</p><p>They finished their drinks and Mack drove Mary Jo past the Senior Center to 1022 Evergreen Place.</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s eyes darted up and down the street. \u201cThis is a nice neighborhood,\u201d she said appreciatively.</p><p>Mack had thought so, too, which was one reason he\u2019d made an offer. This was a good place to raise a family.</p><p>\u201cNow I really don\u2019t understand why the rent\u2019s so low,\u201d Mary Jo said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cLike you said earlier,\u201d he rushed to explain, \u201cthe cost of living is less on this side of Puget Sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea it would be this much less.\u201d</p><p>Mack was beginning to think he might have overdone it. \u201cYou can always check out other rentals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut I like this one.\u201d</p><p>Mack relaxed. \u201cI understand there\u2019s an eligible bachelor in close proximity, too.\u201d The instant the words were out of his mouth, Mack regretted them. Mary Jo was emotionally fragile, and he didn\u2019t want to frighten her off by appearing to pursue anything but friendship. He ignored the reproach that nagged at him\u2014that he was being manipulative.</p><p>In any case, his joke didn\u2019t elicit a response. Instead, Mary Jo stared out the window. After a moment, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be dating anyone for a long while.\u201d</p><p>It was a veiled warning, a signal. He considered offering reassurances, but that would have led to more lies, or half-truths, anyway. So he asked, \u201cWould you like to take a look inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to give her an opportunity to get to know him\u2014and trust him. Living side by side as neighbors and friends was the way to do that. Her brothers weren\u2019t going to appreciate his efforts, but that was their problem.</p><p>Mack helped her down from the truck. \u201cI have the key,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019d be in Unit B.\u201d He opened the door and gestured her inside. A sheet lay across the living room floor with a bucket of paint, a roller and brushes resting next to it. The fresh, clean smell of recently painted walls greeted them. On his mother\u2019s advice, he\u2019d chosen a pale, buttery yellow, which worked with the small rooms yet had a subtle warmth.</p><p>\u201cI only have a few pieces of furniture,\u201d Mary Jo said as she moved from one room to the next. The kitchen was compact but adequate. The two bedrooms were across the hall from each other.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one bath?\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded. \u201cAnd a laundry room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a washer and dryer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey come with the place.\u201d</p><p>Or they would by the time she moved in.</p><p>\u201cI have my bedroom set, of course, and there\u2019s the crib for Noelle and her changing table.\u201d She paused as if calculating what else she could bring. \u201cI have a rocking chair, too, but that\u2019s it in the way of living room furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a television?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo shook her head. \u201cI had an old TV in my room, but it\u2019s not worth taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an extra one you can use.\u201d</p><p>Again Mack saw her hesitate.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer, but I\u2019d rather not do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could sell it to you cheap,\u201d he said impulsively.</p><p>This appeared to interest her. \u201cHow cheap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheap.\u201d He came up with a price he felt she could probably afford. \u201cFifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo laughed. \u201cSold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ve been wanting to get rid of that piece of junk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack!\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you are, buddy.\u201d</p><p>With the easy banter between them, Mack relaxed. \u201cWould you like me to contact the owner and tell him he\u2019s got his second renter?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled over at him. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd listen, don\u2019t worry about me pestering you.\u201d He wanted to make sure Mary Jo understood that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about pestering you.\u201d</p><p>On the contrary, he figured that having Mary Jo and Noelle this close might be the best thing to happen to him in a long, long time.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>When Troy finished shaving on Friday morning, he did something he didn\u2019t usually do\u2014he splashed on a citrus-scented aftershave, hoping the scent would last long enough for Faith to notice later that evening.</p><p>If anyone in the office caught a whiff, he might be teased, but any teasing would be worth the possible return. After several short phone conversations, Faith had finally agreed to have dinner with him and Troy could hardly wait. They had a lot to discuss, but the item at the very top of his list was this purported move. He didn\u2019t want her walking out of his life again, so he had to let her know how he felt in no uncertain terms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Troy was encouraged. He\u2019d come away from each brief conversation with a hopeful feeling. He sensed that she might be willing to start again. Troy assumed that this evening, over dinner, they\u2019d decide once and for all whether to pick up where they\u2019d left off.</p><p>He arrived at the office, his mood still optimistic. It wasn\u2019t long before reality struck its first blow.</p><p>Troy hadn\u2019t been at his desk more than ten minutes when he received a visit from his most recently hired deputy, Gloria Ashton. Gloria was the daughter of private detective Roy McAfee and his wife, although they\u2019d met her only four years ago. Apparently, Roy and Corrie had broken up for a while in college, not knowing Corrie was pregnant. She\u2019d relinquished the baby for adoption.</p><p>Years later, Gloria, now an adult, had sought them out. Troy was astonished by how similar father and daughter were, in personality and in interests. They\u2019d both gone into law enforcement, although Roy had retired from the Seattle police.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Sheriff.\u201d Gloria entered his office, hands clasped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said, gesturing toward one of the visitor chairs.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d She seemed uncomfortable and he wondered why.</p><p>Her shoulders were squared, her back straight and her eyes just managed to avoid his. \u201cI thought I should give you a heads-up about an arrest I made last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d It was obvious that this hadn\u2019t been a routine matter. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Again she avoided eye contact. \u201cI saw a car with a burned-out headlight. When I turned around and followed the vehicle, the driver made an effort to evade me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pulled the car over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She paused. \u201cI quickly assessed that the driver was intoxicated. I asked him to get out of his car and step away from it, which he did without hesitation. After performing the routine checks, I gave him a Breathalyzer test and it showed an alcohol level exceeding .08. I immediately placed him under arrest.\u201d</p><p>So far, this was nothing out of the ordinary and didn\u2019t warrant Troy\u2019s attention. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019ve come to tell me this personally?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded curtly.</p> <p>At that moment it was easy to see that Gloria was Roy McAfee\u2019s daughter. The set of her jaw, the unyielding line of her mouth, was all Roy.</p><p>\u201cThe driver was Mayor Louie Benson.\u201d</p><p>Troy felt like groaning out loud. Well, so be it. The law was the law. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lawyered up right away,\u201d Gloria went on to tell him.</p><p>Troy wouldn\u2019t have expected any less. \u201cHis brother Otto\u2019s an attorney. I imagine Louie has him on speed dial.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cHis attorney met us at the jail.\u201d</p><p>This was awkward, but he\u2019d handled awkward situations before. \u201cI appreciate the advance warning.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze found his and he read the doubt in her eyes. \u201cI wanted you to know....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Mayor Benson point out that he was an elected official or did you recognize him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew who he was as soon as he stepped out of the car and then he told me. The thing is\u2014\u201d She hesitated and then looked away. \u201cHe was belligerent when I first pulled him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d Troy had known Benson for years on a casual basis, although they\u2019d never been close friends. The mayor had been kind when Sandy died and insisted Troy take all the time he needed. To the best of his knowledge, Troy couldn\u2019t remember seeing him with a drink in his hand, not even at the social functions they\u2019d both attended. This behavior seemed completely out of character.</p><p>Gloria appeared to be waiting for Troy to comment. \u201cI came to discuss this with you because I wanted to be sure I\u2019d done the right thing, taking Benson into custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Awkward situation or not, Gloria wasn\u2019t to blame because a local politician hadn\u2019t had the good sense to know when enough was enough. Sometimes people in the public eye felt they\u2019d been awarded some form of entitlement that placed their actions above the law.</p><p>\u201cMayor Benson asked me to cut him some slack.\u201d Gloria clasped and unclasped her hands. \u201cI checked his driving record, and it\u2019s clean. He doesn\u2019t have so much as a parking violation.\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded. Still, that didn\u2019t give him a clear picture. It could mean that in the past Mayor Benson had been granted a free ride or some deputy had conveniently looked the other way.</p><p>Gloria stared down at the floor. \u201cHe said if I issued him a DUI, he\u2019d see to it that I was fired from my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, he threatened you.\u201d Troy had to believe Louie didn\u2019t know what he was saying. He could charge the mayor with a further offense, but he didn\u2019t want to do that, as much for Gloria\u2019s sake as Louie\u2019s.</p><p>Gloria frowned slightly as though she\u2019d never intended to admit this. \u201cI...think he was too drunk to remember everything he said. The thing is, Sheriff, I enjoy working in Cedar Cove and I\u2019d hate this incident to tarnish my career in law enforcement\u2014or worse, end it.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to happen. Not on Troy\u2019s watch, anyway. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about, Ashton. You did your job. If there\u2019s any political flack over this, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He felt, more than saw, his deputy relax.</p><p>\u201cI thought later that I should\u2019ve contacted you at the time of the arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t second-guess yourself. You made the right decision.\u201d Although in retrospect, Troy wished she had called him. It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to the outcome, however. Benson would\u2019ve ended up in jail regardless. But it might have eased Gloria\u2019s mind. Instead, she\u2019d spent a restless night, worrying about Troy\u2019s reaction to the news.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you did your job.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cAren\u2019t you off duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched with a half smile.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I appreciate that you brought this to my attention. I\u2019ll handle it from this point forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The relief in her voice was evident.</p><p>When Gloria had left his office, Troy decided he\u2019d better talk to the mayor immediately; otherwise, this whole affair could blow up in his face. Briefly he wondered if Louie was a secret drinker. In any case, Troy was not the kind of lawman who\u2019d bow to influence or intimidation.</p><p>But the reasons for the mayor\u2019s behavior, whatever they might be, were irrelevant. Louie was in the wrong, no question about it.</p><p>When he called the jail, he discovered that Mayor Benson had been released on his own recognizance.</p><p>Their confrontation wasn\u2019t going to be pleasant. Lately he seemed to be at odds with the mayor over a number of issues. This certainly wouldn\u2019t improve their relationship.</p><p>Troy found Benson in his office at city hall. The mayor glanced up when Troy was announced, then glanced away. He looked dreadful\u2014pale and disheveled with bloodshot eyes. From his appearance, Troy suspected Benson hadn\u2019t had much sleep.</p><p>\u201cYour department seems to enjoy embarrassing me,\u201d Louie said, taking the defensive even before Troy had opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re doing a mighty fine job of that all by yourself,\u201d he countered.</p><p>Louie got up to close his office door. When he turned to face Troy, his mouth was set in a grim line. \u201cI\u2019d like this matter to disappear. I trust you can make that happen.\u201d</p><p>Nope, he couldn\u2019t. \u201cUnfortunately, the outcome is out of my control.\u201d</p><p>It was as if the other man hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cYour deputy\u2019s overzealous. She targeted me because of my position as mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true. Ashton is a good officer. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only fractionally over the legal limit, Sheriff. The officer refused to listen to reason. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to be put in handcuffs and escorted to jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy a fraction of a point,\u201d he said, tapping his desk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who decided you were sober enough to drive. Don\u2019t cast blame other than where it belongs.\u201d After a meaningful pause, he added, \u201cIf you want to make a fuss, perhaps I should mention that not only did you break the law, you threatened one of my officers.\u201d</p><p>The mayor ignored Troy\u2019s comment as he paced, his steps agitated and angry. He seemed to be weighing his options. Finally he sighed, shaking his head. \u201cOkay, whatever. You\u2019re right\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have gotten behind the wheel. I accept full responsibility. Still, once word of this gets out, it could ruin me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Troy wasn\u2019t going to downplay the situation.</p><p>\u201cBut that isn\u2019t your problem, is it?\u201d The question was tossed at him flippantly.</p><p>\u201cHow you cope with the political fallout is up to you.\u201d</p><p>The mayor walked back to his desk and braced his hands against the edge. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I...I don\u2019t drink and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Benson was quiet for a moment, then looked up at Troy. \u201cDo you have any suggestions on how to deal with this?\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t wait for an invitation; he sat down and met the other man\u2019s eyes without flinching. \u201cI believe honesty really is the best policy. Admit that you made a mistake and that you\u2019ll take responsibility for your actions.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the mayor sank into his leather chair. \u201cThat\u2019s harder than you think,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt would be helpful for the public to know how easily something like this can happen.\u201d Troy frequently dealt with similar cases. A couple of after-work beers or glasses of wine in quick succession, and then people would drive home, unaware of how much the alcohol had affected them. Mayor Benson wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Apparently he didn\u2019t like Troy\u2019s advice. Frowning, he said, \u201cSo now you want me to turn this into a public service announcement.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t feel that was worthy of a response. \u201cHowever you approach it with your constituents is up to you,\u201d he said dispassionately.</p><p>Louie\u2019s face seemed to pale even more. \u201cYou\u2019re right...it\u2019s just that...\u201d He left the rest unsaid. Sighing again, he hung his head. \u201cI guess the best way to deal with this fiasco is to face it head-on. I\u2019ll contact Jack Griffin at the paper and give him the story before he prints it on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart idea.\u201d Jack, the Chronicle\u2019s editor, was a good person for the mayor to talk to, for more than the obvious reason. Jack was a recovering alcoholic with quite a few years of sobriety. If the mayor had a drinking problem, there was no one better than Jack Griffin to confide in.</p><p>The two men parted amicably enough. The arrest was acutely embarrassing for Louie and at the same time it might be the wake-up call he needed. What happened now was entirely up to Louie Benson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After that bumpy start to the day, Troy was hoping his afternoon would run smoothly. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t to be.</p><p>Faith\u2019s call came in at close to one o\u2019clock. Troy couldn\u2019t disguise his pleasure in hearing from her. \u201cFaith! This is a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she said and hardly sounded like herself, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to have to cancel our dinner date.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s spirits did an automatic nosedive. \u201cOh?\u201d He did his best to seem nonchalant, as though this was a minor disappointment. It wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone slashed my tires last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Troy gritted his teeth as anger surged through him. \u201cDid you report it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good will that do?\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ve reported the vandalism before and nothing seems to help.\u201d</p><p>Troy was too agitated to discuss this over the phone. \u201cI\u2019m on my way over to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d He hung up, grabbed his hat and coat and was out the door. Although this wasn\u2019t technically an emergency, he turned on his lights but not the siren. He wished he could determine why Faith had been targeted\u2014and how to stop it. But whatever it took, he was determined to put an end to this.</p><p>When Faith opened the door, she looked pale and drawn, with dark shadows beneath her eyes. He wanted to pull her into his arms and comfort her but reminded himself that he was there as a professional, not as her friend\u2014or would-be lover.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said in his most authoritative voice.</p><p>Faith led him to her living room and slumped down on the couch. \u201cI was supposed to go to work this morning, but when I went out to the car, I saw that...that my tires were slashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll four?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>This was no small expense.</p><p>\u201cI called the clinic and told them I couldn\u2019t come in today. Then I contacted the auto service. They had to tow my car to the tire place.... I won\u2019t have it back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Faith.\u201d As the town\u2019s sheriff, Troy felt responsible. \u201cDid the neighbors see anything?\u201d</p><p>Faith shook her head. \u201cI already asked. It must\u2019ve happened after midnight, which is when the McCormicks next door went to bed. No one saw or heard a thing.\u201d</p><p>Troy closed his eyes in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI was so upset, I phoned my daughter, and Jay Lynn insisted I spend the weekend with her. Frankly, Troy, I need to get away. I\u2019m at the end of my rope. Someone doesn\u2019t want me here and after today...after this morning, all I can say is I don\u2019t want to be here, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do. I made a huge mistake the day I moved to Cedar Cove.\u201d</p> <p>His hand tightened on his hat brim, crushing the felt. \u201cIt was exactly the opposite for me. It was one of the best days of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently you have a short memory,\u201d she chided, then smiled weakly in his direction. \u201cI was shocked when the Seattle house sold so quickly\u2014but even more shocked when you said we shouldn\u2019t see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>If Troy could take back those words, if he could unsay them, he would. Breaking off the relationship with Faith had been one of the biggest blunders of his adult life, and he\u2019d paid for it every day since.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Faith said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rehash old arguments. I\u2019m tired and upset and a weekend away will do me good.\u201d</p><p>Troy agreed, although he would\u2019ve liked it a whole lot better if she\u2019d decided to visit her son instead of Jay Lynn. Scott, at least, lived in town.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>She gazed up at him, her bruised-looking eyes meeting his. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyone can do. The best thing for me is to leave town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he objected loudly.</p><p>\u201cFor the weekend,\u201d she amended. \u201cWhat happens after that can wait. Now isn\u2019t a good time for either of us to make a decision about...whether we have a future together.\u201d</p><p>Troy disagreed with her. He wanted Faith with him. He wanted to marry her. But first he had to convince her that they did have a future together. A future in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Linc Wyse was not in favor of this idea of Mary Jo\u2019s. If his sister wanted to move out of the house, fine; she was free to do so whenever she wished. That said, in his opinion the timing didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>As a young mother, Mary Jo needed to be home with her baby. It went without saying that she resented his attitude\u2014but then that was par for the course. He knew that by today\u2019s standards it was perfectly normal for a mother to return to work three months after giving birth. Their own mother had been a stay-at-home mom and he had strong feelings on the subject. Okay, maybe that wasn\u2019t a popular stance and it certainly wasn\u2019t one his sister shared. When he became a husband and father\u2014he instantly dismissed that thought. Marriage wasn\u2019t likely to happen for someone like him, not with his old-fashioned views. That saddened him but he might as well accept reality.</p><p>He\u2019d found it more difficult than he would\u2019ve believed to watch Mary Jo pack up and move across Puget Sound. Despite that, he rather liked Cedar Cove. He\u2019d driven all around the area on Christmas Eve, searching for Mary Jo, and\u2014for the most part\u2014he\u2019d had a good impression of it. His recent visits had confirmed that. It was a nice little town, welcoming and friendly. The only drawback was the distance. In the past week alone, he\u2019d made four trips to the Kitsap Peninsula to see his sister and the baby. To check up on both of them.</p><p>According to Mary Jo, not a single one of those trips had been necessary. But Linc wouldn\u2019t sleep at night if he hadn\u2019t personally seen to his sister\u2019s and niece\u2019s well-being. He\u2019d always taken family responsibility seriously.</p><p>It only seemed right that he visit Noelle on her very first St. Patrick\u2019s Day. Their family background\u2014like that of so many Americans\u2014was motley, with English, French and German that he knew of. He was sure there must be some Irish in there, too. Just in case, he\u2019d bought her a plush leprechaun doll. But he had an even better excuse for this visit; he\u2019d located a new sofa and chair in a closeout deal. He\u2019d wanted to bring them himself, which saved delivery fees. The truth was, he looked forward to surprising his sister.</p><p>Mary Jo had him pegged as some sort of ogre and that just wasn\u2019t true. He hoped this peace offering would help.</p><p>When he parked in front of the duplex, he saw Mack McAfee on a ladder, cleaning out the gutters. Linc hadn\u2019t quite made up his mind about McAfee. Mack had been with Mary Jo during the most critical time of her life. Still, having him live right next door was a little too convenient. Linc wasn\u2019t sure he approved.</p><p>He\u2019d made the mistake of voicing his concerns, and Mary Jo had nearly bitten his head off. He\u2019d kept his trap shut ever since. Apparently, when it came to McAfee, his sister didn\u2019t care for Linc\u2019s advice. Fine. He\u2019d keep his opinions to himself\u2014and keep an eye on McAfee.</p><p>\u201cHey, Linc,\u201d Mack called out. He climbed down from the ladder and thrust out his hand, which Linc willingly shook.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose my sister\u2019s home?\u201d Linc already knew the answer. He asked because he wanted to know how closely the firefighter kept tabs on his little sister. This was one of those catch-22 situations. He wanted Mack to watch over her. At the same time, he wanted to be sure the guy wasn\u2019t paying her more attention than warranted.</p><p>It was a thin line, and Linc planned on being around often enough to see that Mack didn\u2019t cross it.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you brought her some furniture.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least he was observant, Linc thought a little sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll be pleased with the sofa,\u201d Mack was saying.</p><p>Linc hoped so. Hard to tell with Mary Jo. Or with any woman, he realized. He simply didn\u2019t understand women or know how to communicate with them. Over the years he\u2019d had a number of relationships, all of which had come to an abrupt end. The way he figured it, the fault must lie with him. Mary Jo had often told him he was too domineering, too bullheaded and a chauvinist to boot. He\u2019d honestly tried to change, tried to be more sensitive, but that hadn\u2019t worked, either. As far as he could tell, he was destined to remain unmarried. Until Noelle, the fact that he\u2019d never have kids hadn\u2019t bothered him.</p><p>It did now.</p><p>He loved his niece more than he ever could have foreseen. With Mary Jo and Noelle living in Cedar Cove, the house was strangely quiet and empty. Mel and Ned led busy lives; they were often out. They didn\u2019t have the problems Linc did with women. They were both in relationships and he assumed they\u2019d be married soon.</p><p>When Linc wasn\u2019t at the house, he was at work. He ran the car repair shop his father had opened nearly fifty years earlier. Because he was the oldest, he considered it his duty to hold the family business, as well as the family, together. Ever since their parents\u2019 deaths, he\u2019d done his utmost to manage the shop, keep the peace and make sure everyone was okay.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mary Jo doing?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me directly?\u201d she said. She stood in the doorway of her half of the duplex, arms crossed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m living in China, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d For fear he might say or do something else to upset her, Linc shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cSince you asked, I\u2019m doing very well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Noelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>Linc cleared his throat and turned to Mack; the return stare told him he was on his own.</p><p>Gesturing to his truck, Linc said, \u201cI brought you a housewarming gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...it seemed you could use more than one.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cThat was nice of you.\u201d</p><p>Linc felt the tension ease from his shoulders and the back of his neck.</p><p>He handed over the stuffed leprechaun, which was added to Noelle\u2019s growing pile of toys. Then, with Mack\u2019s assistance, he hauled the sofa and chair into Mary Jo\u2019s living room. She indicated where she wanted them, then changed her mind not once but twice. He wasn\u2019t annoyed, and neither was Mack.</p><p>Noelle had been asleep but woke shortly after Mary Jo was satisfied with the arrangement of the furniture. Sitting down on the new chair, Linc held his niece, who smelled deliciously of baby powder and shampoo, and kissed her forehead. She yawned and arched her back, raising her elbows as she did. Babies fascinated him. At first, when Mary Jo had brought Noelle home, he\u2019d been terrified of hurting her\u2014dropping her or squeezing too tight. Gradually he\u2019d become more relaxed around the infant. It helped that she\u2019d outgrown the colic. As it was now, he could hold this little one for hours and be content.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to feed her?\u201d Mary Jo asked Linc, after seeing Mack to the door.</p><p>\u201cI thought...you know, breasts...\u201d The words seemed to stumble all over themselves and he knew he was blushing furiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince I work now, I\u2019m using a breast pump.\u201d</p><p>Some subjects were best not discussed between sister and brother. Breast pumps fell into that category. \u201cI...think maybe you should feed her.\u201d He knew he sounded gruff but couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Noelle smiled up at him and he smiled back. He dared not look at his sister as he muttered, \u201cAre you seeing a lot of that neighbor of yours?\u201d</p><p>There was a short hesitation. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p> <p>Linc shrugged, grateful she hadn\u2019t taken offense. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he seems to be around every time I stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives next door. What do you expect?\u201d</p><p>Her reply held an edge that warned him against pursuing this line of questioning further. Difficult though it was, Linc didn\u2019t ask anything else. If his sister did become involved with her neighbor, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. As long as Mack understood that Linc wouldn\u2019t allow another man to take advantage of her.</p><p>He was well aware that Mary Jo would never talk to him again if he asked McAfee what his intentions were. Still, Linc wanted to know.</p><p>Mary Jo offered him dinner but he declined. He\u2019d stayed too long already. It was time to hit the road.</p> <p>After thanking him for the living room set, Mary Jo walked Linc to his truck. \u201cDrive carefully, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cYou know, don\u2019t you, that it\u2019s not necessary to check up on me every day?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged in response.</p><p>\u201cOr even every other day.\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to hold the family together anymore, Linc. We\u2019re all adults. And we\u2019re all capable of making our own decisions, learning from our own mistakes. You\u2019re sweet to want to protect me, but it really isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Then, to his utter amazement, Mary Jo rose up on tiptoe, placed her hands on either side of his face and kissed his cheek.</p><p>As he drove away, Linc considered what she\u2019d said. The truth was, he realized his sister was right. Mel and Ned didn\u2019t like him looking over their shoulders, either, any more than Mary Jo did.</p><p>Rather than take the ferry home, Linc decided to drive across the Narrows Bridge. He hadn\u2019t driven more than a mile down the freeway when he saw a car parked on the side of the road. The vehicle\u2019s taillights flashed, indicating some kind of mechanical problem. A woman stood helplessly outside, obviously waiting for someone to stop.</p><p>Cars zoomed past. Linc didn\u2019t want to stop. He\u2019d had a long day, it was now dark, and he was tired. Besides, he had a ninety-minute drive ahead of him. As he neared the woman in distress, Linc knew that he couldn\u2019t in good conscience drive by.</p><p>Parking his truck, he climbed down and walked toward the woman. She was delicate-looking, blond, petite. Smaller even than Mary Jo, who stood five-three.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The woman stared up at him as if he\u2019d stepped out of a Friday the 13th movie. Her eyes widened in what appeared to be genuine panic.</p> <p>Linc supposed he could be intimidating, although what she expected him to do to her on the freeway with cars barreling past, he couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Linc Wyse and I\u2019m a mechanic,\u201d he explained, hoping an introduction would put her at ease.</p><p>\u201cIt...just stopped running. I was on my way to Gig Harbor and out of the blue, my car just stopped. I was fortunate to get it off the road before it went completely dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call Triple A?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, no...Well, yes, I did and learned that my membership had expired. I\u2014I\u2019ve gone through a bit of emotional turmoil lately and it must\u2019ve slipped through the cracks.\u201d She seemed ready to break into tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear any of this. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She was right about that. He wasn\u2019t interested in her personal problems. \u201cDid the car choke before it quit running?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI tried to look under the hood, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to open it.\u201d</p><p>Typical. Most women barely had a clue about the fundamentals of operating a vehicle.</p><p>He must have given some indication of his thoughts because she added, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, you know.\u201d</p><p>Linc knew better than to respond to that comment. He leaned in and released the hood lever, then walked around to the front of the vehicle. He raised the hood and quickly checked all the easy fixes.</p><p>The woman stood next to him and studied the engine. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite true,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon? What isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing I said about being stupid.\u201d She gazed past him to the traffic streaming by. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very kind, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Praise disconcerted him, so he ignored her remark. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with your engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening now, on top of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything else?\u201d Linc wondered if he was going to regret asking.</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9. Geoff. Ex-fianc\u00e9, I should say. He\u2019s a thief.\u201d She bit down hard on her lower lip. \u201cI broke off the engagement, and my family\u2019s upset\u2014not because I canceled the wedding but because I didn\u2019t have the sense to know that the man I loved is completely unsuitable as a husband and a failure as a human being.\u201d She expelled a deep sigh. \u201cI apologize. None of this has to do with my car. Frankly I have no idea what I would\u2019ve done if you hadn\u2019t stopped. Calling my father wasn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time Linc had taken a good look at her...and he saw that she was even lovelier than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know someone and you think you love him and then you learn the truth and it\u2019s just so...so heart-wrenching to discover that the person you loved isn\u2019t the person you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Linc started to move away from the vehicle. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you gassed up?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cYou think I might be out of gas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get in and see.\u201d The woman seemed incapable of clear thought. Linc slid into the driver\u2019s seat and turned the key. Sure enough, the needle pointed to empty.</p><p>Apparently she was going through some sort of emotional breakdown. Lucky him that he\u2019d stumbled onto her path. This was what he got for playing the Good Samaritan. No good deed goes unpunished, and all that.</p><p>The woman slipped into the passenger seat next to him and shut the door. She began to tremble with what he assumed was the effort not to weep. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re being kind and I\u2019m being hysterical. How stupid of me not to know I\u2019d run out of gas.\u201d She closed her eyes and lowered her head.</p><p>\u201cIt happens to the best of us,\u201d Linc said in what he hoped was a comforting tone.</p><p>She turned to him with her nose red and her eyes swimming with tears. \u201cDo you ever feel that nothing you do is right?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Despite the fact that he felt as if he\u2019d stepped into the middle of a soap opera, Linc nodded.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>This was becoming awkward. \u201cI have a gas can in the back of my truck,\u201d he said, eager now to be on his way. \u201cI\u2019ll drive to a gas station\u2014pick up a couple of gallons. That should be enough to get you wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...Do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I?\u201d</p><p>Linc\u2019s mind darted in ten different directions at once. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d offered, any more than he could believe she\u2019d asked.</p><p>To avoid wearing down her battery, he turned off the ignition and passed her the car keys.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Lori Bellamy,\u201d she said and held out her hand.</p><p>He shook it, almost shocked by the softness of her skin against his calloused fingers. \u201cLinc Wyse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Linc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d The awkwardness returned, the same unease he experienced whenever he was around women, especially petite ones. Small women like Lori made him feel clumsy and...too big. Linc moved carefully and spoke quietly, not wanting to overwhelm or frighten her.</p><p>He got out of her car, hurried to his truck and cleared off the passenger seat.</p><p>Once she\u2019d clambered inside\u2014with his assistance\u2014she snapped the seat belt into place and smiled over at him. \u201cAre you always this kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sister,\u201d he said. \u201cIf her car had broken down I\u2019d want someone like me to stop and help.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine and merged with the traffic. They sat in silence as he drove, but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable anymore, nor did he feel the need to make conversation. After a couple of minutes, she murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re very easy to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou listened patiently even though I was saying the most ridiculous things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cAbout Geoff. You stopped to help with my car\u2014not to hear about the shambles my life\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s good to talk to a stranger.\u201d Linc didn\u2019t know that for a fact, but it made sense.</p><p>\u201cWell, I certainly didn\u2019t mean to blurt out the most humiliating details of my life.\u201d She gave a short, embarrassed laugh. \u201cMy car running out of gas just seems to confirm that my life\u2019s in a downward spiral.\u201d She shrugged despondently. \u201cI guess Geoff proved that I don\u2019t have very good judgment about men.\u201d</p><p>Linc grinned. \u201cThen we\u2019re equal. Because when it comes to male-female relationships I\u2019m at a complete loss.\u201d Feeling emboldened, deciding to take a chance, he took his eyes from the road long enough to look in her direction. \u201cWould you like to have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...sure.\u201d Actually, any night would be fine with him. It wasn\u2019t as if he had a calendar crammed with social events. \u201cTonight would work,\u201d he said in an offhand way.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but only if you let me treat, seeing all the trouble you\u2019ve gone to on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, afraid he was about to ruin the most promising encounter to come along in the past few years. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not how my daddy raised me,\u201d he added, trying to inject a bit of humor. He paused to gauge her reaction. \u201cCall me old-fashioned, call me a male chauvinist, call me whatever you want, but I intend to pay for our dinner. I asked you out, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld-fashioned,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI prefer old-fashioned. Isn\u2019t the term male chauvinist kind of dated, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019s old-fashioned?\u201d he said, and they both laughed.</p><p>Linc found a gas station and asked the attendant for directions to the nearest restaurant. It was a mom-and-pop burger joint. They ordered hamburgers and french fries and sodas and talked nonstop for two hours. Lori told him about Geoff, and he told her about his sister moving to Cedar Cove. Then he described his shop and how he\u2019d changed the name to Three Wyse Men when he and his brothers took over. She explained that she worked in a boutique near the mall and had recently moved to Cedar Cove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They might\u2019ve stayed longer if he hadn\u2019t noticed obvious signs that the place was closing. Linc hated to see the evening end. Unlike most women, Lori made him feel relaxed and comfortable. Their conversation interested him. Apparently neither of them was skilled at small talk, and when he mentioned that, she\u2019d said, \u201cSo what? We\u2019ll talk about big things, then.\u201d And they had.</p><p>Everything changed once they were in the truck again and he was taking her back to retrieve her car. The silence seemed strained when it hadn\u2019t been before. Linc didn\u2019t understand why and wondered what he might\u2019ve said to upset her. He decided to find out, but didn\u2019t know how to broach the subject, how to ask what was bothering her.</p><p>\u201cLinc?\u201d She put her hand on his arm. \u201cDo you mind if we just sit here for a moment?\u201d He\u2019d parked on the roadside, a few yards from her car.</p><p>\u201cNo...I mean\u2014no, of course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and stared at him with the biggest, darkest brown eyes he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cYou have trouble with relationships, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI do, too. But I feel different with you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, unsure how to explain his feelings in words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good person. You stopped to help me when everyone else drove past.\u201d She gestured at her car. \u201cNo one cared except you.\u201d</p> <p>He wanted to brush aside her gratitude, but she seemed so intent that he didn\u2019t speak for fear of destroying the mood.</p><p>\u201cYou care about your family, too, and you\u2019ve kept your dad\u2019s business going. I admire that.\u201d She closed her eyes, then opened them. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick of what?\u201d he asked, puzzled by the abrupt leap.</p><p>\u201cDating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you won\u2019t go out with me again?\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the disappointment from his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo...listen, don\u2019t say anything yet, but I\u2019d like to suggest something so far out in left field you\u2019ll probably jump out of your truck and head for the hills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lip, then shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s too crazy. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>Linc couldn\u2019t imagine what she was about to suggest and wished she\u2019d blurt it out, damn the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashioned kind of woman.\u201d She paused. \u201cJust like you\u2019re an old-fashioned kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>Linc agreed; he liked that about her.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have problems with relationships and it\u2019s the same way with me.\u201d</p><p>Again, he agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as sick of the whole dating game as I am, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Lori drew in a deep breath. \u201cYou want to skip all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...beg your pardon?\u201d He was missing some step in her logic.</p><p>She kept her gaze fixed squarely on something ahead, although he couldn\u2019t tell what. \u201cWould you be interested in skipping all the stuff that leads up to...marriage?\u201d</p><p>The silence seemed to echo. \u201cLori,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cI might be wrong about this, and if I am, if I\u2019m being presumptuous, forgive me.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAre you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI know this is probably the most bizarre, impulsive thing you\u2019ve ever heard, but I have to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cWe both want to get married, right?\u201d</p><p>That was true. Linc could feel his pulse speed up.</p><p>Lori continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve been burned. I\u2019ve been burned. Let\u2019s do away with all the nonsense. Let\u2019s just go for broke and do it. Would you be willing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never expected a woman to propose to me, but seeing that you have...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I completely throw you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She had, although Linc wouldn\u2019t admit it. \u201cDo you want an answer now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He took a quick breath. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m willing to give it a try if you are.\u201d</p><p>Lori\u2019s smile lit up her whole face as she grabbed his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing this! It\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is.\u201d</p><p>She rested her head against his shoulder and expelled her breath, as if some great weight had been lifted from her.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re getting married,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>Ben was feeling\u2014and acting\u2014more like his old self lately, which greatly relieved Charlotte. She knew he\u2019d spoken with David twice in the past few weeks. While the first call had disturbed him, he\u2019d been less agitated after the second one. In the days that followed, his mood had lightened considerably.</p><p>Ben hadn\u2019t shared any of that conversation with her but Charlotte knew he\u2019d contacted Roy McAfee shortly afterward. At first Charlotte was disappointed that Ben hadn\u2019t confided in her. Since then, she\u2019d worked it out in her mind. Thoughtful man that he was, Ben didn\u2019t want to involve her in this latest mess with his son.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d she called, fussing with her hat in front of the mirror. She so seldom wore a hat these days, but this was a celebration and nothing said that better than a nice hat. In their last conversation, Olivia had told her she\u2019d decided on a hat, too\u2014for different reasons, obviously\u2014but this was also why Charlotte was wearing hers. To make sure her daughter didn\u2019t feel self-conscious. Olivia had a lovely wig, but found it hot and uncomfortable, so her family and friends urged her to go without.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d she asked Ben.</p><p>\u201cThe grand opening\u2019s not for almost an hour,\u201d he called back.</p><p>Charlotte secured the fedora with a fancy pin that had belonged to her mother. \u201cBen, darling, I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d he said, joining her in their bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take five minutes to get to the tearoom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there might be a crowd.\u201d</p><p>Ben hugged her around the waist. \u201cVery well, my dear, if it\u2019ll reassure you, we can leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>After months of construction, her granddaughter\u2019s Victorian Tea Room was about to open. The pink building with the lavender trim was the talk of the town, and that wasn\u2019t surprising. There\u2019d never been a place in Cedar Cove like it.</p><p>In preparation for her granddaughter\u2019s venture, Charlotte had collected her most cherished recipes. Ben had helped her type them. Then, with no small amount of fanfare, they\u2019d delivered the binder to Justine. Charlotte was delighted to see that a number of her recipes had been included in the tearoom menu.</p><p>Charlotte sprayed on some cologne\u2014Evening in Paris, her lifelong favorite. Just as she\u2019d finished, she heard the doorbell. What terrible timing!</p><p>When she walked into the living room, she saw Roy McAfee, coat still on, briefcase in hand, talking to Ben.</p><p>\u201cRoy, how nice to see you,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>She waited for Ben to announce that they were leaving for the tearoom. Family and close friends were gathering there before it opened for a blessing ceremony. Pastor Flemming would invoke God\u2019s blessings on this enterprise, and Charlotte didn\u2019t want to miss a second of it. But instead of deferring Roy\u2019s visit, her husband invited him to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long,\u201d Ben said, apparently guessing her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to make coffee?\u201d she asked the two men.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI just need to give Ben a report.\u201d</p><p>It was clear that Ben had hired Roy to check up on something and that something undoubtedly concerned David.</p><p>Ben gestured to the empty space on the sofa. \u201cJoin us, please.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat down beside him. He reached for her hand, holding it tight. She could feel how tense he was, how weary of dealing with David and his problems, and gave his fingers a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019re probably aware,\u201d Roy said, seated across from them, \u201cBen asked me to look into David\u2019s story.\u201d</p><p>Ben turned to Charlotte and said, \u201cWhen David and I last spoke, he\u2019d told Mary Jo he wanted a paternity test. She was against it, but because I asked her to comply, she did. Test results prove that Noelle is his daughter. There can be no doubt of that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs David going to step up and accept responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he is,\u201d Ben answered. \u201cHe came to me and explained that he\u2019d left his job with the insurance company and is now working for a bank. He told me he\u2019s trying to make positive changes in his life and asked for my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial help?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, and that encouraged me. I felt for the first time in years that perhaps my son had learned his lesson and was willing to become the man I\u2019ve always believed he could be.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s gaze flew to Roy, unsure why Ben had involved him.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve been led down the garden path with David before,\u201d Ben continued. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to judge his sincerity because, as his father, I naturally lean toward trusting him. But rather than blindly accept his word this time, I asked Roy to check out David\u2019s story.\u201d</p><p>Roy bent down to open his briefcase. \u201cI have a full written report for you here,\u201d the investigator told them, getting up to pass Ben a file folder.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re a little tight for time,\u201d Ben said, \u201cwould you be kind enough to summarize it for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte noticed the way Roy\u2019s back stiffened\u2014as though he dreaded what he was about to tell them. \u201cWhen David said he\u2019d left his job, he was telling the truth, although the termination wasn\u2019t his choice. The company fired him with cause. Apparently there\u2019s been a sexual harassment charge filed against him. He didn\u2019t receive a severance package.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte wasn\u2019t surprised David had been let go from his job.</p><p>\u201cBut he has this new position, correct?\u201d The question came from Ben.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s another fabrication,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe\u2019s been unemployed for three months.\u201d</p><p>Knowing how close to the edge David was financially, Charlotte felt she had to ask, \u201cHow is he living, then?\u201d</p><p>Roy looked to Ben as if to ask the older man\u2019s permission to respond. Ben gave a slight nod.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s moved in with a...friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale or female?\u201d Ben inquired, frowning.</p><p>\u201cFemale.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sensed his disappointment in his son\u2014his even greater disappointment, she amended.</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Ben said, betraying none of the emotion Charlotte had recognized in him, \u201cmy son is letting a woman support him.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cThat appears to be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about all this talk of being a father to Noelle, supporting her financially and bringing her into his life?\u201d Charlotte looked at Ben. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can only guess he\u2019s saying all the things I want to hear in an effort to convince me of his sincerity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you might find significant,\u201d Roy said after a short hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Ben returned his attention to the investigator.</p><p>\u201cDavid is currently living in Seattle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeattle?\u201d Ben repeated. \u201cHow long has he been this close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to what I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s been a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s son had been a ferry ride away and hadn\u2019t bothered to notify his family. More telling was the fact that he hadn\u2019t even attempted to see his daughter, who until recently had lived in Seattle, as well. This was a blow, and Charlotte knew that Ben had taken it hard.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Ben said after a moment. He\u2019d made an obvious effort\u2014a painful effort\u2014to absorb the shock of this latest revelation.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had better news,\u201d Roy was saying.</p> <p>Ben shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019d rather deal with the truth now than uncover it later.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte placed her free hand over Ben\u2019s. She felt like weeping on his behalf. In only a few minutes, her husband looked as though he\u2019d aged several years.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I should know?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, everything\u2019s in the report. That\u2019ll give you a clearer picture of your son\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d Ben cried. \u201cIf so, just tell me straight out.\u201d</p><p>Roy sent Charlotte a questioning glance. \u201cBen needs the truth,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>\u201cIs it drugs?\u201d her husband asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It seems that David has a gambling problem.\u201d</p><p>Ben closed his eyes briefly. \u201cI feared as much. What about alcohol?\u201d</p><p>Roy winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to deliver so much bad news, especially on an important day like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Victorian Tea Room is opening its doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, his voice waning. \u201cIt...slipped my mind. Charlotte and I were about to leave when you dropped by.\u201d</p><p>Ben sounded as if he were in a trance. He stood in the middle of the room, staring at nothing, as Charlotte walked Roy to the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Charlotte. Is there anything I can do?\u201d Roy whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, but thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>Lingering in the doorway, Charlotte watched Roy walk down the steps and across the street to his car. All the while, she tried to figure out how she could help her husband deal with yet another devastating blow from his youngest son.</p><p>When she turned around, Charlotte was surprised to find Ben standing behind her. His eyes met hers and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cMy son is on a path to self-destruction. As much as I hate to see him wreck his life, there\u2019s nothing I can do to stop him.\u201d He exhaled slowly and held out his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t allow David to drag me down and I can\u2019t live his life for him. I\u2019d hoped he was making better choices, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His returning smile was gentle. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let David ruin this perfectly wonderful day. We\u2019re meeting the others at the tearoom for Pastor Flemming\u2019s blessing. Then you and I are going to be among Justine\u2019s very first customers.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cWe should be right on time.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Shirley Bliss sat in her workroom, which her children often referred to as the Dungeon. She\u2019d been doing some preparatory work for her newest piece, and she\u2019d lost track of the hours. Shadows crept across the daylight basement walls, telling her it was now late afternoon. Tanni would be home from school soon.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>It was hard to read her. Anytime Shirley dared question Tanni regarding her whereabouts, her daughter grew argumentative and defensive. After a while Shirley had stopped asking. As best she could, she monitored Tanni\u2019s comings and goings, and she tried to remain aware of her friends. At the moment, that was mostly Shaw.</p><p>One of the problems between Shirley and her daughter was that Tanni blamed her for the motorcycle accident that had claimed her father\u2019s life. It might not be logical, but in Tanni\u2019s adolescent view of the world Shirley was responsible. She\u2019d been the one who\u2019d finally capitulated and agreed that Jim could commute into Seattle on his Harley.</p><p>Tanni was convinced that if Shirley had held her ground, her father would still be alive. That question would be forever unanswered.</p><p>Sighing, Shirley made her way up the stairs and realized she\u2019d skipped lunch. That often happened when she started work on a new project. She\u2019d spent the day selecting different fabrics and designing a quilt using suede, cotton prints, silk, linen and yarn, as well as ribbons and cords. When the creative mood overtook her, food didn\u2019t enter her mind. In fact, it wasn\u2019t unusual for her to work without a break. Her best pieces were created during long stretches of time that went far into the night. Jim and the children were accustomed to her strange schedule. Now there was only Tanni at home. Jim was gone and Nick away at college.</p><p>For Shirley, her art was a refuge and an escape. It had been for Tanni, too, although her daughter kept her drawings to herself these days. That was probably a good thing, because Shirley had been worried by the unrelenting anger and bitterness in Tanni\u2019s sketches. She\u2019d become introspective, shunned most of her friends and refused to talk to Shirley, to a counselor, their pastor, anybody.</p><p>Things had changed when she started seeing Shaw, although the transition had been gradual. Despite her concerns, Shirley was grateful that in Shaw, Tanni had found someone to share her feelings with. Like her daughter, he was an artist. Unlike Tanni, Shaw had never had formal training.</p><p>No doubt about it, he was talented. Shirley had gone out of her way to help him get the schooling he\u2019d need if he was going to make a living as an artist. She\u2019d be the first to admit that her motives weren\u2019t exactly unsullied.</p><p>Shirley was worried that the two teenagers, both burdened with a multitude of problems, were too close and would become sexually active. She was afraid Tanni might end up pregnant or, at the very least, brokenhearted, devastated by another great loss. The fact that Tanni and Shaw had discovered the skeleton in the cave outside town had only strengthened the bond between them. They\u2019d become nearly inseparable ever since, and Shirley knew the dangers of that, knew where it could lead. She wanted to protect her daughter from the painful consequences of too intimate a relationship too young.</p><p>In an effort to smooth the way for Shaw, Shirley had agreed to go out with Will Jefferson. Fortunately she rather liked Will and he was definitely attractive, but she remained wary. More to the point, Will was friends with Larry Knight, an artist she greatly admired. At Shirley\u2019s urging, Will had approached him in an effort to get Shaw a scholarship to a reputable art school.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to hide her relief when Shaw was accepted into the San Francisco Art Institute. He was scheduled to fly out there in two days; he\u2019d be working for a friend of Larry Knight\u2019s before the summer term started in May. Although they hadn\u2019t discussed Shaw\u2019s leaving, Shirley realized her daughter felt torn. This was a great opportunity and she was happy for Shaw; at the same time she was worried about what it would do to their relationship.</p><p>The front door opened and Tanni came inside. She dropped her backpack on the carpet and kicked off her shoes. Without a glance in Shirley\u2019s direction, she headed for her bedroom. A few seconds later, the sound of the bedroom door slamming shut echoed down the hallway.</p><p>Shirley wanted to chastise her daughter\u2014for her rudeness, for disregarding Shirley\u2019s frequent requests that she take her backpack to her room, for being inconsiderate of anyone\u2019s feelings but her own. She might as well be howling at the moon for all the response she\u2019d get.</p><p>And the truth was, Shirley didn\u2019t dare instigate a confrontation right now. She was too afraid Tanni would react by doing something impulsive, something foolish.... She opened the cupboard and chose a can of chicken noodle soup. Anything frozen or canned was quick and easy. Shirley didn\u2019t have the patience to cook.</p><p>Once the soup came out of the microwave, she sat down at the kitchen table. She\u2019d eaten her first mouthful when her daughter walked in. Tanni looked around, saw her mother and then just as quickly turned around and left.</p><p>That was typical.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d Shirley called after her.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tanni\u2019s terse rejection wasn\u2019t unexpected. Still, Shirley had to try.</p><p>After she\u2019d finished her soup, she set the bowl in the sink and turned on the evening news and picked up her needles and yarn. She\u2019d started knitting lately, nothing creative or complicated. Everything she knit, mostly squares and scarves, was for charity. Knitting freed her mind. At the end of the day, the comforting, repetitive action relaxed her and allowed her to reflect on the events of her life.</p><p>To her astonishment, about fifteen minutes into the newscast, Tanni walked into the family room and sat in the chair next to hers. Shirley opened her mouth to utter a welcoming comment, but at the last second decided against it. If she spoke, Tanni might leave. No, it was best to let her daughter do the talking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to meet other girls, you know,\u201d Tanni finally said.</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t need Tanni to explain who she meant. \u201cYes, he probably will. Are you afraid of that?\u201d</p><p>Tanni shrugged, which said she was afraid. She knew she risked losing their relationship once Shaw left for art school.</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to stay in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>Tanni looked at Shirley and a half smile formed, as though the question had amused her. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want him to leave either, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, think about it! Shaw\u2019s the only real friend I have. I\u2019m going to miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d Maybe, just maybe, that would force Tanni to find other friends\u2014the friends she\u2019d had before the accident, the friends she\u2019d abandoned.</p><p>\u201cHe says he loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love him.\u201d Shirley wasn\u2019t about to discount the intensity of their feelings. The problem was, they were both so young and didn\u2019t have the life experience to handle such a powerful emotion.</p><p>\u201cI love Shaw more than anything\u2014more than my life.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of fear ran through Shirley, which she worked hard to disguise. It took her a moment to realize that Tanni\u2019s words had simply been a way to communicate the depth of her feelings for Shaw.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019ll e-mail or phone me every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I wonder how long it\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p>So did Shirley, although it would\u2019ve been foolish to admit that. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back for visits.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot often enough,\u201d Tanni complained. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to change and I don\u2019t want it to.\u201d</p><p>Tanni sounded like she had as a little girl, needing her mother\u2019s comfort.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a hug?\u201d Shirley chanced asking.</p><p>Her daughter glared as though the offer had offended her.</p> <p>\u201cA hug wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Shirley added.</p><p>Tanni shrugged. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>Shirley put down her knitting, then stood and walked over to her daughter.

An involuntary sighed escaped as she slid her arms around her daughter.</p><p>To her shock and delight, Tanni hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do just fine,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cAnd so is Shaw.\u201d</p> <p>Tanni leaned her head against her mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI hope he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Tanni whispered. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s so successful he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me?\u201d</p><p>Shirley wasn\u2019t sure how to reassure Tanni. She couldn\u2019t promise that wouldn\u2019t happen and some part of her actually hoped it would.</p><p>Tanni broke away and straightened.</p><p>Shirley returned to her knitting; Tanni stayed in the room. After a couple of minutes, Tanni said, \u201cThe school passed around a notice from Grace Harding, the woman who runs the library.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA notice for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library\u2019s looking for volunteers to work with kids and dogs,\u201d Tanni told her.</p><p>\u201cDogs in the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it said. Ms. Harding is bringing in dogs from the animal shelter and letting children with reading problems read to them. A lot of kids at school say it\u2019s silly, but I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would the library need volunteers? Don\u2019t they already have quite a few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but this is something I\u2019d like to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a meeting next week and I want to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be curious to hear more about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Tanni started to leave. Halfway across the room, she stopped and glanced over her shoulder. Then, in a casual tone, she said, \u201cThanks for listening, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in Shirley\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A year after losing her husband, it almost felt as if she had her daughter back.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Saturday evening, after spending eight hours on her feet at the cash register, Christie was tired. Bone-deep tired. For months, day after day, it\u2019d been nothing but work and school. She couldn\u2019t even remember her last visit to the Pink Poodle.</p><p>They\u2019d had exams that week and Christie decided she deserved a small reward. She\u2019d done all her assignments, studied hard and become proficient with both a camera and a calculator. One beer wouldn\u2019t hurt, and it would be good to reconnect with her friends.</p><p>She pulled into a parking space, and out of the corner of her eye saw a limo at the back of the lot.</p><p>No. It couldn\u2019t be. James? Had he come looking for her? Was he waiting there on the off chance she\u2019d show up?</p><p>Well, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d dropped by the Pink Poodle, but it would be the last! Climbing out of her car, she slammed the door and marched toward the parked limo.</p><p>Rapping hard against the dark windows, she didn\u2019t immediately realize the vehicle was empty.</p><p>She rubbed her knuckles. If James wasn\u2019t in the limo, that probably meant he was in the bar. That was fine with her. She\u2019d flirt with her friends and ignore him, a prospect that filled her with renewed energy.</p><p>Walking into the tavern, Christie first spotted Kyle, a divorced plumber. Several other guys were there, too, mostly sitting at tables. A few of them were playing pool.</p><p>\u201cHey, look who\u2019s here.\u201d Kyle lifted his beer mug in salute.</p><p>\u201cChristie!\u201d Bill slid off his stool to give her a hug.</p><p>Larry, who worked the bar, automatically got her a draft.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to find James. He sat alone in a corner of the room. That wasn\u2019t a beer he had, nor did it resemble a mixed drink. From the looks of it, he was sipping a soda.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d Kyle asked when Christie slipped onto the bar stool next to her old friend.</p><p>\u201cOh, around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you been taking college classes,\u201d Larry commented, setting the frothy mug in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I decided it was time to get serious about a career.\u201d</p><p>If James had noticed her, he didn\u2019t give any sign.</p><p>Bill sidled up next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the guy in back?\u201d she asked, pointing at James.</p><p>\u201cWe call him the Professor,\u201d Larry said and his voice fell to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cDoes he come here often?\u201d</p><p>Kyle shrugged. \u201cOnce or twice a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen comin\u2019 by every so often for the past couple months. Never says a word. All this time and none of us even know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s James Wilbur,\u201d she said automatically. She hadn\u2019t meant to acknowledge him. Her problem, one of many, was her inability to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>Rather than lie, she took her first sip of beer while she tried to come up with a reasonable response. \u201cNot really. I thought I knew him at one time, but I was wrong.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how much sense that made\u2014at least to them.</p><p>\u201cHey, just a minute.\u201d Kyle glanced from Christie to Bill, and then to Larry. He held up one finger. \u201cI remember him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d The question came from Bill.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy who hung out in the parking lot before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Larry nodded in recognition. \u201cThe guy in the limo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it out there now?\u201d Kyle asked. He and Bill hurried to the door. \u201cYup,\u201d Kyle told them a moment later. \u201cSure is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like he finally worked up the courage to step over the threshold,\u201d Christie said, playing along.</p><p>All three men laughed, causing a few of the other patrons to turn in their direction.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to say hello,\u201d Larry said.</p><p>Christie shook her head. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you knew him. He\u2019s been pretty morose, sitting there nursing his Diet Coke.\u201d</p><p>Diet Coke. The man was as skinny as a rail and he drank Diet Coke? For some reason she couldn\u2019t explain, the thought made her furious.</p><p>\u201cSure, Christie, go say hello.\u201d That was Kyle, throwing in his two cents\u2019 worth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s been waiting for you all this time,\u201d Bill said in a teasing voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, puleese.\u201d</p><p>All three grinned.</p><p>\u201cHey, he looks like he could use a friend.\u201d</p><p>Talking to James hadn\u2019t been part of her plan, but when the guys urged her to go over, she found the suggestion irresistible. At this point she didn\u2019t have a clue what she intended to say. It\u2019d probably end up being something stupid. But even knowing that wasn\u2019t enough to stop her.</p><p>James didn\u2019t look up as she approached, which sort of ruined things. She didn\u2019t wait for an invitation to pull out a chair and join him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He answered by lifting his Diet Coke and taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, have you forgotten how to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>James had always been a man of few words, but never fewer than now.</p><p>\u201cThe guys said you\u2019ve been coming around for a while. Any reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. She hated one-word responses. \u201cWould you care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. If that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d She sat sideways in the chair, crossed her legs and made idle circles with her foot. It felt good to sit after spending so many hours on her feet.</p><p>James ignored her and she ignored him. After a few minutes, she could see this wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so she started to stand. His hand shot across the table, stopping her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped, shaking herself free. If he wanted to limit his responses to one word, she\u2019d do that, too.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She wondered how long this could continue. Not long, she decided. \u201cStay? You treat me like I\u2019m your pet dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>Two words. Well, that was an improvement. Slight, but an improvement nonetheless.</p><p>Silence stretched between them. James was the one to break it. \u201cI came because I felt close to you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you know I didn\u2019t stay away because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. You\u2019ve been taking business and photography classes. Teri told me.\u201d</p><p>Her sister the traitor.</p><p>James looked directly at her then. \u201cIs it so hard to forgive me?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Rather than explain, she simply nodded.</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>Christie raised one hand to her chest. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>James shook his head sadly. \u201cHaven\u2019t you figured out yet that no man will ever love you as much as I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she muttered sarcastically. \u201cTrust me on this, Mr. Chauffeur, plenty of men have claimed undying love, just like you did, and then walked out. You\u2019re no different and you proved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d be willing to let me have a second chance, I\u2019ll prove otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve handed out all the second chances I plan to give.\u201d She sounded definite and sure of herself, but she could feel her resolve weakening.</p><p>He hesitated, then shrugged in resignation. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m going to regret this, right? Well, I\u2019m way past regret, James Wilbur or whatever your real name is. Way, way past that. I\u2019ve already suffered all my regrets\u2014the day you ran off.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stood.</p><p>She flinched involuntarily when he reached out to run his finger down her cheek. His touch was light, a caress. \u201cWe would\u2019ve had beautiful babies.\u201d With that he walked away.</p><p>She wanted to shout after him that it was a B-movie line\u2014but she was paralyzed, her breath locked in her lungs. When she\u2019d managed to exhale, she vaulted out of her chair and ran outside. James was halfway across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWait just one minute!\u201d</p><p>Silently he turned to face her.</p><p>Christie stabbed her finger into his chest. \u201cThat was low and completely underhanded and...and cruel. And you know it!\u201d</p><p>Because, clich\u00e9d line or not, he\u2019d struck her weakest point\u2014her desire for a baby. He knew this about her because she\u2019d been honest with him, confided all her hopes and failures and dreams. It was the one thing he could\u2019ve said that was guaranteed to send her running after him. If Christie hadn\u2019t been so angry, she would\u2019ve broken into sobs. Her longing for a child had been shoved aside for so many years that whenever it surfaced the ache became unbearable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James studied her and in the dim light of the streetlamp she saw the tenderness in his eyes. Although she tried to resist, he slipped his arms around her and pulled her against him.</p><p>When she finally surrendered, leaning into his strength, James whispered in her ear, \u201cOh, Christie, Christie, how long until you see I\u2019m not like those other men?\u201d</p><p>She so badly wanted to believe him, yet knew she couldn\u2019t. Too many times before, she\u2019d been duped. She couldn\u2019t risk it again.</p><p>Still, when he lowered his mouth to hers, she offered no resistance. Sliding her arms around his neck, she yielded to his kiss. His lips were warm and moist as he half lifted her from the pavement. His gentleness made her knees weak and her heart race.</p> <p>When he released her, she was surprised she was still upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m not going anywhere, Christie.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He touched her cheek again, then left her standing alone in the Pink Poodle parking lot.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p> <p>If he didn\u2019t know that Faith\u2019s tires had been slashed two weeks ago and that her home had been vandalized in January, Troy wouldn\u2019t have guessed that anything untoward had happened at 204 Rosewood Lane. But the harassment had been intermittent from the moment she\u2019d moved in. Troy was at a loss to explain why Faith had been singled out. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person who made enemies; anyone who met Faith was immediately drawn to her. He hated the fact that neither he nor his deputies had been able to determine who was responsible.</p><p>He stood in front of the house, recalling the morning he\u2019d come to talk to Grace Sherman.</p><p>Dan had disappeared and at that point no one knew the tragic truth\u2014that his lifelong depression over an incident in Vietnam had driven him to suicide. Troy had vivid memories of that visit and the one a year later, when he\u2019d come to bring Grace the news that Dan\u2019s body had been found.</p><p>Sandy had been alive when Dan Sherman went missing. Troy had told her about the case. She\u2019d lost much of her ability to communicate verbally by then, but her expressive eyes had revealed her sympathy for Grace.</p><p>Troy sighed. He was surprised by how often he thought of Sandy. He wished he could talk to her now. She\u2019d always been a good listener and while it might seem odd that he\u2019d want to discuss his feelings for another woman with her, he sensed that if Sandy had known Faith, they would\u2019ve been friends.</p><p>Catching him off guard, the front door opened and Faith stepped onto the porch, standing in the afternoon drizzle. Spring had officially begun a week ago, and as the old saying went, March showers brought April flowers. Or was it April showers that brought May flowers? In either case, it was still a winter sky, bleak and gray, although the days were noticeably longer.</p> <p>\u201cTroy,\u201d Faith called, her arms crossed protectively over her chest, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Troy walked up the pathway to the house. \u201cJust checking to make sure you\u2019re safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling you check on me quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t deny it. It\u2019d become habit to drive by at least once a day and sometimes more often, although he didn\u2019t want Faith to know how often. \u201cI keep turning up like a bad penny, right?\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled, and her lovely face seemed even lovelier. \u201cDo you feel like a cup of decaf coffee?\u201d</p><p>One thing he wouldn\u2019t do, and that was refuse to spend time with Faith. He loved her. He knew she loved him, too. For the most part they\u2019d worked out their differences but the situation between them remained tentative. Although they\u2019d known each other practically their entire lives, the setbacks of the past year had nearly destroyed any promise of a lasting relationship.</p><p>He followed Faith into the house and saw that she\u2019d been knitting. The television was on the twenty-four-hour news channel, and the aroma of cooking wafted toward him. Whatever it was smelled delicious.</p><p>He took a seat and Faith brought him a mug. \u201cThere\u2019s something on your mind,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut I know that whatever it is doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d</p> <p>She was right on both counts, and her ability to read him so easily reminded him of Sandy. Despite his lawman\u2019s poker face, Sandy could always tell when he was disturbed by a case, and now it seemed Faith shared that trait.</p><p>She sat across from him. \u201cCan you talk about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. This was information he couldn\u2019t share. A visit from Charlotte Rhodes earlier that afternoon had most likely given him the solution to one of his most difficult outstanding cases. Even now, Troy wasn\u2019t sure how to handle the situation, especially since it involved someone he knew well.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could...but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Faith said in that soothing way of hers.</p><p>He held his coffee with both hands, letting the heat chase away the chill of late afternoon. \u201cHow\u2019d you know something was on my mind?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Faith picked up her knitting and gazed into the flickering light of the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Troy stared into his coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, Faith.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d It would be so easy to sit with Faith for the rest of the evening. Who was he kidding? He\u2019d like nothing better than to be with her for the rest of his life. A contentment that had escaped him all afternoon settled over him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll explain,\u201d she said, her fingers nimbly working the yarn. \u201cYou have a \u2018tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA \u2018tell\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, brightening. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching that poker show on TV. I don\u2019t know how I got started, but now I\u2019m hooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a \u2018tell\u2019 is?\u201d He knew very well what it meant, but he wanted to hear her definition of it\u2014and, even more, what she felt his \u201ctell\u201d was.</p><p>Faith\u2019s response was enthusiastic. \u201cYou\u2019ve noticed that a lot of poker players wear dark glasses? The reason, according to the commentators, is that other players can read their eyes and know if they\u2019re bluffing or not. I saw one player who shuffled his chips every time he was dealt a good hand. I could tell he had decent cards by his body language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you can read me the same way you read that poker player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered smugly.</p><p>Troy was enjoying this. \u201cWould it be divulging too much to ask what my \u2018tell\u2019 is?\u201d</p><p>She smiled again and stopped knitting for a moment. Leaning forward slightly, she said, \u201cYou squint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do not,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cOh, but, Troy, you do. Your eyes narrow and you frown. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to read tiny, tiny print.\u201d</p><p>As if to prove the opposite, he widened his eyes, which made Faith laugh outright.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first see this \u2018tell\u2019 of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas.\u201d</p><p>The only real interaction he could remember was at the Christmas tree farm, where Megan and Craig had dragged him for their annual outing. Faith had been with her son and her grandchildren, and they\u2019d met there.</p><p>\u201cCan you be more precise?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes as though her knitting suddenly demanded her full attention. \u201cThe night I ran into you at the tree farm,\u201d she said.</p><p>So he was right. \u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the instant I saw you that you didn\u2019t want to be there.\u201d</p><p>That much was true. The only reason he\u2019d gone was for Megan\u2019s sake. The choosing and chopping down of the Christmas tree had long been a family tradition, and although he\u2019d tried to beg off, his daughter had insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou were furious with me, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t anymore, right?\u201d</p><p>Faith shook her index finger at him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to distract me. We were talking about your \u2018tell,\u2019 remember?\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward her. \u201cBy all means, continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d she said, her mouth quivering with a smile. \u201cYou squint. You squinted that night when you saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you pretended you hadn\u2019t noticed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as successfully as I\u2019d hoped,\u201d she said, amusement still evident on her face.</p><p>He grinned, too. \u201cI guess this means I should never play poker,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cNot with me, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she told him, as her fingers moved quickly, looping the yarn onto the needles.</p><p>Troy had never asked her what she was knitting. He thought of the socks she\u2019d made him; he still wore them but never without a pang of nostalgia\u2014and remorse.</p><p>He reluctantly set his coffee aside. \u201cNothing\u2019s been going on around here, has it?\u201d</p><p>Faith looked away. \u201cNothing of significance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith...\u201d</p><p>Sighing heavily, she stared down at her knitting. \u201cSomeone, probably a kid trying to make trouble, overturned my garbage can. No harm done.\u201d</p><p>Troy rubbed his face. \u201cI wish I knew why you\u2019ve been targeted for this vandalism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done everything you\u2019ve suggested,\u201d she broke in, a bit defensively. \u201cScott was over last week and set up motion detector lights over the garage. Don\u2019t worry, Troy, nothing\u2019s happened since my tires got slashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stood and glanced at the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll call if anything else comes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Faith.\u201d</p><p>She walked him to the door and wrapped her arms around him. Troy held her close, loath to release her. He wanted to kiss her, but needed a sign, an indication that she wanted his kiss. It came a few seconds later when she turned her lips to his. Their mouths met softly\u2014sweet and comforting. They\u2019d known passion, but this gentleness was different and in some ways better, although he wouldn\u2019t have thought that possible.</p><p>When he ended the kiss, he pressed his chin against her hair and breathed in her perfume, wondering when he\u2019d see her again. Or would he have to find another convenient excuse to visit?</p><p>Ten minutes later Troy pulled into his own driveway. He couldn\u2019t remember a single detail of the ride between Faith\u2019s house on Rosewood Lane and his own place at 92 Pacific Boulevard. His conversation with Charlotte Rhodes that afternoon weighed heavily on his mind. He needed time to consider the information she\u2019d given him, to think it through.</p><p>As Troy stepped out of his car, he realized there was a second vehicle parked outside his house. The doors opened and two men emerged. Because it was dark and the porch light dim, Troy couldn\u2019t immediately identify them. Then he recognized one as the mayor; the other was his brother, the attorney.</p><p>\u201cLouie,\u201d Troy said, extending his hand to the mayor. \u201cOtto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know,\u201d Otto said gruffly, \u201cas my brother\u2019s attorney, I advised him against this, but he insisted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Troy nodded. \u201cWould you like to go down to the station?\u201d he asked the mayor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Louie was pale, and sweat had broken out on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you,\u201d Louie said. \u201cPrivately.\u201d</p> <p>Troy hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a long time. If you\u2019re asking me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother hasn\u2019t admitted to any wrongdoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtto,\u201d Louie barked. \u201cJust let me tell him. If he needs to arrest me, then so be it. I\u2019m not asking for any personal favors.\u201d He looked directly at Troy. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to talk here, if that\u2019s all right. If you want me to repeat what I tell you over at the station, then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Troy showed them into the chilly house, switched on the lights and turned up the heat, then gestured for the two men to sit down.</p><p>Louie perched on the edge of the sofa; Otto sat next to him, his back straight, his expression guarded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where to start,\u201d the mayor said, glancing up at Troy. His hands dangled between his parted knees.</p><p>\u201cYou saw Charlotte Rhodes stop by my office earlier this afternoon, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Louie said starkly. \u201cShe came to see me afterward and suggested I speak to you.\u201d He gave a long sigh. \u201cI figured it was either come to you and tell my story or wait for you to seek me out. I\u2019d rather clear this up once and for all. I don\u2019t want it hanging over my head anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother can\u2019t be held responsible\u2014\u201d</p><p>Louie raised a hand to silence his brother. \u201cI\u2019ll do the talking. I appreciate that you\u2019re here, Otto, but I\u2019m going to do it my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Again Louie silenced his brother, this time with a look.</p><p>Troy settled back and waited.</p><p>\u201cI married my first wife while I was in college,\u201d Louie said.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t know the mayor had been married more than once. Donna had been Louie\u2019s wife for as long as he could recall.</p><p>\u201cMy marriage to Beverly wasn\u2019t good,\u201d Louie told him. \u201cMy wife had...medical problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat my brother\u2019s trying to say,\u201d Otto cut in, \u201cis that Beverly had emotional problems. Or, more accurately, psychiatric ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was agoraphobic,\u201d Louie said as if his brother hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cIn the beginning, everything seemed fine. Beverly was shy and she didn\u2019t like being around a lot of people but that didn\u2019t bother me. After we were married I realized this tendency of hers was more than simple aversion. To be fair, we had a few good months together.\u201d Louie paused, sighing, before he went on. \u201cI was about to graduate from college and we decided it was time to start our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when the trouble began,\u201d Otto said. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Louie cast his brother another quelling look and Otto didn\u2019t complete the sentence.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Louie continued, \u201cBeverly got pregnant easily enough but miscarried in the third month. Losing the pregnancy devastated her.\u201d</p><p>Troy remembered how hard Sandy\u2019s miscarriage had been on both of them, and more recently, how painful the loss of Megan\u2019s baby had been. He nodded sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cAfterward she withdrew completely. I couldn\u2019t get her to leave the house.\u201d</p><p>Otto leaned forward and added, \u201cLouie did everything he could for her\u2014to no avail. He couldn\u2019t persuade her to see a psychiatrist, and the problem got worse and worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy then Beverly and I had no relationship to speak of. Some days she didn\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d Louie rubbed his palms together as if to warm his hands. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that her younger sister\u2014who wasn\u2019t married\u2014got pregnant. The father was some sailor she met during Seafair in Seattle. Here today and gone tomorrow. Apparently Amber didn\u2019t bother to ask his name. She didn\u2019t want the baby, but Beverly did. She told her we\u2019d raise the child. I was willing to adopt Amber\u2019s child,\u201d Louie said, \u201choping that a baby would give me back the woman I married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you legally adopt the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, sighing once more. \u201cThat meant Beverly would have to leave the house\u2014go to court, for one thing\u2014and she refused to do that.\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded, indicating that his friend should go on.</p><p>\u201cWhen the child was born with Down syndrome, it made no difference to Beverly. She mothered him, gave him all her love and attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing changed,\u201d Otto said. \u201cBeverly was still a recluse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer only joy was her sister\u2019s son,\u201d Louie said. \u201cShe doted on him, loved and pampered him and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>Troy interrupted with a question. \u201cYou stayed in the marriage?\u201d</p><p>Louie looked away, then finally shook his head. \u201cEventually we divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother did everything he could to save the marriage,\u201d Otto insisted.</p><p>Louie raised his hand. \u201cNone of that\u2019s important now. Beverly didn\u2019t seem to care that we were no longer married. Timmy was her entire world.\u201d</p><p>Sensing there was more to this story, Troy turned to Otto, who\u2014strangely\u2014remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cA few years after the divorce, I met Donna,\u201d Louie said, lowering his voice. \u201cI was living in Seattle then. We got engaged. She knew I was divorced but I didn\u2019t mention Timmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouie kept in touch with Beverly and Timmy and saw to their needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought her groceries once a week, made sure her bills were paid and checked up on her,\u201d Louie elaborated. \u201cOtherwise, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve become of them. Although we were divorced I still felt some responsibility for her and Timmy. I was often tempted to call Child Protective Services but they would, most likely, have taken Timmy away, which would\u2019ve destroyed Beverly completely. I guess he was a kid who slipped through the cracks. No one from any official agency knew about him\u2014and I didn\u2019t tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Beverly?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that. When Timmy was in his early teens, I noticed that she\u2019d started to lose weight. Soon I realized it was something physical. She became gaunt and spent practically all her time in bed. I begged her to see a doctor but no matter how much I pleaded she refused.\u201d</p><p>Otto did speak up then. \u201cLouie phoned to ask for my help. I had a good friend who was a medical student. He went to the house to examine her\u2014over her protests\u2014and diagnosed her with cancer. Stomach cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt became apparent that unless she got immediate medical treatment she\u2019d die, and frankly I think that\u2019s what she wanted. Life had become too painful for her.\u201d</p><p>Louie\u2019s expression was tormented. \u201cI did everything I could to convince her to seek medical help. For Timmy\u2019s sake, I pleaded with her to go to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Troy gave a slight nod. He believed Louie. He knew nothing about any of this because he\u2019d been in the service at that time.</p><p>\u201cShe kept refusing,\u201d Otto inserted. \u201cI was with him on more than one occasion and what he\u2019s saying is the truth. The thought of leaving the security of her house was more than she could bear. It was a sad, difficult situation.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cEventually, when she was too weak to resist, we had her taken to Seattle by ambulance. She didn\u2019t last much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the boy?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by to visit a couple of weeks before that\u2014and Timmy was gone.\u201d He leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cDid Beverly tell you where he was?\u201d</p><p>Louie nodded. \u201cShe said her sister had come and taken him away.\u201d He swallowed visibly. \u201cBeverly knew she was dying and couldn\u2019t look after him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou checked this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I...I know I should have. I can\u2019t tell you how many sleepless nights I\u2019ve spent wondering. Beverly said Amber had promised to take the boy to an aunt of theirs who lived near Cedar Cove. This aunt, whom I never met, apparently used to visit once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Troy let that information settle before he asked, \u201cDid you ever hear from Amber again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Otto said, \u201cShe died a year after Beverly in an automobile accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find out about it until several years later,\u201d Louie clarified. \u201cBy then, Donna and I were married and we\u2019d moved back to Cedar Cove and started our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe the body in the cave is Timmy,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>Louie stared down at the floor. \u201cI strongly suspect it is. The...skeleton was wearing the baseball cap I gave him. He loved that thing and wore it constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d need dental records to confirm his identity,\u201d Troy said. He paused. \u201cI assume there are dental records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Louie told him. \u201cHe\u2019d been to the dentist two or three times. He broke a tooth when he was eight, and I took him to Dr. Hudson myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll get the chart from Hudson and send it to the pathologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Timmy,\u201d Louie insisted. \u201cYou can compare dental records if you want, but in my heart of hearts, I know it\u2019s Timmy.\u201d</p><p>This brought up something else. \u201cCharlotte Jefferson knew about Timmy. She met the aunt\u2014Amber and Beverly\u2019s aunt\u2014in the park.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, Louie nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo you believe the aunt is responsible for Timmy\u2019s death?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Louie said, his voice ragged. \u201cIf I were to speculate, I\u2019d guess Amber did take the boy to live with her mother\u2019s sister. But you have to remember that Timmy had only been away from Beverly for the briefest periods of time. He couldn\u2019t possibly have understood what had happened and why he had to leave the only home he\u2019d ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy assumption is that he ran away,\u201d Otto said. \u201cSomehow he found the cave and hid out there....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t his aunt have looked for him or reported him missing? Is she still alive?\u201d Troy asked urgently.</p><p>Louie shook his head. \u201cI learned a few years later that she died of a sudden heart attack about two weeks after Beverly. I figured the boy had gone to a group home or something. I...I suppose that\u2019s what I wanted to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy died due to a tragic series of events.\u201d Otto stood. \u201cMy brother hasn\u2019t done anything culpable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but I should\u2019ve made sure Timmy was okay, that he was settled and happy. The truth is, I was young and selfish and relieved not to be responsible for the boy anymore. I feel wretched now to realize my self-centeredness might have contributed to his death. The night I was arrested for drunk driving was the night I could no longer deny what I\u2019d suspected from the beginning\u2014it was Timmy in that cave.\u201d</p><p>Troy knew that no one would be harder on the mayor than he\u2019d been on himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you feel you need to press charges, then do so,\u201d Louie said brokenly.</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d Otto demanded.</p><p>\u201cNeglect,\u201d Louie whispered. \u201cAmber wasn\u2019t to be trusted and I knew it. I was far too willing to let her take Timmy to this aunt of hers and then, when I discovered the aunt was dead...I didn\u2019t look for him or try to find out where he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d prefer to keep Louie\u2019s name out of the press,\u201d Otto said. \u201cBy the time Timmy died, he\u2019d been divorced from Beverly for a number of years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how mentioning Louie is relevant to the case. You had no legal obligation toward Timmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not a legal obligation but a moral one. I should never have been so willing to slough him off.\u201d</p><p>Troy agreed that morally Louie had been in the wrong even if legally he wasn\u2019t. But in his view, the mayor had suffered enough.</p><p>\u201cOnce I get confirmation from the pathologist,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll write up a short press release, merely indicating that the remains have been identified. What was Timmy\u2019s last name?\u201d he asked as the thought suddenly occurred to him. \u201cWas it Benson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Amber gave him her name\u2014Beverly\u2019s maiden name\u2014which was Gilbert.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll identify the body as that of Timothy Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t mention Louie?\u201d Otto asked. \u201cWe can count on that?\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t see that dragging his name into this matter would serve any useful purpose.\u201d</p><p>Louie hung his head and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a good husband and father during the years since,\u201d Troy said thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019ve served your community well. I suggest we leave things as they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to bury Timmy,\u201d Louie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that the remains are released to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Beverly would want him buried with her.\u201d</p><p>Troy agreed.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>Mack knew something was wrong the moment he arrived home from his shift at the fire station. Mary Jo threw open her front door, as if she\u2019d been waiting for him. She stood there, looking small and frightened.</p><p>Not bothering to go to his own place, Mack walked toward her. She was chewing frantically on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She seemed to have trouble speaking, and he noticed how close to tears she was.</p> <p>\u201cIs Noelle sick?\u201d</p><p>The three-month-old had come down with a cold earlier in the week, but it didn\u2019t appear to be serious.</p><p>\u201cI...I saw David.\u201d</p><p>Mack stiffened instantly. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere...a few minutes ago. I\u2019d just got home with Noelle.\u201d It was now about five-thirty, so David had known to come after Mary Jo had left the office and picked up Noelle. Mack supposed Mary Jo\u2019s address wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for someone like David to find. Access to a computer was probably all he needed.</p><p>Taking her by the elbow, Mack led Mary Jo inside and sat on the sofa with her. Clasping her hand, he held it between his own. He felt her tremble as she gathered her composure.</p><p>She breathed in deeply before she spoke. \u201cHe wants Noelle.\u201d</p><p>Mack bit off an angry retort. \u201cHe\u2019s living in a dream world if he thinks any court in the land will take this baby away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he has an attorney....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d Mack had never met David but he\u2019d heard enough about him to realize the other man wasn\u2019t to be trusted. Apparently he expected to use his infant daughter as leverage for his own purposes. Whatever his specific objective, Mack was sure it had everything to do with cold, hard cash.</p><p>\u201cI...1 don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, scraping her hair off her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve seen him since before Noelle\u2019s birth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have feelings for him?\u201d She\u2019d said she didn\u2019t but he had to ask. Had to know. David was Noelle\u2019s father, and at one time Mary Jo had loved him. Mack struggled to hide the anger he felt at the thought of David threatening Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Her response was loud and immediate. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ever cared for him. How could I have been so blind and...and so gullible?\u201d</p><p>Mack couldn\u2019t answer that, although he didn\u2019t want Mary Jo to change in any way. He\u2019d fallen in love with her and he loved Noelle, too. David Rhodes had a hell of a fight on his hands if he thought he could walk away with Mary Jo\u2019s baby\u2014with the baby Mack considered his more than David\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he has this sudden interest in Noelle?\u201d Mack asked. All he could figure was that David saw some financial advantage in claiming Noelle.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea why he came,\u201d Mary Jo cried. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him in all this time and then out of the blue he shows up demanding his parental rights. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ben?\u201d Mack asked. \u201cHas David been in touch with his father?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded slowly. \u201cApparently he went to his father a little while ago. I don\u2019t know if he asked for money or not, but he has in the past. Ben assured me he wouldn\u2019t give his son any child support money because there\u2019s no guarantee David would use it for Noelle.\u201d</p><p>Mack frowned. \u201cIs it possible that David assumes his father will give him money if Ben knows Noelle is living with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Panic edged her voice. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t seriously think you\u2019d just hand Noelle over to him, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cDid he say he was coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was and that, when he did, he was bringing the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Mack nearly laughed out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s a bold-faced lie.\u201d He clenched his fists, wishing he\u2019d been home when David had come to the house. Rhodes might be able to intimidate Mary Jo, but not Mack. He would gladly have taken him on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he comes back or not, I can\u2019t risk losing Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cI\u2019m moving back home. He\u2019s never been there, and after everything I\u2019ve said about my brothers, I doubt he\u2019d show his face.\u201d</p><p>Mack wanted to argue. He\u2019d gotten accustomed to having Mary Jo and Noelle so close, accustomed to sharing special moments with them. Everything had been going so well. He\u2019d thought Mary Jo had begun to return his love, but obviously she wasn\u2019t ready....</p><p>\u201cIs moving away what you really want?\u201d he finally asked. If he voiced his objections too strenuously, she\u2019d guess the strength of his feelings, and that might scare her off. He sensed she still wasn\u2019t ready for a new relationship, other than being friends.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She buried her face in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I want, but my daughter\u2019s future is at stake. Her well-being takes precedence over my personal desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan your brothers do anything I can\u2019t do?\u201d he asked, hoping she\u2019d listen to reason.</p><p>\u201cNo...I don\u2019t suppose they could. But there are three of them and only one of you.\u201d</p><p>Mack couldn\u2019t argue with her logic. As much as he would\u2019ve liked to spend every minute of every day standing guard over her and Noelle, that would be impossible.</p><p>\u201cI left a message with Linc and asked him to contact me as soon as he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Mack\u2019s heart sank.</p><p>\u201cLeaving Cedar Cove isn\u2019t what I want,\u201d Mary Jo insisted again. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid, Mack.\u201d</p><p>The way her voice shook told him how upset she was. He offered reassurances but he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d convinced her. \u201cDavid\u2019s bluffing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just another scheme of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe that.\u201d She gazed up at him, tears glittering on her lashes. \u201cBut I can\u2019t be a hundred percent certain and neither can you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could beat him up for you,\u201d Mack said, half-humorously.</p><p>Mary Jo punched his arm playfully.</p><p>\u201cHave you discussed any of this with Allan Harris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy legal situation is complicated, he says, because I\u2019ve acknowledged David as the father and the DNA test confirmed it. Plus, he has parental rights and he claims he wants to exercise them. So...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cAllan tells me we\u2019d be in for a protracted court battle.\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded grimly. This was what he\u2019d feared.</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2019s going to miss you so much,\u201d Mary Jo said tearfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about her mother?\u201d Mack needed to know she\u2019d miss him, too.</p><p>Looking away, Mary Jo gave a slight shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you could what?\u201d</p><p>Avoiding his glance, she whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could ever trust a man again, but I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Although Mack was grateful for that much, he wanted more. He wanted her love. Before he could formulate an appropriate response, the phone rang and a panicky feeling trapped the breath in his lungs.</p><p>Mary Jo stood up to answer, but Mack stopped her, catching her hand. \u201cLet me get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cIt might be David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d She seemed to collapse onto the sofa.</p><p>Mack marched across the room and grabbed the receiver. \u201cWyse residence,\u201d he said in his most official voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing at my sister\u2019s place?\u201d Linc demanded rudely. At least he wasn\u2019t David.</p><p>Mack answered that question with one of his own. \u201cHow quickly can you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk. The three of us.\u201d Mack wasn\u2019t interested in relaying the details over the phone.</p><p>\u201cGive me two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Noelle was wailing in the background; Mary Jo leaped to her feet and hurried into the baby\u2019s room. Mack followed, standing in the doorway. He watched as she took the infant from her crib, then efficiently changed her diaper. Noelle turned her head and gazed at Mack while her mother dressed her. She cooed contentedly and waved her arms.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone?\u201d Mary Jo asked. \u201cMy brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was Linc. He\u2019ll be here in a couple of hours. Probably around eight.\u201d</p><p>Mack grinned at the baby, utterly enchanted by her. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of not having her and Mary Jo in his life anymore. Yes, he could visit them in Seattle, but it wouldn\u2019t be the same.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I take you to an early dinner,\u201d Mack suggested. \u201cYou could use a distraction for an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat. Thanks, anyway.\u201d She lifted Noelle into her arms and walked toward him. \u201cYou go ahead, if you want.\u201d But even as she spoke, she reached for his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was deeply gratified to know she didn\u2019t mean what she\u2019d said. She wanted him with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d He meant more than she realized he was saying.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Mary Jo sounded both relieved and embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here with you and we\u2019ll wait for Linc.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo sent him a grateful look. \u201cThank you,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He held out his arms for Noelle, and Mary Jo handed him the baby who settled instantly in his embrace. He smiled down at her, tickling her chin with his index finger. Outwardly he remained calm, but he was thinking furiously, wondering exactly what he should say to Mary Jo\u2014and how he should say it.</p><p>\u201cI should start packing,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mack raised one hand, stopping her. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have an idea that might work.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat kind of idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn idea that\u2019ll let you stay in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Her expression grew hopeful. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Mack gathered his resolve. \u201cYou could marry me.\u201d</p><p>The color seemed to drain from her face, and for a few seconds he was afraid she might faint.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, terrified that she\u2019d reject him outright. His heart felt as if it had shot into his throat and lodged there.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo leaned against the wall. \u201cThat won\u2019t solve anything,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mack disagreed. \u201cThe next time David comes around, he\u2019ll be dealing with me, your husband. He\u2019ll be speaking to both of us. Trust me, if he does try this trick again, it\u2019ll be the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to marry me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would give me the authority to tell him to stay away from my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll legally adopt Noelle.\u201d He watched as her eyes flared with what he assumed was happiness. Then almost immediately her face fell.</p><p>\u201cDavid won\u2019t let you adopt Noelle, especially if he\u2019s planning to use her to manipulate his father for funds.\u201d</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll surrender his rights if we pressure him for child support. We could probably prove without too much trouble that he\u2019s an unfit father.\u201d Mack suspected that as soon as David Rhodes realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to use his daughter as leverage against Mary Jo and his father, he\u2019d be willing to sign over all parental rights.</p><p>Mary Jo seemed to consider his proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s...very nice of you to offer.\u201d</p><p>She was going to reject him. Mack held himself rigid, bracing for her next words.</p><p>She must have sensed his disappointment because she quickly added, \u201cI need time to think about this.\u201d</p><p>Mack checked his watch. \u201cYou have an hour and twenty-five minutes.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to make this sound like an ultimatum, but there was a practical reason for the time limit.</p><p>She obviously understood what it was. \u201cBefore Linc arrives?\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to explain all this to him, so he\u2019s comfortable with me as his brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d</p><p>Mack expelled his breath. He didn\u2019t want to contemplate that possibility. He\u2019d deal with it if he had to and would volunteer his protection and friendship regardless, but...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you will agree to marry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned away from him and her shoulders rose, then fell. \u201cFirst my brothers and now you! Why do all of you feel you know what\u2019s best for me and Noelle?\u201d</p><p>Mack closed his eyes and recognized that he\u2019d gone about this wrong, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to rectify his blunder. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for you. The problem is, I don\u2019t think I could bear to live without you and Noelle.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to look at him, her face tense. She met his gaze, her eyes dark and speculative. Finally she nodded. She\u2019d reached a decision. \u201cOkay. But I want to wait six months and...and this is important. I won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNot while we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll stay in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>That lightened his mood. Still, there was this six-month engagement she was insisting on. \u201cWhy wait that long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll give both of us enough time to decide if a marriage will work. At the end of six months, we can reevaluate. If there\u2019s no physical contact between us, it would be easier for either one of us to break off the engagement and walk away.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s mouth went dry. He didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I assume our arrangement\u2019s off or do we wait six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, if that\u2019s how you want it.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo relaxed and held out her hand for him to shake. \u201cThen we agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecoming engaged is serious, Mack. \u2018I guess\u2019 is not a sufficient answer.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed tightly. It was either accept her terms or risk losing her and Noelle. The baby gurgled and smiled up at him. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do this your way,\u201d he muttered and they shook hands.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re engaged,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>Engaged. To the woman he loved. But it seemed more like a business deal\u2014and not a very advantageous one, either.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go through with this?\u201d Linc felt obliged to ask. He and Lori Bellamy stood in front of the Kitsap County Courthouse nearly three weeks after their initial meeting. Their hands were tightly clasped. Linc wore his best suit. Fact was, he only had the one suit\u2014and he might be wearing it a second time this year at Mary Jo\u2019s wedding. Her engagement to Mack McAfee wasn\u2019t a complete surprise, and it did give him a certain measure of reassurance.</p><p>Lori was so beautiful in her pink dress it was an effort not to stare. She responded with a delicate nod. \u201cI\u2019m ready if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes connected with his. \u201cDid you tell your brothers? And your sister?\u201d</p><p>Linc shook his head. He didn\u2019t feel it was necessary for his brothers to know just yet.</p><p>\u201cYou have the license?\u201d</p><p>Linc patted his suit pocket. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Linc had forgotten all about that. \u201cSomeone from the judge\u2019s office can stand up for us.\u201d</p><p>Lori swallowed hard and looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone because I knew if I did, everyone would try to talk me out of it.\u201d She blushed slightly, her right hand clutching the small bouquet he\u2019d bought her. \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Linc wanted a wife, an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d woman who shared his values and wanted to make their family her career, at least while their children were young. Although he didn\u2019t know Lori well, what he did know suited him just fine. They\u2019d had a number of intense conversations, mostly on the phone.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone knew I\u2019d agreed to marry a man I\u2019d seen a total of four times, they\u2019d think I was mentally unbalanced.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cCan I ask you something before we go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc...\u201d She turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Linc had been afraid she might ask this, and he wished he knew what she wanted to hear, what she expected him to say. As tempting as it was to lie, he didn\u2019t feel that would be a good start to their marriage.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, then immediately qualified his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t love you yet, but I like you more every time we talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk a lot, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Every day, which pleased him. They needed to lay the groundwork for their relationship, set everything in place and work out any disagreements before they said their vows. As a result of their lengthy conversations, he\u2019d made concessions and so had she. He felt that marrying this woman was the right decision, despite their short acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cI put in an offer on a commercial property off Harbor Street\u2014the one we talked about.\u201d</p><p>Lori suddenly averted her eyes. \u201cMy father owns that piece of land. I didn\u2019t know until recently.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t complicate the situation as far as Linc could see. \u201cI offered a fair price,\u201d he said.</p><p>As soon as they were married, Linc intended to move to Cedar Cove and set up his own car repair business. He\u2019d move in with Lori until they found a place of their own. Lori said she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable in Seattle; she preferred to live in a small town. She worked at a dress shop in nearby Silverdale and would continue to do so until they had their first child. Linc believed he could make a success of his new business. He planned to become a silent partner in Three Wyse Men, the family repair shop, leaving its day-to-day operation to Mel and Ned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not changing my mind about our marriage,\u201d Lori assured him again.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Linc squeezed her hand. Together they walked up the steps to the courthouse.</p><p>The ceremony itself was shockingly brief. It hardly seemed legal that they could be practically strangers one minute and married the next.</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t expected the emotion that overcame him when the judge pronounced them husband and wife. In that instant, he experienced a rush of tenderness for Lori that nearly brought tears to his eyes. He was baffled by it, and a little embarrassed, too.</p><p>He realized with astonishment that if he hadn\u2019t stopped to help her that night, none of this would be happening. It would\u2019ve been an ordinary Friday afternoon.</p><p>Lori didn\u2019t say anything, either, and he wondered if she\u2019d felt the emotions he had. If so, she didn\u2019t mention it. In fact, neither of them had anything to say until they were seated in Linc\u2019s truck.</p><p>Lori smiled at him. \u201cHello, husband,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Linc returned her smile. \u201cHello, wife.\u201d</p><p>Wife. What a powerful word that was. A word that said companion, friend, partner...lover.</p><p>As he started the engine, he asked, \u201cIs there anyplace you\u2019d like to go first?\u201d It was a few minutes before five.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have an early dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Linc hid his disappointment. He\u2019d hoped she\u2019d suggest they go straight to her place. He\u2019d brought his suitcase and wanted to unpack, settle in before...He\u2019d been looking forward to sleeping with Lori. So far, their physical relationship consisted of a few less-than-chaste kisses. Her response to their tentative lovemaking had led him to believe they\u2019d definitely be sexually compatible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to my sister before we do that,\u201d Linc said, trying to take his mind off their wedding night.</p><p>\u201cYou mean now or...after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lori slid a bit closer and placed her hand on his arm.</p><p>Linc enjoyed having her touch him even in the most casual way. When she\u2019d asked if he loved her, before the wedding, he\u2019d been as honest as he knew how to be in his response. Now he asked himself if the tenderness he felt, this joyful expectation, could be love. He hoped so. He wanted to love Lori. He was excited about having children with her. She\u2019d be a good mother and he intended to be a good father.</p><p>The courthouse wasn\u2019t far from his sister\u2019s duplex. When he parked there, he saw Mack working outside, pruning some forsythia bushes. Mack was the kind of guy who always found something to do. If he wasn\u2019t painting or doing repairs, he was puttering in his garage or gardening.</p><p>Mack and Linc had talked the previous week regarding Mack\u2019s relationship with Mary Jo. Linc felt his sister had made a smart choice when she agreed to marry him. He\u2019d come to like Mack and believed the other man would not only look after Noelle, he\u2019d do what he could to keep David Rhodes from using his daughter to manipulate Ben.</p> <p>Mack met him as Linc opened the passenger door and helped Lori out. His soon-to-be brother-in-law sent him a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cMack McAfee, this is my wife, Lori.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cYour wife?\u201d</p><p>Lori moved closer to Linc\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Mary Jo know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. We stopped by to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Mack stared at them both.</p><p>The door to Mary Jo\u2019s half of the duplex opened and when she saw Linc in his suit\u2014with Lori beside him\u2014she frowned. She looked at Mack for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s got news,\u201d Mack said, standing back, his fingers in the pockets of his jeans.</p> <p>Mary Jo returned her attention to Linc, who placed his arm around his wife. \u201cMary Jo,\u201d he said formally, \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet your new sister-in-law, Lori Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori Wyse,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s mouth sagged open, much the way Mack\u2019s had. \u201cYou\u2019re married? The two of you?\u201d</p><p>Linc grinned sheepishly and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say a word about this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo anyone.\u201d Linc wanted her to understand that she hadn\u2019t been excluded. \u201cThe boys don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Mary Jo turned to face Lori. \u201cYou really married my brother?\u201d</p><p>Lori nodded. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Linc echoed. When Lori had asked him if he loved her, it\u2019d never occurred to him that she might be that sure about her own feelings, especially this soon.</p><p>\u201cShe must love you,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cWell, come on in. Your name is Lori?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lori broke away from his side and followed Mary Jo into the house.</p><p>Linc remained outside with Mack. He inclined his head toward the door. \u201cMary Jo\u2019s not upset, is she?\u201d</p><p>Mack lifted his hand in a gesture that suggested Linc\u2019s guess was as good as his. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re both more surprised than anything. You could\u2019ve said something, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have,\u201d Linc agreed, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mack laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019d been willing to wait, we might have had a double wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to wait.\u201d Linc kicked at the grass with the tip of his shoe, then figured he might as well disclose the other changes he planned to make. \u201cI\u2019m moving to Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s nod didn\u2019t reveal anything one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cLori,\u201d he suddenly said. \u201cLori Bellamy. She\u2019s the ex-fianc\u00e9e of that guy who used to work for Allen Harris\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Linc interrupted sharply. \u201cBut that\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>Mark nodded again. \u201cWhat are your plans now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be moving in with Lori right away and making the commute to Seattle until Mel and Ned feel okay about running things on their own.\u201d Privately, Linc had set a time limit of two months.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting an offshoot of the business here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lori?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll continue working until she gets pregnant.\u201d Linc intended to do his part to make sure that happened as quickly as possible. \u201cAfter the baby\u2019s born, she wants to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo wants to keep her job,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise Linc. He just hoped Mack understood what he was letting himself in for when he married her. He\u2019d never known a woman more obstinate than his little sister.</p><p>The two men went into the house and Lori smiled at Linc. \u201cI invited Mary Jo and Mack to join us for our wedding dinner.\u201d</p><p>Linc forced a smile in response. \u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother would welcome the opportunity to babysit Noelle,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to phone her?\u201d Mary Jo asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Not five minutes later, the whole dinner party was arranged. Reservations were made at a place called D.D.\u2019s on the Cove, after which they all drove over to the McAfees\u2019 house to drop off Noelle. At Mack\u2019s suggestion, Linc and Lori waited in the truck; then they headed to the restaurant for their six-thirty reservation.</p><p>Linc would\u2019ve preferred dinner with just Lori. However, he\u2019d acceded to her wishes. Mack ordered champagne, which went straight to Linc\u2019s head. Come to think of it, he hadn\u2019t eaten since early that morning. When the food arrived, he was the first to finish his meal.</p><p>The others didn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry. He yawned several times as a broad hint that they should wind things up, but no one noticed his impatience. When they were finally ready to go, Lori announced, \u201cI need you to drive me back to Mary Jo\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Linc sat with his key in the ignition and turned to look at her. \u201cYou do?\u201d He couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment. \u201cWhy?\u201d He wondered if Lori was making excuses to delay their wedding night.</p><p>\u201cShe has something for me,\u201d Lori explained, gently patting his knee. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he followed Mack and his sister back to the McAfees\u2019 house to get Noelle, which meant another ten-minute delay.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this thing my sister has for you?\u201d Linc demanded as they waited in the car. \u201cCan\u2019t you get it some other time?\u201d</p><p>Lori gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay...It\u2019s a special nightgown for our wedding night. It\u2019s from France and it\u2019s black silk. I...should\u2019ve planned for this\u2014only, well, I didn\u2019t and now I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where exactly did my sister get this?\u201d Frankly Linc didn\u2019t like the idea of Mary Jo passing off some secondhand nightgown to Lori.</p><p>\u201cShe said a friend gave it to her when it seemed she was going to marry Noelle\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t very well broadcast his intention of removing this fancy French nightgown ten seconds after she put it on, so he answered with a halfhearted shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything about tonight is important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Linc admitted.</p><p>After Noelle had been loaded into Mack\u2019s car, Linc drove to the duplex on Evergreen Place. Lori hopped out of the truck, ran inside with Mary Jo and was back in less than five minutes.</p><p>By the time she returned she was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister. I like her. We\u2019re going to be good friends.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful, just wonderful. \u201cYou got that nightgown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d She balanced the box on her lap. \u201cMary Jo wanted me to tell you it\u2019s her wedding gift to you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Following Lori\u2019s instructions, he drove to her apartment building and parked in the lot. He came around to help her out, then reached into the back for his suitcase. They walked toward the building arm in arm.</p><p>He\u2019d never been to her apartment so he hadn\u2019t realized how delicate and feminine it was, although he probably should\u2019ve expected it. There were floral prints on the walls and the white sofa was decorated with a variety of pink pillows in varying sizes and fabrics. The kitchen was one that would make Martha Stewart proud. That was fine by Linc. He was thoroughly tired of his brothers\u2019 cooking, not to mention his own.</p><p>\u201cShould I put this in the bedroom?\u201d he asked, grabbing his suitcase. The idea was to steer Lori in that direction as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Linc was in and out of the room in two seconds flat. \u201cThe bed\u2019s got a canopy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>As far as he was concerned, this should\u2019ve been revealed long before their wedding night. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep under a canopy.\u201d Call him silly or macho or anything you wanted; it was something he just couldn\u2019t tolerate.</p><p>Lori said nothing. After a moment she gestured helplessly. \u201cI only have the one bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, we\u2019ll sleep on the sofa tonight.\u201d</p><p>She studied him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. Maybe he had. One thing was certain: he wasn\u2019t sleeping in pink sheets with a froufrou canopy over his head. It would make him feel like...like he\u2019d charged into the private domain of some princess.</p><p>Without commenting Lori disappeared inside the bedroom and quietly closed the door. Linc didn\u2019t follow. Sitting down on the sofa, he picked up a magazine and started to flip through the pages.</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice how many minutes passed before she came back, and when she did, the issue of Home and Garden slipped from his fingers and fell to the carpet.</p><p>Lori posed in the bedroom doorway, wearing a little piece of black silk. A little piece of nothing. Something seemed to be stuck in his throat as he tried not to stare. It didn\u2019t work. He couldn\u2019t look anywhere but at her.</p><p>\u201cMy sofa doesn\u2019t turn into a bed, Linc,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf we sleep there, we\u2019ll both be uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Sofa? What sofa?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the canopy comes down in the morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded several times and still had trouble swallowing.</p><p>Lori held out her hand and Linc stood and walked toward her. She smiled up at him, her eyes filled with love.</p><p>Bending down, he slid his arms around her and half lifted her from the floor before lowering his mouth to hers. She threw her arms around his neck and returned his kiss with a soft, welcoming moan.</p><p>Oh, yes, it was a good thing they were married.</p><p>Then he picked her up in his arms and carried her over the threshold of her bedroom, old-fashioned to the last.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>The phone woke Christie out of a deep sleep. Only after several rings did she realize the irritating sound wasn\u2019t part of some dream. Blindly, she fumbled for the receiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said groggily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d She didn\u2019t recognize the voice.</p><p>Christie sat up and shook the hair out of her face. \u201cTime? Time for what? Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby.\u201d</p> <p>Instantly Christie was wide awake, her heart clamoring. \u201cAre you telling me Teri\u2019s in labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her brother-in-law sounded odd, nothing like his normal self.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the birthing center in Silverdale.\u201d His answer was clipped and, most alarming of all, fearful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Teri hadn\u2019t quite reached thirty-four weeks; thirty-six would have been more favorable. A couple of days before, Christie had been to visit her. Teri had, in her own words, looked as big as a house and felt about as uncomfortable as a migraine. Her ankles had swollen and she complained bitterly about the no-salt diet her obstetrician had put her on. Despite her discomfort, it\u2019d been a good visit. The subject of James hadn\u2019t come up even once. That helped.</p> <p>\u201cYes, too early...Teri\u2019s afraid,\u201d Bobby continued. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to lose the babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Christie wasn\u2019t sure what she could do; all she knew was that she had to be with Teri and Bobby. Her sister needed her and Bobby did, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The relief in his voice was palpable.</p><p>Christie nearly leaped out of bed and threw on yesterday\u2019s clothes. She didn\u2019t bother with makeup and took only long enough to run a brush through her hair.</p><p>Teri was having the babies.</p><p>A surge of emotion blasted through her, and she felt like a rocket launched into space. A few minutes earlier she\u2019d been dead to the world. Now she flew around the room, getting ready and, strangest of all, fighting back tears.</p> <p>Christie wasn\u2019t a weeper. Oh, she lowered her guard on occasion, but it wasn\u2019t something she made a habit of doing. If she was going to let herself cry every time she experienced emotional distress, she should buy stock in a tissue company.</p><p>Ten minutes after Bobby\u2019s phone call, Christie slammed out the door. She suspected the only reason she didn\u2019t get a speeding ticket on the thirty-five-minute drive to Silverdale was the time\u20142:15 a.m. She took up two parking spaces when she screeched into the lot, then jumped out of the car as if it\u2019d burst into flames.</p><p>When she exploded into the foyer at the birthing center she found James Wilbur pacing the area, waiting for her.</p><p>Christie stopped cold. In her rush to get to Teri, she\u2019d forgotten about James. Of course he\u2019d be at the hospital. He would\u2019ve driven Teri and Bobby there.</p><p>\u201cI have your badge information filled out for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to check your identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA badge?\u201d Her mouth felt dry as she struggled to hide her reaction to seeing him again. It\u2019d been weeks since they\u2019d last spoken. She\u2019d only recently begun to win the battle of keeping thoughts of him at bay.</p><p>\u201cBefore you\u2019re allowed in the birthing area,\u201d he said in dispassionate tones, \u201cyou have to be cleared. As soon as you show your identification, you can have the badge. Without it you won\u2019t be admitted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She reached for her purse, took out her driver\u2019s license and was issued the badge.</p> <p>Once it was in her hand, James said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d All of a sudden she sounded the way Bobby had on the phone\u2014anxious, uncertain, afraid.</p><p>James nodded toward the receptionist, who buzzed them through the double doors. He led Christie down the hallway to a waiting area outside the labor rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Of course. So apparently she\u2019d been delegated to sit and wait for news with James. That wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except it meant she\u2019d have to be in the same small space with him.</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, then broke eye contact. \u201cI\u2019ll let Bobby know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thanks.\u201d Christie sat down on the sofa, sliding to the edge of the cushion, and nervously rubbed her hands.</p><p>James returned with Bobby. Her brother-in-law looked terrible. Christie had never seen anyone with less color. Bobby seemed about to collapse.</p><p>She got up and walked over to hug him. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she said, although she had no assurance of that.</p><p>\u201cTeri\u2019s in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t let the doctors give her anything....\u201d</p><p>Christie couldn\u2019t keep from smiling. Knowing her stubborn sister, Teri was probably swearing a blue streak.</p><p>Bobby continued, his hands clenched at his sides. \u201cThe doctors don\u2019t want anyone in the room but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right outside,\u201d Christie promised. \u201cJust keep me updated, okay?\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoes Teri want me to call our mother?\u201d</p><p>Bobby shook his head. \u201cAfter, maybe, but not now.\u201d</p><p>Christie was in full accord with that decision, although she felt she had to make the offer. Teri hadn\u2019t seen or talked to their mother since Christmas. Neither had Christie, and in her opinion, it was just as well that Ruth had stayed out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Christie told him. \u201cGive Teri my love and tell her I\u2019m in the waiting area if she needs anything.\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded again.</p><p>\u201cGive her my love, too,\u201d James added.</p><p>Bobby hugged Christie, waved at James and returned to the labor room. When he opened the door, Christie heard her sister swearing.</p><p>James grinned at her\u2014and, despite herself, Christie smiled back.</p><p>They sat in the small waiting room across from each other. In an effort to avoid conversation, Christie picked up a magazine. It sported a Christmas tree on the cover. After flipping idly through the pages, she set it aside and looked at her watch. It was just after three.</p><p>When she took a chance and glanced up, she found James studying her. He turned away but not before she caught him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded irritably.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d If James had something to say, he might as well spit it out, otherwise they\u2019d both be on edge.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me as well as you think you do. I wouldn\u2019t have asked if I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cFine. You asked, so I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d His eyes met hers. \u201cI was just thinking how much I love you, how much I wish it was you in that labor room, having our baby.\u201d He looked down at his hands. \u201cI was kicking myself for being such a fool and not realizing what I had with you and how much I regret ruining everything.\u201d</p><p>James was right about one thing\u2014she didn\u2019t want to hear it. Men had said almost identical words to her before and she\u2019d wanted to believe them. Then, each time, she\u2019d finally recognized that it had all been a spiel, an attempt to get what they wanted\u2014which was exactly what she\u2019d given them. Christie was determined not to fall victim to her own weakness again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>His shoulders sank and he looked away. When he spoke again, his voice was sad. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>After that, neither spoke for what felt like hours. James stood and walked out of the waiting room. Christie felt strangely bereft without his presence. She was afraid he wouldn\u2019t return but about ten minutes later he strolled back, carrying two cups of steaming coffee. He handed her one of them, and she thanked him.</p><p>Then Bobby appeared, looking even worse than before. \u201cThey say the labor\u2019s not progressing.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem possible that he could be any paler and yet he was.</p><p>\u201cThey decided to do a caesarean,\u201d he said next. \u201cThey\u2019ve already taken Teri into surgery.... I can\u2019t go with her. The doctor said they\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll be in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you stay with Teri?\u201d The situation must be serious.</p><p>\u201cI can wait outside the operating room\u2014but I wanted to let you know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Christie whispered. For the first time she was truly afraid for her sister.</p><p>Bobby left and she slowly sank back into her chair. James took the one beside her. Again they didn\u2019t speak, but after several minutes he reached for her hand.</p><p>Christie knew she should pull away, but she craved the comfort of his touch. As they locked their fingers together, heat seemed to radiate up her arm...and through her entire body.</p><p>\u201cTeri and the babies will be fine,\u201d Christie whispered. \u201cMy sister\u2019s a trouper.\u201d</p><p>Apparently James had nothing to add and after a moment she leaned her head against his shoulder. Then his arm slipped all the way around her....</p><p>After another thirty or forty minutes, Bobby raced back into the waiting room, flapping his arms like a bird about to take flight. \u201cThree boys!\u201d he cried. \u201cPerfect, small...but alive. They\u2019re being put in a preemie machine.... Teri\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames?\u201d Christie managed to ask as she leaped to her feet. Her sight had blurred with tears.</p><p>\u201cNames, names...Oh, yes, names. Robbie, for me, Jimmy for James and Christopher for Christie.\u201d Grinning, he hurried back to rejoin his wife and three sons.</p><p>Instinctively Christie turned to James. At the same time he turned toward her and then, without even knowing who moved first, they were in each other\u2019s arms, clinging hard.</p><p>\u201cI knew everything would be all right,\u201d Christie said with a sob. The truth was, she hadn\u2019t known and had been frantic with worry.</p><p>\u201cA little boy named after me,\u201d James whispered into her hair. It seemed almost more than he could take in.</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d Christie felt the same way. She\u2019d never dreamed her sister would do something like this. Teri was close to their brother, Johnny, and Christie had assumed that if she was going to name any of the triplets after a family member, it would be him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Bobby, too,\u201d James said.</p><p>Bobby was elated. He wasn\u2019t one to openly display his feelings, but he did now. The love and joy in his face was enough to reduce Christie to another embarrassing rush of tears. She wiped them from her cheeks, using both hands, as James continued to hold her.</p><p>\u201cA boy named Jimmy.\u201d His voice was awed.</p><p>They still clung to each other and neither seemed willing to let go first. Christie rested her head against James\u2019s chest. She heard the strong, even beat of his heart. James had come back\u2014to Teri and Bobby, to her. He wasn\u2019t like the other men in her life.</p><p>Just when Christie was about to speak, they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>James released her and Christie turned to see Rachel Peyton, Teri\u2019s friend from the salon.</p><p>\u201cDid Teri have the babies?\u201d Rachel asked eagerly.</p><p>Christie broke into a wide grin. \u201cThree boys. Bobby came to tell us a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall but perfect,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact weights. Bobby was too excited to give us any more details.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out Teri was in labor?\u201d she asked, curious to learn who had contacted Rachel.</p><p>\u201cI phoned her,\u201d James said. \u201cTeri asked me to.\u201d</p><p>As if her legs were no longer able to support her, Rachel staggered to a chair and sat down.</p> <p>Christie crouched beside her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Rachel pressed her hand to her heart. \u201cI...I thought I was going to pass out.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s friend looked ill. When she closed her eyes, Christie glanced at James, who nodded, obviously aware of what she meant. He left and came back a few minutes later with a nurse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Rachel insisted, although she seemed anything but fine.</p><p>The nurse escorted her into an examining room, and once again James and Christie were alone.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve worked an eight-hour shift,\u201d Christie said, suddenly exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d His smile held her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI...I should probably go home and make a few phone calls.\u201d But Christie didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>James put his arm around her waist. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Indecision kept her silent.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he cajoled. \u201cStay a bit longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would like to see the babies,\u201d she murmured. That was true, but it wasn\u2019t the only reason she felt inclined to linger.</p><p>\u201cLittle Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Christopher,\u201d Christie said, grinning wildly.</p><p>James brought her even closer to his side.</p><p>They walked down the corridor like that, and after a long sigh, Christie looked up at James. \u201cIf you ever leave me again, I\u2019ll...I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do, but I guarantee you it won\u2019t be pleasant. Furthermore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever leave you again,\u201d James broke in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, James. I can\u2019t take the pain.\u201d</p><p>He faced her and set his hands squarely on her shoulders. His eyes grew dark and grave. \u201cI\u2019m serious, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to finish my schooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to help you achieve your dreams, Christie. A man does that for the woman he loves.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been prepared for an argument. He didn\u2019t offer one. Her gaze steadily held his. \u201cI want babies of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies of our own. And I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so agreeable,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt confuses me and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He silenced her with a kiss, right there in the hospital hallway. Christie\u2019s arms slid up his chest and looped around his neck as she returned his kiss.</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d he asked in a husky voice when they drew apart.</p><p>Christie nestled into his embrace. \u201cNot if they all arrive at once.\u201d On second thought, she mused, that might not be so bad.</p><p>James rubbed his hand down the length of her back. \u201cWe\u2019ll have beautiful babies.\u201d</p><p>She remembered his remark about beautiful babies the day he\u2019d come to the tavern. It was why she\u2019d run after him...\u201cYes, we will,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He kissed the tip of he nose. \u201cBut they won\u2019t play chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can if they want to,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, \u201cif they want to play, they can.\u201d</p><p>The nurse who\u2019d led Rachel away returned. \u201cI\u2019ve called your friend\u2019s husband,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Christie asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Rachel said, a few steps behind the other woman. She seemed about to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Christie hurried after her into the waiting room.</p><p>Rachel sat down and buried her face in her hands. \u201cThis can\u2019t be true. It just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s friend dropped her hands and glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Christie said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI should be happy, but...we\u2019d decided not to have a baby right away and then there\u2019s Jolene. She isn\u2019t ready to deal with this. We promised we\u2019d give her time to get used to us being married first. We promised. I should\u2019ve gone on the pill, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d Looking from Christie to James, she shook her head. \u201cThis is what happens. I told Bruce we were playing Russian roulette, but he was so sure we were safe....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex!\u201d Rachel exclaimed. \u201cThis is what happens when you have the most wonderful sex...in the middle of the afternoon. We\u2019ve been meeting at noon\u2014oh, you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>James tightened his grip on Christie and whispered, \u201cIs it noon yet?\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, despite her worry about Rachel, Christie smiled.</p><p>A moment later, Rachel smiled, too....</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re engaged?\u201d Linnette McAfee shouted over the phone.</p><p>Mack knew this would shock his sister\u2014just like it would shock his parents once he told them. The engagement felt...He searched for the right word. Strange, he decided. Yes, strange. And awkward, too.</p><p>In the short time since they\u2019d become engaged, things had changed between Mack and Mary Jo, and not for the better. Instead of drawing the two of them together, it seemed to have driven them apart.</p><p>Ever since that night two weeks ago, Mary Jo had gone out of her way to avoid him. Mack didn\u2019t understand it. He\u2019d accepted her stipulation. Nonetheless she seemed to believe that Mack would treat her as badly as Rhodes had. That told Mack she didn\u2019t really know him or trust him, although she claimed she did.</p><p>Another equally unpleasant possibility was that she didn\u2019t actually care for him and was just using him as protection against David Rhodes. He was perfectly willing to play that role and had said as much. But pride\u2014and his own feelings for her\u2014demanded that Mary Jo marry him for reasons other than fear.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t even heard that you were dating anyone,\u201d Linnette said, breaking into his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mary Jo Wyse and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she the woman who had the baby on Christmas Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I delivered Noelle and we\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>His sister cut him off a second time. \u201cTell me again why you haven\u2019t said anything to Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncomplicate it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, David Rhodes, Noelle\u2019s birth father, is threatening to go for custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t now that I\u2019m in the picture, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Linnette said in that irritating big-sister way. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to marry her to keep David Rhodes out of her life. Obviously, there\u2019s more to this story than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>Maybe informing Linnette that he was engaged hadn\u2019t been such a good idea, after all.</p><p>\u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t a hundred percent convinced she returns your feelings?\u201d</p><p>Apparently his sister possessed some form of psychic ability because she\u2019d immediately homed in on the one subject Mack wanted to avoid.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid she\u2019s using you to keep Noelle\u2019s father at bay?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she continued. \u201cMack...do you love her that much?\u201d</p><p>Mack sat on a kitchen stool with his cell pressed tightly against his ear. He closed his eyes and whispered, \u201cYeah, I love her that much.\u201d It would be a whole lot easier if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mack, you\u2019ve got it bad.\u201d</p><p>One thing Mack didn\u2019t want was his sister\u2019s sympathy. He regretted even telling her what was going on between him and Mary Jo. And yet...he felt at such a loss to explain this new tension between them. He\u2019d hoped Linnette might offer him some insight. Some explanation.</p><p>Since their engagement, Mary Jo had barely looked at him. It used to be that she\u2019d often invite him to dinner on the nights he wasn\u2019t at the station. In the past two weeks he hadn\u2019t been to her place even once.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t all. Before they became engaged, they\u2019d played UNO and other card games. They\u2019d talked every day. They\u2019d laughed together. From the moment they\u2019d discussed marriage, she\u2019d treated him as if he had some communicable disease.</p><p>\u201cOkay, little brother, if you honestly feel that way, then why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Linnette said. \u201cAnswer my question first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. If you must know, Mary Jo agreed to marry me but she insisted on a six-month engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months? Well, that\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also insisted there be no...physical contact between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Mack was not repeating that information. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d Just saying the words out loud convinced him Mary Jo didn\u2019t care the way he did. He was a means to an end. He would protect her and Noelle so Rhodes couldn\u2019t threaten her. And the worst of it was...he\u2019d suggested it himself.</p><p>\u201cNothing...physical for six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo felt that would give us time to get to know each other\u2014or so she said,\u201d he grumbled. That excuse seemed lame in light of the recent awkwardness between them.</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t...you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you about your love life, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but maybe you should.\u201d</p><p>Mack let her comment slide.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d his sister said, \u201cMary Jo has some real trust issues. I can\u2019t blame her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even met her,\u201d Mack reminded Linnette. But what she\u2019d said was true. Mary Jo did have trust issues; she\u2019d admitted it and the reasons were obvious. That, however, didn\u2019t explain the change in her attitude since she\u2019d agreed to marry him.</p><p>\u201cFor someone who\u2019s about to become a husband and father, you don\u2019t sound very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. The fact is, I\u2019m not sure why I told you. No one else knows except Mary Jo\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me because I\u2019m your big sister and you want advice\u2014only you won\u2019t come right out and ask for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I that transparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. All of this would be easier if he didn\u2019t have such strong feelings for Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know your real name is Jerome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d He\u2019d insisted on being called Mack from the time he was in grade school. He\u2019d been named for his paternal grandfather, and while Mack had loved his grandpa Jerry, he wasn\u2019t fond of the name.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to tell Mom and Dad?\u201d Linnette asked. \u201cThey\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tentative as the situation between him and Mary Jo was, Mack didn\u2019t feel he could involve his parents. He slouched against the kitchen counter and rested his elbows there. \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t figured that out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack, if Mom finds out from someone else, she\u2019ll be devastated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Although that wasn\u2019t likely to happen.</p><p>\u201cSo will Dad.\u201d</p><p>Mack knew that, too. In hindsight, he wished he\u2019d already mentioned the engagement to his parents.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I understand why you want to keep it a secret,\u201d Linnette surprised him by saying.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. You want to wait until you\u2019re certain she wants to go through with the wedding. The way things stand right now, you\u2019re feeling hesitant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me who\u2019s hesitant. It\u2019s Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>No question. \u201cVery sure.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Linnette asked, \u201cCan I trust you with a secret, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His sister, however, had never really kept secrets. She\u2019d always been the model student and the good daughter, whereas Mack and his father often fought. It worried him that keeping his engagement from his parents threatened the truce he\u2019d established with his father. He\u2019d risked a great deal for Mary Jo and his biggest fear was that it was all for nothing.</p> <p>When Linnette wasn\u2019t immediately forthcoming, Mack said, \u201cSo what\u2019s your big secret?\u201d</p><p>His sister\u2019s voice dropped so low he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cSay that again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I will. I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecember twenty-ninth. On the drive back from Cedar Cove to North Dakota after Christmas, Pete and I took a detour to Las Vegas. Neither of us had ever been before and it was sheer craziness.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, we couldn\u2019t find even one hotel room, let alone two, and when we finally managed to locate a room\u2014there was just the one. That\u2019s when Pete said he didn\u2019t care what the advertisements said\u2014what happens in Vegas doesn\u2019t necessarily stay there, so we got a wedding license and got married the same day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married Pete?\u201d His sister barely knew the farmer, although it was obvious he\u2019d fallen for her, and fallen hard. Anyone with eyes in his head couldn\u2019t possibly miss that. Linnette had been more circumspect, especially around their parents, but she must\u2019ve felt the same way. \u201cYou married him because you could only find one hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette, that\u2019s insane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow just a minute, little brother. If that\u2019s not calling the kettle black, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p><p>She had him there. Mack wanted to argue and tell her she hadn\u2019t known Pete nearly long enough. He wanted to say she had better sense than this. Besides, less than a year ago she\u2019d been crazy in love with Cal Washburn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married a lot longer than Mary Jo and I have been engaged. Why keep it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Linnette exhaled slowly. \u201cI figured Mom and Dad would be disappointed that I hadn\u2019t gone for the big wedding, so Pete and I decided there was no reason to say anything right away. I promised Mom I\u2019d be home this summer, and I thought we could have a second wedding there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not tell them now? They like Pete. It isn\u2019t like they\u2019re going to be upset about who you married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Linnette agreed. \u201cBut I was afraid they\u2019d think I married Pete on the rebound. I didn\u2019t. I genuinely love him and, living so far away, it\u2019s not hard to keep it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you plan to do? Say nothing and just go ahead with a second wedding?\u201d</p><p>Linnette sighed deeply. \u201cI haven\u2019t got that part worked out yet. Getting married on the spur of the moment isn\u2019t as simple as it seems.\u201d</p><p>Mack could sympathize.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for almost four months, and Pete keeps asking when I\u2019m going to tell my family. It was so easy to delay it and now...now it\u2019s been so long. Mack, I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t have any advice to give her, considering that he\u2019d phoned her with his own troubles, looking for help. \u201cI don\u2019t know, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset with us, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I couldn\u2019t be happier for you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest you tell Mom and Dad soon, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will...\u201d</p><p>They spoke for another ten minutes, and his sister updated him on the medical clinic in the small town where she lived. She told him Pete had moved out of the farmhouse and into Buffalo Valley to be with her. Linnette seemed content, happy with her marriage, her work and her life, and that pleased Mack. In the past few years, she\u2019d changed from an insecure, dissatisfied woman to someone who\u2019d become confident in herself and her choices.</p><p>After the conversation with his sister, Mack went outside, determined to work on his garden. He chose the south side of the house for exposure to the afternoon sun. He started digging, shoveling up lawn and dirt to create new flower beds.</p><p>The area would need a load of topsoil and plenty of fertilizer. Mack had big plans for this garden. Although the mid-April weather was still cool, he soon broke out in a sweat. Pausing to take off his shirt, he worked steadily until Mary Jo parked in their shared driveway.</p><p>Mack checked his watch and saw that it was after five. The afternoon, his last afternoon off this week, had sped by. His next shift started at eight tomorrow morning and would last until Saturday. He liked the extended periods of time off this job gave him.</p><p>After removing Noelle from her car seat, Mary Jo walked directly past him as she had every day that week. To his surprise she stopped abruptly and stared at him. Mack waited for her to say something. She didn\u2019t, so he continued digging as tenaciously as if he were inches from a vein of gold.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Mary Jo said shyly.</p><p>Mack raised his head and leaned against the shovel, trying to suggest that he\u2019d only just noticed her. \u201cOh, hi. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be studying him closely. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asked. Maybe he had on two different shoes. He generally didn\u2019t care that much about what he wore.</p><p>Mary Jo looked away. \u201cNo, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to stare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I got mud smeared on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her neck had gone a warm shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She appeared even more uneasy. \u201cYou look...good. All muscular and tan.\u201d</p><p>Hey, that was promising. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you without a shirt before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a firefighter, you know. There\u2019s a reason we\u2019re the preferred candidates for those hunk calendars.\u201d He resisted the urge to pump his arm muscles in order to impress her with his prowess\u2014or, more likely, make her laugh.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled at his comment. \u201cWould you like some iced tea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>This was definite progress. \u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay if I leave Noelle here? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Mack gazed down at the sleeping infant in her carrier, then watched as Mary Jo headed for her half of the duplex. Still leaning against the shovel handle, he studied her from behind and cursed himself for ever agreeing to this six-month engagement. He wanted to marry her.</p><p>Five minutes later, she reappeared with a glass of iced tea. Mack gratefully accepted it and drank the whole glass in one extended swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou were thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he said and noticed once again that she had a hard time keeping her eyes off him. Good. He wanted her to feel this sense of deprivation as strongly as he did. Mack decided then and there to see if he could get her to reconsider. \u201cCould we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, backing away from him. \u201cAbout anything in particular?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, but Mack thought he\u2019d approach the subject carefully. \u201cMaybe we should discuss this inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She picked up the baby carrier and led the way into her duplex.</p><p>Mack followed dutifully. He pulled out a chair at the small kitchen table and waited as she brought Noelle to her room. When she returned, she rinsed his glass and poured him another one.</p><p>\u201cAbout our engagement,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Mary Jo whirled around, her back against the kitchen counter and her hands behind her. \u201cYes\u2014what about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel we might want to rethink\u2014\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cIf you want to back out, I understand, really I do. You\u2019re under no obligation to marry me. I haven\u2019t heard from David in two weeks now, so maybe he\u2019s given up. But I appreciate how much you care about Noelle and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about backing out?\u201d he asked, letting his irritation show.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI thought\u2014you know...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...\u201d she said, moistening her lips. \u201cThat you\u2019d had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to talk about the engagement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d The only thing Mack felt he could do was be honest. \u201cFrankly, ever since we got engaged you\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d Some engagement, he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d she said swiftly. \u201cYou were the one who didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. You stopped coming over as soon as we got engaged!\u201d</p><p>They could argue about it all night and it wouldn\u2019t settle anything. \u201cIf I gave you that impression, then I apologize,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>She offered him the merest hint of a smile. \u201cI guess we\u2019ve both been silly, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement if he\u2019d ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cI know you weren\u2019t happy when I insisted on a six-month engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that,\u201d Mack said. \u201cIt was the fact that you didn\u2019t want me to touch you at all during that time.\u201d</p><p>Doubt flickered in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t touch me.... I just don\u2019t feel it\u2019s wise for us to be...intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mack wondered if he\u2019d misread the situation. But if she was interested in, say, a kiss or a hug, she might have given him some indication earlier.</p><p>The shyness was back. Mary Jo started to turn away and he caught her hand, stopping her. His fingers curled around hers. When she turned toward him, Mary Jo slid effortlessly into his embrace as if she\u2019d been waiting her entire life for exactly this moment.</p><p>They kissed\u2014two or three lengthy kisses. Not until they\u2019d exchanged another heated kiss did he find the strength to ease his mouth from hers.</p><p>Mary Jo looked up at him, eyes wide. Slowly, ever so slowly, she smiled. \u201cThat was very nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Mack said. \u201cAre you sure you want a six-month engagement?\u201d</p><p>Staring up at him, she blinked, and then nodded. \u201cI still think that would be best.\u201d</p><p>Mack could see it was going to be a very long six months.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p> <p>Olivia warily eyed the horse, which was saddled and ready to ride. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this,\u201d she said.</p><p>They stood just outside the barn. Grace walked over to the mare Cliff had chosen for her friend and ran her hand down the animal\u2019s long, sleek nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to worry about,\u201d she assured Olivia.</p><p>Olivia tucked her hands in the back pockets of her jeans. \u201cIn case you weren\u2019t aware, I\u2019m not a horse-riding type of person. I prefer picking wildflowers and sewing quilts. Riding never interested me. I didn\u2019t read The Black Stallion and all those horsey books when I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither, although I have since\u2014when I took a course in children\u2019s literature. But that\u2019s not the point. I didn\u2019t think I was interested at first.\u201d Grace refused to listen to excuses. \u201cIt\u2019ll do us both good to get out in the fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace, really, you and me horseback riding?\u201d Olivia turned longingly toward the house.</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014you and me.\u201d It was a mild, sunny Saturday afternoon and she wasn\u2019t going to let Olivia talk herself out of this. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely path that meanders down to the beach. Trust me, you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t at least try.\u201d</p><p>Olivia still didn\u2019t seem convinced. She cast a pleading glance in Grace\u2019s direction. \u201cThis horse has an evil look about her. How do you know she won\u2019t take the first opportunity to buck me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugarplum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Sugarplum?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that prove? The camel that bit you was called Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Olivia said, referring to an unfortunate incident with one of the animals they\u2019d housed for the church nativity scene.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant. Anyway, you promised you\u2019d do this.\u201d</p><p>Groaning in defeat, Olivia slowly edged her way back to Grace. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad,\u201d Grace said with an encouraging smile. She remembered the first time Cliff had talked her into getting on a horse. Like her friend, she\u2019d balked and made up a bevy of excuses\u2014really good ones, too. When she\u2019d finally run out of ways to avoid the inevitable, she gave in. The short ride along their property line to the beach had been...wonderful. Afterward, Grace had no idea why it\u2019d taken her so long to agree. She enjoyed horseback riding now and, given the opportunity, Olivia would, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to this,\u201d Olivia said as she raised her leg and set her foot in the stirrup. She grabbed the pommel of the Western-style saddle, hanging on with both hands.</p><p>\u201cNot at first, I wasn\u2019t. We all have to begin somewhere,\u201d Grace said, boosting her up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so insistent on this.\u201d It took Olivia three tries to heave herself into the saddle, even with Grace\u2019s help, but she managed. Olivia was breathless by the time she was firmly settled on the docile mare. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstatic,\u201d Grace joked. \u201cAs to why I won\u2019t let you out of this, the truth is, I want you to feel alive again.\u201d After the chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Olivia had been spending her days holed up inside the house, with only rare treks into town. She ventured out to Justine\u2019s new restaurant once a week or so, and occasionally visited her brother\u2019s gallery, but that was about it. Even Charlotte had grown concerned.</p><p>Grace slid into the saddle with a bit more finesse, but then, as Olivia had said, she\u2019d had more practice.</p> <p>Now that she was on Sugarplum, Olivia glanced anxiously around. \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d she muttered in a weak attempt at a joke.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t started,\u201d Grace replied.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked down, which was a mistake Grace had made early on herself.</p><p>\u201cJust how high off the ground am I?\u201d Olivia asked, her brow creased. \u201cIf Jack finds out about this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack knows and he agreed I should do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now let me show you the basics.\u201d She reviewed the lessons Cliff had given her in the beginning. When she\u2019d finished speaking and demonstrating how to use the reins, Grace took the lead.</p><p>With a few grumbling words, Olivia followed. To Grace\u2019s surprise, once they were under way, her friend didn\u2019t seem to have the problems Grace had experienced as a beginner. For one thing, Sugarplum used to stop and graze whenever she felt like it, completely ignoring Grace\u2019s commands. She wasn\u2019t doing that now.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re a natural,\u201d she exclaimed, turning to look at Olivia.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t respond, concentrating on every move.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go down the trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Olivia grinned sheepishly. \u201cI guess Sugarplum isn\u2019t so evil, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Grace teased as she led the way at a slow, steady pace. She started toward the evergreen-lined path. Towering pines stretched up into the blue sky.</p><p>After a few hundred yards, Grace twisted around to look behind her again. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing, Calamity Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good. Doesn\u2019t the sun feel nice? Especially on your head.\u201d Olivia wore a bandanna, tied gypsy-style at the nape.</p><p>\u201cIt feels great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d Olivia called a moment later, her voice animated. \u201cThere\u2019s an eagle. No, two of them!\u201d</p><p>Shading her eyes, Grace peered up at the sky. The eagles were soaring high above them. Fascinated, she watched as they engaged in an elaborate mating ritual. One of the birds fell several hundred feet, and the second eagle swooped after it.</p><p>Eagles often landed on the beach off Lighthouse Road, so she knew Olivia saw them frequently. But this was different. More intimate somehow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I realized how fresh and green it smells in the woods,\u201d Olivia said after a short silence. \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t realize green was actually a smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt reminds you of Christmas, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>They continued to clop along, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of the forest. Soon they entered a clearing and the beach lay before them, scattered with driftwood. They could see Blake Island in the distance like an emerald set on an expanse of glittering blue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so peaceful,\u201d Olivia said quietly.</p><p>That had struck Grace on her first ride with Cliff. She remembered sitting with her husband on the pebbled beach, their backs against a piece of driftwood. She\u2019d closed her eyes, and the sun had warmed her face as the sounds of nature hummed all around her. Grace had heard the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, birds chirping and the crunch of pebbles as the horses shifted their weight. The experience never failed to move her. It was what she wanted for her friend\u2014this peace, this solace. The discovery of what it meant to be close to nature.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get down and walk for a while,\u201d Grace suggested. \u201cIf you feel up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Olivia assured her. She slid down off Sugarplum and dropped to the ground, landing in pebbles. \u201cNow all I have to do is figure out how to get back up there.\u201d</p><p>Holding the mares\u2019 reins, they strolled side by side. For a long time they didn\u2019t speak, content simply to be together. After fifty years\u2014a half century!\u2014of friendship, they were attuned to each other\u2019s moods and feelings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken so much for granted in my life,\u201d Olivia said after a while.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d Grace didn\u2019t think her friend should be hard on herself. She was just as guilty as Olivia of racing from one day to the next, barely taking time to appreciate what a gift life really was.</p><p>This second chance at happiness with Cliff had changed her. Her marriage to Dan had been good in its way; after all those years together, the two of them had grown comfortable, although Dan\u2019s troubles, the pain of war, had never left him. As much as possible, they\u2019d adjusted and she\u2019d done her best to deal with his mood swings. In the end, it\u2019d all been too much for him.</p><p>Cliff had brought his own problems from his first marriage. They\u2019d been patient with each other, though, and had survived misunderstandings and mistakes. Now she was happier than she\u2019d ever expected to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of retiring,\u201d Olivia announced out of the blue.</p><p>Grace had half suspected this was coming. \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m enjoying these months at home. In the beginning I dreaded it. I was so certain I\u2019d be bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t been, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I didn\u2019t know how much I\u2019d like quilting. Mom\u2019s always been the crafty one. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything domestic that my mother can\u2019t do and do well.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Everything Charlotte attempted\u2014from her special desserts to her knitting and sewing projects\u2014was of the highest quality.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you thought about retiring?\u201d Olivia asked, looking steadily at Grace.</p><p>Grace had given it fleeting consideration. \u201cI suppose I have,\u201d she said, \u201cand yet I love what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same,\u201d Olivia murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this decision so difficult.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Grace shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can yet. I have a lot I still want to accomplish at work. We\u2019re starting a new program at the library that excites me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching literacy by having kids read to dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe\u2019ve invited a trainer from Seattle to come in and work with us.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI already have my first volunteers. Tanni Bliss is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanni Bliss,\u201d Olivia repeated. \u201cWhy is that name familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanni and her boyfriend discovered those remains in the cave. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Olivia frowned slightly. \u201cWhat an unusual case. I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s been resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe press sure had a field day with that one, didn\u2019t they? That Seattle reporter made it sound as though Cedar Cove was a hotbed of criminal activity.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed our sheriff was so good at spin? That press release said very little but somehow satisfied everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, it was a tragic story. That poor boy, frightened and all alone. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know what really happened.\u201d Grace had been touched that Cedar Cove\u2019s mayor had arranged for a proper burial. There\u2019d been talk around town about his DUI, but that was over now. Jack had written an excellent article about it, with the mayor\u2019s full cooperation, which had no doubt subdued the gossip. Thankfully the sensationalism about those poor, forgotten bones had worn off, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTanni is Shirley Bliss\u2019s daughter,\u201d Olivia said as if the connection had suddenly clicked. \u201cWill is dating Shirley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. My brother doesn\u2019t talk to me about his relationships.\u201d</p><p>Grace was naturally curious. She wanted to warn Shirley but didn\u2019t feel it was her place to speak to the other woman. If Will had changed\u2014and there was reason to believe he had\u2014she didn\u2019t want to do anything to ruin his chances. \u201cI had my doubts when I learned Will was returning to Cedar Cove,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Olivia gave her an assessing look. \u201cI did, too. After that...situation with you, I didn\u2019t feel I could trust my own brother.\u201d She slowed her steps. \u201cI\u2019m just relieved it didn\u2019t do any lasting damage.\u201d</p><p>She meant damage to Grace\u2019s relationship with Cliff. Ultimately it hadn\u2019t, but Will\u2019s interference\u2014and Cliff\u2019s reaction to it\u2014was one of the problems they\u2019d needed to resolve.</p><p>Changing the subject, Grace asked, \u201cWhat does Jack have to say about you stepping down from the bench?\u201d</p><p>Olivia grinned. \u201cNot much. He says he\u2019s fine with whatever I decide. But I feel that if I retired, he\u2019d start thinking along those lines himself, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea for Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cSometimes I think he\u2019s got ink running in his veins. Jack\u2019s a completely different person at the newspaper office. He comes alive when he\u2019s working to a deadline, and he has great instincts about stories. He might be tempted to hand over the reins, but I suspect he\u2019d regret it after a few months.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had always had such empathy for others and such an unerring sense of what motivated them; it was one of the reasons she was so effective\u2014and highly respected\u2014as a judge.</p><p>\u201cLook at Goldie,\u201d Grace said, smiling as she pictured their favorite waitress at the Pancake Palace. Goldie had been waiting tables at their longtime hangout from the first year Olivia and Grace were in high school. She had to be in her seventies and still worked three or four days a week.</p><p>\u201cI doubt anyone would dare mention the word retirement to Goldie,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d serve us our coconut cream pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>They strolled a little longer, and then Grace noticed that Olivia was slowing down. \u201cShall we sit for a while?\u201d she said.</p><p>Olivia nodded, and they found a big log, tied the horses to a nearby tree and sat gazing out over Puget Sound. The Fauntleroy ferry, tiny in the distance, was steaming toward Vashon Island.</p><p>\u201cI miss our aerobics class,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you miss is the coconut cream pie afterward.\u201d</p><p>Olivia chortled. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d Suddenly she slugged Grace in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, what was that for?\u201d she said, rubbing her upper arm.</p><p>\u201cBecause you quit going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need an exercise buddy,\u201d Grace protested. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to trudge down to the gym all by myself, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess not. But we\u2019re going back, so don\u2019t get soft on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Grace yelped. \u201cI can run circles around you any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p><p>At that they both smiled and lapsed into a companionable silence.</p><p>The year before, Grace had been terribly afraid she\u2019d lose Olivia to cancer. She hadn\u2019t, and Olivia\u2019s prognosis was good. Her bout with cancer had taught both of them many lessons, but none as profound as the knowledge that nothing would ever stand between them. Their friendship was for life, in every sense of those words.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Megan was beginning to look pregnant, Troy thought. He\u2019d stopped by the house after work on Wednesday afternoon because he had an important favor to ask.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be much longer before you\u2019ll need to wear maternity tops,\u201d he said when she let him into the house.</p><p>A sweet smile lit up her face. \u201cDo you think so, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of his first grandchild\u2019s birth.</p><p>\u201cI noticed this morning that it\u2019s getting difficult to zip up my pants. Look.\u201d She turned sideways and placed one hand beneath the barely discernible roundness of her belly.</p><p>\u201cYup, you\u2019re pregnant, all right.\u201d How Troy wished Sandy had lived to hold this baby...</p><p>\u201cI have a favor to ask you,\u201d he said, all business now.</p><p>\u201cAnything, Daddy, you know that.\u201d</p><p>He followed Megan into the kitchen, where she\u2019d just started dinner preparations. Craig, who worked as an engineer at the navy shipyard, wasn\u2019t home yet, but he would be soon. \u201cI want Faith to spend the night with you.\u201d</p><p>His daughter didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOf course. I love Faith.\u201d Then, frowning slightly, Megan said, \u201cShe can\u2019t stay with her son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s kids are on spring break and he took the family to Disneyland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, you know Faith\u2019s always welcome.\u201d</p><p>This would be more than a simple visit. \u201cIs the bed in your spare room made up?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me asking why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her safe.\u201d</p><p>His daughter, who\u2019d been stirring spaghetti sauce, instantly looked up. \u201cSafe from what?\u201d</p><p>Safe from whom was more accurate. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the night at her house. I have cause to believe the intruder may come back tonight\u2014if it\u2019s the person I think it is.\u201d He\u2019d been giving the pattern of the break-ins a lot of thought. The man he\u2019d become convinced was the intruder had been spotted in town by one of his deputies that afternoon. On at least one other occasion\u2014the day Faith\u2019s tires were slashed\u2014he\u2019d been sighted at the biker bar on the edge of town.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d Her eyes, so like Sandy\u2019s, sparkled with interest.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll explain everything later, okay?\u201d</p><p>From the way she compressed her lips, Troy knew his daughter didn\u2019t like being kept in the dark, but there was nothing he could do about it now.</p><p>\u201cDad, I know you mean well, but I\u2019m pretty sure Faith will insist on staying at her own home. Like I said, she\u2019s welcome at our place, but maybe it makes more sense if you stay there. With her.\u201d</p><p>Troy deliberated for a moment and decided Megan was probably right. \u201cI haven\u2019t discussed this with Faith yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, you should know better. No woman likes a man making decisions for her. Faith has a mind of her own.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m betting she won\u2019t agree to this. If I were her, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. What his daughter said made sense.</p><p>As they headed back into the living room and toward the front door, Troy heard her mutter something else under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen are you going to ask Faith to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, and I have every intention of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Troy grinned. After all these months, his relationship with Faith was finally back on an even keel, and at last there was hope, real hope.</p><p>Once again, he acknowledged that Megan was right. He\u2019d be a fool to squander this opportunity. Faith had been his first love, and while he\u2019d loved Sandy with an intensity that couldn\u2019t be equaled, he\u2019d never forgotten Faith. A man didn\u2019t forget his first love.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His daughter hugged him as he left.</p><p>Once he got to Faith\u2019s house, Troy suggested she spend the night with Megan, and as his daughter had predicted, she was having none of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my home, Troy, so save your breath.\u201d</p><p>Troy shook his head wryly. \u201cMegan told me as much. But the truth is, you\u2019re more of a distraction than a help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I now?\u201d The information appeared to please her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to put you in danger\u2019s way,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cAny more danger than I\u2019ve already been in?\u201d</p><p>Troy could only shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou can spend the night here,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cThe two of us, alone together?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about being distracted. I\u2019m not inviting you into my bed.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and looked away. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not tempted, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make this impossible,\u201d Troy groaned.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I promise,\u201d she said in a serious voice.</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here,\u201d Faith told him. \u201cYou can settle in and make yourself at home. I\u2019ll go about my nightly routine, which is probably what this...person will be watching for. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Troy leaned forward and kissed her with all the hunger and pent-up frustration that had plagued him since she\u2019d moved back to Cedar Cove.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak for Faith, but Troy felt that kiss in every single cell. When they broke apart, she pressed her hand over her heart, gasping. \u201cOh, Troy...\u201d</p><p>He brought her back into his arms. \u201cShall we do that again?\u201d</p><p>Faith cleared her throat. \u201cWe\u2019d better not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. I need to concentrate. I\u2019ve got people to phone.\u201d His first call went to a couple of his best deputies.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on,\u201d he said. Weaver and Johnson had parked a dark unmarked vehicle farther down Rosewood Lane and awaited Troy\u2019s instructions. His next phone call was to Megan.</p><p>\u201cYou were right. Faith will remain here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say I told you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Troy said. \u201cYou love it.\u201d His daughter laughed.</p><p>After moving his own vehicle to the next street, Troy walked back to Faith\u2019s. With his deputies in place, Troy made himself comfortable, prepared to sit up all night, if necessary. He reclined in the chair in front of the television, while Faith sat across from him, knitting. It was a cozy domestic scene, one he hoped would be repeated many times once they were married.</p><p>He remembered Megan\u2019s words and wondered if he should ask her right then and there. He opened his mouth, but just as quickly closed it. He should at least give her a ring. He had to do this properly, but he didn\u2019t want to wait much longer. This weekend, he told himself.</p><p>At ten o\u2019clock Faith yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay up on my account,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Go on to bed. Just promise me that if you hear a scuffle or any activity in this part of the house, you won\u2019t come rushing out of your bedroom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, please! This is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed, although he could tell how worried she was.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until after midnight that Troy\u2019s hunch proved to be correct. He was sitting in the pitch-dark living room when he heard a slight commotion near the garage. Not wasting a moment, he contacted his deputies and had them surround the area.</p> <p>\u201cTroy?\u201d Faith whispered from the hallway. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Apparently she was a light sleeper or hadn\u2019t been to sleep at all.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your room and stay put,\u201d he said, not hiding his annoyance. He enunciated each word as distinctly as he could, keeping his voice low.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d he asked more loudly.</p> <p>\u201cFine, fine. I\u2019m on my way,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI never knew you were so bossy.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was but Troy refused to take any chances with her safety. He was the one paid to take risks, not Faith.</p><p>A louder commotion broke out in the garage, and Deputy Weaver gave a shout. Troy ran for the back door and opened it just in time to see a man dressed completely in black dash across the side yard.</p><p>Troy was long past his physical prime, but, junk food aside, he kept in shape. Racing after the man, he tackled him, landing hard on the wet grass. Weaver, who was directly behind him, grabbed the intruder by the scruff of the neck and dragged him to his feet. Troy slapped on the handcuffs he\u2019d kept attached to his belt.</p><p>Deputy Johnson shined a flashlight into their prisoner\u2019s face and Troy instantly recognized the man who\u2019d been the source of all this trouble. He felt a sense of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cTake him to the station,\u201d Troy said after Deputy Johnson had read the perpetrator his legal rights.</p> <p>The two deputies led him away while Troy brushed off his uniform. He was getting way too old to be chasing felons, but he wasn\u2019t about to let this one escape.</p><p>He returned to the house, turning on the kitchen light. \u201cIt\u2019s safe for you to come out now,\u201d he called.</p><p>Faith hurried in, wearing her housecoat. \u201cTroy\u2014oh, my goodness, what happened?\u201d Without waiting for him to answer, she opened a drawer, retrieved a towel and dampened one corner. Standing close, she dabbed at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was surprised to realize he was bleeding. He hadn\u2019t felt a thing.</p><p>\u201cYou got him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Troy nodded. \u201cSure did.\u201d</p><p>Faith pulled out a chair and they both sat down. Her hands were trembling, and he reached for them, chafing warmth back into her cold skin.</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd why does this person hate me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Mark Schaffer.\u201d</p><p>A puzzled look appeared on her face. \u201cWho? I\u2019ve never heard of him before. What could I possibly have done to make him target me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about you, Faith. I should\u2019ve seen that much sooner. This has absolutely nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Faith stared at him in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got all the answers myself, but I\u2019ll tell you what I think happened and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her eyes implored him to make sense of it all.</p><p>\u201cSchaffer was a friend of Dale and Pam Smith, who were the tenants before you. While they were living here, my office received a number of complaints about them. I spoke to Schaffer personally on several occasions. He\u2019s involved with drugs and hangs out with a rough crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he eventually moved away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was by choice. I can\u2019t say for sure exactly how they did it, but I believe Cliff Harding and Jack Griffin persuaded the Smiths and their gang, including Mark, to leave. They hadn\u2019t paid rent in months and they were bringing undesirables into the neighborhood. Grace was afraid that if she evicted them, they\u2019d trash the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you figure Cliff and Jack convinced them to move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I don\u2019t know how.\u201d He gave her a half smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Grace about that and, when you find out, don\u2019t tell me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that Mark, or one of his cronies, left a stash of drugs behind in their rush to vacate the premises. He\u2019s been coming back looking for that. Most likely drugs, but it could be money or something else of value. I assume it\u2019s hidden somewhere in the garage, seeing he\u2019s targeted that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he broke into the house first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither he doesn\u2019t remember exactly where he hid his stash or whatever it is\u2014or he was hoping to get you to move so he\u2019d have time to search after you left. When you didn\u2019t turn tail and run, he had to take his chances, which is why he returned to the house. Then you got the alarm system and he was limited to the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, then.\u201d The relief in her voice was evident.</p><p>\u201cI believe so. Ironically, I think there\u2019s a good possibility that whatever was hidden inadvertently got tossed out when Grace and Cliff had the house cleaned and repainted.\u201d</p><p>Troy stood up to leave. The cut on his mouth had started to throb and he needed to get to the station to deal with Schaffer.</p><p>She walked him to the front door, but stopped him before he could open it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe now,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, then gently caressed his face.</p><p>He caught her hand and held it to his cheek. Every instinct he had told him to stay.</p><p>She smiled at him. Closing her eyes, she leaned forward and pressed her mouth to his, careful not to touch the injury. He could feel the swelling in his lip but it didn\u2019t impede their kiss.</p><p>Troy stepped back to keep himself from pulling her into his arms and kissing her the way he had earlier.</p><p>He released her, reluctant to let her go. \u201cWe need to talk. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d There was a warmth in her eyes, an openness in her expression.</p><p>As he walked away, he noticed that the pain he\u2019d felt just moments earlier had disappeared.</p><p>Thirty-Four</p><p>Gloria Ashton sat in her patrol car with the radar gun in her hand. This spot on Harbor Street was notorious for speeders. Writing tickets was the least favorite aspect of her job, but a necessary one. As the most recently hired deputy, she had her dues to pay. She hoped it wouldn\u2019t be long before she had the opportunity to work directly with Sheriff Davis, the way Weaver and Johnson had on Wednesday night.</p><p>Mark Schaffer had been placed under arrest and was currently being held at the county jail. The Cedar Cove Chronicle had done a write-up on the incident. Needless to say, the entire Rosewood Lane neighborhood had heaved a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>She was on the last stretch of her seven-to-three shift. A car rounded the corner and, seeing her patrol vehicle, automatically slowed. Gloria didn\u2019t bother to check its speed. Whoever was driving hadn\u2019t gained enough momentum after clearing the corner to reach the legal limit. To her surprise, the car pulled in and parked behind hers.</p><p>She wondered if the driver was in some kind of trouble. She set the radar device aside and climbed out of her patrol car. When she recognized Dr. Chad Timmons, she stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem, Dr. Timmons?\u201d she asked in her most professional voice.</p><p>He\u2019d lowered his window. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked, although she was pretty sure the subject matter wouldn\u2019t be to her liking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather do it over a coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward, then.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Obviously frustrated, Chad sighed. \u201cI\u2019d like to clear the air between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Our...encounterwas a long time ago and, from my point of view, highly embarrassing. I prefer to forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, that isn\u2019t the case for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently it was over before it could even start,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to have coffee with me, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but give me a chance to settle this in my own mind. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Some closure, much as I hate the word.\u201d</p><p>Gloria sighed, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes, fifteen,\u201d he said, no doubt sensing her indecision. \u201cIs that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what purpose it would serve. From what I heard, you\u2019re dating Sarah Chesney now.\u201d</p><p>That she was aware he was seeing another woman appeared to please him immensely, because he broke into a wide grin. \u201cSarah and I are friends, nothing more. What\u2019s this I hear about you and Zack Birch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you keeping tabs on me?\u201d she demanded angrily.</p><p>\u201cNo more than you are on me,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that, so she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes, Gloria. You name the time and place.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cAll right, meet me in two hours. That\u2019s when I get off.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in triumph and she wanted to wipe off his smug grin. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She was going to suggest the Pancake Palace but changed her mind. Someone might overhear their conversation and she\u2019d rather not risk that. \u201cMeet me at the marina by the totem pole,\u201d she said. \u201cTen minutes. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Do you want me to bring a stopwatch?\u201d</p><p>Despite her irritation, she grinned. \u201cThat might not be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, Gloria had changed out of her uniform and parked in the lot next to the library. The foot ferry from Bremerton was just getting in, and the first wave of shipyard workers disembarked. Her hands clenched the steering wheel. She couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she\u2019d regret this.</p><p>Waiting until the last possible moment, she left her vehicle and walked toward the marina. Chad was already there, waiting for her. She hadn\u2019t seen him in a couple of months and was struck, once again, by his classic good looks, which were precisely what had attracted her the first time they met. That night had been a disaster, one she had no intention of repeating.</p><p>Chad leaned against the railing, exuding confidence and poise. Where she\u2019d once found that appealing, now it annoyed her.</p><p>As she approached, he handed her a coffee. Wordlessly she accepted it and looked at her watch. \u201cYour ten minutes are ticking away.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he turned toward the railing, resting his arms on it as he held his coffee and watched the gently bobbing boats in the marina. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d enjoy living in a small town,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t either, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to waste your ten minutes with chitchat?\u201d</p><p>He went on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cI took this job at the clinic thinking I\u2019d give it six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have.\u201d It would\u2019ve been a relief to her if he had. Then she wouldn\u2019t risk seeing him\u2014and remembering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI stayed because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She didn\u2019t hide her sarcasm. This was the last thing, the absolute last thing, she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making it up, Gloria.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget.\u201d She hadn\u2019t, but she wasn\u2019t about to let him know that their night together still lingered in her mind.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTry harder,\u201d she advised.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose I haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one night. I\u2019d had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you hadn\u2019t. You knew exactly what you were doing and so did I.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria released her breath. He was right, and while she\u2019d like an excuse for their brief interlude, there was no point in lying\u2014to him or to herself. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like every other man? Notch your bedpost and go on to the next conquest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think of me?\u201d He actually sounded hurt.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. But apparently you read more into our...encounter than you should have.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hurt him. Hurting anyone went against her nature; nevertheless it was best, as far as she was concerned, to forget this and move on.</p><p>He continued to look out over the water. \u201cAt first I thought your reluctance had to do with Linnette.\u201d</p><p>It had. Gloria had met Chad, and they\u2019d spent that one night together. Then, through a fluke, she\u2019d discovered that her sister had a crush on him.</p><p>Except that, at the time, Linnette hadn\u2019t known they were sisters. No one did.</p> <p>After being adopted as an infant, Gloria had grown up in California, in a loving home with wonderful parents. Then, six years ago, she\u2019d lost them in a plane crash. Her life had faltered until she managed to learn the names of her birth parents. It was a shock to discover that after they\u2019d given her up for adoption, they\u2019d gone on to marry and have two other children. These were Gloria\u2019s full siblings, her sister and brother. Hungry for the connection with family, she\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove.</p><p>Then, as luck would have it, her sister had moved into the apartment next door. Her birth father, Roy, sometimes said that luck, good or bad, was all a matter of timing. In this case, the timing and the luck were both. Good and bad. Linnette, a physician assistant, had a huge crush on Dr. Chad Timmons, and Gloria had quickly bowed out of the relationship with Chad, preferring to step aside rather than risk destroying her chances with Linnette because they were both interested in the same man. She\u2019d made so many mistakes, and sleeping with Chad was near the top of that list.</p><p>The night with Chad had been completely out of character. She felt embarrassed thinking about it. Even after Linnette had started dating Cal Washburn, she\u2019d decided not to see Chad again. She\u2019d convinced herself it was just easier that way. Less awkward.</p><p>\u201cLinnette is out of the picture,\u201d he added gently.</p><p>\u201cShe has been for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>Chad sipped his coffee. He still didn\u2019t look in her direction. \u201cMy point exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it,\u201d Gloria demanded, \u201cthat you have such a hard time accepting the fact that I\u2019m not interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know it\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have a rather high opinion of your charms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he agreed readily. \u201cHowever, I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>His remark amused her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d He turned to face her then, with his back to the railing. \u201cI scare you to death because I\u2019m the first man to get past your guard. You have your life carefully planned out and falling in love didn\u2019t fit those plans. Take a memo, Gloria: Life is full of surprises. Not everything happens according to schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I thought you were a family physician, not a psychologist.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound egotistical, but you\u2019re in love with me, and like I said, it scares you to death.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was forced and high-pitched.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to laugh,\u201d he said in a bored voice, \u201cgo ahead, but we both know the truth.\u201d</p><p>In response, Gloria conspicuously checked her watch. \u201cYour time is about up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be able to acknowledge your feelings and admit that what we shared was very, very good. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know all this about me, about us, after one night? One foolish, drunken night, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s taken me a while to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>For reasons she couldn\u2019t explain, a lump had formed in her throat.</p><p>\u201cAs you say, my time\u2019s about up. And I don\u2019t just mean my time with you now, this afternoon. I wanted you to know I\u2019ve given my notice at the clinic, but before I left Cedar Cove I felt I should tell you how much I wish things were different between us.\u201d</p><p>An unexpected feeling of loss washed over her and she couldn\u2019t speak. She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI hope you find the happiness you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cI just regret it wasn\u2019t with me.\u201d He looked directly into her eyes, smiled and threw his coffee container into a nearby trash bin. Without another word, he walked away.</p><p>Gloria remained rooted to the spot. After a moment, she closed her eyes and acknowledged that he was right. She\u2019d carefully planned the reunion with her birth family, but nothing had worked out the way she\u2019d hoped. She wanted to be close to her sister and brother, and that hadn\u2019t happened. Nothing had gone as she\u2019d envisioned. She saw Mack once in a while, for a quick drink and some stilted conversation, and exchanged an occasional phone call with Linnette. It wasn\u2019t their fault; she\u2019d counted on too much from them\u2014too much too soon. They\u2019d already established lives, with no firm place for her. Corrie was superficially warm and friendly, but Gloria felt she\u2019d never got past her guilt over the adoption. Of all of them, she had the best relationship with Roy, a former cop himself.</p><p>Trembling, she leaned against the railing, watching as Chad walked toward the clinic. All these months, she\u2019d been afraid of what would happen if she ever let him back into her life.</p><p>That night, that fateful night, he\u2019d seemed to recognize her pain. When she didn\u2019t answer his questions, he\u2019d whispered that she could tell him when she was ready. But she wasn\u2019t any more ready now than she\u2019d been then.</p><p>After that one night with Chad, Gloria had felt vulnerable. He\u2019d shaken her sense of self-preservation. Instinctively she\u2019d fled, determined that what had happened could never be repeated. She didn\u2019t like being out of control. She couldn\u2019t risk getting emotionally involved with him, with anyone. Linnette\u2019s interest in him had been a convenient excuse, but that was all\u2014an excuse. Especially when Linnette had fallen for Cal, when she was over her infatuation with Chad.</p><p>Although Gloria had rebuffed Chad several times, he hadn\u2019t given up and refused to accept that she didn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings. Only now did she admit what those feelings were, and only because he\u2019d forced her to.</p><p>Now Chad was leaving and she had the strongest intuition that if she let him go, she\u2019d be sorry for the rest of her life.</p><p>Gloria returned to her vehicle and sat there for several minutes, debating what to do. The safe response, she supposed, would be nothing. He could leave, and her life would be unchanged....</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lie to herself anymore. She cared about him, had cared for a very long time. Dropping her head to the steering wheel, she considered her next move. The lump in her throat hadn\u2019t gone away and she gave a shuddering sigh, trapped in her indecision.</p><p>Without any further deliberation, she got out of her car and slammed the door. Anger vibrated through her. She wanted to kick, yell, scream, stamp her feet.</p><p>The medical clinic was close to the marina, and she walked there at a clipped pace, nearly breathless by the time she arrived.</p><p>The waiting room was crowded. She stepped up to the receptionist\u2019s desk and stood in line. \u201cI need to see Dr. Timmons,\u201d she said when it was finally her turn. The woman started to ask her something, but Gloria broke in. \u201cThis is a personal matter.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought the receptionist was about to argue with her. Then she followed the woman\u2019s glance. Chad was speaking to a nurse in the background; he paused when he saw her, said a few words to the nurse and started toward the reception area.</p><p>Gloria met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDr. Timmons,\u201d the receptionist said loudly, \u201cthis woman wants to see you on a personal matter.\u201d Gloria cringed in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Micki.\u201d He directed his next comment to Gloria. \u201cI\u2019m on duty.\u201d</p><p>This was incredibly uncomfortable. In addition to the staff, the waiting room full of patients who studied them as if they were Hollywood celebrities indulging in a public spat.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d he said coolly.</p><p>The least he could do was put her at ease. He didn\u2019t. She managed to nod, her mouth too dry to say anything at all.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to my patient,\u201d he said, looking quickly over his shoulder.</p><p>In other words, if she had something to say she\u2019d better do it soon because he didn\u2019t have time to waste.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said earlier...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said a lot of things earlier.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you want me to stay in Cedar Cove?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She risked opening her eyes.</p><p>He was smiling.</p><p>Gloria heard someone call his name.</p><p>Chad reluctantly moved away. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gloria nodded, turned and hurried away. Either she\u2019d taken a huge step forward or she\u2019d made the most foolish mistake of her life. No, the second most foolish mistake...</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>Mack rounded a corner of the high-school playing field during his five-mile run. His legs and his heart were pumping at their maximum. His thoughts kept pace as he contemplated his relationship with Mary Jo. Although they were engaged, it wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. Even now, Mack remained somewhat unsure of Mary Jo\u2019s feelings toward him. If she genuinely loved him, he saw little evidence of that. His own feelings, however, hadn\u2019t changed\u2014he was crazy about her and Noelle.</p><p>Things had improved since their talk\u2014and their kiss\u2014but Mack sensed a reserve in her, a hesitation. In some ways their relationship had returned to what it had been before David\u2019s threatening visit. They had dinner together three or four nights a week and they\u2019d resumed their card playing and television watching. That much was good. Most of the tension between them had abated, and for that Mack was grateful. Still, he was aware of her reluctance to become more involved and he didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>They\u2019d kissed that one time, which had been wonderful. However, their kisses since then were restrained. Perfunctory. Brief kisses at the end of the evening were the most he\u2019d come to expect. Nothing too passionate or even playful. Mack wanted more, hungered for more, and always left her half of the duplex with an ache in his gut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Five months ago if someone had told him he\u2019d be engaged he might\u2019ve been skeptical. Still, it would have been a possibility. But if anyone had predicted he\u2019d be crazy in love with his fianc\u00e9e, who was living in one side of a duplex with him on the other, and that they\u2019d barely touch, he\u2019d have laughed. Yet that was exactly what was happening and he felt helpless to do anything about it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what had possessed him to agree to her stipulation of a six-month engagement, in which they were to do nothing more than exchange quick kisses and hold hands. Unbelievable! They hadn\u2019t even been engaged a month. The thought of going an additional five seemed intolerable. Most engaged couples were in love and acted like it.</p><p>The harder he ran, the clearer things became. He should\u2019ve realized it earlier. Mary Jo enjoyed his company and his protection, but she wasn\u2019t in love with him. If she was, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to maintain this hands-off policy. While he panted with longing, she kept a respectable distance.</p><p>What also became clear was that any feelings she had for him were clouded with appreciation for the help Mack had given her. She\u2019d been desperate to get away from her brothers, to gain her independence.</p> <p>In his eagerness to bring her and Noelle to Cedar Cove, he\u2019d misjudged. She needed space and time to deal with her emotions and resolve the issues with David by herself\u2014without him or her brothers meddling, making decisions for her.</p><p>Instead of recognizing Mary Jo\u2019s need to handle her own life, her own affairs, and raise her daughter as she saw fit, Mack had been trying to play the role of hero. Hoping to smooth the way for her, he\u2019d robbed Mary Jo of the opportunity to prove herself. When he\u2019d moved her next door, he hadn\u2019t allowed her any genuine choice. He\u2019d stacked the deck by renting the place to her so cheaply, without ever revealing the truth. He\u2019d made it impossible for her to refuse. Mack had simply replaced Linc and become the big brother she both loved and resented.</p><p>What an idiot he\u2019d been. Mack liked to think of himself as fairly intelligent and marveled that it\u2019d taken him this long to see what he\u2019d done. His emotions had blinded him to what should\u2019ve been obvious. His love for Mary Jo and Noelle was suffocating her.</p><p>Even when he\u2019d talked to Linnette, Mack had been so focused on himself and his needs that he hadn\u2019t given the slightest thought to Mary Jo\u2019s fears. No wonder she held him at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>Decisive action had to be taken. Difficult as it was, he had to step away, give Mary Jo the independence she needed and pretend he didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>Depressed, Mack finished his run. He did some intermittent stretches, slowing to a trot to cool down. As he reached the duplex he came to a standstill.</p><p>Mary Jo was outside, sweeping the walkway; she often did light yard work on Sunday afternoons. She smiled when she saw him.</p><p>He made a point of looking away but not before he saw her frown in confusion. He\u2019d planned to think about everything more thoroughly but since she was available to talk now, perhaps it would be best not to delay the inevitable. He walked toward her.</p><p>\u201cHow was your run?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Consumed by his thoughts, Mack didn\u2019t reply. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d he asked, wanting to avoid chitchat.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure. Is something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Hands on his hips, he flung his head back and stared up at a cloudless sky. He didn\u2019t offer any reassurances and gestured toward her side of the duplex instead.</p><p>He followed Mary Jo inside and into the kitchen. Knowing he liked iced tea, she kept a pitcher filled inside the refrigerator. Mack had taken it as a sign that she cared and realized now that she would\u2019ve done it for her brother or a friend or anyone.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said as she took a tall glass from her cupboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Mary Jo asked as she handed him the tea.</p><p>Mack took a deep swallow of the cold drink, savoring the liquid as it slid down his throat. He tried to compose his thoughts. When he\u2019d drunk some of the tea, he set his glass on the kitchen counter. Mary Jo stood on one side of the room and he stayed on the other.</p><p>\u201cI run for more than the exercise,\u201d he said. He had trouble meeting her eyes. \u201cIt gives me a chance to think.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWhile I was out this afternoon, it occurred to me that I have a special bond with you.\u201d</p> <p>Her responding smile was warm. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bond is Noelle.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered, as if she was slow to comprehend his meaning.</p><p>\u201cWe both love Noelle.\u201d Finally, he looked directly at her. \u201cYou\u2019re her mother and I\u2019m the one who delivered her. That baby girl captured my heart the moment she drew her first breath.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo remained silent, watching, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my love for Noelle...confused me, and I assumed I\u2019d fallen in love with you, too. While I was running this afternoon, I figured out that my emotions were all jumbled and that\u2014well, that...my love for you isn\u2019t what I thought it was.\u201d He nearly choked on the words but somehow managed to maintain eye contact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she said after a strained pause.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m trying to explain that when I heard how David threatened to take Noelle from you, I panicked. Marrying you seemed like a viable solution and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, grateful she\u2019d said the words. Even now Mack wasn\u2019t convinced he would\u2019ve been able to spit them out. Because he did love her and, more than anything in this world, wanted her as his wife.</p><p>\u201cAbout Noelle...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Noelle. The engagement was for her protection. We both felt if we were engaged and then married, that would keep David from pestering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the only reason he\u2019s interested in Noelle is because he thinks he can manipulate his father into giving him money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mack nodded. \u201cIf you have any more problems with him, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t have an answer for that. \u201cI\u2019ll sort it out when I have to. But rest assured, I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to Noelle.\u201d Or to Mary Jo, either. \u201cI\u2019ll help you whenever you need me to. You have my word on that.\u201d</p><p>She looked away and sighed. \u201cAnd you realized you can help without the necessity of marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cInstinctively you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, a slight edge to her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted that six-month engagement,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWhich was more of a probation period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yes.\u201d She did busywork in the kitchen, folding the Cedar Cove Chronicle and tossing it into the recycling bin, then smoothing out a towel that lay on the counter. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you want out of the engagement?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and swallowed hard. \u201cThat might be for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hung the towel on the oven door. \u201cYou said I knew marriage wasn\u2019t right for us, but you obviously did, too.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell your parents, remember? That must\u2019ve been why.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, but he doubted it. He took another long drink of his iced tea and set the empty glass aside. \u201cThen we understand each other?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gestured weakly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess I don\u2019t. What is our relationship, Mack?\u201d</p><p>Good question. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he said. As well as landlord and tenant. He quickly decided this wasn\u2019t the appropriate time to divulge that. And it wasn\u2019t as though it was hurting him financially. Plus, he rationalized, the fact that he owned the duplex meant she\u2019d been able to attain at least a degree of independence.</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>His response seemed to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d like the freedom to...to see other women, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, her voice sharpening. \u201cThat\u2019s really what this is all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting I\u2019ve met someone else, then you\u2019re wrong.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to think he was another David, a man who\u2019d discard her without a care.</p><p>\u201cBut you want the freedom to see others,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat goes for you, too.\u201d Again the words nearly stuck in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019d be free to date other men if you wished.\u201d He hoped that wasn\u2019t the case. It would be hell on earth to watch some other man stroll into her life, and stand idly by. Mack didn\u2019t know if he could do it.</p><p>She looked down at her bare hand. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just as well we never got around to shopping for rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that was another instance of us both knowing that marriage wasn\u2019t right for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They seemed to run out of things to say at the same time. But Mack couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave. In the pit of his stomach he knew that once he walked out the door, invitations to visit would be few and far between.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better?\u201d Mary Jo asked after a lengthy silence. \u201cI always do when I\u2019ve finally told someone the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said and forced a smile at the irony of her statement. He started toward the door, then abruptly turned back. \u201cIf you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to call, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t let pride get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, not where Noelle\u2019s concerned,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, I know how important she is to you, and I wouldn\u2019t keep you apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>She walked with him and held open the door. Head down, long hair hiding her face, she said, \u201cI\u2019m grateful, too\u2014that you\u2019re my...friend.\u201d</p><p>Mack found he couldn\u2019t leave without kissing her. Slipping his finger beneath her chin, he raised her face and then, after a single heartbeat, lowered his mouth to hers. The kiss was slow and tender. When he lifted his head, Mack could hardly speak. \u201cFriends and neighbors and...perhaps more.\u201d He wanted to be sure she understood that the possibility existed. What he hoped, what he needed, was some indication from Mary Jo that she wanted him as part of her life. Then and only then could they move forward.</p><p>Mary Jo closed the door after Mack, then sank onto the living room sofa, almost too stunned to think. She supposed Mack was right to break the engagement. She liked him a great deal and was already half in love with him\u2014maybe all the way in love with him. So much had happened in the past year, so much she didn\u2019t fully understand. If her mother had been alive she could\u2019ve talked things over with her. And there wasn\u2019t anyone else. She wouldn\u2019t dream of burdening Grace or Olivia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her life was completely different from what it had been a few months ago. She had little in common these days with even her closest friends. Yes, they chatted and stayed in touch, but Mary Jo had a baby and could no longer take off at a moment\u2019s notice to go to a movie or shop or do anything else. Her whole life, and therefore all her relationships, had changed since Noelle\u2019s birth.</p><p>In a relatively short time she\u2019d become a mother, left her family home, moved to a new town, taken a new job. Now she had one more item to add to that list. She\u2019d become engaged and unengaged within a month. But like everything else, she\u2019d deal with that and with Mack\u2019s confused feelings for her.</p><p>He was right, of course; it was better to be honest, although she was still unsure exactly where their relationship stood. One thing she did feel sure about, though, was the fact that Mack would move heaven and earth to protect Noelle.</p><p>The baby stirred from her afternoon nap and Mary Jo went into her room. After changing Noelle\u2019s diaper and feeding her, she set her in her baby seat and began doing what she always did when she felt troubled. She cleaned house.</p> <p>While she was hanging up her clothes in the bedroom closet, the nail from a loose board caught on the toe of her sock. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d snagged a sock on that nail. Under other circumstances, she\u2019d ask Mack to hammer it down for her, since he acted as the rental manager on behalf of his friend. But she couldn\u2019t go to him just now. Besides, she was fairly competent. All she really needed was something to pound the nail. A shoe with a solid heel would work equally well.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is no dunce,\u201d she told Noelle as she knelt on the floor and found an appropriate shoe. Once down on all fours, Mary Jo saw that more than one board was loose. Retrieving a flashlight from her drawer, she aimed it at the closet floor, ready to pound away, when an object of some kind caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d she said, her voice rising. \u201cThere\u2019s something underneath this board.\u201d</p><p>The baby cooed from the other side of the bedroom.</p><p>Mary Jo used her fingers to wiggle the nail out, then managed to free the second one. Once the board was loose, she lifted it up and discovered, still partially hidden, what seemed to be a wooden box.</p> <p>Mary Jo worked at the remaining floorboards in the closet until she could retrieve the box. Breathless, she sat on the floor, holding it in her lap. The wooden box was old; that much was apparent. It was larger than a cigar box and light. The writing on it had faded long ago to the point that it was unreadable.</p><p>\u201cShall I peek inside?\u201d she asked Noelle.</p><p>The baby returned her look with wide-eyed wonder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious, too,\u201d Mary Jo said. Holding her breath, she raised the lid. There were letters inside, old letters. She picked up the first envelope and turned to Noelle. Reading the postmark, she said, \u201cThese are letters written in 1943 by...\u201d The ink on the blue airmail envelope had faded. \u201cMajor Jacob Dennison.\u201d The letters were addressed to Miss Joan Manry, 1022 Evergreen Place, Cedar Cove, Washington.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to read it,\u201d Mary Jo told her daughter. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why Joan would hide them like this.\u201d She carefully opened the flimsy paper.</p><p>The spidery handwriting was difficult to read. \u201cIt\u2019s written by Jacob\u2014Jake\u2014during the war,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cHe\u2019s in Europe...a pilot flying out of England, it looks like.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s a love letter. Oh, Noelle, he\u2019s about to go on a bombing mission over Germany and he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to die and he wants Joan to know that if he doesn\u2019t survive, he\u2019ll find a way to come to her...that he\u2019ll always love her.\u201d</p> <p>For an hour or more, Mary Jo lost herself in the letters. Sitting on the bedroom floor beside Noelle, she read one after another, her eyes often filling with tears.</p><p>She was startled into awareness by the ringing of her doorbell, followed by a knock. That signal immediately identified her visitor as Mack. Immersed as she was in the letters, she wiped her eyes and hurriedly got to her feet, excited about sharing her discovery with him.</p><p>She threw open the door.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo, listen, I think I might\u2019ve given you the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. Grabbing his arm, she pulled him inside. \u201cI found something I need to show you.\u201d</p><p>Mack frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was this loose board in the closet and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me. I would have taken care of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t important, Mack. The letters are.\u201d She couldn\u2019t contain her excitement. \u201cI came across a box hidden in the closet. It has the most beautiful love letters, all written during World War II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course. Anyone would have...You have to read them, too! Once I started I couldn\u2019t stop. They\u2019re so eloquent, so moving...I want to know what happened to Jake and Joan. I want to find out if Jacob Dennison returned from the war and if they married and had children. You need to talk to your friend right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend?\u201d Mack sounded confused and, little wonder, the way she\u2019d dragged him into the room, talking nonstop.</p><p>\u201cThe man who owns the duplex,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cThey might be related to him. He\u2019ll want these letters\u2014they\u2019re a treasure.\u201d</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible. My...friend, the owner, can\u2019t be related. He only recently purchased the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe whoever he bought it from will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find out, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded eagerly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see who might have owned the house during the war years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mack,\u201d she said.</p><p>Suddenly the uneasiness returned. \u201cI apologize,\u201d Mary Jo said stiffly. \u201cI didn\u2019t really give you a chance to explain why you came over.\u201d</p><p>Mack shrugged. \u201cNo reason. I just wanted to be sure everything\u2019s okay between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Mary Jo assured him.</p><p>Reading these letters had put everything in perspective\u2014although she couldn\u2019t have said exactly how that had happened.</p><p>Thirty-Six</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Dad?\u201d Megan asked, studying Troy closely. \u201cYou\u2019re pale.\u201d</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t remember being this nervous about anything in his life. \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day a man asks a woman to be his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be nervous about?\u201d Megan asked. As a child, she\u2019d thought there wasn\u2019t anything her daddy couldn\u2019t do and she sometimes still seemed to believe it. \u201cWe both know Faith\u2019s going to say yes.\u201d</p><p>Troy wished he shared his daughter\u2019s confidence. He hoped and prayed Faith would accept his proposal, and yet he had doubts. On the one hand he felt optimistic, certain there\u2019d been signs that she wanted him in her life. On the other...there\u2019d been a few serious setbacks, and he wasn\u2019t assuming anything.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Daddy, go out there and get your woman,\u201d Megan said, kissing his cheek. She steered him toward the front door. \u201cYou\u2019re sure Faith is home?\u201d</p><p>Troy hadn\u2019t stopped to think that Faith would be anywhere else on a Friday night. They\u2019d spoken a couple of times since the arrest, more than a week ago, but their conversations had been mostly related to that.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Megan\u2019s elbows jutted out as she put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou mean to say you didn\u2019t phone ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Megan stalked over to the telephone and punched in Faith\u2019s number. She placed her hand over the receiver and looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019d serve you right if Faith\u2019s gone out for the evening.\u201d</p><p>That got his hackles up. \u201cWho with?\u201d If Faith was seeing another man, Will Jefferson, for example, he...he...</p><p>\u201cNo answer, Dad,\u201d Megan said, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t phone and say you wanted to talk to her. You aren\u2019t even married and you\u2019re already taking Faith for granted.\u201d Megan sounded more amused than annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWho could she be with?\u201d Troy wondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>Talk about taking the wind out of his sails. Troy left his daughter\u2019s house, calling himself every name for stupid that he could remember. He should\u2019ve phoned, instead of assuming Faith had nothing better to do on a Friday night than sit home waiting for him.</p><p>He was back at his place and feeling miserable when Megan phoned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me how I know, but Faith\u2019s at the movies with Olivia and Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich movie?\u201d</p><p>Megan told him and then with a smile in her voice, asked, \u201cDo you have a burning desire to see Clive Owen all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do! Bye, sweetheart, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck!\u201d</p><p>Troy was out the door so fast he nearly ran to his car. The theater parking lot was full and he had to circle twice before he found an empty slot. He purchased his ticket; then, wanting it to look as if their meeting was accidental, he bought popcorn and a soda.</p><p>The movie had already started and the theater was so dark he couldn\u2019t see anything beyond his own two feet. He slipped into the first available seat and scanned the backs of people\u2019s heads, hoping to find Faith.</p><p>Although he squinted and leaned forward, nearly dumping his popcorn and his drink, he was unable to identify her. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until the credits scrolled across the screen and the lights came up that he saw Faith.</p><p>She was with Grace and Olivia, only about four rows ahead of him. If he waited for her to notice him, it might not happen, so he approached them.</p><p>\u201cFaith, imagine seeing you here,\u201d he said, hoping that sounded less contrived than he suspected it did.</p><p>\u201cYes, imagine,\u201d Grace said, exchanging a meaningful glance with Olivia. Or was that a smirk?</p><p>\u201cMegan phoned Jack,\u201d Olivia said under her breath. In other words, they knew he\u2019d been looking for Faith.</p><p>\u201cHi, Troy,\u201d Faith said, ignoring her friends. Her smile was warm. \u201cI\u2019m glad we ran into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too...\u201d While Grace and Olivia might enjoy embarrassing him, Faith had gone out of her way to make him feel comfortable.</p><p>By this time the theater had emptied out. One of the teenagers from the concession stand started down the center aisle with a broom and dustpan, checking the rows for stray popcorn and assorted trash.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk outside,\u201d Troy suggested. He could hardly take his eyes off Faith. Suddenly realizing that Olivia and Grace were waiting, obviously interested in what he had to say, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to the Pancake Palace,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWould you care to join us?\u201d</p><p>Faith looked at him then, and everything else receded. The question finally registered when Grace repeated his name. \u201cOh...sure,\u201d he muttered absently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll meet you there in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said again.</p><p>The two women left, and Troy and Faith walked slowly out of the theater.</p><p>\u201cDid you speak to Megan?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOn my cell.\u201d Faith nodded. \u201cJust briefly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything?\u201d He hoped his daughter was sensitive enough to keep her mouth shut about his proposal.</p><p>Faith laughed. \u201cAll she said was that I should be gentle with you, whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>Troy frowned; they were halfway across the parking lot and he could feel sweat beading his upper lip. He\u2019d rehearsed what he wanted to say in front of the mirror at least a dozen times. Megan had insisted he have a short speech ready. Now, for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember a single word.</p><p>As they reached the car, Troy licked his dry lips. \u201cI think you know how much I love you,\u201d he mumbled as he opened the passenger door.</p> <p>\u201cI thought perhaps you did,\u201d she said.</p><p>Stepping back, Troy helped Faith inside and hurried to the driver\u2019s side. With his hands against the steering wheel, he said, \u201cI was thinking, hoping, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you know, that you and I might...might get together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for dinner,\u201d he snapped. \u201cFor life.\u201d</p> <p>His words were followed by a strained silence and then she asked, \u201cTroy, are you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you think this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no need to get huffy.\u201d</p><p>Tightening his grip on the steering wheel, he exhaled loudly. \u201cOkay, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor proposing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for blowing this.\u201d Troy doubted he could\u2019ve made a bigger mess of it had he tried.</p><p>\u201cWould you like my answer?\u201d Faith asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean, no, I don\u2019t want your answer. I meant, no, I want to try again and do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, I\u2019ll keep quiet and wait.\u201d Faith settled back in her seat.</p><p>Troy had no idea how to start over, let alone do this a little more elegantly. Then he grinned. \u201cDo you remember the night we were at our old necking spot and one of my deputies caught us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Troy, I was so embarrassed.\u201d She covered her face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d he muttered. \u201cI was the one who had to look him in the eye the next morning and pretend nothing had happened.\u201d</p><p>The memory lightened his mood, which helped ease the tension from between his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cI do love you, Troy,\u201d Faith whispered. She curved her fingers around his hand. \u201cI loved you when we were teenagers and I love you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d His voice throbbed with the depth of his emotions. \u201cI want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to retire with you and travel with you and make our home here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Faith Beckwith?\u201d</p><p>She smiled tearfully. \u201cI would like nothing better, Troy Davis.\u201d</p><p>Troy had the urge to roll down his window and shout at the top of his lungs. He didn\u2019t, in spite of his desire to let the whole world know that Faith had agreed to marry him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI would like nothing better,\u201d he said, echoing her response to his proposal.</p><p>They reached over the console, arms around each other. The kiss engulfed them both, fired by all the yearning of those long months apart. Those months of sorrow and misunderstanding....</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Faith whispered, her head on his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m almost grateful for that break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Troy admitted and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>They kissed again, then Faith said, \u201cWe should go.\u201d</p><p>Troy started the engine. \u201cI should phone Megan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell Scott and Jay Lynn,\u201d she added. \u201cOh.\u201d She flattened her palm against her chest. \u201cWhen do we want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Troy hadn\u2019t given the matter a thought. The hurdle had been convincing Faith to accept his proposal; anything beyond that was unimportant. \u201cNext week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy, be reasonable! I was thinking June, maybe July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d say June.\u201d The sooner, the better.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, together, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but where?\u201d</p><p>\u201c92 Pacific Avenue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Faith said, looking thoughtful. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded. He wasn\u2019t sure what for now meant\u2014probably that eventually they\u2019d find a new house with no history except what they created themselves, the two of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, we have to tell Olivia and Grace. They\u2019re at the Pancake Palace, waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>Troy checked his rearview mirror and backed out of the parking space, giddy with excitement and relief. When they walked into the Palace, Troy saw that Jack and Cliff had joined the two women.</p><p>The two couples sat in the circular booth and glanced expectantly at Troy and Faith.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jack asked when no one spoke. \u201cAm I going to have an announcement to make in Monday\u2019s edition?\u201d</p><p>Troy placed his arm around Faith\u2019s waist. She leaned toward him. \u201cI believe you will.\u201d</p><p>Grace and Olivia squealed with delight and clapped their hands.</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful news,\u201d Grace said, beaming at them. \u201cJust wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the racket out here?\u201d Goldie asked, coming toward them with a coffeepot in hand. \u201cMuch more of this, and I\u2019ll have to call the authorities.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed. \u201cThe authorities, in the form of our esteemed sheriff, are already here,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p>\u201cTroy and Faith are engaged,\u201d Olivia announced, gesturing toward them.</p><p>Goldie shook her head. \u201cLong overdue, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Troy whispered in Faith\u2019s ear.</p><p>Their friends squeezed closer together, and Faith and Troy slid into the booth. Everyone seemed to be talking at once, throwing questions at Faith, who did her best to address them all.</p><p>A few minutes later, Goldie delivered a tray filled with slices of coconut cream pie. \u201cSeeing this is a celebration, it\u2019s on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we don\u2019t know what she\u2019s charging for the coffee,\u201d Cliff joked.</p><p>\u201cFor you, it\u2019s double,\u201d Goldie said, pointing a finger in his direction.</p><p>They chatted excitedly as they indulged in pie and coffee.</p><p>\u201cSay,\u201d Jack said, licking the back of his fork. \u201cDid any of you hear about the old letters found in that duplex on Evergreen Place?\u201d</p><p>Everyone shrugged. \u201cHow\u2019d you hear about it?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cMack McAfee was in this morning, wanting to read old issues of the Chronicle\u2014from the 1940s. When I asked him why, he told me there was a box of letters hidden in one of the closets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything relevant from the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He had me read a couple of the letters, though. Interesting stuff,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cEvergreen Place?\u201d Olivia repeated. \u201cIf anyone will remember, it\u2019ll be my mother.\u201d</p><p>Troy enthusiastically seconded that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll suggest Mack speak to Charlotte, then,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>With his free hand Troy reached for Faith\u2019s. It felt good to sit here with friends, people he\u2019d known all his life, and\u2014especially\u2014to share this moment with the woman he loved. The woman who would soon be his wife. </p> </body></html>"]
