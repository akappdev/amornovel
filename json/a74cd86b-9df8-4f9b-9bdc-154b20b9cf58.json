He pressed his hand to his chest, resting his palm over the healing bullet wound just under his left pectoral. It had been a long plane ride, even in first class, and the hour-long trip from the airport hadn\u2019t been much better on him. He was exhausted, and all he wanted was his own bed.</p><p>Nick left the luggage at the door and hustled inside to turn off the beeping alarm. Kelly didn\u2019t have to tell him the code. They all knew where the keys to their castles were: Ty\u2019s and Owen\u2019s security codes, Nick\u2019s yacht, and a mental map of Digger\u2019s bayou booby traps.</p><p>The beeping from inside stopped, and Nick returned to roll the luggage out of the way. Kelly wrapped his arm over Nick\u2019s shoulders, and they hobbled through the front door. He could walk on his own when they\u2019d left the hospital in New Orleans, but after so much travel, he wasn\u2019t actually sure he could anymore.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this, bud,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick grunted. \u201cWe both know you took that bullet for me. Least I can do is get you home.\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t argue. He couldn\u2019t claim he\u2019d taken the bullet on purpose, but if he hadn\u2019t been there, it would have lodged in Nick\u2019s head, and they both knew how that would have ended. He leaned on Nick until they reached the worn leather recliner in the living room, but he hesitated as Nick tried to help lower him into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to get out of this thing if I get down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going anywhere.\u201d Nick tightened his grip on Kelly\u2019s waist and eased him into the recliner. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not carrying your ass upstairs right now, so sit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a horrible nursemaid.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled the handle on the side of the chair and shot Kelly\u2019s legs out.</p><p>As soon as the chair stopped wobbling, Kelly closed his eyes and relaxed into its familiar folds. He listened to Nick banging around, bringing their luggage inside, going through the refrigerator. Nick gasped and closed the refrigerator door quickly. They\u2019d been gone a long time; Kelly had no doubt what the inside of that thing smelled like.</p><p>Nick finally came back into the living room with a glass of water. \u201cYou ready for meds? I\u2019m going to put you to sleep and go get some groceries. And . . . maybe some rubber gloves.\u201d</p><p>Kelly mustered a smile. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Nick tapped one of the painkillers into his palm and grinned. \u201cBank shot?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly opened his mouth, and Nick tossed a pill into it, then another, snickering as he handed Kelly the glass of water. He threw a blanket over him, put the television remote and his cell phone within reach, then patted Kelly\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before you wake up.\u201d</p><p>Kelly closed his eyes, relaxing so the pills could to do their work. He knew he didn\u2019t have anything to worry about as long as Nick was on the job.</p><p>When Kelly awoke, it was to the sound of humming and the smell of bacon frying and a hint of Lysol. It took him a moment to remember where he was and why he was sore. He stared at Nick, who was curled on the couch a few feet away with a book.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse.</p><p>Nick jerked, glancing up at him. He set his book aside and scooted forward, but he didn\u2019t stand. \u201cYou okay? Need more pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. What\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>Nick went still and listened briefly, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly held his breath and realized the humming sound had faded. So had the smell. \u201cAre you cooking bacon?\u201d</p><p>Nick began to chuckle, then fought hard to stop. \u201cNo. Do you want me to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yeah. Wait, no, no.\u201d</p><p>Nick waited patiently, still smiling.</p><p>Kelly just stared at him, trying to get his brain to work. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was hallucinating, if his brain had picked up on all the things Nick had been doing while he\u2019d slept and then replayed them to him, or if he was just losing his mind. He wasn\u2019t sure he cared, though, because now that he was fully awake, he was in pain again. \u201cOkay, I need another pill,\u201d he finally said. Nick reached for the pill bottle. \u201cBut half of it this time. I\u2019m tired of you laughing at me for being drugged.\u201d</p><p>Nick merely nodded as he fished a pill out. He broke it and popped one half into his mouth before handing the other to Kelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d Kelly asked, laughing despite how much it hurt to do so.</p><p>\u201cConsider it payment for services rendered,\u201d Nick said as he took a sip of Kelly\u2019s water. Kelly gaped. Nick laughed harder and handed Kelly a whole pill to add to the half. \u201cIt\u2019s like a step above Tylenol, don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was still chuckling while he tried to down the painkillers.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to be more comfortable here or in your bed tonight?\u201d</p><p>Kelly peered at the darkened windows. He dreaded nighttime, because that was when he hurt more and slept fitfully. There was never anything on TV to entertain him in the wee hours when he was wide awake, and he\u2019d sped through all the books he had access to. It also got lonely, because he wasn\u2019t about to keep Nick awake at night as well as depend on him during the day. \u201cIs it that time already?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. If I sleep here, you can have my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, if you sleep here I\u2019ll be on the couch in case you need me. If you sleep upstairs, I\u2019ll make a pallet on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise not to roll in your sleep, and I\u2019ll share the bed.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him an easy smile and stood. \u201cWorth a try. I\u2019ve promised more for a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou whore,\u201d Kelly said, grinning as he slid his arm around Nick\u2019s neck and held tight for Nick to help him stand.</p><p>Once he was out of the recliner, he shuffled off to the bathroom on the ground floor. He could hear Nick lugging the suitcases up the steps to the loft bedroom of the cabin. Kelly was beyond grateful Nick had insisted he come with Kelly until he was well enough to fend for himself. Otherwise he didn\u2019t like to think where he\u2019d be stuck, or who would be stuck taking care of him. Nick was using every last hour of vacation time the Boston PD gave him to be here.</p><p>It took them a full five minutes to get Kelly up the stairs, mostly because they had to keep stopping to laugh at the absurdity of it, and by the time he eased onto the edge of his bed, they were both out of breath.</p><p>Kelly looked up at Nick and grinned. \u201cBet you never worked this hard to get a guy in bed, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot physically, no,\u201d Nick grunted. He pulled back the covers and arranged the pillows for support, then Kelly wrapped an arm around his neck and Nick leaned over him as he eased him into the bed.</p><p>Kelly had to squeeze his eyes closed against the pull. It wasn\u2019t really pain anymore, but there was some serious discomfort when he twisted and stretched, and the muscles were weak. Anything that forced him to use his core was still too much for him. He had to be careful or stitches and staples would tear loose.</p><p>Nick was still hovering over him when he opened his eyes. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly gasped. He cleared his throat. \u201cThat might not have been worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned crookedly. \u201cWell that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d</p><p>Kelly made a derogatory sound and closed his eyes again. Nick pulled away, then gently covered him with the sheet.</p><p>Kelly may have been the corpsman, but Nick had always been the caretaker of the group. He\u2019d been a wingman, fall guy, sounding board, and alibi. He\u2019d been mother, father, big brother, and crazy uncle. Whatever they\u2019d needed. He\u2019d always been the one who\u2019d made sure all the Sidewinder ducks were in a row, and he was probably the sole reason the house they\u2019d all shared in Jacksonville hadn\u2019t burned down.</p><p>It was so odd to think back on all those years and know that Nick had been hiding part of himself he thought he couldn\u2019t share. It almost broke Kelly\u2019s heart to think of all the secrets he\u2019d spilled to Nick, all the things he\u2019d gotten off his chest, but Nick had never been able to do the same.</p><p>Kelly opened his eyes to watch Nick. He was dragging Kelly\u2019s suitcase toward the armoire. \u201cHow\u2019d you make the jump, anyway?\u201d Kelly asked. He had to close his eyes again as exhaustion threatened.</p><p>\u201cWhat jump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, were you always into guys and just hid it? Were all the girls we chased together just a cover, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said quickly. Kelly opened one eye to see Nick clearing off the table beside the bed. He was smirking as he spoke. \u201cI consider myself equal opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Kelly watched him curiously. Over the years, Kelly had seen Nick\u2019s charisma and easy manner pull more barroom trysts than Ty and Digger combined. Sometimes it almost seemed like he did it by accident. Of course, that was all part of Nick\u2019s charm. A lot of what he did seemed accidental, which had contributed to other Marines calling him Lucky for much of his career. But Kelly knew better. Nick\u2019s methods were very deliberate, and his results were anything but luck.</p><p>Nick was a fascinating person, and Kelly had always thought so. When he\u2019d first joined the team, Ty and Nick had been quite intimidating. Fiercely loyal to each other, dangerously protective of each other, and so close they could finish each other\u2019s sentences and communicate without words. Once Kelly had proven himself worthy, he\u2019d been afforded the same loyalty from both men. With Ty, it was like being surrounded by a barricade of barbed wire and mines. Nick\u2019s loyalty felt more like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Everything about Nick felt warm, even the thought of him, and ever since Nick had come out to him, Kelly had wondered what that meant for him.</p><p>What did it mean that Kelly knew he would choose Nick over anyone else if a gun was put to his head? What did it mean that Nick\u2019s calls or texts always left him feeling both happy and melancholy all at the same time? What did it mean when his heart dropped into his toes as he\u2019d listened to Nick confess that he\u2019d been in love with Ty for over a decade?</p><p>Even now the thought sent a pang through his chest that made his wound throb and ache. He placed his hand over it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>Nick glanced over at him as he slid the lamp away from the bed and laid out Kelly\u2019s pill bottles, bandages, and other necessities. \u201cWhat\u2019s what like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing with a guy.\u201d He looked Nick up and down, trying to imagine. Would Nick be the same with a man as he was with a woman? Because Kelly had seen that, and it had looked fun. \u201cIs it different?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged and nodded. \u201cSort of, yeah. Physically? Definitely. Relationships, though, it depends a lot on who you\u2019re with.\u201d He glanced at Kelly and raised an eyebrow, smiling. \u201cYou a little bi-curious, Doc?\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed again, holding his side in a wasted attempt to keep it from hurting. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Nick teased. \u201cEither you\u2019re curious or you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. I mean, I like sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted,\u201d Nick mumbled, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cI never thought about it before.\u201d That was a damn lie. \u201cBut hell, if you can do it, so can I, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick placed his hand on Kelly\u2019s forehead, holding it there briefly before patting him and then moving away. He headed for the bathroom, probably making sure the path from Kelly\u2019s side of the bed was clear.</p><p>\u201cAnd a beautiful person is a beautiful person, so why not open up that door to more opportunities?\u201d Kelly called after him, desperate to have him return so they could continue the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re omnivorous,\u201d Nick said, his voice echoing off the tile and into the bedroom.</p><p>Kelly laughed again. He rested back to watch Nick move around the room. He was like a mother hen, prepping the nest. He moved the chair from the corner to the middle of the room, a convenient place for Kelly to get to and rest if he needed to. He went to the armoire beside the bathroom door and pulled out several extra pillows, putting pillowcases on them and tossing them on the bed. He was going to use them as a barrier between himself and Kelly as they slept, to protect Kelly\u2019s wound from any stray limbs.</p><p>Kelly found himself wishing those pillows wouldn\u2019t be there tonight. He didn\u2019t know why. Painkillers? Knowing Nick was bi and having the nerve to ask questions? Watching Ty and Zane and the connection they obviously shared while in New Orleans? Kelly had never felt that with his ex-wife, not once, but he\u2019d certainly felt it with brothers-in-arms. Maybe it was a perfect storm of factors, but Kelly was definitely curious. Asking Nick these questions had given him a little rush too. Nick gave him a little rush.</p><p>He had always been closest to Nick. Nick had been Kelly\u2019s best man at his wedding. He\u2019d also been the one who\u2019d taken him in briefly after he\u2019d divorced. They were very much alike in temperament, compared to the others who were all fire and stone. He and Nick were water and smoke: patient and nebulous and easy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d Nick said as he threw the last spare pillow on the bed. \u201cYou want anything from downstairs first?\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s breath quickened, and he blurted it out before he could think twice. \u201cWhy Ty?\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped short and cocked his head as if he hadn\u2019t heard right. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you came out to me, you told me you\u2019d been in love with Ty,\u201d Kelly explained. He held his breath, telling himself the answer would probably make his wound throb again and he didn\u2019t really want to know. \u201cWhy Ty?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick blushed and lowered his head, chewing on his lip. He shrugged. \u201cHe was . . . like this big shining beacon. For a long time I was a little in love with the idea of him. The idea of that kind of loyalty and trust for the rest of your life, you know? I think it was mostly just being young and wanting to believe in something. You know Ty. He was easy to believe in.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cAre you still in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Nick was already shaking his head. He came around the other side of the bed and sat, leaning against the headboard so Kelly couldn\u2019t see his face without twisting. \u201cWe went through too much. Nothing romantic about it. And the night I kissed him, the night I told you about everything, there was nothing there. We would have worked if we\u2019d wanted to, I guess, if we\u2019d never found anything else. But . . .\u201d He shrugged and shook his head.</p> <p>Kelly turned to try to see Nick\u2019s face. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing left there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019s kind of a relief. Life changes what love means, you know? What I felt about Ty, it was a different kind of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found something else?\u201d Kelly asked carefully, surprised by how nervous the question made him.</p><p>Nick looked at him oddly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why are you asking me these things? This isn\u2019t some sort of post-gunshot meltdown, is it, \u2019cause I\u2019m not built to handle those.\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to snicker, holding his chest so it wouldn\u2019t hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it is, we\u2019ll call Owen; he\u2019s good at the meltdown stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having a meltdown,\u201d Kelly assured him. \u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent, sitting there and looking confused for a few seconds before answering. \u201cSort of. We haven\u2019t had a date or anything, but we\u2019re . . . actually, I\u2019m not sure what we are.\u201d</p><p>The indecisive answer bolstered Kelly\u2019s courage and relieved him, which was an odd sensation. \u201cHey, Irish?\u201d</p><p>Nick turned to him, the beginnings of a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWill you kiss me?\u201d</p> <p>The smile faded into wide-eyed shock. Nick\u2019s eyes were so green he almost looked like a cartoon. Kelly began to laugh. He had to hold his hand over his wound, but he couldn\u2019t stop laughing. He reached out to put his other hand on Nick\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m laughing,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cIt\u2019s the drugs, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and gently peeled Kelly\u2019s fingers off his forearm. \u201cFrom now on you only get halves,\u201d he mumbled. He slid off the bed, beginning to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Nick turned, trying to look annoyed but still laughing. Kelly schooled his features, frowning dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you look it,\u201d Nick drawled.</p><p>\u201cI want you to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Nick examined him, seeming dubious.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what it feels like to kiss a guy. And you\u2019ve had a lot of practice, so I know you\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you simultaneously complimenting me and calling me a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . I\u2019m just impressed you can take half a Percocet and say simul . . . simultaneous.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily, fighting back his smile. He came around the end of the bed and sat next to Kelly\u2019s hip, turning to hover over him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was surprised when his stomach flipped, but he liked the feeling. \u201cOkay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. If you want me to kiss you, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cBut only if you can sit up on your own, and then pass a field sobriety test.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled his eyes and snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that too if you want it,\u201d Nick said, laughing as he pushed off the bed and headed for the loft steps.</p><p>Kelly watched him, trying to decide if the flip in his stomach was excitement or nerves. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped at the head of the staircase and turned again, ever patient.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he remained there for a few moments before he moved slowly back to the bed. \u201cYou really want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll know what it feels like to kiss a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you and Ty both seem to enjoy it. What\u2019s good for you is good for me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a horrible reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Nick sat down again, close enough that the mattress dipped and Kelly slid toward him. They stared at each other for a few seconds, Kelly holding his breath as Nick thought it through. He was curious, because he knew locking lips with another dude had to be different from kissing a woman, and he was by nature an inquisitive person. He was open to trying just about anything once, and he\u2019d always kind of been on the fence about it. But he was also wondering what it would be like to kiss Nick, and that had nothing to do with the painkillers or his innate desire to try new things.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said quietly. He adjusted the way he was sitting, propping one hand on Kelly\u2019s other side as he leaned over him.</p><p>Kelly held up a finger. \u201cNo half-assed middle school kissing, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the whole deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is starting to feel like I\u2019m leasing a car or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, I want the Irish special.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and glanced up at the ceiling. \u201cFine. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, his lips twitching on a smile and his chest fluttering. They stared at each other as Nick leaned over him, and it was harder for Kelly to catch his breath as he waited for Nick to make his move. He licked his lips.</p><p>Nick finally laughed. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I can\u2019t do this with you looking at me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gave a long-suffering sigh, but he closed his eyes anyway, still fighting a smile. He felt Nick lean closer, and he inhaled sharply, holding his breath as Nick\u2019s lips brushed the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He parted his lips and tilted his head, their noses bumping as Nick moved the same way. They both laughed and Kelly cocked his head the other way, dragging his lower lip across Nick\u2019s as they adjusted. Then Nick was kissing him. Really kissing him. His lips parted, tongue darting between them to lick at Kelly\u2019s lips. His teeth closed over Kelly\u2019s lower lip and dragged before his tongue slipped inside Kelly\u2019s mouth.</p><p>They both moaned.</p><p>Kelly reached up and grabbed a handful of Nick\u2019s shirt, barely realizing he\u2019d done it. His knuckles knocked against hard muscles. Nick\u2019s hand came up to Kelly\u2019s face, brushing his cheek tentatively as if he wasn\u2019t sure he was allowed to touch. Kelly nipped at his lip, and Nick groaned again. He pushed his hand under Kelly\u2019s head and clutched at his hair.</p><p>The stubble on Nick\u2019s chin scratched against Kelly\u2019s cheek. Nick leaned more on top of him, his hands clamping down in the kind of grip Kelly had never felt from a lover. The kiss was more forceful and demanding than any he\u2019d ever experienced, and he found himself using his tongue and his teeth to fight back, even as he pulled Nick closer to urge him on.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hand pressed against Nick\u2019s chest, and it wasn\u2019t even odd that there was nothing but muscle to grab there. He moaned again, and the sound traveled through his body, awakening the rest of him to the moment, to the scent of guns instead of roses, the brush of leather instead of lace.</p><p>Kelly gasped as Nick began to pull away. He didn\u2019t have the strength yet to sit up to follow. Their lips dragged as they separated. Nick\u2019s fingers released Kelly\u2019s hair and slid out from under him as he pushed himself up. Kelly finally opened his eyes, but he didn\u2019t let go of Nick\u2019s shirt. His heart was hammering and his mind was churning, making him light-headed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kelly finally breathed. \u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and ran his thumb across his lip. Kelly knew him well enough to know when Nick was nervous, and he was nervous now. He tightened his grip on Nick\u2019s shirt to keep him from getting up. Nick turned hesitant green eyes on him, waiting for his verdict. Kelly had never really appreciated the color of Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Nick took in a deep breath and then let it out slowly, like he was trying to calm himself. He patted Kelly\u2019s hand, taking it in his and gently extricating his shirt. \u201cLet\u2019s just let that one settle with the Percocet, okay?\u201d</p><p>He made to stand, and Kelly was forced to let him go.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Nick was walking away, running a hand through his hair, and Kelly realized his entire body was still buzzing. It might have been from the painkillers, but he was willing to place bets on his buddy right now.</p><p>It was the same feeling he got when his phone rang. The same feeling as waking up in the hospital to find Nick holding his hand. The same warmth of a blanket wrapping around his shoulders, and something inside him screamed for him to pursue it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nick,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Nick stopped and rolled his neck, like he might have been irritated by Kelly\u2019s repeated attempts to keep him from descending the stairs. He turned, though, the same easy smile on his face, his feelings masked by his legendary patience.</p><p>\u201cIs the rest of it like that too?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick ran his teeth across his lip, beginning to nod. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always if you have the right dance partner?\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at him, finding himself nodding. Jesus, was it possible he was considering Nick O\u2019Flaherty a dance partner right now? Yes. Yes, he was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask me to fuck you now, are you?\u201d Nick asked, deadpan.</p><p>Kelly began to laugh. \u201cThe thought was crossing my mind.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s smile faded. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. You got the engine revved a little.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and turned toward the stairs. \u201cPut him back in the garage then. I don\u2019t drive automatics,\u201d he said as he thumped down the stairs.</p><p>Nick woke with a jerk as a hand grabbed at his arm. He peered over in the moonlight. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to move,\u201d Kelly grunted.</p><p>They\u2019d shared enough beds\u2014and floors\u2014over the years that Nick knew Kelly slept on his side. Being forced to sleep flat on his back made him restless and miserable, but he hadn\u2019t recovered the strength in his torso yet to roll onto his side without help or something to grab onto and pull.</p><p>Nick fumbled for the pillows he\u2019d stacked between them and tossed them to the foot of the bed, rolling onto his side and holding his arm out. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Kelly used Nick\u2019s forearm to pull himself to his side, and as soon as he was settled, Nick took the spare pillows and wedged them behind Kelly\u2019s back to rest against. He was hyperaware of how close he was, of his breaths hitting Kelly\u2019s cheek as he reached across him. Goddammit, why had he even agreed to that kiss in the first place? Now the next day or so would be awkward as hell as he tried to forget how fucking good Kelly felt in his arms.</p><p>Once he was certain there was support behind Kelly, he took the pillow he\u2019d been using and pushed it against Kelly\u2019s chest to give him something to hold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that,\u201d Kelly mumbled. He shoved the pillow back toward the head of the bed.</p><p>Nick scowled. \u201cYou always hold something when you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking your pillow. Quit it.\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed and laid back down, facing Kelly. He watched him for several minutes, alert for signs of pain or misery, waiting for his breathing to even out. It didn\u2019t though, and finally Kelly opened his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou hurting?\u201d Nick asked him.</p><p>\u201cA little. Not enough to take anything. I just can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>Nick remained silent, waiting for Kelly to go on. If he needed to get something off his chest, he would. And Nick had a feeling he knew exactly what Kelly needed to discuss.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good kiss,\u201d Kelly finally said.</p><p>Nick huffed a laugh. \u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m a fabulous kisser and you\u2019re easy.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled his eyes.</p><p>Nick watched and waited, but finally he got tired of the weighty silence. \u201cAre you asking me if it means you\u2019re gay if you liked one kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any answers. I\u2019m leaning toward no.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sighed loudly. \u201cI still want you to do it again. Does that matter?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s chest fluttered. He had to fight for enough breath to answer. \u201cYou mean does it matter in the grand scheme of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean does it matter to you?\u201d</p><p>Nick caught his breath, afraid to break the silence as they stared across the dim inches. He had spent years trying to avoid thinking of his closest friends in a sexual way. It had been especially difficult with Kelly at first, because they were both touchy-feely people. Eventually, years of camaraderie had whitewashed the physical nature of their friendship, but that one fucking kiss had taken down those mental barriers in a heartbeat. Did it matter to him that Kelly might be struggling with his sexual identity after all these years? Yes. Did it matter to him that Kelly had chosen him to try to help him answer those questions? Yes.</p><p>Did it matter to him that he wanted nothing more than to grab Kelly\u2019s face and kiss him again until neither of them could breathe, that he wanted to feel Kelly\u2019s body against his now, that his mind had gone into overdrive and couldn\u2019t seem to stop spinning the moment Kelly\u2019s fingers had grasped at his T-shirt? Did it matter that Kelly was saying he wanted the same thing? \u201cIt does matter to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you give me more?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick let out his pent-up breath and closed his eyes, shaking his head. Something akin to terror streaked through him, followed swiftly by lust. Giving Kelly more would mean ramifications neither of them could deal with. It would mean altering the state of their friendship, risking it, and for what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not under the influence anymore. Much. Even if I was, I\u2019ve done things way worse than you that I\u2019ve never regretted.\u201d</p> <p>Nick barked a laugh, and they both began to chuckle. Suddenly the tension was gone again and it was just the Devil Doc in bed with him once more. Kelly reached across the space between them and brushed his fingers over Nick\u2019s knuckles. A scar on the back of Nick\u2019s hand still displayed the tiny railroad tracks where Kelly had stitched a gash in the field. He ran his fingers across it. There were half a dozen other places on Nick\u2019s body that he\u2019d stitched up over the years. Nick knew his hands well. He\u2019d never seen them as anything but healing hands, though, not until the moment Kelly\u2019s fingers had clutched at his shirt and pulled him closer as they\u2019d kissed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d Nick splayed his fingers, and Kelly\u2019s twined with them, grasping his hand. Kelly gave his fingers a tug and Nick slid across the inches between them. Their lips met, and once again it stole Nick\u2019s breath from his lungs, sped his heart until his ears buzzed, flushed his body with ice and fire. Kelly pulled his hand loose and grabbed Nick\u2019s elbow, pulling at it until he was able to get his hand under the sleeve and against Nick\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this work?\u201d Kelly gasped. His lips moved against Nick\u2019s, and Nick groaned.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work at all. You can\u2019t even roll over by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>He reached around Kelly and pushed at the pillows he\u2019d been so careful to arrange, then he wrapped his arm around him and dragged him close enough to press against him. They\u2019d shared a bed hundreds of times, and more often than not they\u2019d woken up cuddling. Kelly somehow always managed to end up the big spoon. Maybe they could keep this within the realm of something they understood. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cYou saying you can\u2019t handle that?\u201d Kelly needled, grinning.</p><p>Nick could see that grin in the moonlight, had seen that grin a thousand times before. Now, though, he wanted to wipe it away with another kiss. Jesus, if they didn\u2019t do something about this now, it was going to linger.</p><p>He pushed Kelly flat, then reached across him and flipped the lamp on so he could see Kelly\u2019s face more clearly. Kelly groaned as his erection rubbed against Nick\u2019s thigh. The teasing smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cGod, that feels weird,\u201d Kelly huffed.</p><p>\u201cSay the word and I\u2019ll stop,\u201d Nick grunted, although he was silently praying Kelly would do no such thing. He would never be able to look at Kelly\u2019s hands the same way again, but at least this way they might get it out of their systems.</p> <p>Kelly shifted his shoulders, staring at Nick with wide eyes. Nick had him pinned to the mattress. One of Kelly\u2019s hands had found its way all the way under Nick\u2019s shirt to drag down the giant eagle, globe, and anchor tattoo on Nick\u2019s shoulder, and he\u2019d thrown one foot over Nick\u2019s calf as their legs tangled together. They were both hard.</p><p>\u201cIt feels good,\u201d Kelly finally whispered, sounding surprised. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fuck you, Kels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re hurt and I get rough.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard, his breath quickening. \u201cHow rough?\u201d</p><p>Nick cocked his head and smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of hot.\u201d</p> <p>Nick stretched out over him and kissed him, careful not to rest his full weight on him, eliciting a louder groan from Kelly. He shifted until he could feel Kelly\u2019s erection against his through his boxers.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Nick,\u201d Kelly gasped, finally dropping the humor in his voice. He pushed at Nick\u2019s shirt. \u201cLose some of this.\u201d</p><p>Nick shoved up and tugged at his shirt with his free hand, yanking it over his head and throwing it aside. Kelly ran his hand up Nick\u2019s chest, fingers barely grazing, tentative. He was an odd mixture of bold and uncertain. Nick didn\u2019t know why that turned him on, but it did. He\u2019d never been with anyone for their first time. He\u2019d certainly never been with a friend. Oh God, this was probably a bad idea. But something about it felt like a great idea as Kelly met his eyes, and Nick couldn\u2019t deny him anything in that moment.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>Kelly laughed again, his body relaxing even more. He dragged his fingers along the muscles of Nick\u2019s abdomen, never taking his eyes off Nick\u2019s. Nick fought to regulate his breathing, but it was getting difficult. He gasped when Kelly\u2019s hand dipped under the elastic of his boxers, and he lowered himself to nip at Kelly\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, how rough are you?\u201d Kelly asked, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get healed up, maybe I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s breaths came harder and faster. \u201cCan you show me a little?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, kissing Kelly one more time before he got to his hands and knees. Kelly shoved at his boxers, pushing them down to his thighs. With the material out of the way, his fingers dragged back across Nick\u2019s hips and up his ribs.</p><p>Nick hovered over him, meeting his eyes and trying to read just how serious he was. Kelly was the same person who\u2019d insisted it would be fun to BASE jump the Grand Canyon and had begged Nick to go with him to Nicaragua to go volcano boarding. He never thought things through to their natural end. That was Nick\u2019s job. \u201cReaching the point of no return on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for an hour, Nick. Couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s breath caught. Kelly\u2019d been lying awake thinking about this. Thinking about him. Any reservations that had remained went out the window with that. Nick shoved away from him so he could tug his sleep bottoms down for him. He didn\u2019t even try to get the pants all the way off, just pulled them to Kelly\u2019s knees before bending his head to place a kiss at Kelly\u2019s hip.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s entire body jerked and he gasped, reaching down to grab a handful of Nick\u2019s hair. Nick glanced up and grinned as he met Kelly\u2019s eyes. Kelly was watching him, biting his tongue. Nick ducked his head to lick at him, but Kelly\u2019s hand in his hair stopped him. His nerves tumbled, and Nick looked up again, expecting to see indecision on Kelly\u2019s face. Instead, Kelly was smiling.</p><p>\u201cBetter make it good,\u201d Kelly drawled. \u201cNo pressure.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted at him. Yeah. He did need to make it good. In case this was the only chance Kelly gave him. And in case it wasn\u2019t . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd no biting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more rules than the Marine Corps,\u201d Nick mumbled. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>To make his point, he dragged his teeth across Kelly\u2019s hip bone and bit down. Kelly was still squirming and cussing at him when Nick took his cock into his mouth and all the way to the back of his throat in one swift motion.</p><p>\u201cHoly Jesus!\u201d Kelly cried, and his other hand landed on Nick\u2019s shoulder. The sound of the slap echoed off the loft\u2019s sloped ceiling. Nick raised his head slowly, letting Kelly\u2019s cock slide between his lips, curling his tongue around the head before he licked at the tip one last time and looked up at Kelly again.</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t smiling anymore. \u201cYou can bite,\u201d he gasped as he began to kick out of his pajama bottoms. \u201cYou can do whatever the fuck you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Nick purred, smirking. \u201cWhat I want to do isn\u2019t really on the table yet.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s chest heaved with the deep breaths he was taking. Nick slid a hand under his thigh and raised his leg, remembering to be careful as he hefted it onto his shoulder. He bent his head and licked at the crease of Kelly\u2019s thigh. They shared a grin, and Kelly began to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI remember sharing a wall with you, O\u2019Flaherty. I know how dirty you are.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and licked at the head of his cock, sucking it into his mouth. He sucked until Kelly\u2019s hand tightened in his hair again, then he forced Kelly\u2019s cock to the back of his throat and swallowed around it. Kelly shouted, starting to cuss and call Nick names he usually only heard when they were playing paintball.</p><p>He sucked Kelly up and down one last time and then pushed at his leg, rolling Kelly\u2019s hips back. He licked at his balls and then moved his lips over them, massaging them, humming as he did it. Kelly\u2019s leg began to tighten over his shoulder, and Nick took the cue and sucked one of his balls into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch! Fuck! How are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed in response, and Kelly began to writhe. He twisted, his heel digging into Nick\u2019s spine, his hand pulling Nick\u2019s hair hard enough that Nick raised his head. He grabbed Kelly\u2019s wrist and jerked it away from his hair, pinning it to the mattress beside Kelly\u2019s hip.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop if you need to,\u201d he growled. \u201cBut don\u2019t pull my fucking hair out.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded fervently.</p><p>Nick began to stroke his cock, using the hand he had wrapped around Kelly\u2019s thigh. He sucked on his finger as Kelly watched him from under lowered lashes.</p><p>\u201cThis gonna hurt?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Nick whispered. He pressed his wet finger against the muscles around Kelly\u2019s asshole, not hard enough to enter him, just to let him feel something there.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s heel dug into his back. His fingers clutched at the sheet beside him. \u201cGod, that feels weird!\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head and dragged his palm over Kelly\u2019s thigh. \u201cYou are way too tense for that,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He let Kelly\u2019s leg slide down his arm, then he crawled up Kelly\u2019s body, sliding his cock against Kelly\u2019s leg, careful not to settle his weight on Kelly\u2019s abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tense,\u201d Kelly argued as soon as Nick was looking him in the eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m just trying not to fucking come all over you two seconds after you touched me. How the hell did you do the swallowing thing?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, lowering himself, careful to avoid Kelly\u2019s wound as he stretched out against his body. Kelly was shorter than him by a few inches and more compact, but he was all hard muscle and dry wit.</p><p>\u201cYou realize coming all over me is sort of what I\u2019m going for, right?\u201d</p><p>Kelly breathed out hard. His hand came to rest against Nick\u2019s ribs, then dragged lower, shoving between their bodies. Nick had to push up to let him reach between them, and then Kelly\u2019s fingers were wrapping around his cock. Nick\u2019s breath stuttered and his eyes fell shut. He lowered his head to press his forehead against Kelly\u2019s. Their noses smashed together. Kelly lifted his chin for a kiss, then began to stroke Nick, his lips mimicking the lazy rhythm. Nick groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot, you know that?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>\u201cI bet you tell that to all your oldest friends as you\u2019re jacking them off.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snickered and arched his back, seeking contact. \u201cNo, just you.\u201d</p><p>Nick propped himself on one elbow and sought Kelly\u2019s cock with his other hand. Their knuckles brushed as they gripped each other. Nick thrust his hips into Kelly\u2019s.</p><p>Kelly bit at Nick\u2019s lip, smiling. \u201cYou remember that trip to San Diego when we shared a hotel room and you hooked up with that freaky blonde?\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted, nodding. \u201cOdd time to bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you,\u201d Kelly admitted, closing his eyes. \u201cWhenever I need to get off, I think about that night. I always thought it was the girl, but now I\u2019m thinking maybe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking way too much,\u201d Nick snarled. He didn\u2019t want to hear that, no matter how much the implications made his stomach flutter or his heart race. He grabbed Kelly\u2019s hands and slammed both into the mattress, holding him by his wrists. He thrust his hips, sliding his leaking cock along Kelly\u2019s. \u201cWhat you should be thinking about is wrapping your legs around me,\u201d he said against Kelly\u2019s lips before kissing him. He licked at Kelly\u2019s teeth and then sucked on his tongue.</p><p>Kelly groaned and absently tried to pull both knees up. He cursed in frustration when he couldn\u2019t manage it, and Nick fumbled at his side to help him. Kelly nodded almost frantically, and Nick helped him to move and slide his feet over Nick\u2019s thighs.</p><p>Nick continued to rut against him, pressing down hard, cocks sliding, balls pressing together. It would be so easy in this position to just put the head of his cock against Kelly\u2019s ass and shove himself in. That was good to know for next time.</p><p>\u201cNow you should be thinking about me fucking you,\u201d he hissed. \u201cBecause I sure as hell am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Kelly breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t say his name when I fuck you. You say mine.\u201d</p><p>Kelly responded with an inarticulate gasp.</p><p>Nick shoved his hips hard against Kelly\u2019s, their cocks both leaking, gliding against sweaty muscles. He put his lips against Kelly\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you thinking about me inside you?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted and shuddered. \u201cFuck yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you should be thinking, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded jerkily. Nick released one of his hands and dragged his palm up Kelly\u2019s neck and chin, shoving one finger into his mouth. Kelly moaned and sucked it in, wrapping his tongue around it and covering Nick\u2019s finger in saliva. He seemed to instinctively know what Nick intended to do, and he obliged.</p><p>Nick reached between them and used his slick finger to push at those stubborn muscles again, this time forcing the blunt tip past them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNick!\u201d Kelly gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re thinking?\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>\u201cYou inside me,\u201d Kelly recited breathlessly. \u201cYour big fucking dick in there.\u201d</p> <p>Nick used the tip of his finger to press at those muscles but didn\u2019t go deeper, fighting his orgasm. The idea of being inside Kelly when either of them came was almost too much.</p><p>Kelly clutched at him, squirming under him, writhing against his cock, pushing at Nick\u2019s finger and forcing the muscles to fight back. \u201cFuck, Nick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cScream my fucking name.\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed him, a brutal clash of tongues and teeth as Kelly bucked under him, crying out against his lips. It wasn\u2019t Nick\u2019s name, but it was close enough. The first jolt of his orgasm hit and he pulled his finger away, holding Kelly down by both arms as he rutted against him, adding hot spurts of cum to the sweat already mingling between them.</p><p>He pushed up to his knees to take his cock in hand and stroke himself through the rest of the orgasm. They both watched greedily as he came all over Kelly\u2019s lower abs.</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s cock was pulsing, cum dripping down its side. He reached to finish himself off, but Nick batted his hand away and scooted down until he could lick that cum off and suck the head into his mouth. Kelly\u2019s hand landed in his hair again, and he shoved up into Nick\u2019s mouth as he shot the rest of his load down Nick\u2019s throat.</p><p>When Kelly\u2019s fingers finally loosened their grip, Nick collapsed beside him in the bed, gasping in time with Kelly\u2019s gulps for air.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Kelly finally stuttered.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fucking . . . mind. My mind is blown.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed weakly and sat up. \u201cYou want water?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly grabbed his arm, stopping him and pulling him off balance so he toppled back to his side. He gazed up into Kelly\u2019s eyes in the harsh lamplight. Nick had always loved Kelly\u2019s oddly colored eyes, but he\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d be looking into them like this.</p><p>\u201c\u2018You don\u2019t say his name, you say mine\u2019?\u201d Kelly repeated incredulously. \u201cI almost came right then, where the fuck have you been hiding that?\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned and rested on his elbow. \u201cOh God, Kels, what have we done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. We\u2019re exploring this further.\u201d Kelly waved a finger in Nick\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick agreed. He reached across Kelly\u2019s body, bending to kiss him as he grabbed the bottle of painkillers off the bedside table. They continued the kiss as Nick popped the lid off the bottle, and Kelly moaned plaintively when Nick pulled away.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>Nick broke one of the pills in half and offered one half to Kelly with a cheeky grin. \u201cIn place of a cigarette?\u201d</p><p>Kelly took the pill, watching with narrowed eyes as Nick popped the other half in his mouth. They shared a bottle of water, laughing as they used one of the spare pillows to clean off.</p> <p>As they were settling down to sleep, Nick began to build the pillow barrier between them again. Kelly reached out and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI think if I can handle what we just did, I can take it if you accidentally roll over in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and grinned. \u201cAre you too butch to cuddle?\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and laid himself out, scooting closer to Kelly and resting his head in the crook of his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this tomorrow,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes and letting the exhaustion take over.</p><p>Kelly laughed, running his fingers through Nick\u2019s hair. \u201cOh yeah, we will.\u201d</p><p>Kelly woke when the warmth of the sun touched his face. He turned away from it, reaching out across the bed. His hand hit empty space, though, and he finally opened his eyes and raised his head.</p><p>\u201cIrish?\u201d he said, voice hoarse from sleep.</p><p>Nick was gone, though, and his side of the bed was cold under Kelly\u2019s fingers. Kelly struggled to sit, using the covers and the mattress to pull himself up.</p><p>\u201cLoved me and left me. Typical O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Kelly muttered. He probably should have been a nervous wreck waking up alone after last night, especially since Nick was a proven flight risk when it came to relationships. But then he glanced at the clock on the table out of habit and saw a note there instructing him to call for help if he needed it. He smiled at Nick\u2019s blunt, no-frills handwriting. His pills were lined up for him, and a glass of water sat within arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>He managed to drag himself out of bed and make it to the bathroom without too much trouble. Wiping his stomach clean with a damp rag and brushing his teeth was all the effort he put into his appearance, though.</p><p>He was wiping some other guy\u2019s spunk off his stomach. Jesus. It wasn\u2019t just some other guy, either. It was Nick. It was his best friend. It was his best friend he\u2019d always thought was straight until a year ago. What did that even fucking mean for him? Could Kelly still call himself straight? Was he gay now? God, he hoped Nick had some answers for him because Nick was the only person he could think of to even ask these things.</p><p>He turned to examine himself in the mirror. \u201cReally?\u201d he whispered to his reflection. He nodded and began to grin without meaning to. \u201cOkay then. You stupid asshole.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on a pair of sweat pants and a ragged T-shirt, but he had to sit on the end of the bed and rest after he was dressed. He was hard-pressed not to laugh at himself. Too weak to dress himself without a breather, but not too fucking weak to beg his best friend to fuck him.</p><p>He caught sight of the pajama bottoms he\u2019d been wearing last night, crumpled at the foot of the bed where he\u2019d kicked them. His stomach fluttered, and again he was surprised by the reaction. Nick had been good. Very good. Jizz-in-your-pants good. Everything about it had been good, and Kelly was shockingly okay with that. What made him kind of want to throw up was wondering how Nick was taking it.</p><p>He winced as he stood, fighting past the pull as he shuffled toward the stairs. The painkillers hadn\u2019t kicked in yet, and mornings were always the worst. He stood at the top of the steps, looking down. It seemed like a long way without someone there to catch him if he fell.</p><p>Nick appeared at the bottom of the staircase, peering up at him. \u201cYou need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I didn\u2019t,\u201d Kelly said with a grin. \u201cI might have been wrong.\u201d</p><p>Nick took the stairs two at a time, coming to the step below him and letting him lean on his shoulders. Nick\u2019s arm slipped around his waist, and Kelly\u2019s entire body shivered. Nick\u2019s scent, the way he gripped Kelly\u2019s shirt, the warmth of his body, all brought back memories of last night with a confusing rush of sensations.</p><p>\u201cYou too stubborn to call for help now?\u201d Nick muttered.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up at him, frowning. Kelly was silent as they fumbled their way down the stairs. He couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath, and he wasn\u2019t used to the way his chest kept filling with butterflies.</p><p>When he\u2019d asked Nick to kiss him last night, he\u2019d never anticipated this lingering result.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get a chance to study Nick\u2019s face again until he was easing into his recliner. He looked up as Nick bent over him. Nick didn\u2019t seem flustered. He didn\u2019t seem nervous or scared or confused or any of the other myriad of emotions Kelly had felt in the last two minutes. But then, when had Nick ever looked nervous?</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d Nick said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you wanted food,\u201d Nick said with a smile. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, closing his eyes and grimacing as he tried to get comfortable. He jumped when Nick patted his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou hurting?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, his frown deepening. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked, voice going softer.</p><p>Kelly grinned slowly. That intimate tone of voice, talking about what they\u2019d done last night, was something he found surprisingly sexy.</p><p>\u201cKels?\u201d</p><p>Kelly ran a gentle finger over his bullet wound and shrugged. \u201cIt bled a little. Maybe a stitch pulled loose or something.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s gaze dropped to Kelly\u2019s wound, and his face paled. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached out and ran a hand over Nick\u2019s palm, making sure Nick was looking into his eyes again before he spoke. \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling anything last night but good.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked both relieved and amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you fixing?\u201d Kelly asked to get Nick\u2019s mind off how delicate Kelly still was. Nick was an exceptional cook. They\u2019d discovered that when they\u2019d been stationed at Lejeune and had all gone in to rent a house together. Nick\u2019s job had always been to cook.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged, shaking his head. He wasn\u2019t really in the mood for food.</p><p>Nick sighed and sat on the edge of the coffee table, his hands clasped between his knees. \u201cThis is last night catching up to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, voice grim.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s breath caught. He made the mistake of meeting Nick\u2019s eyes, and he was caught by them, transfixed by their color, by the earnest concern in them.</p><p>Nick inhaled deeply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say right now that won\u2019t be awkward.\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to laugh. \u201cI know it. We don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of think we do,\u201d Nick said. \u201cEventually we\u2019ll have to. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t like the feeling of having something hanging between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd right now there\u2019s a wicked big thing hanging there.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Kelly blurted.</p><p>Nick shrugged, looking around the room with a little smile. \u201cI feel like I took advantage of you being drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I feel like I did,\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah but, if you hadn\u2019t, you\u2019d be feeling guilty for telling me no,\u201d Kelly argued.</p><p>\u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Nick said. A smile pulled at his lips. \u201cI\u2019d be regretting telling you no and probably very frustrated, but . . .\u201d</p><p>The admission warmed Kelly all the way to his toes. \u201cSo that\u2019s how you do it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just learned the secret to the O\u2019Flaherty charm,\u201d Kelly said, beginning to grin. \u201cYou just . . . stun the other person with honesty.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled, his cheeks beginning to flush. But he didn\u2019t look away. They stared at each other, getting lost in the familiarity for long seconds before Nick leaned closer. \u201cAre you okay, Kels? And I don\u2019t mean the hole in your chest.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. Then he frowned. \u201cNo, actually.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s face clouded over, his brow furrowing and his eyes apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cSee, every time I think about you now, I get these butterflies,\u201d Kelly explained, fluttering his fingers at his chest. \u201cAnd it\u2019s weird because it\u2019s you, and you\u2019re you. But I like it too. And . . . I like that it\u2019s you. So I\u2019m not sure what to do with that.\u201d</p><p>Nick licked his lips, leaving his tongue at the corner of his mouth like he always did when he was thinking. Kelly\u2019s eyes were drawn to it briefly before he tore his attention away and focused back on Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d Nick finally said.</p><p>\u201cHow about telling me it\u2019ll pass? Or that it\u2019s just the drugs. Or almost dying. Come on, O\u2019Flaherty, I know you have half a dozen excuses at the ready to use for things like this.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent, chewing on his lip.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s smile fell. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never run into a thing like this,\u201d Nick admitted.</p><p>Kelly cocked his head. \u201cYou feel it too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cButterflies whenever I think about myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play word games with me, smart-ass. The meds haven\u2019t kicked in yet.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed and contemplated his hands. He dragged his thumb over the scar on the back of his hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s unproductive to talk about it until you\u2019ve recovered a little more.\u201d He looked up, forcing a smile to cover the hint of fear Kelly could see in his eyes.</p><p>Kelly wanted to push, to get past that smile and see just what Nick was thinking, what he was afraid of. Because the prospects last night had opened up were all parading past Kelly\u2019s mind, and he liked what he saw. He needed Nick to be on the same page with him, though, and Nick obviously wasn\u2019t yet. Kelly knew one thing for certain, and that was that Nick wouldn\u2019t be pushed, he wouldn\u2019t be bullied, and he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t turn that page faster if Kelly tried to do it for him.</p><p>So Kelly just nodded. \u201cHow about pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith M&amp;M\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have some?\u201d Kelly asked, his eyes going wider and his mouth beginning to water.</p><p>Nick gave him a sly grin and stood. He patted Kelly\u2019s head as he walked by him, heading for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Kelly grunted, reaching out to grasp Nick\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s all I get the morning after?\u201d</p><p>Nick stutter-stepped and backtracked to look down at Kelly. \u201cWhat? I gave you drugs and I\u2019m fixing your breakfast on a tray, what more do you want?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned and gave Nick\u2019s arm a little tug. He could see Nick biting his tongue when he smiled, and something about it kicked Kelly\u2019s sex drive into gear. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to make me ask for it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick raised an eyebrow, smiling wider.</p><p>Kelly rolled his eyes and sagged his shoulders, tugging Nick again. \u201cGive me a kiss!\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed, glancing around the room as he fought a smile. He might have been trying to come up with a reason not to, or he might have been fighting the fact that he wanted to. He finally put a hand on Kelly\u2019s head and bent over him, narrowing his eyes when he peered into Kelly\u2019s. He smiled and pressed his nose and lips against Kelly\u2019s cheek before giving him a gentle kiss, then moved away before Kelly could seek more, leaving Kelly sitting there filled with warmth and nerves.</p> <p>Kelly smiled, watching Nick\u2019s reflection in the dark television as he moved around in the kitchen, making Kelly\u2019s pancakes. Nick knew he liked pancakes with M&amp;M\u2019s in them. Kelly had married a woman who\u2019d never even known such a simple fact about him, who\u2019d never cared to learn.</p><p>He let himself ponder that. Ponder Nick. Every time he\u2019d woken up in the hospital in New Orleans, Nick had been there. Sometimes Ty had been there as well, sitting with him, talking with Nick, or curled up asleep in the chair in the corner. But Nick had been there every time without fail. He\u2019d sat in the chair and read. He\u2019d slept curled up on the couch that was too short for him, or with his head resting on the bed near Kelly\u2019s hand. He\u2019d stolen Kelly\u2019s lunch instead of leaving to go to the cafeteria, and then called to get him more when he woke.</p><p>Nick hadn\u2019t left his side, and when the time had come for Kelly to be discharged, Nick hadn\u2019t even discussed coming home with him. He\u2019d simply assumed he would. People searched their entire lives for someone to just care about them. Somehow Kelly had taken that feeling for granted.</p><p>Nick returned and set a plate of pancakes down on the table by Kelly\u2019s side. Kelly watched him, still caught up on the idea of someone who would literally lay down his life for him, who had almost done so on several occasions. Kelly had loved Nick for years, just like he loved the rest of the team. Who was to say that couldn\u2019t be more? Where was it written that either of them had to go through life looking for someone who understood them when they had each other right here? Why did that have to be off the table just because Kelly had spent his entire life pursuing women? He felt like a door had been opened last night, a door he\u2019d never known existed.</p><p>Nick had a toothpick in his mouth, chewing on it as he laid out Kelly\u2019s breakfast where he could reach it. Kelly plucked the toothpick out. \u201cDangerous,\u201d he grumbled.</p> <p>Nick snorted, but as he was turning away, Kelly grabbed his shirtfront and pulled him closer. Nick almost stumbled over the side table, and he had to put both hands on the arms of Kelly\u2019s chair to keep himself from pitching forward into Kelly\u2019s lap. His eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cHow long do I have to recover, exactly?\u201d Kelly demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to fumble around before you\u2019ll sit back down and talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Nick blinked a few times, his eyes seeming to turn greener as Kelly watched. Kelly smiled, growing warmer. He tightened his grip on Nick\u2019s shirtfront so the man couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>\u201cLook, I love you,\u201d Kelly told him. \u201cYou love me. We\u2019ve bled for each other. Why can\u2019t that turn into more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKels . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Before you argue with me, just think about it objectively without adding in who we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho we are is kind of a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Kelly let him go and took a deep breath. \u201cSit down, I want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t sit. Instead he leaned closer, close enough that Kelly\u2019s heart stuttered and he closed his eyes. He could feel Nick\u2019s breath on his lips, feel the scratch of stubble against his chin. \u201cYour pancakes are getting cold,\u201d Nick whispered before pulling back.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes drifted open to stare at the plate of perfect golden pancakes with melting M&amp;M\u2019s made into smiley face patterns. He laughed and met Nick\u2019s eyes again. Nick was grinning. He hesitated briefly before he pressed another gentle kiss to Kelly\u2019s lips. This time he extended it, turning it a little less chaste and adding a little more tongue and teeth.</p><p>Kelly took stock of his racing heart, his shallow breaths, the fluttering in his stomach. He hadn\u2019t felt like this since he\u2019d been a teenager, and he liked it. It wasn\u2019t some stranger in a smoky bar giving him that adventurous feeling, either, it was one of his oldest and dearest friends. He tried to push forward to deepen the kiss, but Nick pulled away from him, running his thumb over his lips.</p><p>\u201cEat. I\u2019m not fixing you more,\u201d Nick muttered. He stepped away, but his hand landed on Kelly\u2019s shoulder and squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk after. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly nodded, satisfied. Because Nick O\u2019Flaherty always kept his promises.</p><p>When Kelly woke, he realized Nick had just waited for his painkillers to kick in and then given him the slip. He had opened up the windows and the doors to the back deck to allow the breeze to sweep through the cabin, then gone outside and hadn\u2019t come back before Kelly began to doze.</p><p>Kelly struggled with the lever on the side of the recliner and finally got the leg down so he could try to stand. He gasped at the pain and stopped moving as soon as he stood, afraid to take another step. His painkillers had worn off. How long had he been asleep?</p><p>\u201cIrish?\u201d he called out.</p><p>He heard a thump from outside on the deck, and Nick\u2019s footfalls were heavy as he jogged to the door. He appeared in the doorway, the sunlight streaming in around him. He\u2019d changed into jeans and a loose flannel shirt, and with the scruff and his curly hair getting longer, he looked pretty damn at home in Kelly\u2019s cabin in the middle of the woods. He also had his combat knife strapped to his thigh.</p><p>A frown creased Kelly\u2019s brow. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nick asked as he made his way over. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>Nick ducked under the arm Kelly raised, sliding his hand around Kelly\u2019s waist to help support him. \u201cYou want to go back down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What are you doing outside? Can I go out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but sit first,\u201d Nick muttered. Kelly didn\u2019t really have much choice as Nick lowered him back to the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll go get your pills; let them settle before you move again.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sighed and waited, staring at the open door as the breeze kicked up. It smelled of sunshine and pine, with a hint of crisp air left from the winter. He loved spring and fall for weather like this. He looked forward to the sunlight on his face.</p><p>Nick thumped back down the steps with his pills and water bottle.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing outside?\u201d Kelly asked, looking pointedly at the knife on Nick\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Nick grinned lopsidedly and handed him his pills. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly downed the pills, then held his arm out for help. He slid it around Nick\u2019s neck, an action they\u2019d repeated dozens of times over the last week or so. But this time felt different. This time Kelly\u2019s fingers dug into Nick\u2019s triceps, appreciating the strength in Nick\u2019s frame. This time Kelly\u2019s nose lingered at Nick\u2019s temple, taking in his scent and letting it stir everything from his mind to his body.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kelly murmured. \u201cSo that\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s breath gusted against his cheek. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked up into his eyes, hoping to catch a glimpse of what Nick was really feeling and thinking. He still appeared scared and worried, his brow furrowed and his eyes hesitant, but there was fire there too. He wanted to explore this as badly as Kelly did, but he was holding back for obvious reasons.</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cKiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember what you told me last night? The only thing I should be thinking about was . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick inhaled sharply, his breath stuttering as he and Kelly stared at each other. \u201cMe inside you.\u201d</p><p>Just the words made Kelly\u2019s breath catch. \u201cKiss me again, dammit.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave a curt nod, then he reached up to caress Kelly\u2019s cheek before he leaned closer and pressed their lips together. It was another careful kiss, a mere brush of lips with a hint of Nick\u2019s teeth on Kelly\u2019s lower lip before he leaned back. Kelly swayed forward, left breathless and light-headed by that simple, gentle touch.</p><p>Nick\u2019s hand pressed to the small of Kelly\u2019s back to pull their bodies together, holding him tight so he wouldn\u2019t fall. Kelly grabbed the back of his neck, delving into another kiss with a bit more fervor than their first. It was so natural for it to turn into a passionate embrace, Kelly had to wonder why they\u2019d never done it before.</p><p>Kelly would have let it go on all day, but Nick had more self-control than he did. He gently pulled away, holding Kelly\u2019s face so Kelly couldn\u2019t chase him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he whispered finally. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what I was doing outside.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted, but he allowed Nick to lead him out there. He was no longer interested in the outdoors or sunshine or whatever Nick had been up to, he just wanted Nick to kiss him again. He winced as the sun hit his eyes, but it felt good to be outside. He put his face up to the warmth and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cFeels good, right?\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>Kelly nodded, opening his eyes to regard Nick again.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand? Walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d Kelly said. He watched as Nick moved away, seeing his dear friend in a completely new light. The way Nick\u2019s shoulders moved, the way he walked with a slight limp he\u2019d never be able to fully hide as he aged because of the shrapnel embedded in his femur, the way his left hand stayed near the handle of his knife. These were all things Kelly\u2019d noticed before, but now he was equating them to the way the muscles of Nick\u2019s back felt under his fingers, the way Nick\u2019s hips rolled between his thighs, and the myriad of things Nick could do with his scarred hands.</p><p>Nick picked up a stick from the railing as Kelly moved gingerly toward the Adirondack chairs in the corner of the deck. Nick turned and held up the stick, grinning. He\u2019d shaved the bark from it, smoothing the shaft, and he\u2019d crafted the bulbous end into curved fingers, all with blunt tips. Kelly laughed as Nick handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cA back scratcher?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged, smiling. \u201cI remember when I broke my collarbone, I was always itching and never able to get to it. You can also use it to reach things so you won\u2019t have to strain to get them.\u201d</p><p>Kelly ran his thumb over the tips of the fingers, nodding. \u201cThanks, Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Nick leaned against the railing, crossing his arms. \u201cYou want to try a walk?\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned, but he nodded. He was supposed to walk every day. \u201cMight as well get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab you some shoes.\u201d</p><p>He jogged back inside, leaving Kelly to ponder the homemade back scratcher. Nick wasn\u2019t the type of guy who needed to be moving or doing something. He didn\u2019t need to have something to do with his hands all the time. He could easily relax in a deck chair and lose himself in his thoughts for hours, or sit and read a book, or just chill under the stars. He hadn\u2019t been out here making this to keep himself busy while Kelly napped.</p><p>When Kelly looked up again, Nick was standing in the doorway watching him. \u201cI can try again if it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find you a cane too,\u201d Nick added, smirking.</p><p>\u201cUnless it has a sword in it, I don\u2019t want a cane.\u201d</p><p>Nick snickered, coming closer with Kelly\u2019s boots. He patted the top of his head as he knelt at Kelly\u2019s feet. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s breath caught. He rested his hand on Nick\u2019s head to keep his balance and peered down at Nick as he slid one foot into the boot Nick was holding for him. They got both boots on, and Nick was tying them up for him before Kelly realized he still had his hand in Nick\u2019s hair. He drew his fingers through the growing curls.</p><p>Nick glanced up at him as he pulled the first bow tight. He smiled knowingly when Kelly didn\u2019t loosen his hold on his hair, then ducked his head and tied the second boot. Kelly had always thought Nick a handsome man, in the same way he appreciated the beauty of a spring day or the sunrise on a misty morning. He\u2019d never equated that appreciation with sex or desire, though, so the stirring in his groin when he remembered Nick\u2019s body against his, or when Nick knelt in front of him, was completely new.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. When Nick stood, he mirrored Kelly\u2019s expression and leaned against the railing. They stared at one another as birds chirped and the wind rustled the leaves above them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so confused right now,\u201d Kelly admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Nick said, his voice soft and somehow comforting. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do? Go for it? Pretend it didn\u2019t happen? Talk it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember my first time,\u201d Nick said, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk about it. You will. And I\u2019m the only one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we talk it out.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever wanted to fuck me before?\u201d Kelly demanded.</p><p>Nick took a deep breath and let it out slowly, gazing up at the sky. He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to now?\u201d</p><p>Nick cocked his head and scrutinized Kelly. Kelly grew considerably warmer as he watched Nick\u2019s eyes. Nick began to smile. His voice was lower and full of gravel when he answered. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard and flushed. \u201cLikewise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mischievous smile Nick responded with only made Kelly want to squirm. Goddamn, why had he never noticed how sexy Nick was when he grinned like that?</p><p>Nick licked his lips to wipe the smirk away and looked down at his hands. \u201cSo, you\u2019re wondering why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Nick asked neutrally.</p><p>Kelly held his breath, considering. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled. Of course Nick would just accept it and proceed to try to find a solution. That was the way Nick was. That was the way they both were, to an extent, which often led to a distinct absence of gnashing of teeth and wailing between them when problems arose.</p><p>Nick gripped the railing with both hands. \u201cPart of the excitement of attraction is knowing it\u2019s reciprocated, right?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly nodded. \u201cWe found out last night that we, um . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReciprocate,\u201d Nick provided. They both grinned, meeting each other\u2019s eyes. The warmth and excitement of new attraction were bolstered by years of history. Years of camaraderie. Years of comfort. It was something entirely new, and it was something that just felt right.</p><p>Kelly inhaled sharply as the realization hit him. \u201cThis would be so easy.\u201d</p><p>Nick bit his lip, not responding. Instead he reached out and ran his fingers over Kelly\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cGod, O, this would be so easy,\u201d Kelly said more emphatically. He moved carefully and leaned on the railing beside Nick. \u201cYou and me? Just . . . can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>Nick gave that a low whistle and nodded. He raised his head, the smile gone. \u201cI can imagine. I\u2019m trying not to, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks ago you almost died,\u201d Nick said, his voice gone rough. \u201cYour view of the world has shifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve almost died a couple times, Kels. I remember what it\u2019s like to . . . to realize you\u2019re still here when you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard and nodded. He remembered the weeks of desperate searching when Ty and Nick had gone missing. He remembered how it had felt, trying to accept that they were gone and he\u2019d never been able to say good-bye, to tell them what they both meant to him. He\u2019d written letters to their families. They\u2019d never been mailed, thank God, but he\u2019d still sobbed while writing them.</p><p>He remembered the day he\u2019d seen a transport truck roll into camp with Ty and Nick laid out in the back, thinking they were dead. He and Owen had climbed into that truck faster than the lieutenant had been able to order them away. Kelly\u2019d found the pulse at Nick\u2019s neck and wanted to throw up with relief.</p><p>His stomach lurched and he turned his hand over to grasp Nick\u2019s fingers. Nick squeezed Kelly\u2019s hand as if he knew what he was thinking, what he was recalling.</p><p>\u201cBefore last night, you\u2019d never even considered kissing another man, much less whatever\u2019s in your head now,\u201d Nick continued.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true. I\u2019d thought about it. Just never seriously. Or while sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. You\u2019re in uncharted territory. It would be easy. Us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked up.</p><p>\u201cJust sex is one thing. I think we could manage that and not lose each other. But talking about anything else right now would be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Nick said with a grin.</p><p>Kelly barked a laugh. \u201cShut up. Hear me out, though. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick picked up Kelly\u2019s hand and held it, his fingers playing with Kelly\u2019s. He nodded.</p><p>Kelly tore his eyes away from their hands to examine Nick\u2019s profile. \u201cWe know each other better already than we could ever hope to know anyone else. Our pasts, our hopes and fears, all our secrets. We\u2019ve already shared all that. We know we\u2019re compatible. Hell, we even know we can live together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d Nick mumbled. He gave Kelly a sly grin.</p><p>\u201cShut up. At least you already know all my bad habits, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike licking the germs off a spoon and putting it back in the drawer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did that once,\u201d Kelly mumbled. \u201cBut you know I love M&amp;M\u2019s in my pancakes. I know you eat French fries with ranch instead of ketchup and that you steal the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms when you think no one\u2019s looking.\u201d</p><p>Nick began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know I squeeze the toothpaste from the middle, and I know you used to go behind me with one of those tube squeezers every morning and fix it so no one else would get mad at me. And I know you wake up in the middle of the night sometimes so terrified you don\u2019t even recognize your own name. And I know the only people you\u2019ll let spend the night in bed with you are people you know can fight you off if you try to hurt them.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes had gone wider, and he fought to swallow as Kelly spoke. He looked vulnerable, something Nick rarely seemed, and Kelly wanted to wrap him in a hug.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wake up screaming too,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cBut I never have when I was sharing a bed with you. And after last night we know there\u2019s a whole lot to work with below the belt, you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and looked down, smiling. Kelly reached for him, grabbing his chin and forcing him to meet his eyes to make sure Nick heard him.</p><p>\u201cThis could work out pretty nice for both of us, Nicko. I\u2019ve never been with anyone where it was so easy so fast. Where it felt like home. But you\u2019ve always been home to me.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes caught the sunlight and almost made Kelly forget what he\u2019d been saying.</p><p>\u201cKelly,\u201d Nick tried. His voice faltered, and he had to stop to swallow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got more with you than I\u2019ve ever had anywhere,\u201d Kelly said in a rush, trying to beat Nick to whatever he\u2019d been about to say. He took a deep breath to calm himself. \u201cAnd after last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be easy.\u201d Nick sighed and ran his thumb along Kelly\u2019s knuckles.</p><p>Kelly dropped his hand away from Nick\u2019s chin. \u201cBut you\u2019re still going to say no, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never say no to you,\u201d Nick said, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cIs it this guy you\u2019re not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan,\u201d Nick provided, trying not to laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating, but not for lack of trying.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy spiked so quickly that Kelly barely recognized the feeling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fireman. Our first date, a warehouse caught fire,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cHe left me at the fire station. Do you have any idea the rivalry between cops and firefighters in Boston? I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t end up duct-taped to the fire pole or something.\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to laugh, biting his lip to stop himself.</p><p>\u201cThe second first date, there was a triple homicide and I had to leave him sitting in my squad car for two hours. He got into the back to take a nap, and didn\u2019t realize the doors would lock behind him.\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to laugh despite how much he hated the idea of Nick dating anyone. Nick chuckled softly, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWe decided that \u2018dates\u2019 weren\u2019t good for the city after that, so we didn\u2019t try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re basically fuck buddies.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged noncommittally, glancing away.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you saying no to me?\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed loudly. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying right now is wait.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s shoulders slumped. The disappointment was sharper than he\u2019d expected. \u201cWait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Until you\u2019re better. Until all of this isn\u2019t shiny and new. Until life feels normal for you again.\u201d</p><p>Kelly made a disgusted sound. \u201cWhat\u2019s normal anyway?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be any kind of friend if I let you make decisions with a bottle of painkillers and a fresh bullet hole in your back.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment spiked, but Kelly should have known Nick would be reasonable and levelheaded. Nick was the first person willing to jump, but he\u2019d also be the one making sure you had your parachute on. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kelly asked, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do while I\u2019m getting better and rubbing the shine off things?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled crookedly. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be getting rubbed a little too.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed, not looking away from each other. Kelly liked how bold Nick was; it was completely at odds with his nonchalant attitude. He\u2019d seen Nick in action, of course, but he\u2019d never been the target. He understood the attraction now. Completely understood.</p><p>He moved impulsively, grabbing for Nick\u2019s shirtfront and pulling him into a kiss. Nick moved with him, turning into him. He picked Kelly up by the backs of his thighs and set him on the railing, crowding in close between his legs as they kissed. Kelly didn\u2019t even have time to register how weird it felt to be manhandled. He didn\u2019t worry about falling backward off the railing. It was natural to trust Nick to hold him, to wrap his arms around Nick\u2019s neck and squeeze his knees against Nick\u2019s hips.</p><p>The kiss was rough and consuming, just like Nick. Just like everything Kelly loved about Nick.</p><p>Nick took Kelly\u2019s face in both hands when he pulled away. He pressed his forehead to Kelly\u2019s cheek, his breath harsh against Kelly\u2019s neck. \u201cPut your feet on the ground,\u201d he said, voice gone hard. He gripped Kelly\u2019s arms to keep him from tilting backward, but he stepped away too.</p><p>Kelly fought the urge to grab him and stop him from backing off.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take that walk,\u201d Nick grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather climb the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled weakly. Kelly gave him a small tug, but Nick resisted. He didn\u2019t break eye contact, but he looked like he desperately wanted to. He shook his head instead. \u201cI was wrong, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Kels. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I got two Percocet in me, I\u2019m untouchable right now!\u201d Kelly drawled, giving Nick\u2019s arm a tug.</p><p>Nick put a hand over his eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t remind me that you lack clear decision-making skills right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPercocet. That\u2019s not what I meant and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about you and Aidan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sort of. No,\u201d Nick stammered. He ran his hand over his face. \u201cI just, this feels dangerous to me, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what this is,\u201d Kelly grumbled.</p><p>Nick laughed bitterly. \u201cI doubt that, because even I don\u2019t know what this is. So let\u2019s just leave it at this and go take a walk.\u201d Nick moved away, leaving Kelly leaning against the railing trying to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cThis is your fear of commitment cropping up, huh? Isn\u2019t that usually like a fifth date thing for you?\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped short and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit,\u201d Kelly said. He crossed his arms over his chest stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cAre you really psychoanalyzing me right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the gears in your head by name, bud. You\u2019re not going to pull any of this shit with me.\u201d</p><p>Nick worked his jaw and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you really afraid of?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick glared at him, his eyes blazing briefly before he calmed again. \u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing that made you keep your mouth shut about Ty all those years?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s jaw jumped as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll never happen,\u201d Kelly said calmly. \u201cIf we try this and it doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no drama between us. It won\u2019t hurt us. It won\u2019t hurt our friendship.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked up at the sky, taking a deep breath. \u201cKels, I\u2019m begging you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Kelly tried as he moved closer. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I know why you\u2019re panicking right now. I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>Kelly took a deep breath and went for it anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of this moving past the \u2018just sex\u2019 point, right? You\u2019re afraid it might be something special, because that\u2019s sure as hell what it felt like last night. You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>Nick put both hands on his hips and lowered his head, nodding. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, then turned and stalked toward the door, disappearing inside.</p><p>Kelly sighed heavily, left alone on his deck as the breeze plucked at the hem of his shirt and ruffled his hair. \u201cWell, that went well.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat in a swing on the front deck, his feet propped on the railing, an unlit cigarette in his hand. He\u2019d wanted to simply bolt, to get out and clear his head for a few hours, but even angry he wasn\u2019t willing to leave Kelly alone. And since the cabin consisted of one open room downstairs and the loft bedroom, there was nowhere to run and hide. So he\u2019d gone to the front deck and planted himself there for a few hours. Kelly had left him alone.</p><p>Nick had to smile. Just the fact that Kelly knew to leave him alone was something. He could almost forgive him for calling him out like he had.</p><p>He heard Kelly coming to the door, and he turned his head. \u201cYou need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d Kelly answered when he pushed past the screen door. He shuffled closer, holding his hand to his chest. He stopped at Nick\u2019s side and stared off at the setting sun. \u201cI\u2019m steadier if I don\u2019t take the pain pills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, but then you\u2019re in pain.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cIt takes some of the fear out of it. Being able to feel it all the way through. I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ve been babying myself for no reason.\u201d</p><p>Nick peered up at him. He brought the cigarette to his mouth and sucked on the filter. He hadn\u2019t smoked a cigarette in almost twenty years. But he still liked the way they felt in his hands, the ritual of bringing one to his lips, the way the tobacco smelled.</p> <p>Kelly finally looked down at him. \u201cPhantom smoking, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled weakly, shrugging.</p><p>Kelly snickered and sat. \u201cYou know what the squids used to call you behind your back when you\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost lighter,\u201d Nick answered, beginning to smile more. Kelly laughed. Nick handed the cigarette to him, and he put it in his mouth and sucked on the filter like Nick had done, then handed it back.</p><p>Nick stared at the cigarette for a long moment. He\u2019d started smoking at twelve. He\u2019d been eighteen when he\u2019d met Ty, and the man had almost instantly broken him of it. He hadn\u2019t shamed him out of it or tried to subvert the habit, though. He\u2019d simply stated the fact that craving a cigarette was one more weakness someone could exploit and that had been that.</p> <p>A week later, Nick had been almost done with it. Almost. The only thing that remained was a craving for the action. It didn\u2019t matter if it was a cigarette, a straw, or a stick. He almost always had something in his mouth, like the toothpick Kelly had plucked from his lips that morning. It didn\u2019t matter. It was still a weakness, he supposed. One of his few. And Kelly knew the whole story.</p><p>\u201cI could never break myself of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our vices,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick said under his breath. He glanced at Kelly, meeting his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cMe too. I knew better. I shouldn\u2019t have poked at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the only people who knows it\u2019s there to poke. I have to give you points for that.\u201d They stared at each other in the silence, neither compelled to speak or look away. Nick brought the cigarette to his mouth again, sucking in the faint taste of tobacco before handing it over to Kelly. \u201cYou ready for that walk now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kelly pulled a lighter out of his back pocket and lit the cigarette. He took a long drag, then exhaled the smoke in a stream that began to waft on the breeze. He grinned. \u201cA hole shot in my lung, I was hoping you\u2019d be able to see smoke come through the stitches,\u201d he said, snickering as he handed it back to Nick.</p><p>Nick smiled sadly, watching his companion in the dying light. He turned his attention to the glowing tip of the cigarette. He\u2019d been a private the last time he\u2019d smoked. He stared at it a little longer, then turned it over and ground the tip into the railing.</p><p>When he tore his attention away from it, Kelly was watching him. \u201cYou know what I always admired about you, Irish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew right from wrong.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a huge feat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. In our lives? The things we\u2019ve been part of? Yeah, it is. Your moral compass always pointed the right way. And no matter what you wanted, you always followed where it led you. So if last night didn\u2019t feel right to you, I\u2019ll trust that.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him, trying to decipher the feeling the words gave him. He was both honored by Kelly\u2019s opinion of him and oddly disappointed. He shook his head. What scared him about last night wasn\u2019t that it had felt wrong. It had felt right. Really fucking right. And that was the core of his current problem. His moral compass was spinning.</p> <p>Kelly took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cBut at the risk of pissing you off even more,\u201d he said, his face hard and his voice stern, \u201cI\u2019m going to say this again because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard it enough. I don\u2019t think you believe it.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s entire body went cold. He held his breath, telling himself to let Kelly finish this time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cOne of the best I\u2019ve ever known. And if you\u2019re denying yourself a life with someone who loves you because you don\u2019t think you deserve it, then you\u2019re not as smart as I think you are. And if you\u2019re saying no to me because you\u2019re afraid, then you\u2019re a pussy.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cHow long did you practice that before you came out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour,\u201d Kelly answered, breaking into a smile. \u201cWas it good? How\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cIt was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe me?\u201d</p><p>Nick inhaled deeply, butterflies churning in his stomach. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me when I say I want the D?\u201d</p><p>Nick choked back a laugh. He ran his fingers over his forehead, smiling crookedly. \u201cYeah, I do. This is the worst idea we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s grin widened. \u201cI agree. Want to go upstairs and get naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Nick drawled.</p><p>\u201cWant to not smoke another cigarette first?\u201d</p><p>They both laughed. Their camaraderie had always been easy. Nick\u2019s inner composure fed off Kelly\u2019s outward calm, and Kelly\u2019s quirkiness fed off Nick\u2019s nonchalance. Kelly was probably right when he said there\u2019d be no drama between them.</p><p>Kelly pulled himself out of his chair, moving closer to Nick. He slapped his shoulder and waved at him. \u201cScoot over.\u201d</p><p>Nick did, sliding to the far side of the swing to let Kelly settle beside him. He kept his hand on the back of the swing and Kelly leaned into the crook of his arm. It wasn\u2019t something they\u2019d never done before, because Nick had a tendency to put his arm around whoever was sitting next to him regardless of who it was. But this time felt different. Everything about Kelly felt different now. Different, yet still familiar. Nick realized that would never change. What he was afraid of happening had already happened, and they would never be able to go back to what they\u2019d been.</p><p>There was no retreat. Retreat, hell. The only option now was to move forward. They just needed to pick their path and stick to it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Kelly said, bringing Nick back to the present. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide shit from me, you know? You don\u2019t have to protect me from any part of you. I already know it all. And you know all of me.\u201d</p><p>Nick watched Kelly\u2019s profile, unable to tear his eyes away, unable to say anything.</p><p>Kelly pulled a blunt out of his pocket and held it up. \u201cYou still smoke these?\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed, smirking. \u201cOnly when I know I\u2019m not going back to work.\u201d</p><p>Kelly put it between his lips and lit up. The tip glowed as he took a long drag, then he rested his head against Nick\u2019s arm and closed his eyes. Nick took the blunt from his fingers, his eyes not leaving Kelly\u2019s face.</p><p>Kelly released the smoke in a slow stream, not moving. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. And I know you won\u2019t hurt me. So fuck it, Irish, let\u2019s try this.\u201d</p><p>Nick took a hit and pondered Kelly\u2019s words. They passed it between them several more times, watching the sun set against the mountain peaks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never be the same,\u201d Nick finally said. He needed to know that Kelly had thought this through, that he was aware of what the morning light would reveal.</p><p>Kelly barked a laugh. \u201cWe pole-vaulted over that last night.\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned closer, curling his arm around Kelly\u2019s shoulders. He brushed his nose along Kelly\u2019s neck, just behind his ear. Kelly inhaled sharply. The goose bumps rose on his arms and he turned his head into the contact.</p><p>Nick brushed his lips against Kelly\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou really think this can go bad?\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cWhen everything about it feels so fucking good?\u201d</p><p>Nick breathed in deeply, truly giving the question thought rather than letting his gut reaction take over. \u201cOnly if we let it, I guess,\u201d he finally decided, his lips moving against Kelly\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d Nick gripped Kelly\u2019s chin, pulling his face until their lips met. Kelly immediately leaned into him, groaning as Nick\u2019s teeth scraped over his lip, as their tongues met and teased. The kiss was so consuming that Nick got lost in it, all his senses absorbed by it. It was still crazy to think this was the Doc he was kissing, to think he was getting turned on just sitting here and kissing Kelly. He would have to pole-vault over that hurdle too, because this was too damn good to pass up just because it was weird.</p><p>He sucked Kelly\u2019s bottom lip between his one last time before ending the kiss and pulling back with a gasp for air.</p><p>Kelly licked at his lips, forcing his eyes open to meet Nick\u2019s. \u201cOkay, see that? That\u2019s good stuff. I think we should do more of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what I told you about thinking?\u201d Nick asked, voice lowered.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s breath hitched. \u201cHow could I forget?\u201d</p><p>Nick released his hold on Kelly\u2019s chin, running his fingers up to brush along his cheekbone. Kelly\u2019s eyes were a shade close to blue, with hints of green and gray depending on what reflected in them. Nick had always been fascinated by Kelly\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d maybe even fantasized about kissing him a few times, but he\u2019d never lusted after him.</p><p>Not until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you right now,\u201d he said, voice gruff. \u201cI\u2019m hard in my fucking jeans just thinking about what I could do to you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled, his eyes growing darker as they dilated. Nick couldn\u2019t stop looking into them.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to be high or drunk or both the first few times we do this, because it\u2019s too fucking weird to kiss you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cI agree to those terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You want to go upstairs and get fucked?\u201d</p><p>Kelly stuffed the blunt back into his pocket and grabbed Nick\u2019s shoulder, using him to push himself off the swing. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Nick began to laugh, moving slowly as Kelly tried to rush him. \u201cHow\u2019s your chest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pulls. But it doesn\u2019t hurt enough to refuse a second helping of last night, so come on.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him, letting the nerves settle a little more before Kelly pulled him to his feet. He took hold of Kelly\u2019s hips and stopped him before he could turn away, pulling their bodies together. Kelly had to tip his head back to meet Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sex, right?\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>Kelly narrowed his eyes, then began to grin. \u201cDon\u2019t punk out on me now, O\u2019Flaherty.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted as Kelly pushed away from him. \u201cThose are my terms,\u201d he called after him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Kelly said, disappearing inside. \u201cLet\u2019s go get stoned and fuck.\u201d</p><p>Nick watched him for a moment before shrugging and following. He trailed behind Kelly as he made his way up the stairs. Kelly had been right: he was much steadier without the painkillers. But he also moved slower and more gingerly. Nick was having second thoughts about this by the time he was halfway up the stairs. Kelly was obviously still in pain, and Nick knew exactly what kind of damage he could when he got worked up.</p><p>When he reached the head of the stairs, Kelly stood near the end of the bed, waiting with a tentative half smile on his face. \u201cThis feels like a prom date or something,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nick nodded, glancing around the loft bedroom with another flutter of nerves. \u201cWe\u2019ve already altered our relationship with last night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never get that back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kelly said softly.</p><p>\u201cWe can stop here and just go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Kelly narrowed his eyes, a smile flitting across his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look for the exit at every turn, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed.</p><p>Kelly began to unbutton his shirt. \u201cWell there ain\u2019t no exits on this ride, babe, \u2019cause I know all your tricks.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned. He watched the slow reveal, something he\u2019d rarely let himself linger over in the past. Kelly had some fucking incredible shoulders and arms, that much was for sure. And the rest of him might as well have been an amusement park, as fun as he was to explore. Nick would have to retrain his way of thinking if they were going to be fucking and he was actually allowed to leer now. He licked his lips, reaching up to pull at the buttons of his soft flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on I\u2019m just going to have to jump you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Kelly asked with a laugh. \u201cTalking doesn\u2019t work on you, but getting naked does.\u201d</p><p>Nick tossed his shirt toward the nearby chair. Kelly let his own shirt drop to the floor.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on?\u201d Nick repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re happy?\u201d Kelly suggested. His hands moved to the band of his sweatpants and shoved them down. He was growing hard just standing there with Nick\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re having fun. As long as you\u2019re not panicking because you think you\u2019re in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>Nick licked his lips again, blatantly watching as Kelly stepped out of his pants. Kelly spread his arms wide, inviting Nick to look. Inviting him to do a hell of a lot more than look.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that how it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head and slowly moved toward Kelly, looking him up and down as he circled him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to buy the milk, O\u2019Flaherty, I just want you to grope the cow,\u201d Kelly said, trying to hide a sly smile by biting his lip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick chuckled and stepped up behind him. He slid his hands over Kelly\u2019s waist, pulling their bodies together. Kelly hummed, and Nick bent to kiss the back of Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Kelly turned his head, his nose brushing Nick\u2019s hair. \u201cCome on, Lucky. You think I can\u2019t feel how much you want this?\u201d</p><p>Nick inhaled sharply, rubbing his hard cock against Kelly\u2019s ass. One hand gripped Kelly\u2019s hip while the other dragged up his body, avoiding the new scar on his chest and finally coming to rest just under Kelly\u2019s neck. He could feel the rise and fall of Kelly\u2019s increasingly labored breathing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to fuck you tonight,\u201d Nick hissed in Kelly\u2019s ear. Before he knew what he was doing, his hand had ventured higher and tightened at Kelly\u2019s throat. His forefinger and thumb rested on the defined edges of Kelly\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you?\u201d Kelly gasped. His pulse raced under Nick\u2019s fingertips.</p><p>Nick closed his eyes. \u201cI told you once. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d He kissed Kelly\u2019s shoulder again, then his neck. Kelly groaned, vibrating Nick\u2019s palm. Nick tugged him, turning them around and walking Kelly a few steps until he was facing the wall. He took care to be gentle when he pushed Kelly against it, still holding him by his neck and hip.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hands came up to press against the wall and he blew an unsteady stream of air out. He was trembling.</p><p>He put his lips to Kelly\u2019s ear and hummed, the sound low and rumbling. He closed his eyes and thrust his hips against Kelly\u2019s ass again, trying to be calm, trying to be gentle. He could imagine what it would be like to slide inside Kelly and make him writhe and scream, to take him on his knees. His grip tightened on Kelly\u2019s throat as he thought about it.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Kelly gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I find this so fucking hot, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to stop reminding me you\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>He forced Kelly\u2019s head to the side and strained to be able to kiss him over his shoulder. Kelly growled against his mouth, nipping at his lip and tongue, his body pushing back against Nick\u2019s as he tried to turn. Nick shoved him harder to the wall, tightening his grip. His bare chest pressed against Kelly\u2019s warm back. The denim of his jeans caught at Kelly\u2019s naked skin, his belt buckle digging in. He took his hand from Kelly\u2019s hip and fumbled with his belt and zipper.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly breathed.</p><p>Nick shoved his jeans and boxers down just enough to free his cock, then reached down and guided it against the crack of Kelly\u2019s ass. Kelly\u2019s entire body tensed and he shoved up onto his toes to make him closer to Nick\u2019s height. Nick shivered as Kelly\u2019s reaction reverberated through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going inside you,\u201d he hissed in Kelly\u2019s ear. Kelly nodded. \u201cBut I do plan on coming all over your ass, so buckle the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned again and Nick pulled back on his chin, forcing Kelly to look up at the ceiling. He pushed Kelly\u2019s entire body against the wall, thrusting his hips and dry-humping him between his legs.</p><p>Kelly made a growling, whimpering sound. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t fuck me?\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted, pressing his face against Kelly\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019d wreck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun,\u201d Kelly said, choking on the words.</p><p>Nick closed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there. Do you have condoms? Lube?\u201d he asked, barely able to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter what kind?\u201d Kelly asked. He was gritting his teeth and his eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cThe kind you use when you get off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrawer by the bed.\u201d</p> <p>Nick stepped back, putting his hand between Kelly\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, resting his forehead against the wall. He reached down to palm himself. \u201cDo we really need condoms?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Nick glanced back at him as he rummaged through the drawer. \u201cLess mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessy is hot as hell.\u201d Kelly still hadn\u2019t opened his eyes, and he was stroking himself languidly. \u201cI trust you if you say we don\u2019t need them.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s stomach flipped. He\u2019d never once been with someone he would trust at their word for going without a cover. But Kelly was different, and Nick didn\u2019t even give it a second thought. He dropped the condom back into the drawer and returned to press against Kelly\u2019s back. He reached around him, replacing Kelly\u2019s hand with his own to stroke Kelly\u2019s hard cock a few times. Then he gripped Kelly\u2019s wrist and brought it back out, shoving it hard against the wall.</p><p>Their fingers twined together.</p><p>Nick kissed at Kelly\u2019s neck. \u201cDo me a favor, okay?\u201d he whispered. Kelly nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t come until I\u2019m ready to swallow it, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted and made another whimpering sound, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m in the middle of shooting my load inside that sweet ass of yours, you start to come, you shove your dick down my throat any way you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Kelly gasped. He grinned and rested his head back on Nick\u2019s shoulder, his eyes still closed. \u201cI got it. Holy fuck.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled and filled one hand with lubricant. He dropped the bottle and took himself in hand, stroking and covering his cock in lube.</p><p>He bent his head to kiss Kelly\u2019s shoulder. Then he dragged his teeth over the skin, biting down. Kelly moaned and pushed his ass back against Nick\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m no longer in control of my ass.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. He took his cock and slid the head between Kelly\u2019s ass cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s because your ass is mine right now,\u201d he growled, then bit down again on Kelly\u2019s shoulder and rocked his hips harder. His slick cock slid easily, gliding against Kelly\u2019s ass.</p><p>Kelly pushed back, shimmying his hips. Nick let Kelly\u2019s hand go and grabbed his neck again, yanking his head back so he could kiss and bite and suck at his collarbone and jaw and neck. The sounds Kelly made with each nip were intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, I want to eat you alive,\u201d Nick snarled, pulling a desperate moan from Kelly. Kelly\u2019s knees were going weak, though, and he seemed to be using all his strength to keep his chest from hitting the wall. Nick worked harder to hold him up, reminding himself to be gentler as he worked his hips, seeking friction for his thrusts. He reached around Kelly with his slick hand and palmed his cock, beginning to stroke him, his movements forcing Kelly to fuck his hand.</p><p>Kelly rose on his toes again. He exhaled in a gust. Nick shoved Kelly\u2019s head to the side and their lips sought each other out, sucking and biting, their tongues lapping. Nick found the tight ring of muscle at Kelly\u2019s ass with the head of his cock, pushing at it with a careful thrust.</p><p>Kelly moaned wantonly, and the sound went straight to Nick\u2019s throbbing cock. Kelly\u2019s jumped in Nick\u2019s hand, the tip leaking against his thumb.</p><p>\u201cIf I beg, will you shove that into me?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick ground out. He thrust harder though, pressing at those muscles, making Kelly think he could enter him. There was no way he\u2019d force himself past those tense muscles, though, not for the first time.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Nick,\u201d Kelly gasped. His hands splayed against the wall.</p><p>Nick moaned, pressing his face into Kelly\u2019s neck. He took advantage of the tension pouring off Kelly\u2019s body, of the chance to let Kelly feel Nick\u2019s cock pressing at those muscles.</p><p>Their panting breaths mingled together. Kelly\u2019s strangled gasps were loud in Nick\u2019s ears. He pushed his ass back, obviously liking the feeling and wanting more. With some patience and preparation, Kelly was going to be one hell of an entertaining bottom. Nick could imagine exactly what it would be like to stretch him out on a bed and lay into him.</p><p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick ground out, desperately fighting back his orgasm.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nick!\u201d Kelly shouted. He reached back and dug his fingernails into Nick\u2019s ribs, breaking the skin as he dragged them. Nick shouted and tightened his grip on Kelly\u2019s neck, pulling his whole body away from the wall and then slamming him into it as he came.</p><p>Kelly talked the whole way through, mumbling to him, begging him, groaning and moaning. Nick held to him as they both gasped and grunted, as his cum spurted between Kelly\u2019s legs and against his ass.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ that feels good,\u201d Kelly finally panted.</p><p>Nick pushed away from him, taking hold of his shoulder and turning him to press his back against the wall. Kelly was biting his lip, his eyes fluttering as he tried and failed to keep them open. Nick stepped close and kissed him, diving into it. Kelly\u2019s hands tangled in his hair.</p><p>Nick growled into the languid kiss. All sense of urgency had leaked out of both of them, and Nick\u2019s palm was covered in cum that wasn\u2019t his. He pulled away from the kiss. \u201cYou came, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to laugh, curling around Nick and pressing their bodies closer.</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d Nick muttered against his lips.</p><p>Kelly stretched out on the lounger on the small balcony outside his bedroom. The stars winked overhead. The moon shone down, bright on his bare skin. It was cool enough that Nick had gone back inside for a blanket, because neither of them was willing to get dressed again.</p><p>Nick\u2019s cum was drying between his legs. He\u2019d refused to clean up because he wanted to feel it there. It was a singularly odd sensation, but Kelly was digging it. In fact, it was sexy as hell. He was all for new experiences, after all.</p><p>He was also pretty sure there was going to be a handprint on his neck. Bite marks on his shoulder. Jesus Christ, that was hot. And he\u2019d actually been compelled to put Neosporin on Nick\u2019s ribs where he\u2019d drawn blood.</p><p>He heard Nick bang into something and cuss it up and down before stumbling out onto the balcony. Kelly snickered as Nick wrapped the blanket around his shoulders and cursed the table one more time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d Nick grumbled.</p><p>Kelly laughed harder. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look at the pothead calling the kettle names,\u201d Nick said in a singsong voice as he settled onto the wide chaise beside Kelly. They both laughed harder. Nick pulled the blanket over them, and the warmth of his naked body against Kelly\u2019s was so welcome that Kelly turned into it. A moment later Nick had his arm under Kelly\u2019s neck, giving him a cushion to rest his head on, and he wrapped his arm around Kelly to pull him closer. Their temples pressed together as they both looked up at the night sky.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Nick muttered. \u201cEven out on the water the stars aren\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>Kelly hummed in agreement and passed Nick the blunt they\u2019d started on earlier. Nick brought out the lighter he\u2019d retrieved with the blanket.</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t sure he should have found it sexy to watch Nick light the thing. He\u2019d seen him do it a hundred times before. They were the only members of Sidewinder who appreciated the intricacies of herbal refreshment, so they\u2019d done this together a lot over the years, sneaking away and sitting under the stars to share a hit. But this was the first time Kelly had ever appreciated Nick\u2019s form.</p><p>He was falling hard and fast and he didn\u2019t care why or how. Wrapped up in this blanket under the stars, he could admit that. He always fell fast, though, and he knew Nick. Nick could smell someone falling in love from a mile away. Kelly had seen him bolt like a scared whitetail deer more than once, so he\u2019d have to be careful.</p><p>Nick took a long drag as he stared up at the sky. His body was relaxing, settling into the lounger and into Kelly. He turned his head, placing the burning tip of the blunt into his mouth. He reached for Kelly\u2019s chin, pulling him until their lips met. Kelly slid his fingertips against Nick\u2019s cheek as they shotgunned the hit. Nick blew smoke into his mouth as their bodies curled together, then he took the blunt and pulled it away, stealing a languid kiss before Kelly got a chance to exhale.</p><p>They began to laugh even as the kiss continued. Nick pulled away, and Kelly turned his head to blow smoke into the night, laughing harder.</p><p>They lay curled together, sharing the blunt until it was gone and getting higher than the stars they watched, drawing warmth from each other when they probably should have been inside.</p><p>\u201cThis is good, Kels,\u201d Nick finally murmured.</p><p>Kelly turned his head to peer at Nick in the moonlight. He was staring at the sky, the same way he always did when they\u2019d wander off and lie down somewhere and get high.</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cI grow it myself in the woods out back.\u201d</p><p>Nick began to laugh, the sound kicking Kelly off into a fit of giggling too. Nick pulled Kelly closer. He turned his head, pressing his face against Kelly\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Their lips met, and before Kelly knew what was happening, they were curling around each other, kissing more, their legs tangling, their bodies aligning in ways Kelly had never realized they could.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cWhat do we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWing it,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cYou promise to fuck me eventually?\u201d</p><p>He felt Nick smile into the kiss. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>When Kelly woke, the sun was streaming through the loft of the cabin and he was alone in bed. Again. He glanced around. Music was playing downstairs. On the table beside his bed was a bottle of water and his pills all lined in a row, waiting to be taken. There was also a packet of string cheese. A note was propped against the lamp, telling him to call for help before he tried to get out of bed, and to eat the cheese before taking his pills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly laughed and disregarded the note in every way, throwing his covers off and using the edge of the mattress to pull himself out of bed. He had to sit and gather his strength before he was able to push himself to stand, and once he was up he immediately regretted his intense meeting with the wall last night. But he padded into the bathroom, proud to have done it without having to call for help.</p><p>A quick examination in the mirror showed prominent bruises under his chin and around his neck. That was good, he supposed, it meant they weren\u2019t too deep. He also had several red welts where he remembered Nick\u2019s teeth digging in on his shoulder and neck. He found he didn\u2019t care. In fact, he was as proud of those battle injuries as he was of the rest.</p><p>He took care of business, giving himself one more look in the mirror before stepping back into the bedroom. Nick was sitting cross-legged on the bed, eating a piece of toast and scrolling through something on his iPad.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Irish,\u201d Kelly said, his voice hoarse and scratchy.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t hear you moving around from downstairs?\u201d Nick asked without looking up from what he was reading.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting crumbs in the bed?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick nodded without looking up from what he was reading. \u201cSheets need washing anyway,\u201d he said as he chewed. He finished what he was doing and raised his head, his eyes raking Kelly up and down as he set the iPad aside.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. He shuffled back to the bed, and Nick moved to help him. Kelly tried to swat him away, but Nick easily grabbed his hand and wrapped an arm around him. His chest fluttered. Nick\u2019s scent now reminded him of everything good in the world. He turned at the edge of the bed, looking into Nick\u2019s eyes and putting his arm around Nick\u2019s neck so Nick could help him sit. Nick\u2019s arms tightened around him.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed Kelly gently. Kelly could feel him smiling into the kiss, and it made him grin too.</p><p>Nick finally let him go, leaving them both gasping. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty spectacular one.\u201d</p><p>Nick helped him sit, his hands lingering when they probably didn\u2019t need to. Kelly gritted his teeth with the pull in his chest. Mornings were always worse because the painkillers in his system were running low and his body was stiff and stubborn. It was also a little embarrassing not to be able to sit down by himself, but he supposed that was what happened when a bullet tore through you and then you decided you were tougher than your painkillers.</p><p>Nick piled the pillows for him, and Kelly rested against the headboard, watching Nick unabashedly.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d Nick asked, and the gravel in his voice sent a shiver up Kelly\u2019s spine.</p> <p>\u201cNot as good as I was last night, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s fingers were gentle as he brushed them over Kelly\u2019s neck. \u201cHow about you take your pills instead of trying to prove how tough you are?\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted.</p><p>Nick moved the breakfast tray he\u2019d brought up so it was beside Kelly on the bed, making sure everything was within arm\u2019s reach, then rounded the bed and crawled into the other side, sitting against the headboard with his iPad.</p><p>Kelly crunched down on a piece of bacon. After living together for five years while they\u2019d been stationed at Lejeune, Nick knew exactly how crispy he liked his bacon. He knew a lot of things. Kelly waved his bacon at the iPad. \u201cAnything interesting going on?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, still chewing. \u201cTy sent a message earlier saying he was heading back to Baltimore. Digger\u2019s convinced he\u2019s being watched by the CIA. And Owen came out of it smelling like roses and got a fucking Easter bonus. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been suspended,\u201d Nick added after a moment, still smiling at the iPad as he checked his email.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspended without pay until they straighten out the warrant for my arrest in Louisiana,\u201d Nick explained, beginning to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>Nick shrugged it off. \u201cIt\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve been in custody in the last year, I\u2019d suspend me too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again and placed the iPad aside, turning to look at Kelly instead. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly said with a nod, taking stock mentally. He nodded again. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Nick hesitated briefly, then said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to write up a steaming pile of bullshit for my captain telling him why I shouldn\u2019t be fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo do it,\u201d Kelly said, laughing despite the underlying worry that Nick might actually lose his job.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to rest for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes skeptically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call if I need help,\u201d Kelly assured him.</p><p>Nick gave him a brief kiss and rolled out of bed, taking his iPad downstairs. Kelly let his mind drift, thinking of Nick, thinking of their past together and the probability of them having a future. It was sudden and it was different, but Kelly still couldn\u2019t see a flaw in it. So what if Nick was famously afraid to move a romantic relationship past the fuck buddies stage? So what if Kelly\u2019d never been with a guy before? Or even been attracted to a guy before.</p><p>He\u2019d always acknowledged beauty in other men, but again, he\u2019d never felt attraction. What if it really was the narcotics he\u2019d been on the past few weeks? What if it was the near-death experience and Nick emerging as his caretaker? What if Nick was right and this was just a situational thing? What if the shine rubbed off?</p><p>What if they looked up in a week or a month and found that they\u2019d permanently altered the shape of their friendship, a friendship Kelly valued more than anything in the world, all for the whim of a man on the brink of death and high on Percocet?</p><p>What if Kelly actually convinced Nick this was a good idea, and got past those defenses Nick had worked his whole life building up, only to decide it was the wrong thing after all? It would crush Nick. Just the thought made Kelly nauseous. They were already on a slippery slope as it was; he needed to be damn sure they could take one more step without the whole cliff giving way.</p><p>When he looked up, he remembered he was alone. Nick had music playing low downstairs, obviously thinking it would cover the sounds of him muttering to himself so Kelly would rest. But Kelly couldn\u2019t rest. He needed to solidify this in his mind so he\u2019d stop panicking. He called out for Nick, and soon he heard Nick\u2019s footsteps coming up the steps.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to watch some gay porn,\u201d he told Nick as soon as the man reached the top.</p><p>Nick stopped short, eyes wide. A look of pure confusion passed over his face before he nodded and turned to head back down the steps. \u201cI\u2019ll get the iPad.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was eating his cold bacon when Nick returned, iPad in hand.</p><p>\u201cAm I to assume this is you trying to test if you\u2019re actually attracted to men instead of just being a horny stoner?\u201d Nick asked as he crawled into the bed and propped the iPad between them.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat outcome are we hoping for here?\u201d Nick asked as he tapped at the screen.</p><p>Kelly gazed at his profile. Nick glanced at him, returning Kelly\u2019s smirk with one of his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping I find watching a guy take it in the ass just as hot as I find the memory of you that night in San Diego,\u201d Kelly finally decided. \u201cOr last night. Or the night before. Or just the thought of you doing to me what you did to that girl.\u201d</p><p>Nick was still looking at him sideways, but a flush began to appear on his cheeks.</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard, growing warmer. \u201cYou remember that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you were, um . . . impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were watching,\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>\u201cExhibitionist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoyeur.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. He took the iPad from Nick\u2019s hands and pressed play on the video Nick had found. It wasn\u2019t a full video, just a free sample of something, so it started right in the middle of the act. The sound blasted through the quiet cabin. Kelly held the iPad at arm\u2019s length, cocking his head and frowning as he watched one man ram into another mercilessly, both of them contorting into unnatural positions. Nick leaned against the headboard beside him, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off the video. There was a lot of moaning and slapping and what looked like some very advanced yoga poses, and by the time the five-minute video ended, Kelly wasn\u2019t certain it had done much for him.</p><p>He flopped the iPad into his lap and sighed.</p><p>\u201cNothing, huh?\u201d Nick asked, sounding amused. Kelly shook his head. Nick reached for the iPad and clicked it off. \u201cI tend to like the amateur ones myself.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at him, his cock showing interest at the mere thought of Nick getting off to amateur porn.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re more real, less acrobatics,\u201d Nick explained, meeting Kelly\u2019s eyes without flinching. Kelly found it harder to breathe when Nick smiled mischievously. \u201cReal people who are really attracted to each other. It\u2019s sexier. Sometimes just the roll of the hips is all it takes for me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard. \u201cYou realize what you just said got me harder than five minutes of watching two people fuck.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou are a devious asshole, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Kelly barked a laugh. \u201cIs it possible to just be attracted to one guy, instead of all guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kels, anything\u2019s possible. You\u2019re not attracted to all women, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d Kelly said with a sigh.</p><p>They sat side by side in the bed, looking at each other speculatively. Nick finally shrugged and smiled. He shifted and wrapped his arm around Kelly\u2019s shoulders, pulling gently until they were both reclining against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Nick rumbled in Kelly\u2019s ear.</p><p>Kelly closed his eyes and leaned into Nick, smirking.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re thinking too hard. And I know why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same reason I am. You don\u2019t want to hurt me because you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>Kelly closed his eyes. Nick had the damnedest way of making things seem simple sometimes.</p><p>\u201cTake your time figuring it out, Kels. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t sure if it was the Percocet hitting him or Nick\u2019s simple promise that caused the warmth spreading through his chest. \u201cYou\u2019d do that? You\u2019d wait for me to figure things out?\u201d</p><p>Nick began to grin. \u201cI got no one better to do.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed despite trying not to. \u201cWhat about that guy? What was his name? The fireman?\u201d</p><p>Nick cleared his throat and loosened his hold on Kelly\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAidan. Like I said, that\u2019s been pretty casual. And . . . if there\u2019s something here with you?\u201d He looked up and into Kelly\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow could I pass that up?\u201d</p><p>Kelly caught his breath, staring into Nick\u2019s eyes and trying to decipher the heavy feeling in his chest. Nick drifted his knuckles over Kelly\u2019s cheekbone, and soon enough their lips met.</p><p>Something about the combination of gruff no-nonsense and tender attention was hitting buttons Kelly had never known he possessed. He could hear hints of the staff sergeant giving orders in Nick\u2019s words, but they were blunted by caresses full of adoration and mischief. It was a heady mixture, and it was signature Nick O\u2019Flaherty. It was everything Kelly had always loved about Nick. His brusque leadership under fire\u2014\u201cGet your fat Navy ass down before I blow it off!\u201d\u2014and the warmth of his friendship in times of peace, all boiled down in this moment to a word and a gesture.</p><p>Kelly grabbed the front of Nick\u2019s shirt. Nick looked down at his hand, smiling when he met Kelly\u2019s eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care why or how,\u201d Kelly grunted. \u201cI like this. I like seeing you like this. I like . . . I like thinking of you like this. I want more.\u201d</p><p>Nick opened his mouth to speak, but he seemed to struggle to say anything as his cheeks flushed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Nick managed to say. He licked his lips and began to grin. Kelly\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he recognized the look in Nick\u2019s eyes. He had just decided to throw caution to the wind and follow Kelly into the fire, just like he\u2019d done many times before. Damn the odds of getting hurt.</p><p>Kelly leaned and kissed him, wincing as his wound pulled with the movement. Nick pushed him back so he was against his nest of pillows again, still kissing him, his hands beginning to roam down Kelly\u2019s body.</p><p>But soon Nick grunted in annoyance and shoved away from him. \u201cI just really can\u2019t do this properly until you\u2019re better.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grabbed for him and caught him by the collar. \u201cAre you serious? How about improperly, then, because now I need it.\u201d</p><p>Nick fumbled behind him and grabbed the iPad, plopping it in Kelly\u2019s lap. \u201cWatch more gay porn,\u201d he said as he tried to disengage his collar. \u201cIt\u2019ll calm you down.\u201d</p><p>Kelly released him and slapped him on the side of the head, but Nick took the punishment and then rolled away, out of Kelly\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Kelly cried.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get carried away and hurt you again, okay?\u201d Nick said as he straightened his T-shirt. He looked and sounded sincere. \u201cBecause I will. Last night was bad enough. I mean Jesus, you look like you got strangled, and I fucking bled, man.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached to the bedside table and grabbed a handful of bacon, chucking it at Nick with a laugh and a curse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey! I have to clean that up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo get cleaning,\u201d Kelly said as he grabbed a handful of cold, soggy eggs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Nick warned with a point.</p> <p>Kelly quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome give me a cuddle with a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>Nick was still pointing at him. \u201cI will not be leveraged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuddle,\u201d Kelly said, waving his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nicko, come give me a manly cuddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut down the eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise I\u2019ll get a cuddle?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, just put down the eggs.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned triumphantly and plopped the eggs back onto the plate.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re disgusting, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a shower today anyway,\u201d Kelly said with a shrug. Nick rounded the end of the bed, watching him warily. Kelly gave him a sly smile. \u201cWill you help me?\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled the covers back and bent over him, pressing a kiss to his lips before growling, \u201cI end up with egg on me and you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Kelly managed. Nick hefted him out of bed, still kissing him, wrapping around him, growing more heated and pulling him closer. Before Kelly realized what he was doing, his hands were in Nick\u2019s hair, grabbing on so he could kiss him harder.</p><p>He felt Nick growl, the sound thrilling him down to his toes. He began to smile, laughing and desperately trying not to. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he tried sincerely. He began to laugh harder, pulling his sticky hand away from Nick\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I did it. And I\u2019m even more sorry I\u2019m laughing. I can\u2019t stop though.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent for a moment, fuming. Then he shook his head and pulled Kelly back to him. \u201cFuck it,\u201d he snarled, delving into another kiss. He pulled Kelly toward the bathroom.</p><p>Kelly had to stand on his toes to wrap his arms around Nick\u2019s neck to kiss him. He didn\u2019t mind, though. It was kind of hot, actually, the height difference. Everything about Nick was hotter than the surface of the sun, and Kelly had to wonder why in the fuck he\u2019d never noticed before. He pulled at the back of Nick\u2019s T-shirt, getting egg all over it. Nick stopped and yanked it over his head, pressing their bare chests together.</p><p>Kelly dragged his fingers across the oversized tattoo on Nick\u2019s shoulder, making him shiver.</p> <p>\u201cGross,\u201d Nick groaned, then pulled Kelly through the bathroom door and into the shower stall. He pushed Kelly against the cold tiles, holding him there as he turned the shower nozzle away from them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still wearing your jeans,\u201d Kelly told him, smirking.</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes were blazing when he met Kelly\u2019s, and it was quite obvious that he didn\u2019t care what got wet as long they were both naked and writhing when the water turned on. Nick grinned, and they both began to laugh. He quickly got out of his jeans and boxers, tossing them aside without breaking eye contact. There was something so intense just under the surface, Kelly was mesmerized. He\u2019d seen it before, but only in battle. And last night. And the night before.</p><p>He shivered and raked his eyes up and down Nick\u2019s naked body. Even a decade after their last deployment, Nick hadn\u2019t changed much. He was still in peak physical condition, but his muscles were bulkier now. He\u2019d injured his knee near the end, and he\u2019d chosen to give up running, putting that energy into free weights instead.</p><p>Nick moved closer, pushing the tip of his nose along Kelly\u2019s cheek as he pressed their chest together gently. Over the sound of his blood rushing through his ears and Nick\u2019s harsh breath against his lip, Kelly heard the bell downstairs that signaled a car pulling up the gravel drive.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Nick ground out.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me.\u201d Nick turned the water on quickly, ducking under it despite the fact that it was freezing cold, and washed the egg out of his hair. Then he stepped out of the shower, gathering his jeans up and stalking out of the bathroom.</p><p>Kelly was left alone as the water slowly warmed, mildly turned on and amused. He held his hand out to wash it clean, then stepped under the spray to at least wash the top layer of dirt off. He took his time getting dressed, because he didn\u2019t really have any other choice. And he took even more time getting down the stairs because tumbling down them didn\u2019t sound fun.</p><p>When he pushed through the front door, Nick was standing on the deck, shielding his eyes as he peered down the driveway. He\u2019d thrown a flannel shirt on but hadn\u2019t buttoned it, and a gun was stuffed in the small of his back.</p><p>Nick\u2019s cell phone began to chime from the kitchen. The song was one Kelly recognized for Ty, but he didn\u2019t move to answer it. Someone coming down his driveway was unusual enough to warrant his undivided attention.</p><p>The car finally broke the ridge and came into sight, trailing dust and gravel. It was a government issue SUV.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Nick hissed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a follow-up interview or something.\u201d</p><p>Nick squared his shoulders, rolling them and sort of unfurling. Kelly grinned. He\u2019d always loved watching Nick prepare for battle. It was like watching a dog bristle. Kelly moved out onto the deck, standing shoulder to shoulder with him, waiting.</p><p>The car came to a stop where the driveway ended, next to Kelly\u2019s truck. The passenger door popped open, but it wasn\u2019t a man in a suit like Kelly expected. It was a Marine.</p><p>He peered up at Nick as the driver, another Marine, rounded the front of the car.</p><p>\u201cStaff Sergeant Nicholas O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d the man questioned.</p><p>Nick stiffened as Kelly\u2019s blood ran cold.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>The Marine came closer, standing at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Staff Sergeant.\u201d He waited a beat for Nick to respond, but when Nick didn\u2019t, he stepped closer, handing Nick a blue packet of papers. \u201cStaff Sergeant, I\u2019m here to inform you you\u2019ve been recalled to active duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kelly blurted.</p><p>Nick was silent, reading the orders. He finally nodded, his jaw tight. \u201cThank you, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared for a moment before taking a step forward. He had to grip the railing as he shook all over. \u201cWhat about mine?\u201d</p><p>The Marine hesitated, glancing at his companion.</p><p>Nick put a hand on Kelly\u2019s shoulder, squeezing. \u201cKels,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d the Marine said. \u201cWe have no other orders to deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, if the team is being called back, I\u2019m going with them,\u201d Kelly shouted. \u201cKelly Abbott, check your goddamned orders again!\u201d</p><p>Nick moved to stand in front of him, putting a hand on his hip as Kelly tried to go down the steps after the two Marines. \u201cKelly, stop. Stop!\u201d</p><p>Kelly shoved at him, trying to break free, still shouting at the Marines. \u201cYou can\u2019t take my team without me! You can\u2019t send them back without me!\u201d</p><p>Nick wrapped him up, glancing over his shoulder. \u201cGo!\u201d he shouted at the two men.</p><p>They hurried to obey, retreating to their SUV.</p><p>\u201cKelly, stop,\u201d Nick pleaded, his voice breaking as he held Kelly tighter. \u201cPlease, stop. Doc.\u201d</p><p>Kelly collapsed against him as the car pulled away. He lowered his head, resting it against Nick\u2019s shoulder as he let out an anguished shout. Nick was truly holding him up now. Kelly didn\u2019t care if he was standing or not. His team. His boys. He was supposed to be there with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Kelly lifted his head and shoved away from him, but Nick wouldn\u2019t let him go. He pulled him into a hug, placing Kelly\u2019s head under his chin and holding him tight.</p><p>\u201cI know what you just did,\u201d Kelly whispered. He relaxed into Nick\u2019s protective embrace. Nicked hummed questioningly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t holding me back. You were holding me up.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s arms tightened around him.</p><p>\u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t look weak in front of a Marine.\u201d</p><p>Nick rested his chin on Kelly\u2019s head, his hands grasping at Kelly\u2019s back. \u201cYou could never be weak. You carry the whole team with you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned mournfully. The phone on the kitchen counter began to ring again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ty,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe was probably trying to warn us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, trying to accept the crushing realization that everyone he loved was being called to war and he wasn\u2019t capable of going with them. \u201cHow long do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Kelly closed his eyes, holding his breath until he was almost light-headed. He finally let it out and met Nick\u2019s eyes. Nick took Kelly\u2019s face in both hands. They stood in silence, staring into each other\u2019s eyes as both their cell phones rang and rang inside.</p><p>They converged in Charlotte, everyone flying in from around the country so they could report together as a team. They all knew it might be the last thing they did as a team, because there was no guarantee they\u2019d be kept together once they were deployed.</p><p>Nick and Kelly sat together in one of the airport lounge areas, waiting for the others to arrive and join them. These would be their last moments alone together, the last chance they had to say what needed to be said. Nick couldn\u2019t think of a word that seemed adequate.</p><p>Kelly finally flopped his arm over Nick\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhen you\u2019re over there,\u201d he said, his voice pitched low. \u201cI want you to remember you have unfinished business here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him, his heart in his throat when their eyes met.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s smile wavered, giving Nick a glimpse of the pain Kelly was trying to hide. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I want to say to you,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick\u2019s words were barely audible. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d have more time to figure this out, but . . . I\u2019ll wait for you to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone better to do,\u201d he drawled, echoing Nick\u2019s own words. Nick huffed, and Kelly leaned closer to press his forehead to Nick\u2019s temple. Nick patted his cheek. He turned his head and their lips found each other. It was almost physically painful to share that last kiss. When it ended, Nick couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t speak. He turned his head so they were once again leaning against each other, and he kept his hand on Kelly\u2019s cheek after he closed his eyes.</p><p>They sat that way in silence. Unmoving. Barely breathing. Nick\u2019s mind churned. He was nearly ill by the time someone touched him on the shoulder. He opened his eyes to find Ty and Zane standing in front of them, both looking as worn out and heartsick as Nick felt.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>Kelly looked up when he spoke. He stood and wrapped Ty up in a hug, holding on to him with the same kind of anguish he\u2019d held on to Nick with last night. Nick met Zane\u2019s eyes, nodding at him. There really wasn\u2019t anything they could say. Nick stood to shake his hand, though, but Zane surprised him by stepping closer to hug him.</p><p>\u201cPlease bring him back alive,\u201d Zane whispered as he clung to Nick.</p><p>Nick nodded jerkily. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Zane released him and sat next to him, his jaw tight and his shoulders rigid. He leaned forward, his head lowered and his fingers twined together. Nick could imagine what was going through Zane\u2019s mind. Nick had never had to leave someone he cared for behind, not until now. He understood what the heartbreak felt like.</p><p>Ty finally managed to extricate himself from Kelly\u2019s hug, and he and planted himself on the floor at Zane\u2019s feet, sitting with his seabag behind him as a backrest.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your neck?\u201d Ty asked Kelly, pointing to the fingerprints still left under Kelly\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cNick got carried away during rough sex,\u201d Kelly answered, deadpan. Nick muffled a laugh and glanced at Kelly, who winked in return.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever. What time are we expecting Johns and Digger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the arrivals again,\u201d Kelly told them, patting Nick on the shoulder before he walked off, moving slowly and holding his hand to his side. He had grown increasingly restless now that he was on the mend, wanting to push himself more and more.</p><p>Nick watched him go, filled with anger and regret that they were here at all and not back in Colorado on Kelly\u2019s deck, looking at the stars. That wasn\u2019t the only regret on his mind, though. He didn\u2019t like having secrets, and though he and Kelly had decided it was best to let this one stay quiet until they returned home and figured things out themselves, it wasn\u2019t the only secret Nick was harboring right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Irish?\u201d Ty asked as soon as Kelly was out of earshot.</p><p>Nick shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou look guilty. What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Zane, then back at Ty with a nod. There was no point in trying to hide it once Ty had called him on it. The airport bustled around them, but Nick barely took notice of any of it. He took a deep breath, steeling himself. \u201cI really fucked up this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go get some . . . coffee,\u201d Zane said as he made to stand.</p><p>Nick waved a hand. He sat forward, rubbing his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Garrett. Stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Nick checked to make certain Kelly wasn\u2019t on his way back before he took a deep breath. \u201cAt the hospital in New Orleans, the day they were releasing the Doc,\u201d he said, beginning to tremble as he thought about what Kelly\u2019s reaction would be to his admission. \u201cI was getting coffee as we waited for the papers. I saw two sailors at the front desk, getting information.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSailors?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cThey were there for Doc?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought they were. I went back upstairs, found his doctor, and . . .\u201d Nick pushed at the back of his teeth with his tongue, trying to work up the nerve to finish. \u201cI bribed him to say Kelly was no longer fit for service.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up straighter, eyes wide. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p> <p>Nick rubbed at his chin, lowering his head.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Nick,\u201d Ty whispered he glanced over his shoulder. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHe can barely walk; there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have been called back, regardless,\u201d Zane pointed out. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell him,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Ty put his hand on Nick\u2019s knee to draw his attention back. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the way he reacted when they came for me and not him. I can\u2019t leave him behind thinking he wasn\u2019t good enough to come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is your guilt talking and making you sound like an idiot,\u201d Ty hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s not physically able to go back. We know that. He knows that. He\u2019s not stupid. No matter what you did, Doc wouldn\u2019t be coming with us. Nothing you can tell him is going to make him feel better about that.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes. Damn Ty and his unscrupulous ability to make sense out of lying. When he glanced up again, he saw Kelly working his way across the crowded terminal with Owen in tow.</p><p>Ty tapped Nick\u2019s knee. \u201cDo you really want him left behind knowing you did this? It can wait until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop talking, Beaumont,\u201d Nick grunted. \u201cYou\u2019re like the Bermuda Triangle of morals.\u201d</p> <p>Zane snorted and covered it with a cough.</p><p>\u201cFine, be that way,\u201d Ty said. \u201cGo be a goddamn white knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he even be angry at all?\u201d Zane asked quietly. \u201cIs Kelly capable of being angry?\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent, watching Kelly. He really only had two options. He could man the fuck up and tell Kelly what he\u2019d done, risking his anger here at the eleventh hour. Or he could keep it to himself, working on the logic that Kelly legitimately wouldn\u2019t have been recalled anyway. Nick\u2019s actions probably had nothing to do with it. But he\u2019d go off to war with the nagging feeling that he was a coward and a horrible friend.</p><p>He pushed to his feet before he could talk himself out of it, striding to meet Kelly and Owen as they approached the lounge area. Owen greeted him with a sedate hug. Nick took Kelly\u2019s arm and held on as Owen headed for Ty and Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kelly asked when Nick didn\u2019t let go of him.</p><p>\u201cI have something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at the others and Nick did the same. Owen shook Zane\u2019s hand before settling onto the floor beside Ty. Nick found it harder to breathe, but he took Kelly by both shoulders and turned him to face him to make him focus.</p> <p>\u201cJust be quiet until I finish saying this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is your way of professing your undying love for me, you need some work on your technique,\u201d Kelly drawled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the reason you didn\u2019t get recalled with us,\u201d Nick said in a quiet rush.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s smile fell and he straightened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nick told him what he\u2019d done in New Orleans, and why he\u2019d done it. \u201cI saw a chance to keep one of us from going back over there, and I took it. I was trying to . . . save you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gaped, finally tearing his eyes away from Nick to glance at the others, who were now watching them. He took a step back, jerking out of Nick\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cKels, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell could you do this?\u201d Kelly shouted. He shoved at Nick\u2019s shoulder and almost immediately grabbed for his chest, hunching with the pain he\u2019d obviously forgotten would come.</p><p>Nick reached to steady him. Kelly swatted at his hand again but Nick gripped his elbow hard and held on, refusing to be pushed away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, repeating it again and again as Kelly tried to shove him away.</p><p>A hand landed on Nick\u2019s shoulder, and Owen and Ty were there with them, pulling them apart. Ty gripped Nick\u2019s elbows, restraining him. Owen held Kelly\u2019s waist to keep him upright, thinking he\u2019d overworked himself and was about to collapse. But Kelly growled and lashed out, catching Nick\u2019s chin with his fist before Owen could pull him away.</p><p>Nick and Ty both tumbled to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Ty grunted. He released Nick immediately, giving him the chance to defend himself. Nick didn\u2019t move, though.</p><p>Kelly stood with his hands on his knees, breathing hard and hanging his head. Owen hovered beside him, a hand on Kelly\u2019s back, looking supremely confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Digger shouted. He stood a few feet away, his seabag on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, that really hurt,\u201d Kelly gasped. He straightened carefully, holding his chest. \u201cI feel better now.\u201d</p><p>Digger dropped his bag and helped Ty and Nick to their feet.</p><p>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d Kelly asked Nick.</p><p>Nick rubbed his jaw, nodding. \u201cLittle bit, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Kelly huffed.</p><p>He grabbed for Nick\u2019s shoulder, catching the material of his shirt and pulling him closer with it. Relief washed through Nick as Kelly hugged him. He rested his chin on Kelly\u2019s shoulder and held him tight.</p><p>\u201cYou did it out of love,\u201d Kelly whispered. He patted Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019d still be stuck here no matter what you did, so . . . you did it out of love. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Digger asked again. \u201cAnd what happened to Doc\u2019s neck?\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted in Nick\u2019s ear and they both began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou two have spent too much time in Doc\u2019s weed,\u201d Owen said, walking away now that the drama had passed. The others trailed after him, leaving Nick and Kelly to their embrace.</p><p>They sat in a sedate group as the minutes ticked down. Their flight to Jacksonville, North Carolina, was leaving soon, and the last hours felt too heavy to fill with anything meaningful. Nothing would be special enough, so they spent the time telling stories and laughing.</p><p>Kelly still hadn\u2019t quite come to terms with the fact that he wouldn\u2019t be going with them. What the hell was he supposed to do? He kept glancing at Nick. He couldn\u2019t even be upset by what Nick had told him. He knew Nick always acted on an almost desperate instinct to protect the people he loved.</p><p>Kelly had been joking when he\u2019d guessed Nick was about to profess his undying love, but he hadn\u2019t been too far off the mark. Nick\u2019s technique was pretty damn good, if not subtle as hell.</p><p>They were listening to the story of how Ty had pulled a Rhett Butler on Zane in the middle of the Baltimore FBI field office when they heard the boarding announcement for the flight that would take the boys away.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s heart jumped into his throat.</p><p>Everyone was silent and stoic as they gathered their seabags and walked as a group toward the nearby gate. They gathered at the boarding lanes, trying to figure out how to say good-bye, trying to decide which gestures would last for a lifetime of memories if someone didn\u2019t come home.</p><p>Ty wrapped Zane up in a hug, his murmured words too low to overhear. They stood that way, grasping each other for dear life.</p><p>Kelly took Owen\u2019s hand and shook it, pulling him into a hug. \u201cBe safe, bud,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou know what to do, right?\u201d Owen asked.</p><p>Kelly nodded and released him. Both Nick and Owen had put Kelly in charge of their affairs. Nick because he had no one else he trusted, and Owen because his parents didn\u2019t have the security clearance.</p><p>Owen backed away and let Digger move in for a hug. He bypassed the handshake entirely and picked Kelly up, squeezing him to the point that it hurt. Kelly laughed breathlessly and patted his back until Digger set him down again. Digger turned away without a word, sniffing audibly.</p><p>Kelly forced himself to meet Nick\u2019s eyes. Nick moved close and hugged him gently, pressing their cheeks together, his warm hands splayed against Kelly\u2019s back. \u201cI don\u2019t have the words,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need them,\u201d Kelly said shakily. \u201cJust watch your damn six out there.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded jerkily and moved away, his head down and his shoulders slumped. Kelly fought back tears as he looked at the three of them. His boys.</p><p>Ty grabbed Kelly\u2019s face and kissed his forehead, patting his cheek. \u201cBe good,\u201d he said gruffly before moving away. He joined the others, all of them turning to face Kelly and Zane. They went to attention without a word, standing shoulder to shoulder. Then each of them gave a sharp salute.</p><p>Kelly finally lost control and let the tears track down his face without wiping them away. He straightened and returned their salute, holding it until the four remaining members of Force Recon Team Sidewinder turned away and headed for the gangway, walking once again into the fray.</p><p>Not one of them looked back.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Kelly said shakily.</p><p>Zane sniffed and nodded. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s us I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the gangway until the last man was out of sight. Then he turned to Zane. \u201cNick O\u2019Flaherty doesn\u2019t make a promise he doesn\u2019t intend to die trying to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made me a promise,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Kelly nodded, swallowing hard. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Zane was on his way up the stairs when the doorbell rang. He debated not answering it, but ultimately he headed back down, grumbling. It was Sunday, his only day off, and he didn\u2019t want to deal with any shit today.</p><p>He peered through the peephole, and his heart stuttered when he saw the Marine on the stoop. He was wearing a green and khaki service uniform, a barracks cover on his head. A seabag was slung over his shoulder, and he stood straight and tall as he looked out on the street, his back to the door.</p><p>Zane fumbled with the lock, his fingers suddenly unable to keep up with his racing heart. Was it news? Was it good or bad news? Why the hell would a Marine be standing on his stoop if it wasn\u2019t news?</p><p>He swung the door open, feeling stupid and clumsy as the man turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty?\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him a wan smile and held up his hand. \u201cNo one\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>Zane glared at him. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to believe him or not. And he wasn\u2019t sure whether to hug him or hit him.</p><p>Nick laughed at Zane\u2019s expression, the sound flat and tired. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked him up and down, inspecting him for injuries that would have sent him home. None were visible. \u201cWhy are you here? How are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight-hour special liberty.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned harder. He realized he was still gripping the door, and his knuckles hurt. He let go and shook his hand. \u201cSpecial liberty?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cI have a cold,\u201d Nick answered, deadpan. He waited a beat. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>Zane started, nodding as he stepped out of the way. \u201cYeah. Shit. Sorry, I just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPanicked, I know. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t have anywhere to change out of the uniform,\u201d Nick said as he stepped inside. He set his seabag down by the door, the same spot Ty always dropped his gym bag when he was tired after a long day.</p><p>Zane stared at it for a moment, letting the pain settle in his chest before he tried to take another breath. He finally tore his eyes away and tried to smile at Nick. Nick was watching him. He seemed exhausted, but his frown was sympathetic. He had to sense Zane\u2019s disappointment that he wasn\u2019t Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d Zane managed to say with a wave of his hand at Nick.</p><p>Nick smirked. \u201cI know. Marines always look good.\u201d He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a leather billfold that appeared to hold his orders, then pulled a creased and battered envelope from the billfold and handed it to Zane.</p><p>Zane stared at it, licking his lips and steeling himself before he reached for it. It was warm against his fingers, and the simple scrawl of his name was familiar. It was from Ty, but it had the appearance of a letter that had seen many nights in someone\u2019s pocket. Zane knew a lot of soldiers, sailors, and Marines left a letter with a buddy in case they didn\u2019t make it home. If Nick had been carrying this letter around every day for that reason, Zane didn\u2019t want to read it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew I was coming home,\u201d Nick answered, voice gentle. \u201cHe wrote it before I left.\u201d</p><p>Zane released the breath he\u2019d been holding in a rush. He turned the letter over, fingers shaking, desperate to rip it open and read the first communication he\u2019d received from Ty in months.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat. \u201cGarrett. I know my way around if you want to take that upstairs and read it. You can write him a response and I\u2019ll carry it back with me.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, fighting to breathe. \u201cYou only have forty-eight hours. You shouldn\u2019t waste them.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for another breathless second, then lunged and wrapped Nick up in a hug. Nick began to laugh, patting him on the back awkwardly. \u201cGo on,\u201d he finally urged. \u201cI\u2019m going to steal some of Ty\u2019s Cubans while you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Zane backed away and then turned to head up the stairs, the letter pressed to his hip so his fingers wouldn\u2019t tremble as he held it. He heard Nick in the kitchen, probably retrieving the portable safe Ty kept hidden below the kitchen sink where he stowed his Cuban cigars. Zane didn\u2019t even care that Nick knew it was there. He went to his bedroom and sat on the end of the bed, staring down at the letter from Ty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He almost didn\u2019t want to open it. There was every possibility it might be the last thing he heard from Ty, and though he tried not to think that way, he was only human. The notion kept creeping in. What if this was it? What if this was the last thing they managed to say to each other? How could it ever be enough?</p><p>He forced himself to tear into the envelope before he could make himself sick.</p><p>Zane,</p> <p>I\u2019m okay. We\u2019re all okay. I miss you like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I wanted you to know that. I can\u2019t say more. Please don\u2019t ask Nick details. Just know we\u2019re doing our damnedest to get home.</p><p>It was signed formally, with the words Captain B. Tyler Grady scrawled across the bottom.</p><p>\u201cCaptain,\u201d Zane murmured. He smiled even as his composure threatened. There was almost nothing to go on, but it was from Ty and that was all that mattered. Beneath the signature were eight numbers that seemed to be random. Zane wondered first if they were perhaps a processing code, but they were in Ty\u2019s handwriting.</p><p>After staring for a few more seconds, he realized what it was. A simple cipher. Ty had sent him an encoded message. He grabbed a pad of paper from the bedside table and began writing down the letters needed to replace the numbers, and it didn\u2019t take long to decipher what the message said: \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Zane began to laugh. Ty had sent him a puzzle to play with.</p> <p>It took him long minutes to write his response. He kept it just as short, just as succinct, knowing these letters were being read. He included his own cipher in return, with the message, \u201cAye aye, Captain,\u201d just to throw Ty off.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seal it, knowing it wouldn\u2019t matter, and then thumped back down the stairs. Nick was nowhere to be found, though. The living room was silent, and nothing was out of place. Zane called his name, cocking his head to listen.</p><p>The distant reply came from outside. Zane ambled out to the front stoop, but again he found no one there. \u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here,\u201d Nick called.</p><p>Zane craned his head, peering two stories up to the top floor balcony where Nick stood, leaning over and looking at him.</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck did you get past me?\u201d Zane asked, chuckling at the memory of Nick and Kelly scaling a balcony in New Orleans.</p> <p>\u201cI have skills,\u201d Nick said, his voice just low enough to travel down. He waved the cigar held between two long fingers. \u201cCome share this thing with me.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared over the railing, and Zane headed back inside to join him. He climbed past the bedrooms on the second floor and into the large attic room, where the door to the balcony was propped open and the curtains were flowing in a light breeze. He stood in the doorway, watching Nick for a moment. Nick was reclining in a rusty old lawn chair, his feet propped on the railing. He\u2019d changed into jeans and a black T-shirt, and he was barefoot.</p><p>He held up the Cuban for Zane to take, and Zane moved to sit in the chair beside him, putting the cigar in his mouth. He studied Nick for several more seconds.</p><p>Zane had never paid a lot of attention to Nick, other than briefly deciding he was going to try to like him instead of hit him. He didn\u2019t know him well, even though he was so much like Ty on the surface. He didn\u2019t know his moods, and he couldn\u2019t read him. But even Zane could see that Nick wasn\u2019t the same person he\u2019d been in New Orleans.</p><p>\u201cGot a response?\u201d Nick asked when he finally turned to Zane and smiled.</p><p>Zane handed him the envelope. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked impulsively.</p><p>Nick glanced up from folding the letter, his eyebrows jumping. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean . . . you\u2019re here. You\u2019re not in Boston. I know I wasn\u2019t the top person on your list to see, so . . . are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>Nick smiled, looking away from Zane to peer out over the city stretching beyond the balcony. Zane had sat up here with Ty many times. It was where Ty liked to come to think, to ponder their cases, to decompress after a stressful day. Nick had obviously been up here enough to know that if he hadn\u2019t propped the door open, he would have gotten locked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d he finally said, his voice so soft and hoarse that Zane had to lean closer to hear.</p><p>Zane held his breath, waiting for Nick to elaborate. Nick remained silent, though.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Zane finally whispered.</p><p>Nick lowered his head, licking his lips. \u201cI never thanked you for what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy is my best friend,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe\u2019s been the most constant thing I\u2019ve had in my life. I know if you had forced him to choose between us, he would have chosen you. And he should have,\u201d Nick added quickly with a glance at Zane. \u201cThank you for not making him choose.\u201d</p><p>Zane had to take a few seconds to gather his thoughts as Nick met his gaze with striking green eyes. He finally found his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. It would have killed him.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence, staring at each other for several more moments. Zane didn\u2019t feel awkward about it, and the moment didn\u2019t strike him as especially heavy or fraught. Nick had a way of making him feel at ease despite their shaky start, and Zane had to wonder if that was why he and Ty had remained so close for so long. Nick was the rock to Ty\u2019s hurricane. He was impervious to Ty\u2019s moods. It was like his superpower.</p><p>Nick plucked the cigar from Zane\u2019s fingers and took a long drag. When he spoke again, smoke accompanied his words. \u201cDoc\u2019s flying in to meet up with me. He should be here soon. We\u2019ll probably get some dinner. You\u2019re welcome to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled and took another drag.</p><p>Zane laughed at the devious look in Nick\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh my God. Ty told you to take me out to dinner, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s classified,\u201d Nick drawled. He tilted his head back and blew a smoke ring toward the sunset.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zane grumbled. His eyes followed the ring as it wavered off on the breeze. He\u2019d have to get Ty to teach him how to do that when he returned. \u201cNow I\u2019m a charity case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we all, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, smiling wryly. He propped his feet up on the railing. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little jealous of you and Ty,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Nick glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cI never had a friend like that. Someone I knew would be there no matter what. I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>Nick pursed his lips and gave a slow nod. \u201cGarrett, you have at least one friend like that now.\u201d</p><p>Zane found his throat tightening at the sentiment. He didn\u2019t fool himself into thinking Nick was offering any kind of loyalty that wasn\u2019t attached to Ty, but it was more than he could remember having in years. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Nick began to smile, and his words took on a sly hint. \u201cSo, dinner. You like Italian?\u201d</p><p>Zane burst out laughing. \u201cI know a place nearby.\u201d</p><p>They were both still snickering when they heard a car door shut on the street below. \u201cI see your smoke rings!\u201d Kelly called from below. \u201cI hear your evil cackling.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat up and peered over the railing, then pushed out of his seat and left Zane sitting there without another word. He didn\u2019t make a sound going down the stairs. Zane waved to Kelly, who had a bag slung over his shoulder and was craning his neck to peer up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d Irish go?\u201d</p><p>Before Zane could answer, Nick burst out the front door and hopped the three steps to the sidewalk. He body-slammed Kelly hard and picked him up. Kelly made a sound like a bird being hit by a car, but then he wrapped his arms and legs around Nick and held on as he was hugged.</p><p>Zane laughed even as a melancholy ache settled in his chest. He was glad to see the two friends reunited, but he couldn\u2019t help but wish that was him and Ty down there.</p><p>\u201cNot too long now,\u201d he whispered to himself. \u201cKeep it together, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Nick had been sent halfway across the world under the guise of a forty-eight-hour mental health break, but his true purpose had been to deliver a single, five-word message to the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland. He\u2019d flown twelve hours in a jump seat, delivered his message, then diverted to Baltimore to drop in on Zane. Ty hadn\u2019t sent him there as Zane had suspected, but Nick hadn\u2019t let Zane know that.</p><p>He\u2019d been able to get word to Kelly, who\u2019d flown in to meet up with him. Nick had been nearly sick with nerves as he waited for Kelly to arrive, but the moment he\u2019d seen him standing on the sidewalk in front of Ty\u2019s row house, the moment he\u2019d heard his lighthearted voice, any trace of apprehension abandoned him and all he wanted was to hug Kelly until his head popped off.</p><p>They took Zane to dinner, keeping conversation light, trying not to let anything slip. Kelly knew not to ask questions, and Zane seemed to catch on quickly that even asking how the weather had been was too far.</p><p>Dinner was good. Zane\u2019s waiter friend, Ryan, was just as hot as Ty complained about. Nick and Kelly were able to keep their hands and eyes off each other for hours as they sat and talked with Zane. In the end, Kelly and Zane arranged to keep in contact better, offering each other some support while Sidewinder was gone.</p><p>Zane was clearly heartsick, but he didn\u2019t seem lonely. When they parted at the end of the night, he didn\u2019t linger or ask them to stick around, though he did offer to let them stay with him. They declined for . . . obvious reasons. But Nick was relieved to see that Zane seemed to be doing okay on his own.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t tell Zane and Kelly that they weren\u2019t the only ones who were alone a lot of the time. He couldn\u2019t tell them that the team had been split up, promoted and seeded into smaller groups. Given the real reason they\u2019d been recalled\u2014black ops missions on which MARSOC couldn\u2019t afford to use known operators\u2014Nick and Digger were now master sergeants, each leading a recon squadron of twelve men. Ty was a captain who commanded four separate squadrons, Nick\u2019s and Digger\u2019s included. Owen had been filtered into Naval Intelligence, and they only heard from him when they gathered in the dark to do their real jobs.</p><p>None of that mattered tonight, though. None of that mattered for the next two days. Nick wrapped his arm around Kelly\u2019s waist and pulled him closer as they walked down the hallway to their hotel room. They glanced at each other, both grinning. Neither of them said a word.</p><p>Nick slid the room key home and shoved the door open, then reached out to take Kelly\u2019s hand and tug him inside. They barely got their bags into the room. They were kissing even before the door latched.</p><p>Kelly grasped at Nick\u2019s shirt, sliding his hands around to dig into Nick\u2019s shoulders. Nick moved in on him, his hands on Kelly\u2019s cheeks, shoving him against the wall with little regard for how rough he was being. They both grunted when Kelly hit, but it didn\u2019t slow them down. Nick kissed him hungrily, gripping Kelly\u2019s hair. Kelly moaned when Nick\u2019s fingers tightened and tugged, and the sound was like a dinner bell ringing.</p><p>Nick bit Kelly\u2019s lip, gasping as their bodies pressed together. \u201cI thought about this so goddamn many times.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cEvery night. Every fucking night I thought about you.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes, running the tip of his nose from Kelly\u2019s chin to his cheek, breathing him in. Kelly jutted his chin out and brushed his lips against Nick\u2019s. Nick could feel him grinning, could feel the eagerness in his labored breaths. They both knew what was coming. There was no holding it off this time, and there was no point in wasting what precious little time they had in trying to deny what they both wanted.</p><p>Nick kissed him, rocking into him. Then he trailed kisses down his chin to his neck and nipped at him, seeking the sounds he remembered Kelly making. He wasn\u2019t disappointed. Kelly moaned, vibrating Nick\u2019s lips as he sucked on Kelly\u2019s neck. Nick grabbed his thighs and picked him up, sliding him up the wall and using his body to keep him there.</p><p>Kelly wrapped his legs around Nick\u2019s waist to help him. \u201cFuck me, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s fingers tightened in his hair and he bit down harder on his neck, dragging his teeth over the skin. He wanted nothing more than to do just that, and now that Kelly wasn\u2019t injured, Nick didn\u2019t have to worry about hurting him. Much.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Nick promised, despite his desire to say \u201cAye aye\u201d and toss Kelly to the floor.</p><p>Kelly grunted. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and pushed his face against Kelly\u2019s neck. \u201cWe both need to get off at least once before I get at you, or I\u2019ll tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t! I\u2019ve been practicing!\u201d Kelly began popping the buttons on Nick\u2019s shirt, fingers fluttering against Nick\u2019s skin as they moved.</p><p>Nick\u2019s breath caught. His knees went weak, and he let Kelly slide back down the wall to his feet. He placed both hands on either side of Kelly\u2019s head and pushed away so he could meet Kelly\u2019s eyes. \u201cPracticing?\u201d</p><p>Kelly hummed, biting his lip against a grin.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been doing that, exactly?\u201d The hoarse rumble in his voice could have been misconstrued as threatening, but Kelly just grinned wider. He knew Nick too well to misconstrue anything he did.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I love it when you do that,\u201d Kelly muttered, his changeable eyes boldly meeting Nick\u2019s. He undid the button of Nick\u2019s jeans with nimble fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Nick asked, his voice gone even rougher. He looked down at Kelly\u2019s hands. Kelly pressed his forehead to Nick\u2019s, both of them watching as he shoved Nick\u2019s jeans down his hips.</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of nights alone,\u201d Kelly said. Nick raised his head, and their noses brushed. Kelly\u2019s breath was warm against his lips. \u201cI called your name every damn time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cTry me, babe. I can take it.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s chest tightened, making his breath stutter. His fingers curled against the wall. Kelly\u2019s palms slid along his hips, just under the band of his boxers. Then Kelly put his head against the wall and peered up at Nick, smirking as he wrapped his fingers around Nick\u2019s cock.</p> <p>\u201cJust how much self-control do you have left after three months in the desert?\u201d</p><p>Nick gripped the back of Kelly\u2019s neck and forced him flat against the wall. \u201cNot enough,\u201d he snarled before they shared a violent kiss. His other hand tugged haphazardly at Kelly\u2019s clothing.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Kels. Just stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t shut up, I talk when I\u2019m nervous!\u201d</p> <p>Nick snorted and shoved away from the wall. He met Kelly\u2019s eyes, running his knuckles down his cheek. Months of thoughts swirled in his head, months of thinking that he could love Kelly, that they could really work. He wanted to tell Kelly just that, but now wasn\u2019t the time. He wasn\u2019t the type of man who hid his emotions, though, so he knew Kelly was seeing hints of it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Kelly murmured.</p><p>When they kissed again, neither of them closed their eyes.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s fingers were gentle against Nick\u2019s skin. Nick cupped his face and kissed him again, humming as Kelly\u2019s body relaxed further. Nick didn\u2019t want him nervous, not for any reason.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d he asked, his lips moving against the corner of Kelly\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Kelly sighed shakily, then took a deep breath. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt feels like home.\u201d</p> <p>Nick pushed his nose against Kelly\u2019s, kissing him gently as warmth spread through his entire body.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like home,\u201d Kelly said as he wrapped his arms around Nick\u2019s neck.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t find his breath, and everything else seemed to fade away except for the feeling of Kelly in his arms. He slowed everything down, kissing Kelly languidly. They had to separate for air, and Nick pushed away from the wall. They met each other\u2019s eyes, not saying anything, not feeling the need to.</p><p>Kelly reached to lift Nick\u2019s T-shirt up, but Nick took his hand instead.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to verbalize what he was feeling, but he didn\u2019t even know what it was. It was so much more than just sex. \u201cKels,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that! We only have two nights and we\u2019re supposed to be having hot monkey sex! You can\u2019t back out on me now!\u201d</p><p>Nick burst out laughing, covering his face with one hand. \u201c\u2018You feel like home\u2019! You can\u2019t have hot monkey sex after that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes you can!\u201d Kelly insisted. He grabbed the hem of Nick\u2019s shirt and yanked it up, shoving it up over his head and then tossing it to the floor. He shoved Nick toward the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Nick stumbled backward, barely able to keep his balance with his jeans riding low around his thighs. \u201cKelly!\u201d</p><p>Kelly shoved him again. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it, Irish, come have your way with me.\u201d</p><p>Nick licked his lips and grumbled, but Kelly shoved him one last time and he wound up on his back on the mattress. Kelly yanked his shirt off as he headed for the door and the bags they\u2019d dropped. He was out of sight for a moment, then he returned, naked, with both hands full. He held up a bottle of lubricant in one, and a red flipcam in the other.</p><p>\u201cIs that a video camera?\u201d Nick asked, his voice cracking.</p><p>Kelly stuck his tongue out, biting it as he nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Nick drawled, unable to keep the affection out of his voice.</p><p>Kelly set both his prizes on the bed and untied Nick\u2019s shoes, pulling each one off and dropping it with a heavy thunk to the floor. Then he pulled Nick\u2019s jeans off, followed by his boxers, and climbed onto the bed to straddle Nick.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you haven\u2019t been practicing with someone like this?\u201d Nick said with a strained laugh.</p><p>Kelly put both hands on Nick\u2019s chest and leaned over him. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll show you later how I\u2019ve been spending my nights.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted and Kelly shifted, moving against Nick\u2019s hard cock. Their eyes met, and they both grinned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back, Irish,\u201d Kelly taunted.</p><p>Nick licked his lips, his eyes raking down Kelly\u2019s body. He sat up, kissing at the scar on Kelly\u2019s chest and up his throat to his jaw. Kelly shifted around in his lap, rubbing his ass against Nick\u2019s cock. Nick held him tighter and kicked his leg out to the side, using the leverage to flip them both and pin Kelly beneath him. They stretched out sideways on the king-sized bed. Kelly arched his back and squeezed his legs against Nick\u2019s hips.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed and grabbed Nick\u2019s face. \u201cNo. Whose name do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>Kelly bit Nick\u2019s lip as they kissed, not letting go even when Nick pulled back. Nick took hold of his hips and yanked him toward the edge of the bed, scooting back and pulling Kelly with him. When his feet hit the floor, he stood and grabbed Kelly\u2019s legs to flip him over to his stomach. Kelly flailed and grabbed at the bedcovers, but he couldn\u2019t right himself before Nick had him pinned again.</p><p>He leaned over him, sliding his hand under Kelly and up his chest to pull their bodies together, his cock hard against Kelly\u2019s ass. Kelly tilted his head to offer up his neck, and Nick bit down, dragging one hand to grip Kelly\u2019s hip. Nick could feel Kelly\u2019s heart hammering against his palm, beating in frantic time with his own.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you want it?\u201d Kelly asked. He moved his ass against Nick\u2019s cock, making them both moan.</p><p>Nick put his lips to Kelly\u2019s ear, holding him tighter. \u201cI want you every fucking way I can get you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stretched his lean body out to reach for the bottle of lubricant. Nick ran his hand over Kelly\u2019s spine, letting his cock slide against his ass. Good God, he was absolutely sinuous. Nick couldn\u2019t wait to be inside him, to make him writhe.</p><p>Kelly handed the lubricant back to him. Nick took the bottle, barely able to stay under control. \u201cWe don\u2019t have condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need them.\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice was muffled as he rested on his elbows and hung his head.</p><p>Nick rubbed his palm over Kelly\u2019s ass, bending over to kiss his shoulder. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered, despite a jolt of nerves, then snapped the bottle open. He straightened back up, stroking himself and watching the rapid rise and fall of Kelly\u2019s breathing. \u201cHand me that fucking video camera.\u201d</p><p>Kelly made a whimpering sound and reached for it, snagging it by the attached string. He turned it on and handed it to Nick. Nick hit record and bent over Kelly to speak against his ear. \u201cI better not see this shit on the internet.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pushed up and made an exasperated sound. \u201cJust hurry up and get in there!\u201d</p><p>Nick gripped him by his shoulder, laughing. He stroked himself, covering his cock liberally in lube. \u201cLast chance.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shivered in Nick\u2019s arms and turned his head, seeking Nick\u2019s lips with his own. As they kissed, Nick reached between them, pressing one slick finger against Kelly\u2019s asshole. Kelly groaned wantonly and rested his forehead on the bed, giving Nick the perfect opening to kiss along his shoulder and neck\u2014kisses Kelly leaned into, and their lips meeting again. Nick slid his tongue into Kelly\u2019s mouth as he slid his finger inside him. It was an easy entry, a gasp and a tightening of muscles Kelly\u2019s only reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou have been practicing,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s heart was pounding, making it hard to breathe, making it hard to even think. Kelly\u2019s body was warm and hard against his. He\u2019d imagined this so many times over the last few months. He\u2019d fucking craved it.</p><p>He worked a second finger inside, moving slowly, twisting, turning the video camera to record it. Kelly arched his body and rewarded him with another deep moan.</p><p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick gritted out.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, Nick, come on.\u201d</p><p>Nick took himself in hand and pushed the head of his cock against Kelly\u2019s ass, pressing forward. Kelly shoved his knee against Nick\u2019s to widen his stance. He was hanging his head and panting, and Nick hadn\u2019t even pushed inside him yet.</p><p>Nick put a hand in the center of his back and said, \u201cBreathe out, babe.\u201d</p><p>Kelly did, and Nick worked the head of his cock inside him, watching and barely remembering to point the camera toward the action.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, Kels,\u201d Nick gasped. He closed his eyes and fought with every ounce of willpower he possessed not to shove in deeper. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside someone without a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst for both of us then,\u201d Kelly said, his voice strained. He raised his head, pushing up on his hands. \u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>Nick ran his hand down Kelly\u2019s spine. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s answer came out as a hiss. \u201cFuck yes.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head again, pushing his hips back carefully. Nick didn\u2019t move, letting Kelly guide the entry. Kelly groaned louder, going still, and Nick began to rotate his hips, working himself inside. He\u2019d never felt anything like it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe,\u201d Kelly grunted, grabbing at Nick\u2019s hip, digging his fingers in and pulling Nick closer. Nick sank further in and gasped, gripping Kelly hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Kelly, this isn\u2019t going to last long if you don\u2019t fucking control yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking control it,\u201d Kelly grunted. He shoved back again and they both shouted as Nick sank deep.</p><p>Nick fumbled with the video camera and raised it to capture himself pulling his cock slowly out and then rocking back in.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Kelly cried. He grabbed at the covers, his fingers twisting in them.</p><p>Nick seated himself, shoving deep, then leaned over and placed his hand on top of Kelly\u2019s, twining their fingers.</p><p>\u201cWreck me, babe,\u201d Kelly pleaded.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Nick gritted out. He dropped the camera and grabbed Kelly\u2019s hip instead, pulling out and carefully thrusting back in. It took him longer than usual to find a good rhythm, but goddamn Kelly was so fucking tight he had to go slow. He wanted to go slow. He rested his head against Kelly\u2019s shoulder and fucked him, pushing in deep and pulling out until Kelly pleaded. Rolled his hips and tugged at Kelly until both their toes curled.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s moans grew louder, his body writhing, his ass so tight Nick thought he might come every time Kelly moved. Kelly finally pushed onto his hands and knees, gasping for breath. He reached out, his hand fumbling for the video camera. He shoved it under him, pointing it so they\u2019d be able to watch from below as Nick fucked him.</p><p>Nick buried himself deep and began to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re dirty, Kels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like Satan calling me a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed harder and bent over him, rocking into him. Kelly shouted, caught by the new angle.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, hello prostate,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>Nick gripped his hip hard and hit that angle again. Over and over, until Kelly was barely able to prop himself up anymore. Nick paused just long enough to add more lube to the mix, then sped his rhythm, still aiming for Kelly\u2019s prostate. Their bodies pounded together, the slapping of their skin masked only by Kelly\u2019s shouts for more.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Nick, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Kelly managed after several minutes.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Nick gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously one of those that can come without being jacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you,\u201d Nick said as Kelly\u2019s muscles began to tighten and spasm. \u201cIf you come, I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>Kelly threw his head back. \u201cYou\u2019ll come inside me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr on you, wherever the fuck you want.\u201d</p><p>Kelly moaned. \u201cShoot it off inside me, Lucky. Fill me up.\u201d</p><p>The bed protested Nick\u2019s thrusts, but Kelly cried out for more. Nick watched his cock disappearing into Kelly\u2019s ass, his fingers digging into the muscles. The red camera was still sitting on the bed, watching everything, recording it from below. Kelly would probably jack off to this video for weeks. Nick winked at the camera.</p><p>Kelly cried out, throwing his head back.</p><p>\u201cWhose name do you say?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Kelly whimpered.</p><p>Nick pounded into him harder. \u201cSay it, babe, come on. Whose name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours!\u201d Kelly shouted.</p><p>Nick rammed into him, rotating his hips to massage Kelly\u2019s prostate. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear you. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, Nick! I\u2019m going to come!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come when I tell you to. You\u2019ll come when you start screaming my fucking name.\u201d</p><p>Nick grabbed Kelly\u2019s shoulder to hold him still, slowing his thrusts so he could feel Kelly\u2019s orgasm when it came. Kelly fought against being held, but he had nowhere to go. His fingers clutched at the covers. His hips moved, desperately trying to force Nick\u2019s cock to hit his prostate again.</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d he finally pled.</p><p>Nick\u2019s voice was gruff as he tried to hold off on his own orgasm. \u201cYou want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe. Please, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking good at begging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it, baby, come on! I want it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me hear you come,\u201d Nick growled. He shoved in deep and Kelly cried out incoherently. Nick kept hitting that spot, over and over, his thrusts hard and fast, never pulling out, keeping the pressure on Kelly\u2019s prostate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNick!\u201d Kelly\u2019s back arched like a cat. His entire body spasmed. The muscles around Nick\u2019s cock squeezed, making it almost impossible for him to move. He kept going though, fucking Kelly through his orgasm as he reached under him to finally take Kelly\u2019s cock in his hand. He hadn\u2019t even fucking touched Kelly\u2019s cock, not once, but Kelly\u2019s cum was spurting against the bed. He really was coming just from taking it up the ass. God, he was fun to fuck! Nick jacked him off, causing Kelly to shout again. \u201cNick!\u201d</p><p>Nick growled. \u201cGet it all out, babe.\u201d</p><p>Kelly finally lost the ability to keep himself up, though he had the wherewithal to grab the camera before he collapsed, and he pointed it over his shoulder so it would record Nick, still buried deep inside him, still fucking him. Nick gave the camera a cheeky nod.</p> <p>He readjusted to the new position, putting both hands on Kelly\u2019s ass cheeks and pushing them apart so he could see his cock sliding in and out. It was almost like doing push-ups, except far more fun.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nick,\u201d Kelly grunted. He stretched out, holding the camera out so it would pan down the expanse of his own sweaty back and capture Nick\u2019s thick cock shoving into his ass. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got a load for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a big one, babe. Let me have it.\u201d</p><p>Nick bent over, his thrusts losing their rhythm. Kelly\u2019s moans and gasps grew louder, spurring him on until he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer\u2014and he didn\u2019t want to. He pulled out, pumping his slick cock until cum began to shoot against Kelly\u2019s ass, then shoved himself back in, shouting as the friction overwhelmed him. He laid out over Kelly, pulling him tight, gasping his name, rocking his hips as he emptied himself deep inside him.</p> <p>They were both left slick and breathless. Nick could already feel the cum dripping from Kelly\u2019s ass, being pushed back out by the tightening of his muscles around Nick\u2019s cock.</p><p>After several long moments of merely trying to breathe, Nick rolled his hips, and they both moaned. Kelly shifted beneath him.</p><p>\u201cDid you just shoot off inside me?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s so fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>Nick kissed the back of his shoulder and pushed up. \u201cI\u2019m pulling out of you now. You ready?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly nodded, but when Nick started to move, Kelly gasped and his muscles tightened. \u201cJesus Christ, are you still fucking hard in there?\u201d</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t help but laugh again. He reached for Kelly\u2019s chin, turning his head to the side to kiss him. He licked at Kelly. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly did, parting his lips so Nick could slip his tongue inside. He deepened the kiss, making it a slow, languid exploration of Kelly\u2019s lips and tongue and teeth to keep Kelly\u2019s mind off the fact that he was pulling out.</p><p>When he was free, he rolled and flopped at Kelly\u2019s side. Their feet hung off the edge of the bed. They stared at each other, neither saying anything, neither moving.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Kelly finally said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your recovery time like?\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled to his back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve never sucked cock either. I want to try that next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you say my name when I suck you off, bitch,\u201d Kelly drawled as he pulled himself closer and rested his elbow on Nick\u2019s chest. He kissed Nick and grinned. \u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>Nick rested his hands under his head, letting Kelly cuddle closer to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came inside me.\u201d He smiled and bit his lip.</p><p>Nick\u2019s body flushed even though he\u2019d just exhausted himself. It was the first time he\u2019d ever come inside someone, if he didn\u2019t count blowjobs. The thought was hotter than he\u2019d expected. His words were choked. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me so fucking hot just thinking about it,\u201d Kelly admitted.</p><p>Nick kissed him again, gripping his hair to keep him from moving away. He reached down with the other hand to grab Kelly\u2019s ass, his fingers trailing through slick cum.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>\u201cI feel it. You filled me up. I knew you had a load for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking dirty, I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even need lube next time.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes. \u201cNext time will be pretty damn soon if you keep this up.\u201d</p><p>Kelly kissed him again, dragging his teeth against Nick\u2019s lip. \u201cNext time I\u2019m going to ride you. God, your dick is fun, you know that? And I get to hold the camera too.\u201d</p><p>Nick slid his sticky hands into Kelly\u2019s hair, narrowing his eyes. Kelly\u2019s expression turned guarded, like he thought Nick might be irritated by the presence of the recording device now that he wasn\u2019t lost in the haze of lust.</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cGood call on the waterproof camera.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. He bent to kiss Nick, molding to his body as they both lay sideways on the bed. Nick held him close and Kelly settled into the crook of his arm, resting his head on Nick\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, even if it is just forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>Nick buried his face in Kelly\u2019s hair. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Irish?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me you\u2019re talking to,\u201d Kelly murmured.</p><p>Nick was silent. He finally nodded again. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly held him tighter and turned into him, closing his eyes. \u201cAll these years, and you\u2019re still a shitty liar.\u201d</p><p>Nick woke to the disturbing sound of utter silence. The room was still, the expensive hotel\u2019s infrastructure buffering the sounds from other rooms. The A/C had shut off. It took several moments for Nick to shake the confusion of finding himself in a soft, cool bed. It took him a few more to realize he was alone.</p><p>He stretched his hand out, running his fingers across the indentation in the pillow next to him.</p><p>\u201cKels?\u201d he called out. He held his breath, nerves beginning to build when there was no answer.</p><p>He sat up and pushed the sheets away, looking around the hotel room. Pillows and clothing littered the floor. The comforter was gone. One of the bedside lamps had been knocked over. Nick could feel a split in his lip where Kelly had bit him. The chaise in the corner had been used for horrible things. The only thing missing was Kelly.</p><p>Nick slid out of bed and dug through his seabag for a clean pair of jeans. He was still zipping them up when he stepped out onto the balcony to find Kelly sitting with his feet propped on the railing, wrapped in the comforter from the bed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kelly said without looking over at him.</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d bailed on me for a minute,\u201d Nick told him, smiling. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged, too busy chewing on his lip to answer.</p><p>Nick squinted out at the harbor, frowning. He couldn\u2019t see anything that might be keeping Kelly\u2019s attention. He took a step toward him, but something stopped him from moving closer. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Kelly said almost immediately, like he\u2019d been waiting for a pin to pop a balloon. He gazed up at Nick, his eyes blue and full of sorrow in the morning light. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>The words hit Nick square in the chest, stealing his breath. He realized he was staring, meeting Kelly\u2019s eyes as he tried to reconcile such a swift ending to something he\u2019d thought would be . . . permanent. He took a careful step and sat in the nearest chair, nodding and clearing his throat to try to play off his natural reaction. \u201cOkay,\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kelly whispered. He was watching Nick, turned toward him with that stupid blanket around his shoulders.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t look at him, though, not until he was sure the devastation was off his face. He nodded again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kels. Nothing to apologize for. We knew it might not work, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could do it, I really did. But you said it was nothing more than sex.\u201d Kelly paused, giving Nick a chance to speak or react. Nick couldn\u2019t find his voice. Jesus, why did this hurt so fucking much? Kelly cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s already more than that, though.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him sharply, his heart skipping.</p><p>Kelly shrugged, giving him a weak smile. \u201cWe both know how fast I fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re better off if we just stop now,\u201d Kelly said quickly. \u201cThe thought of this being something . . . frivolous? The thought of you going home and being with someone else? It kind of breaks my heart, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else,\u201d Nick repeated, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWe both know how friends with benefits work, Irish, come on.\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned forward and grabbed Kelly\u2019s hand. He swallowed past the nerves and the fear and met Kelly\u2019s changeable eyes with a deep breath. \u201cKels, I can\u2019t think of a thing under the sun that makes me happier than you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly blinked rapidly, his mouth parting in shock.</p><p>Nick held his hand tighter. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t feel right to you, you say the word and this\u2019ll be it. But if you\u2019ll give me a chance, just one chance, I swear to you I\u2019ll make it worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance at what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be yours.\u201d</p><p>Kelly tried several times to speak. He licked dry lips and said, \u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Kels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>Nick held his breath, waiting for the verdict. Kelly\u2019s lips twitched, then he began to grin. He reached out and caught Nick by the back of his neck, pulling him into an urgent kiss. Nick grabbed him by the edges of his blanket, wrapping it around them both as Kelly crawled onto the chaise lounge with him and straddled him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Nick managed to ask between kisses.</p><p>Kelly bit his lip, dragging his teeth across it before nodding. \u201cDon\u2019t ask stupid questions.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, holding him closer. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to try this, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Kelly was grinning against his lips as he nodded. \u201cDoes this mean I get to say I love you and you have to say it back?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what it means.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pressed his forehead to Nick\u2019s. \u201cI love you, Nick O\u2019Flaherty.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s heart jumped into his throat. He was grinning so widely it hurt his split lip. \u201cI love you. You crazy bastard.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
