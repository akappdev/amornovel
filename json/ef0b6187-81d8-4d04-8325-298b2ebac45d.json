I like to admire the straight line of his jaw, the curve of his cheekbone. There\u2019s an openness to his face, an innocence\u2014a certain kind of niceness. It\u2019s the niceness that touches my heart the most.</p><p>It\u2019s Friday night at Gabe Rivera\u2019s house after the lacrosse game. Our school won, so everyone is in very fine spirits, Peter most of all, because he scored the winning shot. He\u2019s across the room playing poker with some of the guys from his team; he is sitting with his chair tipped back, his back against the wall. His hair is still wet from showering after the game. I\u2019m on the couch with my friends Lucas Krapf and Pammy Subkoff, and they\u2019re flipping through the latest issue of</p><p>Teen Vogue, debating whether or not Pammy should get bangs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think, Lara Jean?\u201d Pammy asks, running her fingers through her carrot-colored hair. Pammy is a new friend\u2014I\u2019ve gotten to know her because she dates Peter\u2019s good friend Darrell. She has a face like a doll, round as a cake pan, and freckles dust her face and shoulders like sprinkles.</p><p>\u201cUm, I think bangs are a very big commitment and not to be decided on a whim. Depending on how fast your hair grows, you could be growing them out for a year or more. But if you\u2019re serious, I think you should wait till fall, because it\u2019ll be summer before you know it, and bangs in the summer can be sort of sticky and sweaty and annoying. . . .\u201d My eyes drift back to Peter, and he looks up and sees me looking at him, and raises his eyebrows questioningly. I just smile and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t get bangs?\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes in my purse. It\u2019s Peter.</p><p>Do you want to go?</p><p>No.</p><p>Then why were you staring at me?</p><p>Because I felt like it.</p><p>Lucas is reading over my shoulder. I push him away, and he shakes his head and says, \u201cAre you guys really texting each other when you\u2019re only twenty feet away?\u201d</p><p>Pammy crinkles up her nose and says, \u201cSo adorable.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to answer them when I look up and see Peter sweeping across the room toward me with purpose. \u201cTime to get my girl home,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I say. \u201cIs it that late already?\u201d Peter\u2019s hoisting me off the couch and helping me into my jacket. Then he pulls me by the hand and leads me through Gabe\u2019s living room. Looking over my shoulder, I wave and call out, \u201cBye, Lucas! Bye, Pammy!</p><p>For the record, I think you would look great with bangs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you walking so fast?\u201d I ask as Peter marches me through the front yard to the curb where his car is parked.</p><p>He stops in front of the car, pulls me toward him, and kisses me, all in one fast motion. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate on my cards when you stare at me like that, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I start to say, but he is kissing me again, his hands firm on my back.</p><p>When we\u2019re in his car, I look at the dashboard and see that it\u2019s only midnight. I say, \u201cI still have an hour until I have to be home. What should we do?\u201d</p><p>Of the people we know, I\u2019m the only one with an actual curfew. When the clock strikes one o\u2019clock, I turn into a pumpkin. Everyone is used to it by now: Peter Kavinsky\u2019s Goody Two-shoes girlfriend who has to be home by one. I\u2019ve never once minded having a curfew. Because truly, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m missing out on anything so wonderful\u2014and what\u2019s that old saying? Nothing good happens after two a.m. Unless you happen to be a fan of watching people play flip cup for hours on end. Not me. No, I\u2019d much prefer to be in my flannel pajamas with a cup of Night-Night tea and a book, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go to your house. I want to come inside and say hi to your dad and hang out for a bit. We could watch the rest of Aliens.\u201d Peter and I have been working our way down our movie list, which consists of my picks (favorite movies of mine that he\u2019s never seen), his picks, (favorite movies of his that I\u2019ve never seen), and movies neither of us have seen. Aliens was Peter\u2019s pick, and it\u2019s turning out to be quite good. And even though once upon a time Peter claimed he didn\u2019t like rom coms, he was very into Sleepless in Seattle, which I was relieved for, because I just don\u2019t see how I could be with someone who doesn\u2019t like</p><p>Sleepless in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not go home yet,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Peter thinks about it for a minute, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel, and then he says, \u201cI know where we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see,\u201d he says, and he puts the windows down, and the crisp night air fills the car.</p><p>I lean back into my seat. The streets are empty; the lights are off in most of the houses. \u201cLet me guess. We\u2019re going to the diner because you want blueberry pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. It\u2019s too late to go to Starbucks, and Biscuit Soul Food is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, food isn\u2019t the only thing I think about,\u201d he objects. Then: \u201cAre there any cookies left in that Tupperware?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all gone, but I might have some more at home, if Kitty didn\u2019t eat them all.\u201d I dip my arm out the window and let it hang. Not many more nights left like these, where it\u2019s cool enough to need a jacket.</p><p>I look at Peter\u2019s profile out of the corner of my eye. Sometimes I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s mine. The handsomest boy of all the handsome boys is mine, all mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say.</p><p>Ten minutes later, we are driving onto the University of Virginia campus, only nobody calls it campus; they call it Grounds. Peter parks along the side of the street. It\u2019s quiet for a Friday night in a college town, but it\u2019s UVA \u2019s spring break, so a lot of kids are still gone.</p><p>We\u2019re walking across the lawn, his hand in mine, when I\u2019m hit with a sudden wave of panic. I stop short and ask, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad luck for me to come here before I\u2019m actually in, do you?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a wedding. You\u2019re not marrying UVA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say, you\u2019re already in.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave a verbal commitment to the UVA lacrosse team last year, and then he applied early action in the fall. Like with most college athletes, he was all but in, so long as his grades stayed decent. When he got the official yes back in January, his mom threw a party for him and I baked a cake that said, I\u2019m taking my talents to UVA in yellow frosting.</p><p>Peter pulls me by the hand and says, \u201cCome on, Covey. We make our own luck. Besides, we were here two months ago for that thing at the Miller Center.\u201d</p><p>I relax. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>We continue our walk across the lawn. I know where we\u2019re going now. To the Rotunda, to sit on the steps. The Rotunda was designed by Thomas Jefferson, who founded the school, and he modeled it after the Pantheon, with its white columns and big domed top. Peter runs up the brick</p><p>steps Rocky-style and plops down. I sit down in front of him, leaning back and resting my arms on the tops of his knees. \u201cDid you know,\u201d I begin, \u201cthat one of the things that makes UVA unique is that the center of the school, right there inside the Rotunda, is a library and not a church? It\u2019s because Jefferson believed in the separation between school and church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you read that in the brochure?\u201d Peter teases, planting a kiss on my neck.</p><p>Dreamily, I say, \u201cI learned it when I went on the tour last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you went on a tour. Why would you go on a tour when you\u2019re from here? You\u2019ve been here a million times!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right that I\u2019ve been here a million times\u2014I grew up going here with my family. When my mom was still alive, we\u2019d go see the Hullabahoos perform because my mom loved a cappella. We had our family portrait taken on the lawn. On sunny days after church, we\u2019d come picnic out here.</p><p>I twist around to look at Peter. \u201cI went on the tour because I wanted to know everything about UVA! Stuff I wouldn\u2019t know just by living around here. Like, do you know what year they let women in?\u201d</p><p>He scratches the back of his neck. \u201cUh . . . I don\u2019t know. When was the school founded? The early 1800s? So, 1920?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. 1970.\u201d I turn back around and face forward, looking out onto the grounds. \u201cAfter a hundred and fifty years.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, Peter says, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s crazy. Okay, tell me more facts about UVA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUVA is America\u2019s only collegiate World Heritage UNESCO site in all of the United States,\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, don\u2019t tell me more facts about UVA,\u201d Peter says, and I slap him on the knee. \u201cTell me something else instead. Tell me what you\u2019re looking forward to most about going to school here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go first. What are you most excited about?\u201d</p><p>Right away, Peter says, \u201cThat\u2019s easy. Streaking the lawn with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re looking forward to more than anything? Running around naked?\u201d Hastily I add, \u201cI\u2019m never doing that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a UVA tradition. I thought you were all about UVA traditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d He leans forward and puts his arms around my shoulders, rubbing his nose in my neck the way he likes to do. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I let myself dream about it for a minute. If I get in, what am I most looking forward to? There are so many things, I can hardly name them all. I\u2019m looking forward to eating waffles every day with Peter in the dining hall. To us sledding down O-Hill when it snows. To picnics when it\u2019s warm. To staying up all night talking and then waking up and talking some more. To late-night laundry and last-minute road trips. To . . . everything. Finally I say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay . . .</p><p>I guess I\u2019m most looking forward to . . . to going to the McGregor Room whenever I want.\u201d People call it the Harry Potter room, because of the rugs and chandeliers and leather chairs and the portraits on the wall. The bookshelves go from the floor to the ceiling, and all of the books are behind metal grates, protected like the precious objects they are. It\u2019s a room from a different time. It\u2019s very hushed\u2014reverential, even. There was this one summer\u2014I must have been five or six, because it was before Kitty was born\u2014my mom took a class at UVA, and she used to study in the McGregor Room. Margot and I would color, or read. My mom called it the magic library, because Margot and I never fought inside of it. We were both quiet as church mice; we were so in awe of all the books, and of the older kids studying.</p><p>Peter looks disappointed. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because he thought I would name something having to do with him. With us. But for some reason, I want to keep those hopes just for me for now.</p><p>\u201cYou can come with me to the McGregor Room,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you have to promise to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Affectionately Peter says, \u201cLara Jean, only you would look forward to hanging out in a library.\u201d</p><p>Actually, judging by Pinterest alone, I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of people would look forward to hanging out in such a beautiful library. Just not people Peter knows. He thinks I\u2019m so quirky. I\u2019m not planning on being the one to break the</p><p>news to him that I\u2019m actually not that quirky, that in fact lots of people like to stay home and bake cookies and scrapbook and hang out in libraries. Most of them are probably in their fifties, but still. I like the way he looks at me, like I am a wood nymph that he happened upon one day and just had to take home to keep.</p><p>Peter pulls his phone out of his hoodie pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s twelve thirty. We should go soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d I sigh. I like being here late at night. It feels like the whole place is ours.</p><p>In my heart, it was always UVA. I\u2019ve never really expected to go anywhere else, or even really thought about it. I was going to apply early when Peter did, but my guidance counselor, Mrs. Duvall, advised me against applying early action, because she said it would be better to wait so they could see my senior mid-year grades. According to Mrs. Duvall, it\u2019s always best to apply at your peak moment.</p><p>And so I ended up applying to five schools. At first it was just going to be UVA, the hardest to get into and only fifteen minutes from home; William and Mary, the second hardest to get into and also my second choice (two hours away); and then University of Richmond and James Madison, both only an hour away, in a tie for third choice. All in state. But then Mrs. Duvall urged me to apply to just one out-of-state school, just in case, just to have the option\u2014so I applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It\u2019s really hard to get into out-of-states, but I picked it because it reminds me of UVA. It has a strong liberal arts program, and it\u2019s not too far away, close enough to come home in a hurry if I needed to.</p><p>But if I had the choice, I would still pick UVA every time. I\u2019ve never wanted to be far from home. I\u2019m not like my big sister. Going far away, that was her dream. She\u2019s always wanted the world. I just want home, and for me, UVA is home, which is why it\u2019s the college I\u2019ve measured all other colleges against. The perfect storybook campus, the perfect everything. And, of course, Peter.</p><p>We stay a bit longer, me telling Peter more facts about UVA and Peter making fun of me for knowing so many facts about UVA</p><p>. Then he drives me home. It\u2019s nearly one a.m. when we pull up in front of my house. The downstairs lights are all off, but my dad\u2019s bedroom light is on. He never goes to bed until I\u2019m home. I\u2019m about to hop out when Peter reaches across me and stops me from opening the door. \u201cGive me my good-night kiss,\u201d he says.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cPeter! I have to go.\u201d</p><p>Stubbornly he closes his eyes and waits, and I lean forward and plant a quick kiss on his lips. \u201cThere. Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kisses me again like we have all the time in the world and says, \u201cWhat would happen if I came back after everyone went to sleep, and I spent the night, and left really early in the morning? Like, before dawn?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I say, \u201cYou can\u2019t, so we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I agree. \u201cBut he\u2019d be pretty disappointed in me. And he\u2019d be mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if we got caught,\u201d Peter says, but it\u2019s halfhearted. He won\u2019t risk it either. He\u2019s too careful about staying in my dad\u2019s good graces. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m really looking forward to the most?\u201d He gives my braid a tug before saying, \u201cNot having to say good night. I hate saying good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re at college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, and I kiss him one more time before jumping out of the car and running toward my house. On the way, I look up at the moon, at all the stars that cover the night sky like a blanket, and I make a wish.</p><p>Dear God, please, please let me get into UVA </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSHOULD I DUST MARIE\u2019S WIG</p><p>with pink glitter or gold glitter?\u201d I hold up an Easter egg to my computer screen for Margot\u2019s inspection. I\u2019ve dyed the shell pale turquoise blue and decoupaged it with a cameo of Marie Antoinette.</p><p>\u201cHold it up closer,\u201d Margot says, squinting into the camera. She\u2019s in her pajamas; a sheet mask clings to her face. Her hair has grown just past her shoulders, which means she\u2019ll probably cut it soon. I have a feeling she\u2019ll always keep her hair short now. It really suits her.</p> <p>It\u2019s night in Scotland, and still afternoon here. We are five hours and 3,500 miles apart. She\u2019s in her dorm room; I\u2019m sitting at our kitchen table, surrounded by Easter eggs and bowls of dye and rhinestones and stickers and fluffy white feathers that I saved from when I made Christmas ornaments a few years ago. I\u2019ve got my laptop propped up on a stack of cookbooks. Margot\u2019s keeping me company while I finish decorating my eggs. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do a pearl border around her, if that helps inform your decision,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cThen I say go with the pink,\u201d she says, adjusting her sheet mask. \u201cPink will pop more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking too,\u201d I say, and I get to work</p><p>dusting glitter with an old eye-shadow brush. Last night I spent hours blowing the yolks out of the shells. This was supposed to be a fun thing for Kitty and me to do together like the old days, but she bailed when she was invited over to Madeline Klinger\u2019s house. An invitation from Madeline Klinger is a rare and momentous occasion, so of course I couldn\u2019t begrudge Kitty that.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little while longer before you find out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometime this month.\u201d I start lining up pearls in a row. Part of me wishes I could just get this over with, but another part of me is glad to have this time of not knowing, of still hoping.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get in,\u201d Margot says, and it\u2019s like a proclamation. Everyone around me seems to think that my getting into</p><p>UVA</p><p>is a foregone conclusion. Peter, Kitty, Margot, my dad. My guidance counselor, Mrs. Duvall. I\u2019d never dare say it out loud, for fear of jinxing anything, but maybe I think so too. I\u2019ve worked hard: I got my</p><p>SAT</p><p>scores up by two hundred points. My grades are almost as good as Margot\u2019s were, and Margot got in. I\u2019ve done everything I\u2019m supposed to do, but will it be enough? At this point, all I can do is wait, and hope. And hope and hope.</p><p>I\u2019m in the middle of hot-gluing a little white bow to the top of my egg when I stop to cast a suspicious look at my sister. \u201cWait a minute. If I get in, are you going to try to convince me to go somewhere else, just so I can spread my wings?\u201d</p> <p>Margot laughs, and her sheet mask slips down her face. Readjusting it, she says, \u201cNo. I trust you to know what\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>She means it, I can tell. Just like that, her words make it so. I trust me too. I trust that when the time comes, I will know what\u2019s best. And for me,</p><p>UVA</p><p>is best. I know it. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll say is, make your own friends. Peter will be making tons of friends because of lacrosse, and the people he\u2019ll be friends with aren\u2019t necessarily the kinds of people you\u2019d pick to be friends with. So make your own friends. Find your people.</p><p>UVA</p><p>is big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise.</p><p>\u201cAnd make sure you join the Asian association. The one thing I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on by going to school in a different country is an Asian-American group. It\u2019s definitely a thing, you know, going to college and finding your racial identity. Like Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim Monahan, from my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,</p><p>Tim</p><p>,\u201d I say. Tim Monahan is Korean, and he was adopted. There aren\u2019t all that many Asian people at our school, so we all know who each other are, at least tangentially.</p><p>\u201cHe never hung out with Asians in high school, and then he went to Tech and met a ton of Korean people, and now I think he\u2019s the president of an Asian fraternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Greek life isn\u2019t a thing in the</p><p>UK</p><p>. You\u2019re not going to join a sorority, are you?\u201d She is quick to add, \u201cNo judgment if so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter will probably join a fraternity, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything about it either. . . .\u201d Even though he hasn\u2019t mentioned it, I could easily picture Peter in a fraternity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s hard if your boyfriend\u2019s in one and you\u2019re not. Something about all the mixers and stuff, like it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re friends with the girls from the sister sorority. I don\u2019t know. The whole thing seems silly to me, but it could be worth it. I hear sorority girls like to craft.\u201d She waggles her eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which.\u201d I hold up my egg for her. \u201cTa-da!\u201d</p><p>Margot moves closer to the camera to look. \u201cYou should go into the egg-decorating business! I want to see the other ones.\u201d</p><p>I hold up the egg carton. I\u2019ve got a dozen blown-out eggs, pale pink with neon pink rickrack trim, brilliant blue and lemon yellow, lavender with dried lavender buds. I was glad to have an excuse to use that dried lavender. I bought a sack of it months ago for a lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and it\u2019s just been taking up space in our pantry.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with them?\u201d Margot asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing them over to Belleview so they can put them on display in the reception area. It always looks so dreary and hospitaly there.\u201d</p><p>Margot leans back against her pillows. \u201cHow is everyone at Belleview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ve been so busy with college apps and senior year stuff, I haven\u2019t been able to go by as much as I used to. Now</p><p>that I don\u2019t officially work there anymore, it\u2019s a lot harder to find the time.\u201d I spin the egg in my hand. \u201cI think I\u2019ll give this one to Stormy. It\u2019s very her.\u201d I set the Marie Antoinette egg down on the rack to dry, and I pick up a lilac egg and begin affixing it with candy-colored gemstones. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit more, from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Margot agrees. \u201cWhen I come home for spring break, let\u2019s go over there together. I want to introduce Ravi to Stormy.\u201d</p><p>Ravi is Margot\u2019s boyfriend of six months. His parents are from India, but he was born in London, so his accent is as posh as you might imagine. When I met him over Skype, I said, \u201cYou sound just like Prince William,\u201d and he laughed and said, \u201cCheers.\u201d He\u2019s two years older than Margot, and maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s older, or maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s English, but he seems very sophisticated and not at all like Josh. Not in a snobby way, but definitely different. More cultured, probably from living in such a grand city, and going to the theater whenever he wants, and meeting dignitaries and the like because his mother is a diplomat. When I told Margot that, she laughed and said it\u2019s just because I haven\u2019t gotten to know him yet, but Ravi\u2019s actually a huge nerd and not at all smooth or Prince Williamish. \u201cDon\u2019t let the accent fool you,\u201d she said. She\u2019s bringing Ravi home with her over spring break, so I suppose I\u2019ll see for myself soon enough. The plan is for Ravi to stay at our house for two nights and then fly to Texas to see relatives. Margot will stay here with us for the rest of the week.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet him in real life,\u201d I say, and she beams.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure I will. I like everyone Margot likes, but the truly lucky thing is that now that Margot\u2019s gotten to know Peter better, she sees how special he is. When Ravi\u2019s here, all four of us will be able to hang out, true double dates.</p><p>My sister and I are both in love at the same time, and we have this thing we can share, and how wonderful is that! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE NEXT MORNING, I PUT</p><p>on the poppy-colored lipstick Stormy likes me in, gather up my Easter eggs in a white wicker basket, and drive over to Belleview. I stop at the reception desk to drop off the eggs and chat with Shanice for a bit. I ask her what\u2019s new, and she says there are two new volunteers, both</p><p>UVA</p><p>students, which makes me feel a lot less guilty about not coming around as much.</p> <p>I say good-bye to Shanice and then head over to Stormy\u2019s with my Easter egg. She answers the door in a persimmon-colored kimono and lipstick to match and cries out, \u201cLara Jean!\u201d After she sweeps me into a hug, she frets, \u201cYou\u2019re looking at my roots, aren\u2019t you? I know I need to dye my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely tell,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>She\u2019s very excited about her Marie Antoinette egg; she says she can\u2019t wait to show it off to Alicia Ito, her friend and rival. \u201cDid you bring one for Alicia, too?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cJust you,\u201d I tell her, and her pale eyes gleam.</p><p>We sit on her couch, and she wags her finger at me and says, \u201cYou must be completely moonstruck over your young man since you\u2019ve barely had time to visit with me.\u201d</p><p>Contritely I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll come visit more now that college applications are in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><p>The best way to deal with Stormy when she\u2019s like this is to charm and cajole her. \u201cI\u2019m only doing what you told me, Stormy.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head to the side. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to go on lots of dates and lots of adventures, just like you did.\u201d</p><p>She purses her orangey-red lips, trying not to smile. \u201cWell, that was very good advice I gave you. You just keep listening to Stormy, and you\u2019ll be right as rain. Now, tell me something juicy.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cMy life isn\u2019t that juicy.\u201d</p><p>She tsks me. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any dances coming up? When\u2019s prom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get a move on it. You don\u2019t want some other girl wearing your dress, dear.\u201d She studies my face. \u201cWith your complexion, I think you ought to wear pink.\u201d Then her eyes light up and she snaps her fingers. \u201cThat reminds me! There\u2019s something I want to give you.\u201d Stormy hops up and goes to her bedroom and she returns with a heavy velvet ring box.</p><p>I open the box and let out a gasp. It\u2019s her pink diamond ring! The one from the veteran who lost his leg in the war. \u201cStormy, I can\u2019t accept this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you will. You\u2019re just the girl to wear it.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I take the ring out and put it on my left hand, and</p><p>oh, how it sparkles. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful! But I really shouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, darling.\u201d Storm winks at me. \u201cHeed my advice, Lara Jean. Never say no when you really want to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014yes! Thank you, Stormy! I promise I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me on the cheek. \u201cI know you will, dear.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I get home, I put it in my jewelry box for safekeeping.</p><p>* *</p><p>Later that day, I\u2019m in the kitchen with Kitty and Peter, waiting for my chocolate chip cookies to cool. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been on a quest to perfect my chocolate chip cookie recipe, and Peter and Kitty have been my steadfast passengers on the journey. Kitty prefers a flat, lacy kind of chocolate chip cookie, while Peter likes his chewy. My perfect cookie is a combination of the two. Crunchy but soft. Light brown, not pale in color or flavor. A little height but not puffy. That\u2019s the cookie I\u2019ve been searching for.</p><p>I\u2019ve read all the blog posts, seen the pictures of all white sugar versus a mix of brown and white, of baking soda versus baking powder, vanilla bean versus vanilla extract, chip versus chunk versus chopped bars. I\u2019ve tried freezing in balls, flattening cookies with the bottom of a glass to get an even spread. I\u2019ve frozen dough in a log and sliced; I\u2019ve scooped, then frozen. Frozen, then scooped. And yet, still, my cookies rise too much.</p><p>This time I used considerably less baking soda, but the cookies are still vaguely puffy, and I am ready to throw the</p><p>entire batch out for not being perfect. Of course I don\u2019t\u2014that would be a waste of good ingredients. Instead I say to Kitty, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you got in trouble for talking during silent reading last week?\u201d She nods. \u201cTake these to your teacher and tell her you baked them and you\u2019re sorry.\u201d I\u2019m running low on people to give my cookies to. I\u2019ve already given some to the mailman, Kitty\u2019s bus driver, the nurses\u2019 station at Daddy\u2019s hospital.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do when you figure it out?\u201d Kitty asks me, her mouth full of cookie.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s the point of all this?\u201d Peter says. \u201cI mean, who cares if a chocolate chip cookie is eight percent better? It\u2019s still a chocolate chip cookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take pleasure in the knowledge that I am in possession of the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. I will pass it down to the next generation of Song girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr boys,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cOr boys,\u201d I agree. To her I say, \u201cNow go upstairs and get a big Mason jar for me to put these cookies in. And a ribbon.\u201d</p><p>Peter asks, \u201cWill you bring some to school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say, because I want to see him make that pouty face I love so much. He makes the face, and I reach up and pat his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re such a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d he says, snagging another cookie. \u201cLet\u2019s get the movie started. I promised my mom I would stop by the store and help her move some furniture around.\u201d Peter\u2019s mom owns an antiques store called Linden &amp; White, and Peter helps her out as much as he can.</p><p>Today\u2019s movie off our list is</p><p>Romeo + Juliet</p><p>, the 1996 version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Kitty\u2019s already seen it a dozen or so times, I\u2019ve seen bits and pieces, and Peter\u2019s never seen it at all.</p><p>Kitty drags her beanbag cushion downstairs and arranges herself on the floor with a bag of microwave popcorn beside her. Our wheaten terrier mix Jamie Fox-Pickle immediately plants himself next to her, no doubt hoping for a falling popcorn crumb. Peter and I are on the couch, cuddled under a sheep\u2019s-wool blanket that Margot sent from Scotland.</p><p>From the moment Leo comes on screen in that navy blue suit, I have chest palpitations. He\u2019s like an angel, a beautiful, damaged angel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he so stressed out about?\u201d Peter asks, reaching down and stealing a handful of Kitty\u2019s popcorn. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a prince or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a prince,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s just rich. And his family is very powerful in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my dream guy,\u201d Kitty says in a proprietary tone.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s all grown up now,\u201d I say, not taking my eyes off the screen. \u201cHe\u2019s practically Daddy\u2019s age.\u201d Still . . .</p><p>\u201cWait, I thought</p><p>I</p><p>was your dream guy,\u201d Peter says. Not to me, to Kitty. He knows he\u2019s not my dream guy. My dream guy is Gilbert Blythe from</p><p>Anne of Green Gables</p><p>. Handsome, loyal, smart in school.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cYou\u2019re like my brother.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks genuinely wounded, so I pat him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s a little scrawny?\u201d Peter presses.</p><p>I shush him.</p><p>He crosses his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t get why you guys get to talk during movies and I get shushed. It\u2019s pretty bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our house,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cYour sister shushes me at my house too!\u201d</p><p>We ignore him in unison.</p><p>In the play, Romeo and Juliet were only thirteen. In the movie they\u2019re more like seventeen or eighteen. Definitely still teens. How did they know they were meant to be? Just one look across a bathroom fish tank was all it took? They knew it was a love worth dying for? Because they do know. They believe. I guess the difference is, in those times people got married so much younger than they do now. Realistically, till death do us part probably only meant, like, fifteen or twenty years, because people didn\u2019t live as long back then.</p><p>But when their eyes meet across that fish tank . . . when Romeo goes to her balcony and professes his love . . . I can\u2019t help it. I believe too. Even though, I know, they barely know each other, and their story is over before it even truly begins, and the real part would have been in the everyday, in the choosing to be with each other despite all the hardships. Still, I think they could have made it work, if they had only lived.</p><p>As the credits roll, tears roll down my cheeks and even Peter looks sad; but unsentimental, dry-eyed little Kitty just hops up and says she\u2019s taking Jamie Fox-Pickle outside to</p><p>pee. Off they go, and meanwhile I\u2019m still lost in my emotions on the couch, wiping tears from my eyes. \u201cThey had such a good meet-cute,\u201d I croak.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a meet-cute?\u201d Peter\u2019s lying on his side now, his head propped up on his elbow. He looks so adorable I could pinch his cheeks, but I refrain from saying so. His head is big enough as it is.</p><p>\u201cA meet-cute is when the hero and heroine meet for the very first time, and it\u2019s always in a charming way. It\u2019s how you know they\u2019re going to end up together. The cuter the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in</p><p>Terminator</p><p>, when Reese saves Sarah Connor from the Terminator and he says, \u2018Come with me if you want to live.\u2019 Freaking amazing line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure, I guess that\u2019s technically a meet-cute. . . . I was thinking more like</p><p>It Happened One Night</p><p>. We should add that to our list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that in color or black-and-white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack-and-white.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans and falls back against the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t have a meet-cute,\u201d I muse.</p><p>\u201cYou jumped me in the hallway at school. I think that\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we already knew each other, so it doesn\u2019t really count.\u201d I frown. \u201cWe don\u2019t even remember how we met. How sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember meeting you for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh. Liar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey just because you don\u2019t remember something doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t. I remember a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so how did we meet?\u201d I challenge. I\u2019m sure that whatever comes out of his mouth next will be a lie.</p><p>Peter opens his mouth, then snaps it shut. \u201cI\u2019m not telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee! You just can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t deserve to know, because you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cSo full of it.\u201d</p><p>After I turn off the movie, Peter and I go sit on the front porch, drinking sweet tea I made the night before. It\u2019s cool out; there\u2019s still enough bite in the air to let you know it isn\u2019t quite full-on spring yet, but soon. The dogwood tree in our front yard is just beginning to flower. There is a nice breeze. I think I could sit here all afternoon and watch the branches sway and bow and the leaves dance.</p><p>We still have a little time before he has to go help his mom. I would go with him, mind the register while he moves around furniture, but the last time Peter brought me, his mom frowned and said her store was a place of business, not a \u201cteenage hangout.\u201d Peter\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t outwardly dislike me, and I don\u2019t even think she inwardly dislikes me\u2014but she still hasn\u2019t forgiven me for breaking up with Peter last year. She\u2019s kind to me, but there\u2019s this distrust, this wariness. It\u2019s a let\u2019s-wait-and-see kind of feeling\u2014let\u2019s wait and see when you hurt my son again. I\u2019d always imagined I would have a great, Ina Garten\u2013type relationship with my first boyfriend\u2019s mom. The two of us cooking dinner</p><p>together, sharing tea and sympathy, playing Scrabble on a rainy afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Peter asks me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my lower lip. \u201cI wish your mom liked me better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d I give him a look.</p><p>\u201cShe does! If she didn\u2019t like you, she wouldn\u2019t invite you over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe invites me over for dinner because she wants to see you, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntrue.\u201d I can tell this thought has never occurred to him, but it has the ring of truth and he knows it.</p><p>\u201cShe wishes we\u2019d break up before we leave for college,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>\u201cSo does your sister.\u201d</p><p>I crow, \u201cHa! So you\u2019re admitting your mom wants us to break up!\u201d I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m being so triumphant about. The thought is depressing, even if I already suspected it.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks getting serious when you\u2019re young is a bad idea. It has nothing to do with you. I told her, just because it didn\u2019t work out with you and Dad, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be like that for us. I\u2019m nothing like my dad. And you\u2019re nothing like my mom.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s parents got divorced when he was in sixth grade. His dad lives about thirty minutes away, with his new wife and two young sons. When it comes to his dad, Peter doesn\u2019t say much. It\u2019s rare for him to even bring him up, but this</p><p>year, out of the blue, his dad has been trying to reconnect with him\u2014inviting him to a basketball game, over to his house for dinner. So far Peter\u2019s been a stone wall.</p><p>\u201cDoes your dad look like you?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, do you look like him?\u201d</p><p>Sullenly he says, \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what people always say.\u201d</p><p>I put my head on his shoulder. \u201cThen he must be very handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the day, I guess,\u201d he concedes. \u201cI\u2019m taller than him now.\u201d</p><p>This is a thing that Peter and I have in common\u2014he only has a mom and I only have a dad. He thinks I got the better end of the deal, losing a mom who loved me versus a dad who is alive but a dirtbag. His words, not mine. Part of me agrees with him, because I have so many good memories of Mommy, and he has hardly any of his dad.</p><p>I loved how after a bath, I would sit cross-legged in front of her and watch</p><p>TV</p><p>while she combed the tangles out of my hair. I remember Margot used to hate to sit still for it, but I didn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s the kind of memory I like best\u2014more of a feeling than an actual remembrance. The hum of a memory, blurry around the edges, soft and nothing particularly special, all kind of blending into one moment. Another memory like that is when we\u2019d drop Margot off at piano lessons, and Mommy and I would have secret ice cream sundaes in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. Caramel and strawberry sauce; she\u2019d give me her peanuts so I had extra. Once I asked her why she didn\u2019t like nuts on her sundae,</p><p>and she said she did like them, but I</p><p>loved</p><p>them. And she loved me.</p><p>But despite all of these good memories, memories I wouldn\u2019t trade for anything, I know that even if my mom was a dirtbag, I\u2019d rather have her here with me than not. One day, I hope Peter will feel that way about his dad.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about now?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter sets down his glass and stretches out and rests his head in my lap. Looking up at me, he says, \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would\u2019ve really liked you,\u201d I say, touching his hair. Hesitantly, I ask, \u201cDo you think I might get to meet your dad some day?\u201d</p><p>A cloud passes over his face, and I wish I hadn\u2019t brought it up. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to meet him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Then he snuggles closer to me. \u201cHey, maybe we should go as Romeo and Juliet for Halloween this year. People at</p><p>UVA</p><p>go all out for Halloween.\u201d</p><p>I lean back against the post. He\u2019s changing the subject, and I know it but I play along. \u201cSo we\u2019d be going as the Leo and Claire version of Romeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tugs on my braid. \u201cI\u2019ll be your knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>I touch his hair. \u201cWould you be willing to consider growing your hair out a little bit? And maybe . . . dyeing it blond? Otherwise people might think you\u2019re just a knight.\u201d</p><p>Peter is laughing so hard I doubt he hears the rest of my</p><p>sentence. \u201cOh my God, Covey. Why are you so hilarious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking!\u201d Half joking. \u201cBut you know I take costuming seriously. Why bother doing something if you\u2019re only going to do it halfway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I would maybe wear a wig, but I\u2019m not promising anything. It\u2019ll be our first</p><p>UVA</p><p>Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to</p><p>UVA</p><p>for Halloween before.\u201d The first fall Margot got her driver\u2019s license, we took Kitty trick-or-treating on the lawn. She was Batman that year. I wonder if she might like to do that again.</p><p>\u201cI mean we\u2019ll finally be able to go to</p><p>UVA</p><p>Halloween parties. Like, legit go to them and not have to sneak in. Sophomore year me and Gabe got kicked out of an</p><p>SAE</p><p>party and it was the most embarrassing moment of my life.\u201d</p><p>I look at him in surprise. \u201cYou? You\u2019re never embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was that day. I was trying to talk to this girl who was dressed up in a Cleopatra costume and these older guys were like, \u2018Get your ass out of here, scrub,\u2019 and she and her friends laughed. Jerks.\u201d</p><p>I lean down and kiss him on both cheeks. \u201cI would never laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou laugh at me all the time,\u201d he says. He lifts his head up and pulls my face closer and we are kissing an upside-down Spider-Man type of kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I laugh at you,\u201d I say, and, smiling, he shrugs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S THE FIRST DAY OF</p><p>senior week, and during Senior Week, every day there\u2019s a theme. Today\u2019s theme is school spirit, and I\u2019m wearing Peter\u2019s lacrosse jersey and pigtails with yarn ribbons in our school colors, light blue and white. Peter has painted his face half blue and half white. When he picked me up this morning, I screamed when I saw him.</p><p>The rest of the week goes: Tuesday seventies day, Wednesday pajamas day, Thursday characters day (the day I am truly looking forward to), and Friday we\u2019re off on our senior trip. The vote was between New York City and Disney World, and New York won. We\u2019re driving up on a charter bus for the three-day weekend. It\u2019s perfect timing for a trip like this, because the seniors are going crazy waiting to hear from colleges and we could all use a distraction. Except for those of us who applied early decision and already know where they\u2019re going, like Peter, and Lucas Krapf, who\u2019s going to Sarah Lawrence. The majority of my class will stay in state. It\u2019s like our guidance counselor, Mrs. Duvall, is always saying: What\u2019s the point of living in Virginia if not to take advantage of all the great state schools? I think it\u2019s nice that so many of us will still be here in Virginia, that we aren\u2019t scattering off to the four corners of the earth.</p> <p>At lunchtime, when Peter and I walk into the cafeteria, the a cappella group is serenading a junior girl with the song \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\u201d but with the words \u201cWill You Go to Prom with Me, Gina?\u201d We stop and listen before we get in line for our food. Prom isn\u2019t for another few months, but promposals have already started in earnest. So far the most impressive was last week, when Steve Bledell hacked into the announcements board and replaced the day\u2019s events with</p><p>Will you go to prom with me, Liz?</p><p>and it took two days for the</p><p>IT</p> <p>department to figure out how to fix it. Just this morning, Darrell filled Pammy\u2019s locker with red roses, and he spelled out</p><p>PROM</p><p>?</p><p>in petals on the door. The janitor yelled at him for it, but the pictures look amazing on Pammy\u2019s Instagram. I don\u2019t know what Peter\u2019s planning. He\u2019s not exactly one for big romantic gestures.</p><p>When we\u2019re in line for food, Peter reaches for a brownie and I say, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014I brought cookies,\u201d and he gets excited.</p><p>\u201cCan I have one now?\u201d he asks. I pull my Tupperware out of my bag and Peter grabs one. \u201cLet\u2019s not share with anybody else,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d I say, because our friends have spotted us.</p><p>Darrell is singing, \u201cHer cookies bring all the boys to the yard,\u201d as we walk up to the table. I set the Tupperware down on the table and the boys wrestle for it, snatching cookies and gobbling them up like trolls.</p><p>Pammy manages to snag one and says, \u201cY\u2019all are beasts.\u201d</p><p>Darrell throws his head back and makes a beastlike sound, and she giggles.</p><p>\u201cThese are amazing,\u201d Gabe groans, licking chocolate off his fingers.</p><p>Modestly I say, \u201cThey\u2019re all right. Good, but not amazing. Not perfect.\u201d I break a piece off of Peter\u2019s cookie. \u201cThey taste better fresh out of the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please come over to my house and bake me cookies so I know what they taste like fresh out of the oven?\u201d Gabe bites into another one and closes his eyes in ecstasy.</p><p>Peter snags one. \u201cStop eating all my girlfriend\u2019s cookies!\u201d Even a year later, it still gives me a little thrill to hear him say \u201cmy girlfriend\u201d and know that I\u2019m her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get a gut if you don\u2019t quit with that shit,\u201d Darrell says.</p><p>Peter takes a bite of cookie and lifts up his shirt and pats his stomach. \u201cSix-pack, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky girl, Large,\u201d Gabe says.</p><p>Darrell shakes his head. \u201cNah, Kavinsky\u2019s the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>Peter catches my eye and winks, and my heart beats quicker.</p><p>I have a feeling that when I\u2019m Stormy\u2019s age, these everyday moments will be what I remember: Peter\u2019s head bent, biting into a chocolate chip cookie; the sun coming through the cafeteria window, bouncing off his brown hair; him looking at me.</p><p>After school, Peter has lacrosse practice, and I sit in the stands and do my homework. Of all the guys on the team, Peter is the only one going to a division one school, and Coach White is already crying about what the team will</p><p>look like when Peter\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t understand all the ins and outs of the game, but I know when to cheer and when to boo. I just like to watch him play. He thinks every shot he takes will go in, and they usually do.</p><p>* *</p><p>Daddy and Ms. Rothschild are, officially, a couple, and they have been since last September. Kitty\u2019s over the moon; she takes credit for it at every opportunity. \u201cIt was all a part of my master plan,\u201d she brags. I\u2019ll give it to her. The girl does have vision. After all, she got Peter and me back together against all the odds, and now we\u2019re in love.</p><p>For not having a lot in common, Ms. Rothschild and Daddy are a surprisingly good couple. (Again, not unlike Peter and me.) Proximity really does make all the difference. Two lonely neighbors, Netflix, a couple of dogs, a bottle of white wine. If you ask me, it\u2019s lovely. Daddy has way more of a life now that Ms. Rothschild\u2019s in it. They\u2019re always going places together, doing actual activities. Like on a Saturday morning, before any of us are awake, they\u2019ll go hiking and watch the sun rise. I\u2019ve never known Daddy to hike, but he\u2019s taken to it like a fish to water. They go out to dinner; they go to wineries; they meet up with Ms. Rothschild\u2019s friends. Sure, he still likes to stay in and watch a documentary, but his world is so much more with her in it\u2014and so much less lonely, which I never knew he was, these eight long years since Mommy died. But he must have been, now that I see him so energized and so out and about. Ms. Rothschild eats with us at least a few times a week, and it\u2019s gotten to where it</p><p>feels strange to not see her sitting there at the kitchen table, with her rich, throaty laugh and her glass of white wine next to Daddy\u2019s glass of beer.</p><p>After dinner that night, when I bring out cookies and ice cream for dessert, Daddy says, \u201cMore cookies?\u201d and he and Ms. Rothschild exchange a meaningful look. Spreading vanilla ice cream on a cookie with a spoon, Daddy says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing a lot of baking lately. You must be pretty stressed waiting on those college acceptance letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with that,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to perfect my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Just be grateful, you guys.\u201d</p><p>Daddy begins, \u201cYou know, I read a study that found that baking is actually therapeutic. It\u2019s something to do with the repetition of measuring ingredients, and creativity. Psychologists call it behavioral activation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, whatever works,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says, breaking a piece of cookie off and popping it into her mouth. \u201cI go to SoulCycle; that\u2019s where I find my center.\u201d If Margot were here, she\u2019d roll her eyes at that. Ms. Rothschild made me go with her once\u2014I kept losing the beat and trying to find it again but to no avail. \u201cLara Jean, you\u2019ve got to come with me again. There\u2019s a great new instructor who plays all Motown music. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I go with you, Tree?\u201d Kitty asks. That\u2019s what Kitty\u2019s taken to calling Ms. Rothschild. I still think of her as Ms. Rothschild, and I slip up from time to time, but I try to call her Trina to her face when I remember.</p><p>\u201cYou can come with me when you\u2019re twelve,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the rules of SoulCycle.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to believe that Kitty is eleven already. Kitty is eleven and I\u2019ll be eighteen in May. Time goes by so quickly. I look across the table at Daddy, who is looking at Kitty with a sad kind of smile, and then at me. I know he must be thinking the same thing.</p><p>He catches my eye and sings, \u201cLara Jean, don\u2019t you worry \u2019bout a thing,\u201d in his best Stevie Wonder voice, and we all groan. Biting into his makeshift ice cream sandwich, Daddy says, \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard; everything will turn out the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in the world that</p><p>UVA</p><p>would ever say no to you,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says.</p><p>\u201cKnock on wood,\u201d Kitty says, rapping the kitchen table with her knuckle. To me she says, \u201cYou knock too.\u201d</p><p>Dutifully I knock on the table. \u201cWhat does knock on wood even mean?\u201d</p><p>Daddy perks up. \u201cActually, it\u2019s thought to come from Greek mythology. According to Greek myths, dryads lived in trees, and people would invoke them for protection. Hence knocking on wood: just that added bit of protection so as not to tempt fate.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s Ms. Rothschild, Kitty, and me exchanging a look. Daddy\u2019s so square, and Ms. Rothschild seems so young compared to him, even though he\u2019s not that much older than her. And yet it works.</p><p>* *</p><p>That night I can\u2019t fall asleep, so I lie in bed going over my extracurriculars again. The highlights are Belleview and my internship at the library last summer. My</p><p>SAT</p><p>score is higher than the</p><p>UVA</p><p>average. Margot got in with just forty more than me. I got a five on the</p><p>AP</p><p>US</p><p>history exam. I\u2019ve known people to get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>with less than that.</p><p>Hopefully my essay gave me a bit of shine. I wrote about my mom and my sisters, and all the ways she\u2019s shaped us\u2014when she was alive and after she wasn\u2019t. Mrs. Duvall said it was the best she\u2019d read in years, but Mrs. Duvall has always had a soft spot for the Song girls, so who knows.</p><p>I toss and turn for another few minutes, and finally I just throw off my covers and get out of bed. Then I go downstairs and start measuring out ingredients for chocolate chip cookies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S THURSDAY, CHARACTERS DAY, THE</p><p>day I\u2019ve been looking forward to all week. Peter and I spent hours going back and forth over this. I made a strong case for Alexander Hamilton and Eliza Schuyler, but had to back down when I realized how expensive it would be to rent Colonial costumes on such short notice. I think couples costumes might be my favorite part of being in a couple. Besides the kissing, and the free rides, and Peter himself.</p><p>He wanted to go as Spider-Man and have me wear a red wig and be Mary Jane Watson, mostly because he already had the costume\u2014and because he\u2019s really fit from lacrosse, and why not give the people what they want? His words, not mine.</p> <p>In the end we decided to go as Tyler Durden and Marla Singer from</p><p>Fight Club</p><p>. It was actually my best friend Chris\u2019s idea. She and Kitty and I were watching it at my house, and Chris said, you and Kavinsky should go as those psychos. She said it would be good for the shock value\u2014for me, anyway. At first I balked because Marla isn\u2019t Asian and I have my only-Asian-people-costumes policy, but then Peter\u2019s mom found him a red leather jacket at an estate sale, and it just came together. As for my costume, Ms. Rothschild is loaning me clothes from her own wardrobe, because she was young in the nineties.</p><p>This morning, Ms. Rothschild comes over before work to help me get ready. I\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table in her black slip dress and a fake mohair jacket and a wig, which Kitty delights in messing up to get that crazy bedhead look. I keep swatting her moussed-up hands away, and she keeps saying, \u201cBut this is the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m a pack rat,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says, sipping coffee from her thermos. She reaches into her bag and tosses me a pair of high, high black platform heels. \u201cWhen I was in my twenties, Halloween was my thing. I was the queen of dressing up. It\u2019s your turn to take the crown now, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still be the queen,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cNo, dressing up in costumes is a young person\u2019s game. If I wore a sexy Sherlock Holmes costume now, I\u2019d just look desperate.\u201d She fluffs up my wig. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. My time has passed.\u201d To Kitty she says, \u201cWhat do you think? A little more gunmetal eye shadow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not take it too far,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is still school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole point of wearing a costume is taking it too far,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says airily. \u201cTake lots of pictures when you get to school. Text them to me so I can show my work friends. They\u2019ll get a kick out of it. . . . God, speaking of work, what time is it?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Rothschild is always running late, something that drives Daddy crazy because he\u2019s always ten minutes early. And yet!</p><p>When Peter comes to pick me up, I run outside and open the passenger-side door and scream when I see him. His hair is blond!</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>I shriek, touching his hair. \u201cDid you bleach it?\u201d</p><p>He grins a self-satisfied kind of grin. \u201cIt\u2019s spray. My mom found it for me. I can use it again when we do Romeo and Juliet for Halloween.\u201d He\u2019s eyeing me in my getup. \u201cI like those shoes. You look sexy.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks warm up. \u201cBe quiet.\u201d</p><p>As he backs out of my driveway, he glances at me again and says, \u201cIt\u2019s the truth, though.\u201d</p><p>I give him a shove. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, people better know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d he assures me.</p><p>And he does. When we walk down the senior hallway, Peter cues up the Pixies\u2019 \u201cWhere Is My Mind?\u201d on his phone, loud, and people actually clap for us. Not one person asks if I\u2019m a manga character.</p><p>* *</p><p>After school, Peter and I are lying on the couch; his feet are hanging off the end. He\u2019s still in his costume, but I\u2019ve changed into my regular clothes. \u201cYou always have the cutest socks,\u201d he says, lifting up my right foot. These ones are gray with white polka dots and yellow bear faces.</p><p>Proudly I say, \u201cMy great-aunt sends them from Korea. Korea has the cutest stuff, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ask her to send me some too? Not bears, but maybe, like, tigers. Tigers are cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour feet are too big for socks as cute as these. Your toes would pop right out. You know what, I bet I could find you</p><p>some socks that fit at . . . um, the zoo.\u201d Peter sits up and starts tickling me. I gasp out, \u201cI bet the\u2014pandas or gorillas have to\u2014keep their feet warm somehow . . . in the winter. Maybe they have some kind of deodorized sock technology as well.\u201d I burst into giggles. \u201cStop . . . stop tickling me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop being mean about my feet!\u201d I\u2019ve got my hand burrowed under his arm, and I am tickling him ferociously. But by doing so, I have opened myself up to more attacks.</p><p>I yell, \u201cOkay, okay, truce!\u201d He stops, and I pretend to stop, but sneak a tickle under his arm, and he lets out a high-pitched un-Peter-like shriek.</p><p>\u201cYou said truce!\u201d he accuses. We both nod and lie back down, out of breath. \u201cDo you really think my feet smell?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t. I love the way he smells after a lacrosse game\u2014like sweat and grass and him. But I love to tease, to see that unsure look cross his face for just half a beat. \u201cWell, I mean, on game days . . . ,\u201d I say. Then Peter attacks me again, and we\u2019re wrestling around, laughing, when Kitty walks in, balancing a tray with a cheese sandwich and a glass of orange juice.</p><p>\u201cTake it upstairs,\u201d she says, sitting down on the floor. \u201cThis is a public area.\u201d</p><p>Disentangling myself, I give her a glare. \u201cWe aren\u2019t doing anything private,</p><p>Katherine</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister says my feet stink,\u201d Peter says, pointing his foot in her direction. \u201cShe\u2019s lying, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>She deflects it with a pop of her elbow. \u201cI\u2019m not smelling your foot.\u201d She shudders. \u201cYou guys are kinky.\u201d</p><p>I yelp and throw a pillow at her.</p><p>She gasps. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t knock over my juice! Daddy will kill you if you mess up the rug again.\u201d Pointedly she says, \u201cRemember the nail-polish-remover incident?\u201d</p><p>Peter ruffles my hair. \u201cClumsy Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I shove him away from me. \u201cI\u2019m not clumsy. You\u2019re the one who tripped over his own feet trying to get to the pizza the other night at Gabe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Kitty bursts into giggles and Peter throws a pillow at her. \u201cYou guys need to stop ganging up on me!\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying for dinner?\u201d she asks when her giggles subside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My mom\u2019s making chicken fried steak.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cLucky. Lara Jean, what are we having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m defrosting some chicken breasts as we speak,\u201d I say. She makes a face, and I say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, maybe you could learn to cook. I won\u2019t be around to cook your dinners anymore when I\u2019m at college, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You\u2019ll probably be here every night.\u201d She turns to Peter. \u201cCan I come to your house for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can both come.\u201d</p><p>Kitty starts to cheer, and I shush her. \u201cWe can\u2019t, because then Daddy will have to eat alone. Ms. Rothschild has SoulCycle tonight.\u201d</p><p>She takes a bite of her cheese sandwich. \u201cI\u2019m making myself another sandwich, then. I don\u2019t want to eat old freezer-burn chicken.\u201d</p><p>I sit up suddenly. \u201cKitty, I\u2019ll make something else if you\u2019ll braid my hair tomorrow morning. I want to do something</p><p>special for New York.\u201d I\u2019ve never been to New York before in my life. For our last family vacation, we took a vote, and I picked New York, but I was voted down in favor of Mexico. Kitty wanted to eat fish tacos and swim in the ocean, and Margot wanted to see Mayan ruins and have a chance to work on her Spanish. In the end, I was happy to be outvoted. Before Mexico, Kitty and I had never even left the country. I\u2019ve never seen water so blue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll braid your hair only if I have time left over after I do mine,\u201d Kitty says, which is the best I can hope for, I suppose. She\u2019s just so good at doing hair.</p><p>\u201cWho will braid my hair when I\u2019m at college?\u201d I muse.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Peter says, all confidence.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how,\u201d I scoff.</p><p>\u201cThe kid will teach me. Won\u2019t you, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a price,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>They negotiate back and forth before finally settling on Peter taking Kitty and her friends to the movies one Saturday afternoon. Which is how I come to be sitting cross-legged on the floor while Peter and Kitty sit on the couch above me, Kitty demonstrating a French braid and Peter recording it on his phone.</p><p>\u201cNow you try it,\u201d she says.</p><p>He keeps losing a piece and getting frustrated. \u201cYou have a lot of hair, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t get the French, I\u2019ll teach you something more basic,\u201d Kitty says, and there is no mistaking the contempt in her voice.</p><p>Peter hears it too. \u201cNo, I\u2019m gonna get it. Just give me a second. I\u2019m gonna master it just like I mastered the other kind of French.\u201d He winks at me.</p><p>Kitty and I both scream at him for that. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that in front of my sister!\u201d I yell, shoving him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cI was kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019re not</p><p>that</p><p>good at French kissing.\u201d Even though, yeah, he is.</p><p>Peter gives me a</p><p>Who are you kidding?</p><p>look, and I shrug, because who</p><p>am</p><p>I kidding?</p><p>* *</p><p>Later, I\u2019m walking Peter to his car when he stops in front of the passenger-side door and asks, \u201cHey, how many guys have you kissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust three. You, John Ambrose McClaren\u2014\u201d I say his name fast, like ripping off a Band-Aid, but Peter still has enough time to scowl. \u201cAnd Allie Feldman\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid with the lazy eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His name was Ross. I thought he was cute. It happened at a sleepover at Allie\u2019s; I kissed him on a dare. But I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a speculative look. \u201cSo me, John, and Allie\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting one person, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanderson!\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand. \u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t really count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie Feldman\u2019s cousin Ross who you kissed on a dare counts, but not</p><p>Josh</p><p>, who you technically cheated on me with?\u201d Peter wags his finger at me. \u201cNuh-uh. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I shove him. \u201cWe weren\u2019t actually together then and you know it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA technicality, but okay.\u201d He gives me a sidelong look. \u201cYour number\u2019s higher than mine, you know. I\u2019ve only ever kissed Gen, Jamila, and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl you met at Myrtle Beach with your cousins? Angelina?\u201d</p><p>A funny look crosses over his face. \u201cOh yeah. How\u2019d you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bragged about it to everyone!\u201d It was the summer before seventh grade. I remember it drove Genevieve crazy, that some other girl had kissed Peter before she did. We tried to find Angelina online, but we didn\u2019t have much to go on. Just her name. \u201cSo that makes it four girls you\u2019ve kissed, and you did a lot more with them than kiss, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m on a roll now. \u201cYou\u2019re the only boy I\u2019ve ever</p><p>kissed</p><p>kissed. And you were the first. First kiss, first boyfriend, first everything! You got so many of my firsts, and I didn\u2019t get any from you.\u201d</p><p>Sheepishly he says, \u201cActually that\u2019s not entirely true.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never any girl at the beach. I made the whole thing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no Angelina with big boobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she had big boobs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you did. You told Trevor that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine! Geez. You\u2019re missing the whole point, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the whole point, Peter?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cThat day in McClaren\u2019s basement. You were my first kiss too.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly I stop laughing. \u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I forgot. Also it\u2019s embarrassing that I made up a girl. Don\u2019t tell anybody!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m filled with a glowy kind of wonder. So I was Peter Kavinsky\u2019s first kiss. How perfectly wonderful!</p><p>I throw my arms around him and lift my chin expectantly, waiting for my good-night kiss. He nuzzles his face against mine, and I feel gladness for the fact that he has smooth cheeks and barely even needs to shave. I close my eyes, breathe him in, wait for my kiss. And he plants a chaste peck on my forehead. \u201cGood night, Covey.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fly open. \u201cThat\u2019s all I get?\u201d</p><p>Smugly he says, \u201cYou said earlier that I\u2019m not that good at kissing, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kidding!\u201d</p><p>He winks at me as he hops in his car. I watch him drive away. Even after a whole year of being together, it can still</p><p>feel so new. To love a boy, to have him love you back. It feels miraculous.</p><p>I don\u2019t go inside right away. Just in case he comes back. Hands on my hips, I wait a full twenty seconds before I turn toward the front steps, which is when his car comes peeling back down our street and stops right in front of our house. Peter sticks his head out the window. \u201cAll right then,\u201d he calls out. \u201cLet\u2019s practice.\u201d</p><p>I run back to his car, I pull him toward me by his shirt, and angle my face against his\u2014and then I push him away and run backward, laughing, my hair whipping around my face.</p><p>\u201cCovey!\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get!\u201d I call back gleefully. \u201cSee you on the bus tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>That night, when we\u2019re in the bathroom brushing our teeth, I ask Kitty, \u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how much will you miss me when I go to college? Be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early for this kind of talk,\u201d she says, rinsing her toothbrush.</p><p>\u201cJust answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA four! You said you missed Margot a six point five!\u201d</p><p>Kitty shakes her head at me. \u201cLara Jean, why do you have to remember every little thing? It\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is pretend you\u2019ll miss me!\u201d I burst out. \u201cIt\u2019s the decent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot was going all the way across the world. You\u2019re</p><p>only going fifteen minutes away, so I won\u2019t even have a chance to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>She clasps her hands to her heart. \u201cOkay. How\u2019s this? I\u2019m going to miss you so much I\u2019ll cry every night!\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much, I\u2019ll want to slit my wrists!\u201d She cackles wildly.</p><p>\u201cKatherine. Don\u2019t talk like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen quit fishing for compliments,\u201d she says, and she goes off to bed, while I stay behind and pack up my toiletries for the New York trip tomorrow. If I get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>, I\u2019ll probably just keep a set of my makeup and creams and combs here at home, so I won\u2019t have to pack every time. Margot had to be so careful about what she brought with her to Saint Andrews, because Scotland is so far away and she isn\u2019t able to make the trip back home very often. I\u2019ll probably only pack for fall and winter and leave all my summer things at home, and then just switch them out when the seasons change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IN THE MORNING, DADDY DRIVES</p><p>me to school to catch the charter bus. \u201cCall me as soon as you\u2019re settled in your room,\u201d he says as we wait at the traffic light by school.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you pack the emergency twenty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Last night, Daddy gave me a twenty-dollar bill to put in the secret pocket of my jacket, just in case. I have his credit card, too, for spending money. Ms. Rothschild loaned me her tiny umbrella and her portable cell phone charger.</p><p>Daddy gives me a sidelong look and a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast now. First your senior trip, then prom, then graduation. Only a matter of time before you\u2019re out of the house too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still have Kitty,\u201d I say. \u201cThough it\u2019s true that she isn\u2019t exactly the ray of sunshine that I am.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIf I get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>, I\u2019ll be around all the time, so don\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d I sing it the way he does, like Stevie Wonder.</p><p>* *</p><p>On the bus I sit next to Peter; Chris sits with Lucas. I thought it might be a tough sell to get Chris to come on the senior trip, and it would have been, if Disney World had won out.</p><p>But she\u2019s never been to New York before either, so it ended up being easy peasy.</p><p>We\u2019re on the road for an hour before Peter engages everybody in a game of Never Have I Ever, which I pretend to be asleep for, because I have not done much of anything, drugs-wise or sex-wise, and that\u2019s all anybody cares about. Mercifully, the game dies down pretty fast, I suppose because it\u2019s a lot less exciting when there are no red Solo cups involved. Just as I\u2019m opening my eyes and stretching my arms and \u201cwaking up,\u201d Gabe suggests Truth or Dare, and my stomach takes a nosedive.</p><p>Ever since Peter\u2019s and my hot tub video scandal last year, I\u2019ve felt self-conscious about what people might be thinking about what we do or don\u2019t do. Sex-wise, I mean. And Truth or Dare is miles worse than Never Have I Ever!</p> <p>How many people have you had sex with? Have you ever been in a threeway? How many times a day do you jerk off?</p><p>Those are the kinds of questions people ask each other, and if anybody ever asked them of me, I would have to say that I\u2019m a virgin, and in some ways, that\u2019s even more subversive than any other answer. Usually, I slip away to the kitchen or another room when this game gets started at other parties. But there\u2019s nowhere for me to slip away to today, for we are on a bus, and I am well and truly trapped.</p><p>Peter gives me an amused look. He knows what I\u2019m thinking. He says he doesn\u2019t care what people think, but I know that\u2019s not true. Historically, Peter cares very much what other people think of him.</p><p>\u201cTruth or dare,\u201d Gabe says to Lucas.</p><p>Lucas takes a swig of his Vitaminwater. \u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex with a dude?\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes tight. Lucas is gay, and he\u2019s out, but he isn\u2019t</p><p>out</p><p>out. He doesn\u2019t want to deal with having to explain himself to people all the time, and why should he have to? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s anybody else\u2019s business.</p><p>There\u2019s a quick beat before Lucas says, \u201cNo. Is that an offer?\u201d</p><p>Everybody laughs, and Lucas has a slight smile on his face as he takes another swig of Vitaminwater, but I can see the tension in his neck, his shoulders. It must take a toll, having to be on guard for these kinds of questions, ready to deflect, to smile, to laugh it off. My virginity question is tiny in comparison. But I still don\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>I pray that Lucas picks me next, because I know he\u2019ll go easy on me. But Lucas must not notice the pleading glances I am throwing his way, because instead of picking me, he chooses Genevieve, who is sitting a few rows back, looking at her phone. She\u2019s been dating a guy from her church and he goes to a different school, so no one sees her around as much. I heard from Chris that her parents got divorced, and that her dad moved into a new condo with his girlfriend. Chris said Genevieve\u2019s mom had a breakdown and had to be hospitalized for a few days, but things are better now, which I\u2019m glad for. Peter sent daffodils to her mom when she came back home, and we labored over what the card should say\u2014we finally decided on just</p><p>Be well, Wendy. Love, Peter</p><p>.</p><p>The flowers were my idea, and I chipped in, but of course I didn\u2019t put my name on the card. I\u2019ve just always liked Wendy; she\u2019s been nice to me since I was little. I still get that nervous dip in my stomach when I see Genevieve, but not as bad as it used to be. I know we\u2019ll never be friends again, and I\u2019ve made my peace with it.</p><p>\u201cTruth or dare, Gen,\u201d Lucas calls out.</p><p>She looks up. Automatically she says, \u201cDare.\u201d Of course Genevieve picks dare; she\u2019s a lot of things, but she\u2019s no coward. I\u2019d rather do anything than answer a sex question, so I\u2019ll likely be picking dare too.</p><p>Lucas dares Genevieve to go sit next to Mr. Jain and put her head on his shoulder. \u201cMake it believable,\u201d Lucas says. Everyone howls with laughter. I can tell she really doesn\u2019t want to do it, but again, she\u2019s not a coward.</p><p>We all watch as she makes her way up the aisle and then stops at Mr. Jain\u2019s row. Mr. Jain is new this year; he teaches biology. He\u2019s on the younger side, handsome; he wears skinny jeans with button-downs to school. Genevieve slides into the seat next to him, and all I can see is the back of her head as she talks. He\u2019s smiling. Then she snuggles closer to him and drops her head on his shoulder, and he jumps like a scared cat. Everyone is laughing, and Mr. Jain turns around and shakes his head at us, looking relieved it was a joke.</p><p>Genevieve returns to us, triumphant. She takes her seat and looks around the group; our eyes meet for a moment, and my stomach dips. Then she looks away. \u201cTruth or dare, Chrissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis game is so lame,\u201d Chris says. Gen just stares at her,</p><p>eyebrows raised in challenge, and Chris finally rolls her eyes and says, \u201cWhatever. Truth.\u201d When they go head-to-head like this, it\u2019s impossible not to notice that they are related\u2014first cousins, on their moms\u2019 side.</p><p>Genevieve takes her time thinking up her question. Then she lands the whammy. \u201cDid you or did you not play doctor with our cousin Alex when we were in third grade? And don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Everyone is whooping and hollering, and Chris\u2019s face has gone bright red. I give her a sympathetic look. I know the answer to this one. \u201cTrue,\u201d she mutters, and everyone howls.</p><p>Luckily for me, this is about when Mr. Jain gets up and puts a</p><p>DVD</p><p>in the</p><p>DVD</p><p>player, so the game dissolves and my turn never comes. Chris turns around and says to me in a low voice, \u201cYou got off so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d I whisper back, and Peter chuckles. He can chuckle all he wants, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a little relieved too. Not that he\u2019s ever said so, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019d want the whole senior class to know that he and his girlfriend of a year\u2014longer, if you count our fake relationship\u2014have never had sex before.</p><p>* *</p><p>Hardly anybody in our class has been to New York City, so we\u2019re all just a little wide-eyed about it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a place so alive. It\u2019s a city that has its own heartbeat. I just can\u2019t believe how many people there are, how crowded it is, how sophisticated everyone looks. They all look like\u2014like city people. Except for the tourists like us, of course. Chris tries to act bored and unfazed by it all, but when we get on</p><p>the subway to go to the Empire State Building, she doesn\u2019t hold on to the pole and nearly falls over when we come to a sudden stop. \u201cIt\u2019s different than in</p><p>DC</p><p>,\u201d she mutters. That\u2019s for sure.</p><p>DC</p><p>is the closest big city to Charlottesville, but it\u2019s still a sleepy little town compared to New York. There\u2019s so much to see, so many stores I wish we could stop in. Everyone is in a hurry; they all have plans and places to be. Peter gets screamed at by an old lady for walking and looking at his cell phone, which makes everyone laugh, and for once, Peter is embarrassed. It\u2019s all so overwhelming.</p><p>When we get to the Empire State Building, I make Peter take a selfie with me at the elevators. At the top, I feel light-headed, we\u2019re so high up. Ms. Davenport tells me to sit with my head between my knees for a minute, which helps. When the nausea passes, I get up and go looking for Peter, who has disappeared during my time of need.</p><p>As I turn the corner, I hear Peter calling out, \u201cWait! Wait! Sir!\u201d He\u2019s following a security guard who is approaching a red backpack on the floor.</p><p>The security guard bends down and picks it up. \u201cIs this yours?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave it on the ground?\u201d He unzips the backpack and pulls out a teddy bear.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes dart around. \u201cCan you put that back inside? It\u2019s for a promposal for my girlfriend. It\u2019s supposed to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>The security guard is shaking his head. He mutters to</p><p>himself and starts looking in the backpack again.</p><p>\u201cSir, please just squeeze the bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not squeezing the bear,\u201d the security guard tells him.</p><p>Peter reaches out and squeezes the teddy bear and the bear squeaks out, \u201cWill you go to prom with me, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands to my mouth in delight.</p><p>Sternly the security guard says, \u201cYou\u2019re in New York City, kid. You can\u2019t just leave a backpack on the ground for your proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually called a</p><p>promposal</p><p>,\u201d Peter corrects, and the security guard gives him a look. \u201cSorry. Can I just have the bear back?\u201d He spots me then. \u201cTell him</p><p>Sleepless in Seattle</p><p>is your favorite movie, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>I rush over. \u201cSir, it\u2019s my favorite movie. Please don\u2019t kick him out.\u201d</p><p>The security guard is trying not to smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to kick him out,\u201d he says to me. To Peter he says, \u201cJust be more aware next time. In New York, we\u2019re vigilant. If we see something, we say something, do you feel me? This is not whatever little country town you guys are from. This is</p><p>New York City</p><p>. We do not play around here.\u201d</p><p>Both Peter and I nod, and the security guard walks away. As soon as he\u2019s gone, Peter and I look at each other and break out into giddy laughter. \u201cSomebody reported my book bag!\u201d he says. \u201cMy promposal got fucked.\u201d</p><p>I take the teddy bear out of his bag and hug it to my chest. I\u2019m so happy I don\u2019t even tell him not to cuss. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to turn the corner, and see the book bag</p><p>right here by the telescopes. Then you were going to pick up the bear, and squeeze it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I going to know to squeeze it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Peter pulls a crumpled piece of paper out of the bag. It says,</p><p>Squeeze Me</p><p>. \u201cIt fell off when the security guard was manhandling it. See? I thought of everything.\u201d</p><p>Everything except the ramifications of leaving an unattended bag in a public place in New York City, but still! It\u2019s the thought that counts, and the thought is the sweetest. I squeeze the bear, and again he says, \u201cWill you go to prom with me, Lara Jean?\u201d \u201cYes, I will, Howard.\u201d Howard is, of course, the name of the bear from</p><p>Sleepless in Seattle</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you saying yes to him and not to me?\u201d Peter demands.</p><p>\u201cBecause he asked.\u201d I raise my eyebrows at him and wait.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Peter mumbles, \u201cLara Jean, will you go to prom with me? God, you really do ask for a lot.\u201d</p><p>I hold the bear out to him. \u201cI will, but first kiss Howard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovey. No. Hell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I give him a pleading look. \u201cIt\u2019s in the movie, Peter.\u201d</p><p>And grumbling, he does it, in front of everybody, which is how I know he is utterly and completely mine.</p><p>* *</p><p>On the bus to our hotel in New Jersey, Peter whispers to me, \u201cWhat do you think\u2014should we sneak out after bed checks and come back to the city?\u201d He\u2019s mostly joking. He knows I\u2019m not the type to sneak out on a school trip.</p><p>His eyes go wide when I say, \u201cHow would we even get to the city? Do taxis go from New Jersey to New York?\u201d I can\u2019t even believe I am considering it. It\u2019s so unlike me. Hastily I say, \u201cNo, no, never mind. We can\u2019t. We\u2019d get lost, or mugged, and then we\u2019d get sent home, and then I\u2019d be so mad we missed out on Central Park and everything.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a skeptical look. \u201cDo you really think Jain and Davenport would send us home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but they might make us stay at the hotel all day long as punishment, which is even worse. Let\u2019s not risk it.\u201d Then: \u201cWhat would we do?\u201d I\u2019m playing pretend now, not really planning, but Peter plays along.</p><p>\u201cWe could go hear some live music, or go to a comedy show. Sometimes famous comedians do surprise sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we could see</p><p>Hamilton</p><p>.\u201d When we drove through Times Square, Lucas and I craned our heads to see if we could get a glimpse of the</p><p>Hamilton</p><p>marquee, but no such luck.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I want to get a New York bagel and see how it stacks up against Bodo\u2019s.\u201d Bodo\u2019s Bagels are legendary in Charlottesville; we\u2019re very proud of those bagels.</p><p>Putting my head on his shoulder, I yawn and say, \u201cI wish we could go to Levain Bakery so I could try their cookie. It\u2019s supposed to be like no chocolate chip cookie you\u2019ve had before. I want to go to Jacques Torres\u2019s chocolate shop too. His chocolate chip cookie is the definitive chocolate chip cookie, you know. It\u2019s truly legendary. . . .\u201d My eyes drift closed, and Peter pats my hair. I\u2019m starting to fall asleep when I realize he\u2019s unraveling the milkmaid braids Kitty pinned on</p><p>the crown of my head. My eyes fly back open. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, go back to sleep. I want to practice something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get it back to how she had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me try,\u201d he says, collecting bobby pins in the palm of his hand.</p><p>When we get to the hotel in New Jersey, despite his best efforts, my braids are lumpy and loose and won\u2019t stay pinned. \u201cI\u2019m sending a picture of this to Kitty so she\u2019ll see what a bad student you are,\u201d I say as I gather up my things.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Peter quickly says, which makes me smile.</p><p>* *</p><p>The next day is surprisingly springlike for March. The sun is shining and flowers are just beginning to bud. It feels like I\u2019m in</p><p>You\u2019ve Got Mail</p><p>, when Kathleen Kelly goes to meet Joe Fox in Riverside Park. I would love to see the exact garden where they kiss at the end of the movie, but our tour guide brings us to Central Park instead. Chris and I are taking pictures of the</p><p>Imagine</p><p>mosaic in Strawberry Fields when I realize Peter is nowhere in sight. I ask Gabe and Darrell, but no one\u2019s seen him. I text him, but he doesn\u2019t reply. We\u2019re about to move on to Sheep Meadow for a picnic, and I\u2019m starting to panic, because what if Mr. Jain or Ms. Davenport notices he\u2019s not here? He comes jogging up just as we\u2019re about to go. He\u2019s not even out of breath or the least bit concerned he almost got left behind.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I demand. \u201cWe almost left!\u201d</p><p>Triumphantly he holds up a brown paper bag. \u201cOpen it and see.\u201d</p><p>I grab the bag from him and look inside. It\u2019s a Levain chocolate chip cookie, still warm. \u201cOh my God, Peter! You\u2019re so thoughtful.\u201d I get on my tiptoes and hug him, and then turn to Chris. \u201cIsn\u2019t he so thoughtful, Chris?\u201d Peter\u2019s sweet, but he\u2019s never this sweet. This is two romantic things in a row, so I figure I should praise him accordingly, because the boy responds well to positive reinforcement.</p><p>She\u2019s already got her hand inside the bag, and she stuffs a piece of cookie in her mouth. \u201cVery thoughtful.\u201d She reaches for another piece, but Peter snatches the bag away from her.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Chris! Let Covey have a bite before you eat the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why\u2019d you only get one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s huge! And it cost, like, five bucks for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you ran and got this for me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou weren\u2019t nervous you\u2019d get lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says, all proud. \u201cI just looked at Google Maps and ran for it. I got a little turned around when I got back in the park, but somebody gave me directions. New Yorkers are really friendly. All that stuff about them being rude must be bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Everyone we\u2019ve met has been really nice. Except for that old lady who screamed at you for walking and looking at your phone,\u201d Chris says, snickering at Peter, who scowls at her. I take a big bite of the cookie. The Levain cookie is more like a scone, really dense and doughy. Heavy, too. It really is like no chocolate chip cookie I\u2019ve ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Peter asks me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unique. It\u2019s in a class of its own.\u201d I\u2019m taking another bite when Ms. Davenport comes up and hustles us along, eyeing the cookie in my hand.</p><p>Our tour guide has a pointer that looks like the Statue of Liberty\u2019s torch, and he holds it up in the air to shepherd us through the park. It\u2019s actually pretty embarrassing, and I wish we could just go off by ourselves and explore the city, but no. He has a ponytail and he wears a khaki vest, and I think he\u2019s kind of corny, but Ms. Davenport seems to be into him. After Central Park we take the subway downtown and get off to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. While everyone else is in line for ice cream at Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, Peter and I run over to Jacques Torres\u2019s chocolate shop. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s idea. Of course I ask Ms. Davenport for permission first. She\u2019s busy talking to the tour guide, so she waves us off. I feel so grown up, walking through the streets of New York without any adults.</p><p>When we get to the store, I\u2019m so excited, I\u2019m shaking. Finally I get to try Jacques\u2019s famous chocolate chip cookie. I bite into it. This cookie is flat, chewy, dense. Chocolate has pooled on top and hardened! The butter and sugar taste almost caramelized. It\u2019s heaven.</p><p>\u201cYours are better,\u201d Peter says, his mouth rudely full, and I shush him, looking around to make sure the girl at the register didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cStop lying,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>He is. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why mine aren\u2019t like his,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt must be the industrial ovens.\u201d It seems I\u2019ll just have to accept my not-quite-perfect chocolate chip cookie and be content with good enough.</p><p>As we step out the door, I notice a bakery across the street called Almondine and another one on the opposite corner called One Girl Cookies. New York is truly a city of baked goods.</p><p>Peter and I walk back to the ice cream shop holding hands. Everyone is out on the pier, sitting on benches, eating their ice cream, and taking selfies with the Manhattan skyline behind them. New York keeps surprising me with how pretty it is.</p><p>Peter must be thinking the same thing, because he squeezes my hand and says, \u201cThis city is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>I\u2019m sound asleep when there is a knock at the door. I wake up with a start. It\u2019s still dark outside. In the bed across the room, Chris doesn\u2019t stir.</p><p>Then I hear Peter\u2019s voice on the other side of the door. \u201cCovey, it\u2019s me. Want to go watch the sunrise on the roof?\u201d</p><p>I get out of bed and open the door, and there is Peter, in a</p><p>UVA</p><p>hoodie, holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee and a cup with a tea bag hanging out the side. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive thirty. Hurry, go get your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, give me two minutes,\u201d I whisper. I run to our bathroom and brush my teeth and then I fumble around in the darkness for my jacket. \u201cI can\u2019t find my jacket!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wear my hoodie,\u201d Peter offers from the doorway.</p><p>From under her blanket Chris growls, \u201cIf you guys don\u2019t shut up, I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDo you want to watch the sunrise with us?\u201d</p><p>Peter shoots me a pouty look, but Chris\u2019s head is still under her blanket, so she doesn\u2019t see. \u201cNo. Just leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d I say, and I scurry out the door.</p><p>We take the elevator to the top, and it\u2019s still dark outside, but it\u2019s beginning to get light. The city is just waking up. Right away Peter shrugs out of his hoodie, and I put my arms up and he slips it over my head. It\u2019s warm and smells like the detergent his mother uses.</p><p>Peter leans over the edge, looking across the water to the city. \u201cCan\u2019t you picture us living here after college? We could live in a skyscraper. With a doorman. And a gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a skyscraper. I want to live in a brownstone in the West Village. Near a bookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he says.</p><p>I lean over the edge too. I never would have pictured myself living in New York City. Before I came here, it seemed like such an intimidating place, for tough people who aren\u2019t afraid to get into a fight with someone on the subway, or men in suits who work on Wall Street, or artists who live in SoHo lofts. But now that I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not so scary, not with Peter by my side. I steal a look at him. Is this how it goes? You fall in love, and nothing seems truly scary anymore, and life is one big possibility? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a six-hour trip back to Virginia, and I\u2019m asleep for most of it. It\u2019s dark out by the time we pull into the school parking lot, and I see Daddy\u2019s car parked up front. We\u2019ve all had our own cars and been driving ourselves around for so long, but pulling into the school parking lot and seeing all the parents waiting there for us feels like being in elementary school again, like coming back from a field trip. It\u2019s a nice feeling. On the way home, we pick up a pizza and Ms. Rothschild comes over and she and Daddy and Kitty and I eat it in front of the</p><p>TV</p><p>.</p><p>After, I unpack, do the bit of homework I have left, talk to Peter on the phone, and then get ready for bed. But I end up tossing and turning for what feels like eternity. Maybe it\u2019s all the sleep I got on the bus, or maybe it\u2019s the fact that any day now, I\u2019ll hear from</p><p>UVA</p><p>. Either way, I can\u2019t sleep, so I creep downstairs and start opening drawers.</p><p>What could I bake this time of night that wouldn\u2019t involve waiting for butter to soften? It\u2019s a perpetual question in my life. Ms. Rothschild says we should just leave butter out in a dish like she does, but we aren\u2019t a leave-the-butter-out family, we are a butter-in-the-refrigerator family. Besides, it messes with the chemistry if the butter is too soft, and in Virginia in the spring and summertime, butter melts quick.</p> <p>I suppose I could finally try baking the cinnamon roll brownies I\u2019ve been playing around with in my head. Katharine Hepburn\u2019s brownie recipe plus a dash of cinnamon plus cinnamon cream cheese swirl on top.</p><p>I\u2019m melting chocolate in a double boiler and already regretting starting this project so late when Daddy pads into the kitchen in the tartan robe Margot gave him for Christmas this past year. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep either, huh?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying out a new recipe. I think I might call them cinnabrownies. Or sin brownies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood luck waking up tomorrow,\u201d Daddy says, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>I yawn. \u201cYou know, I was thinking maybe you\u2019d call in for me and I\u2019d sleep in a little and then you and I could have a nice, relaxing father-daughter breakfast together. I could make mushroom omelets.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNice try.\u201d He nudges me toward the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll finish up the sin brownies or whatever they\u2019re called. You go to bed.\u201d</p><p>I yawn again. \u201cCan I trust you to do a cream cheese swirl?\u201d Daddy looks alarmed and I say, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll finish making the batter and bake them tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty much done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Can you measure me out a quarter cup of flour?\u201d</p><p>Daddy nods and gets out the measuring cup.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the liquid measuring cup. We need the dry measuring cups so you can level off the flour.\u201d He goes back to the cupboard, and switches them out. I watch as he scoops flour and then carefully takes a butter knife to the top. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learn from the best,\u201d he says.</p><p>I cock my head at him. \u201cWhy are you still awake, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I guess I have a lot on my mind.\u201d He puts the top back on the flour canister and then stops and hesitates before asking, \u201cHow do you feel about Trina? You like her, right?\u201d</p><p>I take the pot of chocolate off the heat. \u201cI like her a lot. I think I might even love her. Do</p><p>you</p><p>love her?\u201d</p><p>This time Daddy doesn\u2019t hesitate at all. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He looks relieved. \u201cGood,\u201d he says back. Then he says it again. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Things must be pretty serious if he\u2019s asking me such a question. I wonder if he\u2019s thinking of asking her to move in. Before I can ask, he says, \u201cNo one will ever take the place of your mom. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d I lick the chocolate spoon with the tip of my tongue. It\u2019s hot, too hot. It\u2019s good that he should love again, that he should have someone, a real partner. He\u2019s been alone so long it felt like the normal thing, but this is a better thing. And he\u2019s happy, anyone can see it. Now that Ms. Rothschild\u2019s here, I can\u2019t picture her not here. \u201cI\u2019m glad for you, Daddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All morning long I\u2019ve been checking my phone, just like pretty much every senior at my school has been doing all week. Monday came and went with no word from</p><p>UVA</p><p>, then Tuesday, then Wednesday. Today is Thursday, and still nothing. The</p><p>UVA</p> <p>admissions office always send out acceptances before April first, and last year, notices went out the third week of March, so it really could be any day now. The way it goes is, they put the word out on social media to check the Student Info System, and then you log in to the system and learn your fate.</p><p>Colleges used to send acceptance letters in the mail. Mrs. Duvall says that sometimes parents would call the school when the mailman came, and the kid would jump in their car and drive home as fast as they could. There\u2019s something romantic about waiting for a letter in the mail, waiting for your destiny.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in French class, my last class of the day, when someone shrieks, \u201c</p> <p>UVA</p><p>just tweeted! Decisions are out!\u201d</p><p>Madame Hunt says,</p><p>\u201cCalmez-vous, calmez-vous,\u201d</p><p>but everyone\u2019s getting up and grabbing their phones, not paying attention to her.</p> <p>This is it. My hands tremble as I log in to the system; my</p><p>heart is going a million miles a minute waiting for the website to load.</p><p>The University of Virginia received over 30,000 applications this year. The Committee on Admission has examined your application and carefully considered your academic, personal, and extracurricular credentials, and while your application was very strong, we are sorry to inform you . . .</p><p>This can\u2019t be real. I\u2019m in a nightmare and any moment I\u2019m going to wake up. Wake up wake up wake up.</p><p>Dimly, I can hear people talking all around me; I hear a scream of joy down the hallway. Then the bell rings, and people are jumping out of their seats and running out the door. Madame Hunt murmurs, \u201cThey usually don\u2019t send out the notices until after school.\u201d I look up, and she\u2019s looking at me with sad, sympathetic eyes. Mom eyes. Her eyes are what undo me.</p><p>Everything is ruined. My chest hurts; it\u2019s hard to breathe. All of my plans, everything I was counting on, none of it will come true now. Me coming home for Sunday night dinner, doing laundry on weeknights with Kitty, Peter walking me to class, studying all night at Clemons Library. It\u2019s all gone.</p><p>Nothing will go like we planned now.</p><p>I look back down at my phone, read the words again.</p><p>We are sorry to inform you . . .</p><p>My eyes start to blur. Then I read</p><p>it again, from the beginning. I didn\u2019t even get wait-listed. I don\u2019t even have that.</p><p>I stand up, get my bag, and walk out the door. I feel a stillness inside of me, but at the same time this acute awareness of my heart pumping, my ears pounding. It\u2019s like all the parts are moving and continuing to function as they do, but I\u2019ve gone completely numb. I didn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m not going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>; they don\u2019t want me.</p><p>I\u2019m walking to my locker, still in a daze, when I nearly run right into Peter, who is turning the corner. He grabs me. \u201cSo?\u201d His eyes are bright and eager and expectant.</p><p>My voice comes out sounding very far away. \u201cI didn\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>His mouth drops. \u201cWait\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>I can feel the lump rising in my throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even wait-listed?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d The word is one long exhale. Peter looks stunned. He lets go of my arm. I can tell he doesn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, turning away from him.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014I\u2019ll come with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. You have an away game today. You can\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovey, I don\u2019t give a shit about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t. Just\u2014I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d He reaches for me and I sidestep away from him and hurry down the hallway, and he calls out my name, but I don\u2019t stop. I just have to make it to my car, and then I can cry. Not</p><p>yet. Just a hundred more steps, and then a hundred more than that.</p><p>I make it to the parking lot before the tears come. I cry the whole drive home. I cry so hard I can barely see, and I have to pull over at a McDonald\u2019s to sit in the parking lot and cry some more. It\u2019s starting to sink in, that this isn\u2019t a nightmare, this is real, and this fall I won\u2019t be going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>with Peter. Everyone will be so disappointed. They were all expecting I\u2019d get in. We all thought it was going to happen. I never should have made such a big deal about wanting to go there. I should\u2019ve just kept it to myself, not let anyone see how much I wanted it. Now they\u2019ll all be worried for me, and it\u2019ll be worse than Madame Hunt\u2019s sad mom eyes.</p><p>When I get home, I take my phone and go upstairs to my room. I take off my school clothes, put on my pajamas, and crawl into bed and look at my phone. I\u2019ve got missed calls from Daddy, from Margot, from Peter. I go on Instagram, and my feed is all people posting their reaction shots to getting into</p><p>UVA</p><p>. My cousin Haven got in; she posted a screen grab of her acceptance letter. She won\u2019t be going there, though. She\u2019s going to Wellesley, her first choice. She doesn\u2019t even care about</p><p>UVA</p><p>; it was her safety school. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feign sympathy for me when she finds out I didn\u2019t get in, but inside she\u2019ll feel secretly superior. Emily Nussbaum got in. She posted a picture of herself in a</p><p>UVA</p><p>sweatshirt and baseball cap. Gosh, did everyone get in? I thought my grades were better than hers. I guess not.</p><p>A little while later, I hear the front door open and Kitty\u2019s</p><p>footsteps come running up the stairs. She throws open my bedroom door, but I am on my side, eyes closed, pretending to be asleep. \u201cLara Jean?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. I need a little while longer before I have to face her and Daddy and tell them I didn\u2019t make it. I make my breathing go heavy and natural, and then I hear Kitty retreat and close the door quietly behind her. Before long, I fall asleep for real.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I wake up, it\u2019s dark outside. It always feels so bleak to fall asleep when it\u2019s still light out and then wake up to darkness. My eyes feel swollen and sore. Downstairs, I hear water running in the kitchen sink and the clink of silverware against dishes. I go down the staircase and stop before I make it to the bottom. \u201cI didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>,\u201d I say.</p><p>Daddy turns around; his sleeves are rolled up, his arms soapy, his eyes even sadder than Madame Hunt\u2019s. Dad eyes. He turns off the faucet and comes over to the staircase, hoists me up, and draws me into his arms for a hug. His arms are still wet. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d he says. We\u2019re almost the same height, because I am still standing on the stairs. I\u2019m focusing on not crying, but when he finally releases me, he tips up my chin and examines my face worriedly, and it\u2019s all I can do to keep it together. \u201cI know how badly you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>I keep swallowing to keep down the tears. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d</p><p>He smooths the hair out of my eyes. \u201cEverything is going to work out. I promise it will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I just really didn\u2019t want to leave you guys,\u201d I cry, and I can\u2019t help it, tears are rolling down my face. Daddy\u2019s wiping them away as fast as they can fall. He looks like he\u2019s going to cry too, which makes me feel worse, because I had planned to put on a brave face, and now look.</p><p>Putting his arm around me, he admits, \u201cSelfishly, I was looking forward to having you so close to home. But Lara Jean, you\u2019re still going to get into a great school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be</p><p>UVA</p><p>,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Daddy hugs me to him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says again.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting next to me on the staircase, his arm still around me, when Kitty comes back inside from walking Jamie Fox-Pickle. She looks from me to Daddy, and she drops Jamie\u2019s leash. \u201cDid you not get in?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my face and try to shrug. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t meant to be, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry you didn\u2019t get in,\u201d she says, her voice tiny, her eyes sorrowful.</p><p>\u201cCome give me a hug at least,\u201d I say, and she does. The three of us sit like that on the staircase for quite some time, Daddy\u2019s arm around my shoulder, Kitty\u2019s hand on my knee.</p><p>* *</p><p>Daddy makes me a turkey sandwich, which I eat, and then I go back upstairs and get back in bed to look at my phone again, when there\u2019s a knock at my window. It\u2019s Peter, still in his lacrosse uniform. I jump out of bed and open the window for him. He climbs inside, searches my face, and then says, \u201cHey, rabbit eyes,\u201d which is what he calls me when I\u2019ve</p><p>been crying. It makes me laugh, and it feels good to laugh. I reach out to hug him and he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hug me right now. I didn\u2019t shower after the game. I came straight here.\u201d</p><p>I hug him anyway, and he doesn\u2019t smell bad to me at all. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ring the doorbell?\u201d I ask, looking up at him, hooking my arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI thought your dad might not like me coming over so late. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I let go of him and sit down on my bed, and he sits at my desk. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause, and then Peter says, \u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t say the right things earlier. I was just bummed. I didn\u2019t think this was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at my bedspread. \u201cI know. Me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just sucks so much. Your grades are way better than mine. Cary got in, and you\u2019re better than him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a lacrosse player or a golfer.\u201d I try not to sound bitter-hearted, but it\u2019s an effort. A very traitorous, very small thought worms its way into my head\u2014it\u2019s not fair that Peter\u2019s going and I\u2019m not, when I deserve it more. I worked harder. I got better grades, higher</p><p>SAT</p><p>scores.</p><p>\u201cFuck them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Screw them.\u201d He exhales. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d</p><p>Automatically I say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not</p><p>insane</p><p>.</p><p>UVA</p><p>\u2019s a really competitive school. I\u2019m not mad at them. I just wish I was going there.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, we hear the toilet flush from the hallway, and we both freeze. \u201cYou\u2019d better go,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Peter gives me one more hug before climbing back out my window. I stand there and watch him run down the street to where he parked his car. After he drives away, I check my phone, and there are two missed calls from Margot and then a text from her that says,</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I start to cry again, because that\u2019s when it finally feels real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WHEN I WAKE UP IN</p><p>the morning, it\u2019s the first thing I think of. How I\u2019m not going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, how I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going. My whole life I\u2019ve never had to worry about that. I\u2019ve always known where my place is, where I belong. Home.</p> <p>As I lie there in bed, I start a mental tally of all the things I\u2019m going to miss out on, not going to a college just around the corner from home. The moments.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s first period. My dad\u2019s an</p><p>OB</p> <p>, so it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have it covered, but I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment, to give Kitty a speech about womanhood that she\u2019ll hate. It might not happen for another year or two. But I got mine when I was twelve and Margot got hers when she was eleven, so who knows? When I got my first period, Margot explained all about tampons and what kind to use for what days, and to sleep on your belly when your cramps are particularly bad. She made me feel like I was joining some secret club, a woman\u2019s club. Because of my big sister, the grief I felt about growing up was less acute. Kitty likely won\u2019t have either of her big sisters here, but she does have Ms. Rothschild, and she\u2019s only just across the street. She\u2019s grown so attached to Ms. Rothschild that she\u2019ll probably prefer a period talk from her anyway, truth be told. Even if in the future Daddy and Ms.</p><p>Rothschild were to break up, I know Ms. Rothschild would never turn her back on Kitty. They\u2019re cemented.</p><p>I\u2019ll miss Kitty\u2019s birthday, too. I\u2019ve never not been at home for her birthday. I\u2019ll have to remind Daddy to carry on our birthday-sign tradition.</p><p>For the first time ever, all of the Song girls will be living truly apart. We three probably won\u2019t ever live in the same house together again. We\u2019ll come home for holidays and school breaks, but it won\u2019t be the same. It won\u2019t be what it was. But I suppose it hasn\u2019t been, not since Margot left for college. The thing is, you get used to it. Before you even realize it\u2019s happening, you get used to things being different, and it will be that way for Kitty too.</p> <p>At breakfast I keep stealing glances at her, memorizing every little thing. Her gangly legs, her knobby knees, the way she watches</p><p>TV</p><p>with a half smile on her face. She\u2019ll only be as young as this for a little while longer. Before I leave, I should do more special things with her, just the two of us.</p><p>At the commercial break she eyes me. \u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. I\u2019m just going to miss you is all.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty slurps the rest of her cereal milk. \u201cCan I have your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you won\u2019t be living here. Why should your room just sit there and go to waste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want my room and not Margot\u2019s? Hers is bigger.\u201d</p><p>Practically, she says, \u201cYours is closer to the bathroom and it\u2019s got better light.\u201d</p><p>I dread change, and Kitty steps right into it. She leans in extra hard. It\u2019s her way of coping. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss me when I\u2019m gone, I know it, so quit pretending you won\u2019t,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to be an only child,\u201d she says in a singsong voice. When I frown, she hurries to say, \u201cOnly kidding!\u201d</p><p>I know Kitty\u2019s just being Kitty, but I can\u2019t help but feel a tiny stab of hurt. Why would anyone want to be an only child? What\u2019s so great about having no one to warm your feet up against on a cold winter night?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss me,\u201d I say, more to myself than to her. She doesn\u2019t hear me anyway; her show is back on.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I get to school, I go straight to Mrs. Duvall\u2019s office to tell her the news. As soon as Mrs. Duvall sees the look on my face, she says, \u201cCome sit down,\u201d and she gets up from behind her desk and closes the door behind me. She sits in the chair next to mine. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d Now that I\u2019ve said it a few times, you\u2019d think it would be easier to get the words out, but it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s worse.</p><p>She heaves a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m surprised. I\u2019m very, very surprised. Your application was strong, Lara Jean. You\u2019re a wonderful student. I did hear that they got a few thousand more applicants this year than in years past. Still, I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be wait-listed at the very least.\u201d All I can do is give</p><p>her a small shrug in response, because I don\u2019t trust my voice right now. She leans forward and hugs me. \u201cI heard from a source in the admissions department that William and Mary will be sending out their decisions today, so buck up for that. And there\u2019s still</p><p>UNC</p><p>, and U of R. Where else did you apply? Tech?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201c</p><p>JMU</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll great schools. You\u2019ll be fine, Lara Jean. I\u2019m not the least bit worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking, which is that we both thought I\u2019d get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>, too; instead I just offer a weak smile.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I walk out, I see Chris at the lockers. I tell her the news about</p><p>UVA</p><p>, and she says, \u201cYou should come with me and work on a farm in Costa Rica.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, I lean back against the wall and say, \u201cWait\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you did.\u201d I\u2019ve known Chris wasn\u2019t going away to college, that she was going to go to community college first and then see. She doesn\u2019t have the grades, or much inclination, really. But she never said anything about Costa Rica.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a year off and go work on farms. You work for like five hours, and they give you room and board. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you know about farming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! It doesn\u2019t matter. You just have to be willing to</p><p>work; they\u2019ll teach you. I could also work at a surfing school in New Zealand, or learn how to make wine in Italy. Basically, I could go anywhere. Doesn\u2019t that sound amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. . . .\u201d I try to smile but my face feels tight. \u201cIs your mom okay with it?\u201d</p><p>Chris picks at her thumbnail. \u201cWhatever, I\u2019m eighteen. She doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>I give her a dubious look. Chris\u2019s mom is tough. I have a hard time picturing her being okay with this plan.</p><p>\u201cI told her I\u2019d do this for a year and then come back and go to</p><p>PVCC</p><p>, and then transfer to a four-year college,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut who knows what will happen? A year is a long time. Maybe I\u2019ll marry a</p><p>DJ</p><p>, or join a band, or start my own bikini line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds so glamorous.\u201d</p><p>I want to feel excited for her, but I can\u2019t seem to muster up the feeling. It\u2019s good that Chris has her own thing to look forward to, something that no one else in our class is doing. But it feels like everything all around me is shifting in ways I didn\u2019t expect, when all I want is for things to stand still.</p><p>\u201cWill you write me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll Snapchat everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on Snapchat, and besides, that\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d I nudge her with my foot. \u201cSend me a postcard from every new place you go, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows if I\u2019ll even have access to a post office? I don\u2019t know how post offices work in Costa Rica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d she agrees.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen as much of Chris this year. She got a job hostessing at Applebee\u2019s, and she\u2019s become very close with her work friends. They\u2019re all older, some of them have kids, and they pay their own bills. I\u2019m pretty sure Chris hasn\u2019t told any of them she still lives at home and pays exactly no bills. When I visited her there last month, one of the servers said something about hoping to make enough that night for rent, and she looked at Chris and said, \u201cYou know how it is,\u201d and Chris nodded like she did. When I gave her a questioning look, she pretended not to see.</p><p>The warning bell rings, and we start walking to our first-period classes. \u201cKavinsky must be freaking out that you didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>,\u201d Chris says, checking her reflection in a glass door we walk past. \u201cSo I guess you guys will do long-distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My chest gets tight. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely get people in place to keep an eye on the situation,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, like spies? I think I heard Gillian McDougal got in. She\u2019d spy for you.\u201d</p><p>I give her a look. \u201cChris, I trust Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I\u2019m not talking about him! I\u2019m talking about random girls on his floor. Dropping by his room. You should give him a picture of you to keep him company, if you know what I mean.\u201d She frowns at me. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, a sexy picture? No way!\u201d I start backing away from her. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve gotta go to class.\u201d The last thing I want to do is think about Peter and random girls. I\u2019m still trying to get used to the idea that we won\u2019t be together at</p><p>UVA</p><p>this fall.</p><p>Chris rolls her eyes. \u201cCalm down. I\u2019m not talking about a nudie. I would never suggest that for you of all people. What I\u2019m talking about is a pinup-girl shot, but not, like, cheesy. Sexy. Something Kavinsky can hang up in his dorm room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want him to hang up a sexy picture of me in his dorm room for all the world to see?\u201d</p><p>Chris reaches out and flicks me on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I shove her away from me and rub the spot where she flicked me. \u201cThat hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved it for asking such a dumb question.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI\u2019m talking about preventative measures. A picture of you on his wall is a way for you to mark your territory. Kavinsky\u2019s hot. And he\u2019s an athlete. Do you think other girls will respect the fact that he\u2019s in a long-distance relationship?\u201d She lowers her voice and adds, \u201cWith a Virgin Mary girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I gasp and then look around to see if anyone heard. \u201cChris!\u201d I hiss. \u201cCan you please not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help you! You have to protect what\u2019s yours, Lara Jean. If I met some hot guy in Costa Rica with a long-distance gf who he wasn\u2019t even</p><p>sleeping</p><p>with? I don\u2019t think I\u2019d take it very seriously.\u201d She gives me a shrug and a sorry-not-sorry look. \u201cYou should definitely frame the picture too, so people know you\u2019re not someone to mess with. A frame says permanence. A picture taped on a wall says here today, gone tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my bottom lip thoughtfully. \u201cSo maybe a picture of me baking, in an apron\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith nothing underneath?\u201d</p><p>Chris cackles, and I flick her forehead lightning quick.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet serious then!\u201d</p><p>The bell rings again, and we go our separate ways. I can\u2019t see myself giving Peter a sexy picture of me, but it does give me an idea\u2014I could give him a scrapbook instead. All of our greatest hits. That way when he\u2019s missing me at</p><p>UVA</p><p>, he can look at it. And keep it on his desk, for any \u201crandom girl\u201d who might happen by. Of course I won\u2019t mention this idea to Chris\u2014she\u2019d just laugh and call me Grandma Lara Jean. But I know Peter will love it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019M ON PINS AND NEEDLES</p><p>all day, waiting to hear the news from William and Mary. My entire focus is on my phone, waiting for it to buzz, waiting for that e-mail. In</p><p>AP</p><p>English class, Mr. O\u2019Bryan has to ask me three times about the slave narrative tradition in</p> <p>Beloved</p><p>.</p><p>When it does buzz, it\u2019s just Margot asking me if I\u2019ve heard anything yet, and then it buzzes again, and it\u2019s Peter asking me if I\u2019ve heard anything yet. But nothing from William and Mary.</p><p>Then, when I\u2019m in the girls\u2019 room in between classes, it finally does buzz, and I scramble to zip up my jeans so I can check my phone. It\u2019s an e-mail from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, telling me my application has been updated. I stand there in the bathroom stall, and even though I truly don\u2019t expect to get in, my heart is pounding like crazy as I click on the link and wait.</p><p>Wait-listed.</p><p>I should be happy about it, because</p><p>UNC</p> <p>is so competitive and the wait list is better than nothing, and I would be happy . . . if I had already gotten into</p><p>UVA</p><p>. Instead it\u2019s like another punch in the stomach. What if I don\u2019t get in anywhere? What will I do then? I can see my Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor now:</p><p>Poor Lara Jean, she didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>or</p><p>UNC</p><p>. She\u2019s</p> <p>so different from her sister; Margot\u2019s such a go-getter.</p><p>When I get to the lunch table, Peter is waiting for me with an eager look on his face. \u201cDid you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>I sit down in the seat next to him. \u201cI got wait-listed at</p><p>UNC</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shit. Well, it\u2019s impossible to get in there out of state unless you\u2019re a basketball player. Honestly, even getting on the wait list is impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cScrew them,\u201d he says. \u201cWho wants to go there anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people.\u201d I unwrap my sandwich, but I can\u2019t bear to take a bite, because my stomach\u2019s tied up in knots.</p><p>Peter gives a begrudging shrug. I know he\u2019s just trying to make me feel better, but</p><p>UNC</p><p>is a great school and he knows it and I know it, and there\u2019s no use pretending it\u2019s not.</p><p>All through lunch I\u2019m listlessly sipping on my Cherry Coke and listening to the guys go on about the game they\u2019ve got coming up in a few days. Peter looks over at me at one point and squeezes my thigh in a reassuring way, but I can\u2019t even muster up a smile in return.</p><p>When the guys get up to go to the weight room, it\u2019s just Peter and me left at the table, and he asks me worriedly, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d I say.</p><p>Then he sighs and says, \u201cIt should be you going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>and not me,\u201d and just like that, poof, the traitorous little thought I had last night about me deserving it more than him disappears like perfume mist into the air. I know how hard</p><p>Peter worked at lacrosse. He earned his spot. He shouldn\u2019t be thinking those kinds of thoughts. It\u2019s not right.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that. You earned it. You deserve to go to</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>His head down, he says, \u201cSo do you, though.\u201d Then his head snaps up, his eyes alight. \u201cDo you remember Toney Lewis?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cHe was a senior when we were freshmen. He went to</p><p>PVCC</p><p>for two years and then he transferred to</p><p>UVA</p><p>his junior year! I bet you could do that too, but you\u2019d be able to do it even sooner, since you\u2019re going to a regular four-year college. Getting in as a transfer is a million times easier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. . . .\u201d Transferring hadn\u2019t occurred to me. I\u2019m still getting used to the idea that I won\u2019t be going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cRight? Okay, so this fall you\u2019ll go to William and Mary or U of R or wherever you get in, and we\u2019ll visit each other all the time, and you\u2019ll apply to transfer for next year, and then you\u2019ll be with me at</p><p>UVA</p><p>! Where you belong!\u201d</p><p>Hope flares inside of me. \u201cDo you really think it\u2019ll be that easy for me to get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! You should\u2019ve gotten in in the first place! Trust me, Covey.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I nod. \u201cYeah! Okay. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Peter breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cGood. So we have a plan.\u201d</p><p>I steal a french fry off his plate. I can already feel my appetite coming back to me. I\u2019m stealing another fry when my phone vibrates. I snatch it up and check\u2014it\u2019s an e-mail from</p><p>the office of admissions at William and Mary. Peter looks over my shoulder and back at me, his eyes wide. His leg bounces up and down against mine as we wait for the page to load.</p><p>It is with great pleasure that I offer you admission to the College of William and Mary . . .</p><p>Relief floods over me. Thank God.</p><p>Peter jumps out of his seat and picks me up and swings me around. \u201cLara Jean just got into William and Mary!\u201d he shouts to the table and anyone who is listening. Everyone at our table cheers.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Peter crows, hugging me. \u201cI told you everything would work out.\u201d</p><p>I hug him back tightly. More than anything else, I feel relieved. Relieved to be in, relieved to have a plan.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work until you\u2019re here,\u201d he says in a soft voice, burrowing his face in my neck. \u201cIt\u2019s two hours away\u2014that\u2019s nothing. I bet your dad would let you take the car. It\u2019s not like Kitty needs it yet. And I\u2019ll do the trip with you a few times to get you comfortable with it. It\u2019s gonna be all good, Covey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding.</p><p>When I sit back down, I send a group text to Margot, Kitty, Ms. Rothschild, and my dad.</p><p>I got into W&amp;M!!!</p><p>I throw in those exclamation marks for good measure, to show how excited I am, to make sure they know they shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for me anymore, that everything is great now.</p><p>My dad sends back a string of emojis. Ms. Rothschild writes,</p><p>You go girl!!!!!</p><p>Margot writes,</p><p>YAYYYYYYY! We will celebrate IRL next week!</p><p>After lunch, I stop by Mrs. Duvall\u2019s office to tell her the good news, and she is thrilled. \u201cI know it\u2019s your second choice, but in some ways it might be an even better fit than</p><p>UVA</p><p>was. It\u2019s smaller. I think a girl like you could really shine there, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her, receive her hug, but inside I\u2019m thinking,</p><p>I guess she didn\u2019t think a girl like me could really shine at</p><p>UVA</p><p>.</p><p>* *</p><p>By the end of the week, I get into James Madison and University of Richmond, too, which I\u2019m happy about, but I\u2019m still set on William and Mary. I\u2019ve been to Williamsburg plenty of times with my family, and I can picture myself there. It\u2019s a small campus, a pretty one. And it really isn\u2019t far from home. It\u2019s less than two hours away. So I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll study hard, and then after a year I\u2019ll transfer to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, and everything will be exactly the way we planned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019M THE ONE WHO GOES</p><p>to the airport to pick up Margot and Ravi, while Daddy puts finishing touches on dinner and Kitty does her homework.

Her hair is freshly bobbed around her chin, she\u2019s wearing a sweatshirt and leggings, and as I squeeze her tight, I think</p><p>Oh, how I\u2019ve missed my sister!</p><p>I let go, and then I take a good look at Ravi, who is taller than I realized. He is tall and skinny with dark skin and dark hair and dark eyes and long lashes. He looks so unlike Josh, but so like a boy that Margot would date. He has one dimple, on his right cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you in real life, Lara Jean,\u201d he says, and right away I\u2019m bowled over by his accent. My name sounds so much fancier all dressed up in an English accent.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling nervous, and then I see that his T-shirt says</p><p>DUMBLEDORE\u2019S ARMY</p><p>, and I relax. He\u2019s a Potter person, like us. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too. So what house are you?\u201d</p><p>He grabs both Margot\u2019s and his suitcases and loads them into the trunk. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can guess. Your sister got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly because you were trying to impress me for the first month I knew you,\u201d she protests. Ravi laughs and climbs into the backseat. I think it\u2019s a good sign of his character that he doesn\u2019t automatically go for shotgun. Margot looks at me. \u201cDo you want me to drive?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to say yes, because I always like it better when Margot drives, but I shake my head, jingle my keys high. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows like she\u2019s impressed. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>She goes to the passenger side, and I get in the front seat. I look at Ravi in my rearview mirror. \u201cRavi, by the time you leave our house, I will have figured out</p> <p>your</p><p>house.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>When we get home, Daddy and Kitty and Ms. Rothschild are waiting for us in the living room. Margot looks startled to see her there sitting on the couch with Daddy, her bare feet in his lap. I\u2019ve grown so used to it, to her being around, that it feels to me like Ms. Rothschild is part of the family now. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me how jarring it would be for Margot. But the truth is, Ms. Rothschild and Margot haven\u2019t spent a lot of time together because she\u2019s been away at school; she wasn\u2019t around when Ms. Rothschild and Daddy first started dating and she\u2019s only been home once since, for Christmas.</p><p>As soon as Ms. Rothschild sees Margot, she jumps up to</p><p>give her a big hug and compliments her on her hair. She hugs Ravi, too. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a tall drink of water!\u201d she quips, and he laughs, but Margot just has a stiff smile on her face.</p><p>Until she sees Kitty, who she wraps up in a bear hug and then, seconds later, squeals, \u201cOh my God, Kitty! Are you wearing a bra now?\u201d Kitty gasps and glares at her, her cheeks a dull angry red.</p><p>Abashed, Margot mouths,</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Ravi hurries to step forward and shake Daddy\u2019s hand. \u201cHello, Dr. Covey, I\u2019m Ravi. Thank you for inviting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re glad to have you, Ravi,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>Then Ravi smiles at Kitty and lifts his hand in greeting and says, a tad awkwardly, \u201cHi, Kitty.\u201d</p><p>Kitty nods at him without making eye contact. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Margot is still staring at Kitty in disbelief. I\u2019ve been here all along, so it\u2019s harder for me to see how much Kitty has grown in the past year, but it\u2019s true, she has. Not so much in the chest department\u2014the bra is merely ornamental at this point\u2014but in other ways.</p><p>\u201cRavi, can I get you something to drink?\u201d Ms. Rothschild chirps. \u201cWe have juice, Fresca, Diet Coke, water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Fresca?\u201d Ravi asks, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicious grapefruity soda. Zero calories! You have to try it!\u201d Margot watches as Ms. Rothschild goes to the kitchen and opens up the cabinet where we keep our cups. Filling a glass with ice, she calls out, \u201cMargot, what about you? Can I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Margot answers in a pleasant enough tone, but</p><p>I can tell she doesn\u2019t appreciate being offered a drink in her own home by someone who doesn\u2019t live there.</p><p>When Ms. Rothschild returns with Ravi\u2019s Fresca, she presents it to him with a flourish. He thanks her and takes a sip. \u201cVery refreshing,\u201d Ravi says, and she beams.</p><p>Daddy claps his hands together. \u201cShould we take the bags upstairs? Give you guys a chance to freshen up before dinner? We\u2019ve got the guest room all set up.\u201d He gives me a fond look before saying, \u201cLara Jean put in a new pair of slippers and a robe for you, Ravi.\u201d</p><p>Before Ravi can reply, Margot says, \u201cOh, that\u2019s so nice. But actually, I think Ravi\u2019s just going to stay with me in my room.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if Margot has dropped a stink bomb in the middle of our living room. Kitty and I are looking at each other with huge</p><p>OMG</p><p>eyes; Daddy just looks stunned and at a complete loss for words. When I made up the guest room for Ravi, folded a set of towels for him on the side of the bed, and put out the robe and slippers, it never occurred to me that he\u2019d be staying in Margot\u2019s room. Clearly, the thought never occurred to Daddy either.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s face is growing redder by the second. \u201cOh, um . . . I don\u2019t know if . . .\u201d</p><p>Margot purses her lips nervously as she waits for Daddy to finish his sentence. We\u2019re all waiting, but he can\u2019t seem to figure out what to say next. His eyes dart over to Ms. Rothschild for help, and she puts her hand on the small of his back in support.</p><p>Poor Ravi looks supremely uncomfortable. My first thought was that he was a Ravenclaw like Margot; now I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s a Hufflepuff like me. In a soft voice he says, \u201cI truly don\u2019t mind staying in the guest room. I\u2019d hate to make things awkward.\u201d</p><p>Daddy starts to answer him, but Margot gets there first. \u201cNo, it\u2019s totally fine,\u201d she assures Ravi. \u201cLet\u2019s go get the rest of our stuff out of the car.\u201d</p><p>The second they leave, Kitty and I turn to each other. At the same time we say, \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Kitty ponders, \u201cWhy do they need to stay in the same room together? Do they have to have sex that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Kitty,\u201d Daddy says, his tone sharper than I\u2019ve heard him use with her. He turns and leaves, and I hear the sound of his office door closing. His office is where he goes when he is really mad. Ms. Rothschild gives her a stern look and follows after him.</p><p>Kitty and I look at each other again. \u201cYikes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to snap,\u201d Kitty says sullenly. \u201cI\u2019m not the one whose boyfriend is staying in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d I tuck her against me, wrapping my arms around her bony shoulders. \u201cGogo has a lot of nerve, huh?\u201d She\u2019s very impressive, my sister. I just feel sorry for Daddy. This isn\u2019t a fight he\u2019s used to having\u2014or any kind of fight at all, really.</p><p>Of course I text Peter right away and tell all. He sends back a lot of wide-eyed emojis. And:</p><p>Do you think your dad would let us stay in the same room??</p><p>Which I ignore.</p><p>* *</p><p>When Ravi goes upstairs to wash up and change, Ms. Rothschild says she has dinner out with the girls, so she\u2019d better get going. I can tell Margot is relieved. After Ms. Rothschild leaves, Kitty takes Jamie Fox-Pickle for a walk, and Margot and I head to the kitchen to fix a salad to go with the chicken Daddy\u2019s roasting. I\u2019m eager to have a moment alone with her so we can talk about the whole sleeping-arrangements situation, but I don\u2019t get a chance to ask, because as soon we step into the kitchen, Margot hisses at me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Daddy and Ms. Rothschild are so serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she\u2019s over here for dinner almost every night!\u201d I whisper back. I start rinsing a basket of cherry tomatoes so the sound of the water running will give us cover.</p><p>\u201cShe was walking around like she lives here! And since when do we have Fresca? We\u2019ve never been a Fresca-drinking family.\u201d</p><p>I start slicing the tomatoes in half. \u201cShe loves it, so I always make sure to buy a case when I go to the store. It\u2019s actually very refreshing. Ravi seemed to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with Ms. Rothschild all of a sudden? You guys got along great when you were home for Christmas\u2014\u201d I break off as Daddy walks into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMargot, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Margot pretends to be busy counting out silverware. \u201cSure, what\u2019s up, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Daddy glances at me, and I look back down at the tomatoes.</p><p>I am staying for moral support. \u201cI would prefer if Ravi stayed in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>Margot bites her lip. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence before Daddy says, \u201cI\u2019m just not comfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Daddy, we\u2019re in college. . . . You do realize we\u2019ve shared a bed before, right?\u201d</p><p>Wryly he says, \u201cI had my suspicions, but thank you for that confirmation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost twenty years old. I\u2019ve been living away from home, thousands of miles away, for nearly two years.\u201d Margot glances over at me and I shrink down. I should\u2019ve left when I had the chance. \u201cLara Jean and I aren\u2019t little kids anymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t bring me into this,\u201d I say, as jokingly as I can.</p><p>Daddy sighs. \u201cMargot, if you\u2019re set on this, I\u2019m not going to stop you. But I would just remind you that this is still my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was</p><p>our</p><p>house.\u201d She knows she\u2019s won this battle, so she keeps her voice light as meringue.</p><p>\u201cWell, you freeloaders don\u2019t pay the mortgage on it, I do, so that should make it my house slightly more.\u201d With that final dad joke, he puts on oven mitts and takes the sizzling chicken out of the oven.</p><p>When we sit down to eat, Daddy stands at the head of the table and carves the chicken with the fancy new electric carving knife Ms. Rothschild got him for his birthday. \u201cRavi, can I offer you dark meat or white?\u201d</p><p>Ravi clears his throat. \u201cUm, I\u2019m so sorry, but I actually don\u2019t eat meat.\u201d</p><p>Daddy gives Margot a horrified look. \u201cMargot, you didn\u2019t tell me Ravi was a vegetarian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says, grimacing. \u201cI totally forgot. But Ravi loves salad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly do,\u201d he assures Daddy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Ravi\u2019s portion,\u201d I offer. \u201cI\u2019ll take two thighs.\u201d</p><p>Daddy saws off two thighs for me. \u201cRavi, tomorrow morning I\u2019m making you a mean breakfast enchilada. No meat!\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Margot says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to</p><p>DC</p><p>early tomorrow morning. Maybe the day he leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>Kitty is unnaturally subdued. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s nervousness from having a boy she doesn\u2019t know sit at her dining room table, or if it\u2019s just because she\u2019s getting older, and she\u2019s less a kid in the way she interacts with new people. Though I suppose a twenty-one-year-old boy is really more of a young man.</p><p>Ravi has such nice manners\u2014probably because he is English, and isn\u2019t it a fact that English people have better manners than Americans? He says sorry a lot. \u201cSorry, can I just . . .\u201d \u201cSorry?\u201d His accent is charming, I keep saying pardon so he\u2019ll speak again.</p><p>For my part, I try to lighten the mood with questions about England. I ask him why English people call private school public school, if his public school was anything like Hogwarts, if he\u2019s ever met the royal family. His answers are: because they are open to the paying public; they had head</p><p>boys and head girls and prefects but no Quidditch; and he once saw Prince William at Wimbledon, but only the back of his head.</p><p>After dinner, the plan is for Ravi, Margot, Peter, and me to go to the movies. Margot invites Kitty to come along, but she demurs, citing her homework as the reason. I think she\u2019s just nervous around Ravi.</p><p>I get ready in my room, dab a little perfume, a little lip balm, put on a sweatshirt over my cami and jeans because the theater gets cold. I\u2019m ready fast, but Margot\u2019s door is closed, and I can hear them talking quietly yet intensely. It\u2019s a strange thing to see her door closed. I feel like a little spy standing outside the door, but it\u2019s awkward, because who knows if Ravi has a shirt on, or what? It\u2019s so adult, that closed door, those hushed voices.</p><p>Through the door I clear my throat and say, \u201cAre you guys ready? I told Peter we\u2019d meet him at eight.\u201d</p><p>Margot opens the door. \u201cReady,\u201d she says, and she doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>Ravi steps out behind her, carrying his suitcase. \u201cI\u2019m just going to drop this off in the guest room, and then I\u2019m all set,\u201d he says.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, I whisper to Margot, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRavi didn\u2019t want to make a bad impression on Daddy by us staying in the same room. I told him it was fine, but he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very considerate of him.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t say so to</p><p>Margot, but it was totally the right move. Ravi just keeps rising in my estimation.</p><p>Reluctantly she says, \u201cHe\u2019s a very considerate guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally handsome, too.\u201d</p><p>A smile spreads across her face. \u201cAnd there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Peter\u2019s already at the movie theater when we arrive, I\u2019m sure because of Margot. He has no problem being late for me, but he would never dare be late for my big sister. Ravi buys all four of our tickets, which Peter is really impressed by. \u201cSuch a classy move,\u201d he whispers to me as we sit down. Peter deftly maneuvers it so we\u2019re sitting me, Peter, Ravi, Margot, so he can keep talking to him about soccer. Or football, as Ravi says. Margot gives me an amused look over their heads, and I can tell all the unpleasantness from before is forgotten.</p><p>After the movie, Peter suggests we go for frozen custards. \u201cHave you ever had frozen custard before?\u201d he asks Ravi.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Ravi says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best, Rav,\u201d he says. \u201cThey make it homemade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Ravi says.</p><p>When the boys are in line, Margot says to me, \u201cI think Peter\u2019s in love\u2014with my boyfriend,\u201d and we both giggle.</p><p>We\u2019re still laughing when they get back to our table. Peter hands me my pralines and cream. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head and dip my spoon into the custard.</p><p>Margot says, \u201cWait, we have to cheers my sister getting into William and Mary!\u201d</p><p>My smile feels frozen as everyone clinks their custard cups against mine. Ravi says, \u201cWell done, Lara Jean. Didn\u2019t Jon Stewart go there?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I say, \u201cWhy yes, yes he did. That\u2019s a pretty random fact to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRavi\u2019s specialty is random facts,\u201d Margot says, licking her spoon. \u201cDon\u2019t get him started on the mating habits of bonobos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo words,\u201d Ravi says. Then he looks from Peter to me and whispers, \u201cPenis fencing.\u201d</p><p>Margot\u2019s so lit up around Ravi. I once thought she and Josh were meant for each other, but now I\u2019m not so sure. When they talk about politics, they\u2019re both equally passionate, and they go back and forth, challenging each other but also conceding points. They\u2019re like two flints sparking. If they were on a</p><p>TV</p><p>show, I could see them as rival residents at a hospital who first grudgingly respect each other and then fall madly in love. Or two political aides at the White House, or two journalists. Ravi is studying bioengineering, which has not a lot to do with Margot\u2019s anthropology, but they sure make a great team.</p><p>* *</p><p>The next day, Margot takes Ravi to Washington,</p><p>DC</p><p>, and they visit a few of the museums on the Mall and the Lincoln Memorial and the White House. They invited Kitty and me to go along, but I said no on behalf of both of us because I was pretty sure they would want some time alone and because I wanted to be cozy at home and work on</p><p>my scrapbook for Peter. When they get back that night, I ask Ravi what his favorite thing to do in</p><p>DC</p><p>was, and he says the National Museum of African American History and Culture by far, which makes me regret my decision not to go, because I haven\u2019t been there yet.</p><p>We turn on a</p><p>BBC</p><p>show on Netflix that Margot has been raving about, and it was filmed near where Ravi grew up, so he points out landmark places like his first job and his first date. We eat ice cream right out of the cartons, and I can tell that Daddy likes Ravi by the way he keeps urging him to have more. I\u2019m sure he noticed that Ravi is staying in the guest room, and I\u2019m sure he appreciates the gesture. I hope Ravi and Margot keep dating, because I could see him in our family forever. Or at least stay together long enough for Margot and me to take a trip to London and stay at his house!</p><p>Ravi has to leave for Texas the next afternoon, and while I\u2019m sad to see him go, I\u2019m also a little bit glad, because then we get to have Margot all to ourselves before she leaves again.</p><p>When we say good-bye, I point at him and say, \u201cHufflepuff.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cYou got it in one.\u201d Then he points at me. \u201cHufflepuff?\u201d</p><p>I grin back. \u201cYou got it in one.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>That night we\u2019re in my bedroom watching</p><p>TV</p><p>on my laptop when Margot brings up college\u2014which is how I know that on some level she was waiting for Ravi to go too, so she</p><p>could talk to me about real things. Before we load the next episode, she looks over at me and says, \u201cCan we talk about</p><p>UVA</p><p>? How are you feeling about it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sad, but it\u2019s all right. I\u2019m still going to go there.\u201d Margot gives me a quizzical look, and I explain, \u201cI\u2019m going to transfer after freshman year. I talked to Mrs. Duvall, and she said if I got good grades at William and Mary, I would definitely get in as a transfer.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkles up. \u201cWhy are you talking about transferring from William and Mary when you aren\u2019t even there yet?\u201d When I don\u2019t answer right away, she says, \u201cIs this because of Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, it is, in part, but not completely.\u201d I hesitate before saying the thing I haven\u2019t said out loud. \u201cYou know that feeling, like you\u2019re meant to be somewhere? When I visited William and Mary, I didn\u2019t get that feeling. Not like with</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be that no school gives you the exact feeling you have with</p><p>UVA</p><p>,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so\u2014which is why I\u2019m going to transfer after a year.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to live a half life at William and Mary because the whole time you\u2019re wishing you were with Peter at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. The freshman-year experience is so important. You should at least give it a fair chance, Lara Jean. You might really love it there.\u201d She gives me a look heavy with meaning. \u201cRemember what Mommy said about college and boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>How could I forget?</p><p>Don\u2019t</p><p>be the girl who goes to college with a boyfriend</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I say.</p><p>Margot takes my laptop and goes on the William and Mary website. \u201cThis campus is so pretty. Look at this weather vane! It all looks like something out of an English village.\u201d</p><p>I perk up. \u201cYeah, it kind of does.\u201d Is it as pretty as</p><p>UVA</p><p>\u2019s campus? No, not to me, but then I don\u2019t think anywhere is as pretty as Charlottesville.</p><p>\u201cAnd look, William and Mary has a guacamole club. And a storm-watchers club. And oh my God! Something called a wizards-and-muggles club! It\u2019s the largest Harry Potter club at any</p><p>US</p><p>university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! That</p><p>is</p><p>pretty neat. Do they have a baking club?\u201d</p><p>She checks. \u201cNo. But you could start one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . That would be fun. . . .\u201d Maybe I</p><p>should</p><p>join a club or two.</p><p>She beams at me. \u201cSee? There\u2019s a lot to be excited about. And don\u2019t forget the Cheese Shop.\u201d</p><p>The Cheese Shop is a specialty food store right by campus, and they sell cheese, obviously, but also fancy jams and bread and wine and gourmet pastas. They make really great roast beef sandwiches with a house dressing\u2014a mayonnaisey mustard that I have tried to duplicate at home, but nothing tastes as good as in the shop, on their fresh bread. Daddy loves to stop at the Cheese Shop for new mustards and a sandwich. He\u2019d be happy to have an excuse to go there. And Kitty, she loves the Williamsburg outlet mall. They sell kettle corn there, and it\u2019s really addictive. They pop it right in front</p><p>of you, and the popcorn is so hot, it melts the bag a little.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could get a job in Colonial Williamsburg,\u201d I say, trying to get into the spirit. \u201cI could churn butter. Wear period garb. Like, a calico dress with an apron or whatever they wore in Colonial times. I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re not allowed to speak to each other in modern-day language, and kids are always trying to trip them up. That could be fun. The only thing is, I\u2019m not sure if they hire Asian people because of historical accuracy. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, we live in the time of</p><p>Hamilton</p><p>! Phillipa Soo is half-Chinese, remember? If she can play Eliza Hamilton, you can churn butter. And if they refuse to hire you, we\u2019ll put it on social media and make them.\u201d Margot tilts her head and looks at me. \u201cSee!

Margot\u2019s still jet-lagged, so she got up early and fixed scrambled eggs and bacon. I\u2019m luxuriously spreading eggs on buttered toast and listening to the rain tap on the roof, when I say, \u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t go to school today, and we did something fun?\u201d</p><p>Kitty brightens. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot you. You still have to go to school. I\u2019m basically done. No one cares if I go anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Daddy probably cares,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>\u201cBut if we could do anything . . . what would we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Margot bites into her bacon. \u201cWe\u2019d take the train to New York City and enter the</p><p>Hamilton</p><p>lottery, and we\u2019d win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t go without me,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, And Peggy,\u201d I say, giggling.</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cDon\u2019t call me And Peggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re talking about, so calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re cackling about it like a witch. Also, I do so know about</p><p>Hamilton</p><p>, because you play the soundtrack</p><p>all day long.\u201d She sings, \u201cTalk less; smile more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information, it\u2019s a cast recording, not a soundtrack,\u201d I say, and she makes a big show of rolling her eyes.</p><p>In truth, if Kitty\u2019s anyone, she\u2019s a Jefferson. Wily, stylish, quick with a comeback. Margot\u2019s an Angelica, no question. She\u2019s been sailing her own ship since she was a little girl. She\u2019s always known who she was and what she wanted. I suppose I\u2019m an Eliza, though I\u2019d much rather be an Angelica. In truth</p><p>I\u2019m</p><p>probably And Peggy. But I don\u2019t want to be the And Peggy of my own story. I want to be the Hamilton.</p><p>* *</p><p>It rains all day, so as soon as we get home from school, the first thing Kitty and I do is get back into our pajamas. Margot never got out of hers. She\u2019s wearing her glasses, her hair in a knot at the top of her head (it\u2019s too short to stay put), Kitty is in a big tee, and I\u2019m happy it\u2019s cold enough to wear my red flannels. Daddy is the only one still in his day clothes.</p><p>We order two large pizzas for dinner that night, plain cheese (for Kitty) and a supreme with the works. We\u2019re on the living room couch, shoving oozy slices of pizza into our mouths, when Daddy suddenly says, \u201cGirls, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\u201d He clears his throat like he does when he\u2019s nervous. Kitty and I exchange a curious look, and then he blurts out, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask Trina to marry me.\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands to my mouth. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes bulge, her mouth goes slack, and then she flings her pizza aside and lets out a shriek so loud that Jamie Fox-</p><p>Pickle jumps. She catapults herself at Daddy, who laughs. I jump up and hug his back.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop smiling. Until I look at Margot, whose face is completely blank. Daddy\u2019s looking at her too, eyes hopeful and nervous. \u201cMargot? You still there? What do you think, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAbsolutely. I think Trina\u2019s great. And Kitty, you adore her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kitty\u2019s too busy squealing and flopping around on the couch with Jamie to answer. Softly, Margot says, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Daddy. I really am.\u201d</p><p>The</p><p>absolutely</p><p>is what gives her away. Daddy\u2019s too busy being relieved to notice, but I do. Of course it\u2019s weird for her. She\u2019s still getting used to seeing Ms. Rothschild in our kitchen. She hasn\u2019t gotten to see all the ways Ms. Rothschild and Daddy make sense. To Margot, she\u2019s still just our neighbor who used to wear terry-cloth booty shorts and a bikini top to mow the lawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your guys\u2019s help with the proposal,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cLara Jean, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have some ideas for me, right?\u201d</p><p>Confidently I say, \u201cOh, yeah. People have been doing promposals, so I have lots of inspiration.\u201d</p><p>Margot turns to me and laughs, and it almost sounds real. \u201cI\u2019m sure Daddy will want something more dignified than \u2018Will You Marry Me\u2019 written in shaving cream on the hood of somebody\u2019s car, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromposals have gotten way more sophisticated than in your day, Gogo,\u201d I say. I\u2019m playing along, teasing her so she</p><p>can feel normal again after the bomb Daddy just dropped.</p><p>\u201c</p><p>My</p><p>day? I\u2019m only two years ahead of you.\u201d She tries to sound light, but I can hear the strain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cTwo years is like dog years when it comes to high school. Isn\u2019t that right, Kitty?\u201d I pull her toward me and hug her tight to my chest. She squirms away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, both of you guys are ancient beings,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cCan I be a part of the proposal too, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I can\u2019t get married without you guys.\u201d He looks teary. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Kitty is hopping up and down like a little kid. \u201cYeah!\u201d she cheers. She\u2019s over the moon, and Margot sees it too, how important this is to her.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to propose?\u201d Margot asks.</p><p>\u201cTonight!\u201d Kitty pipes up.</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cNo! That\u2019s not enough time to think up the perfect way. We need a week at least. Plus you don\u2019t even have a ring. Wait a minute, do you?\u201d</p><p>Daddy takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes. \u201cOf course not. I wanted to wait and talk to you girls first. I want all three of you to be here for the proposal, so I\u2019ll do it when you come back for the summer, Margot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too far away,\u201d Kitty objects.</p><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t wait that long, Daddy,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to help me pick out the ring at least,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean has a better eye for that kind of thing,\u201d Margot says serenely. \u201cBesides, I barely know Ms. Rothschild. I</p><p>haven\u2019t a clue what kind of ring she\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>A shadow crosses over Daddy\u2019s face. It\u2019s the</p><p>I barely know Ms. Rothschild</p><p>that put it there.</p><p>I rush to put on my best Hermione voice. \u201cYou \u2018haven\u2019t a clue\u2019?\u201d I tease. \u201cP.S., did you know you\u2019re still American, Gogo? We don\u2019t talk as classy as that in America.\u201d</p><p>She laughs; we all do. Then, because I think she saw that brief shadow too, she says, \u201cMake sure to take tons of pictures so I can see.\u201d</p><p>Gratefully Daddy says, \u201cWe will. We\u2019ll videotape it, whatever it is. God, I hope she says yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll say yes, of course she\u2019ll say yes,\u201d we all chorus.</p><p>* *</p><p>Margot and I are wrapping slices of pizza in plastic and then double wrapping in foil. \u201cI told you guys two pizzas would be too much,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cKitty will eat it for her after-school snack,\u201d I say. \u201cSo will Peter.\u201d I glance toward the living room, where Kitty and Daddy are snuggled up on the couch, watching</p><p>TV</p><p>. Then I whisper, \u201cSo how do you really feel about Daddy asking Ms. Rothschild to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s completely bonkers,\u201d she whispers back. \u201cShe lives across the street, for pity\u2019s sake. They can just date like two grown-ups. What\u2019s the point of getting</p><p>married</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they just want it to be official. Or maybe it\u2019s for Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t even been dating that long! How long has it been, six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little longer than that. But Gogo, they\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d</p><p>She stacks up the slices of foiled pizza and says, \u201cCan you imagine how weird it\u2019ll be to have her living here?\u201d</p><p>Her question gives me pause. Ms. Rothschild</p><p>is</p><p>at the house a lot, but that\u2019s not the same as living here. She has her own ways of doing things, and so do we. Like, she wears shoes at her house, but we don\u2019t wear them here, so she takes them off when she comes over. And, now that I think about it, she\u2019s never slept over here before; she always goes back home at the end of the night. So that might feel a little weird. Also, she stores bread in the refrigerator, which I hate, and to be quite honest, her dog Simone sheds a lot and has been known to pee on the carpet. But the thing is, since I\u2019m not going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, I won\u2019t be around much longer\u2014I\u2019ll be away at college. \u201cNeither of us will be living here full-time though,\u201d I say at last. \u201cJust Kitty, and Kitty\u2019s thrilled to death.\u201d</p><p>Margot doesn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cYes, they do seem really close.\u201d She goes to the freezer and makes space for the pizza, and with her back facing me she says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we have to go prom-dress shopping before I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, okay!\u201d It feels like two seconds ago that we were shopping for Margot\u2019s prom dress, and now it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>Daddy, who I didn\u2019t realize had walked into the kitchen, pipes up with, \u201cHey, maybe Trina could go too?\u201d He casts a hopeful look my way. I\u2019m not the one he should be looking at. I already love Ms. Rothschild. It\u2019s Margot she has to win over.</p><p>I look over at Margot, who is giving me wide panic eyes. \u201cUm . . . ,\u201d I say. \u201cI think it should just be a Song girls thing this time.\u201d</p><p>Daddy nods like he understands. \u201cAh. Got it.\u201d Then he says to Margot, \u201cCan the two of us spend a little daughter-dad time together before you leave? Maybe take our bikes on a trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she says.</p><p>When his back is turned, Margot mouths,</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I feel disloyal to Ms. Rothschild, but Margot is my sister. I have to be on her side.</p><p>* *</p><p>I think maybe Margot\u2019s feeling guilty about cutting Ms. Rothschild out of the dress shopping expedition, because she keeps trying to make it more of a thing. When we go to the mall the next day after school, she announces that we\u2019ll each pick two dresses, and I have to try all of them on no matter what, and then we\u2019ll rate them. She even printed out thumbs-up and thumbs-down emojis and made paddles for us to use.</p><p>It\u2019s cramped in the dressing room, and there are dresses everywhere. Margot gives Kitty the job of rehanging and organizing, but Kitty\u2019s already given it up in favor of playing Candy Crush on Margot\u2019s phone.</p><p>Margot hands me one of her picks first\u2014it\u2019s a flowy black dress with fluttery cap sleeves. \u201cYou could do your hair up for this one.\u201d</p><p>Without looking up, Kitty says, \u201cI would go with beachy waves.\u201d</p><p>Margot makes a face at her in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs black really me, though?\u201d I wonder.</p><p>\u201cYou should try wearing black more often,\u201d Margot says. \u201cIt really suits you.\u201d</p><p>Kitty picks at a scab on her leg. \u201cWhen I go to prom, I\u2019m going to wear a tight leather dress,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt can get hot in Virginia in May,\u201d I say, as Margot zips me up. \u201cYou could wear a leather dress to homecoming though, since it\u2019s in October.\u201d</p><p>We study my reflection in the mirror. The dress is too big in the bodice, and the black makes me look like a witch, but a witch in an ill-fitting dress.</p><p>\u201cI think you need bigger boobs for that dress,\u201d Kitty says. She holds up the thumbs-down paddle.</p><p>I frown at her in the mirror. She\u2019s right, though. \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mommy have big boobs?\u201d Kitty asks suddenly.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I think they were on the small side,\u201d Margot says. \u201cLike an A?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat size do you wear?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cA B.\u201d</p><p>Eyeing me, Kitty says, \u201cAnd Lara Jean\u2019s small like Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m practically a B!\u201d I protest. \u201cI\u2019m a large A. An almost B. Somebody unzip me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTree has big boobs,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cAre they real?\u201d Margot asks as she pulls down my zipper.</p><p>I step out of the dress and hand it over to Kitty to hang. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re real. I\u2019ve seen her in a bikini, and hers spread when she\u2019s lying down, and that\u2019s how you know. The fake</p><p>ones stay in place like scoops of ice cream.\u201d Kitty picks up Margot\u2019s phone again. \u201cAlso, I asked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were fake, I doubt she\u2019d tell you that,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>Kitty frowns at her. \u201cTree doesn\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019d lie; I\u2019m saying she might be private about plastic surgery! Which is her right!\u201d Kitty just shrugs coolly.</p><p>I quickly put on the next dress to get off the subject of Ms. Rothschild\u2019s boobs. \u201cWhat do you guys think of this one?\u201d</p><p>They both shake their heads and reach for the thumbs-down paddle at the same time. At least they are united in their dislike of my dress.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my pick? Try mine on next.\u201d Kitty\u2019s pick is a skin-tight, white, off-the-shoulder bandage dress I would never in a million years wear, and she knows it. \u201cI just want to see it on you.\u201d</p><p>I try it on to appease her, and Kitty insists it\u2019s the best dress of all the dresses, because she wants to have the winning pick. In the end, none of the dresses are my style, but I\u2019m not bothered by it. Prom is still more than a month away, and I want to scour vintage shops before I commit to anything from a regular store. I like the idea of a lived-in dress, a dress that has gone places, seen things, a dress that a girl like Stormy might\u2019ve worn to a dance.</p><p>When Margot leaves for Scotland the next morning, she makes me promise to send pictures of potential dresses so she can weigh in. She doesn\u2019t say another word about Ms. Rothschild, but then, she wouldn\u2019t, because that\u2019s not her style. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>LUCAS SAYS, \u201cI THINK PROM</p><p>is a lot like New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d He and Chris and I are hanging out in the nurse\u2019s office, because she is out to lunch, and she doesn\u2019t care if we lie on her couch. Since we\u2019re so far into senior year, all the teachers are in a pretty generous mood.</p><p>\u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve is for basics,\u201d Chris sneers, picking at her nails.</p> <p>\u201cWill you let me finish?\u201d Lucas sighs and begins again. \u201cAs I was</p><p>saying</p><p>, prom buckles under the weight of all the expectations you put on it. One perfect high school night that every American teenager is supposed to have. You spend all this time and money and you feel obligated\u2014no,</p><p>owed</p> <p>an epic night. What can possibly live up to that amount of pressure?\u201d</p><p>I think the perfect high school night will end up being some random little nothing moment that you didn\u2019t plan or expect; it just happened. I think I\u2019ve already had like twelve perfect high school nights, with Peter, so I don\u2019t need prom to be epic. When I picture my prom night, I picture Peter in a tux, being polite to my dad, putting a corsage on Kitty. All of us taking a picture by the mantel. I make a mental note to ask Peter to get an extra little corsage for her.</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean you aren\u2019t going?\u201d I ask Lucas.</p><p>He sighs again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no one here I would even want to go with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t going with Peter, I would ask you,\u201d I say. Then I look from Lucas to Chris. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you guys go together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to prom,\u201d Chris says. \u201cI\u2019ll probably go clubbing in</p><p>DC</p><p>with my Applebee\u2019s people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, you can\u2019t not go to prom. You can go clubbing with your Applebee\u2019s friends anytime. We only get one senior prom.\u201d</p><p>My birthday\u2019s the day after prom and I\u2019m a little hurt that Chris seems to have forgotten. If she goes clubbing in</p><p>DC</p><p>, she\u2019ll probably stay all weekend and I won\u2019t even see her on my actual birthday.</p><p>\u201cProm\u2019s going to be lame. No offense. I mean, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have fun, Lara Jean; you\u2019re going with the prom king. And what\u2019s that girl\u2019s name you\u2019re friends with now? Tammy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPammy,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be fun if you\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>She puts her arm around me. \u201cAww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always said we\u2019d go to prom together and watch the sun rise over the elementary school playground!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can watch it with Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Chris says. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to lose your V that night anyway, so I\u2019ll be the last thing you\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on having sex on prom night!\u201d I hiss.</p><p>My eyes dart over at Lucas, who is looking at me, bug-eyed.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean . . . you and Kavinsky haven\u2019t had sex yet?\u201d</p><p>I look to make sure no one\u2019s in the hallway listening. \u201cNo, but please don\u2019t tell anybody. Not that I\u2019m ashamed of it or anything. I just don\u2019t want everyone knowing my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, obviously, but wow,\u201d he says, still sounding shocked. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so wow?\u201d I ask him, and I can feel my cheeks warming.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so . . . hot.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why having sex on prom night is a thing,\u201d Chris says. \u201cI mean, yes, it\u2019s tradition, but also, everybody\u2019s dressed up, you get to stay out all night . . . Most of these people will never look as good as they do on prom night, grooming-wise, and that\u2019s sad. All these lemmings getting their manis and their pedis and their blowouts. So basic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get blowouts?\u201d Lucas says.</p><p>Chris rolls her eyes. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I say, \u201cThen why are you judging other people for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, that\u2019s not my point here. My point is . . .\u201d She frowns. \u201cWait, what were we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlowouts, manis, lemmings?\u201d Lucas says.</p><p>\u201cBefore that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cRight! My point is, losing your virginity on prom night</p><p>is a clich\u00e9, but clich\u00e9s are clich\u00e9s for a reason. There\u2019s a practicality to it. You get to stay out all night, you look great, et cetera, et cetera. It just makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having sex for the first time because it\u2019s convenient and my hair looks good, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know for sure, but I imagine my first time will probably be at college, in my own room, as an adult. It\u2019s hard to imagine it happening now, at home, when I\u2019m Lara Jean the sister and the daughter. At college, I\u2019ll just be Lara Jean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S DECIDED THAT DADDY WILL</p><p>propose to Ms. Rothschild on Saturday, after hiking on one of their favorite trails. He\u2019s going to do it right by a waterfall. The plan is for Peter and Kitty and me to hide behind trees and record the whole thing, then pop out with a romantic picnic basket. Daddy was nervous about the video part, in case Ms. Rothschild doesn\u2019t say yes, but Kitty begged. \u201cIt\u2019s for Margot,\u201d she kept saying, when really she\u2019s just nosy and wants to see it go down. Of course I do too. Peter\u2019s along for the ride, literally. He\u2019s giving us a ride.</p><p>That morning, before he leaves to pick up Ms. Rothschild, Daddy says, \u201cGuys, if it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be a yes, can you stop videotaping?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m carefully wrapping roast beef sandwiches in wax paper. I look up to say, \u201cShe\u2019s going to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll quietly slip away,\u201d he says. He gives Kitty a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Dr. Covey,\u201d Peter says, lifting his hand for a high five.</p><p>As they slap hands, I say, \u201cDaddy, did you pack the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Then he frowns. \u201cWait, did I?\u201d He pats his pockets and unzips the inside compartment of his windbreaker. \u201cDamn, I forgot it!\u201d Then he runs upstairs.</p><p>Peter and I exchange a look. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen your dad so stressed out,\u201d he says, popping a grape in his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s usually a cool customer.\u201d</p><p>I slap Peter\u2019s hand away from the grapes.</p><p>Kitty steals a grape and says, \u201cHe\u2019s been like this all week.\u201d</p><p>Daddy runs back downstairs with the engagement ring. Kitty and I helped him pick it out. It\u2019s a white-gold princess cut with a diamond halo. I was certain about the princess cut and Kitty was certain about the halo.</p><p>Daddy heads off to pick up Ms. Rothschild, and I finish putting together the picnic basket. I\u2019m glad to have an excuse to bring it out. I bought it from a yard sale ages ago, and I haven\u2019t used it once. I pack a bottle of champagne, a perfect cluster of grapes, the sandwiches, a wedge of Brie, crackers.</p><p>\u201cPack a bottle of water, too,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be dehydrated from the hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd probably from all the crying after she says yes,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cShould we play some music for them, when he gets down on one knee?\u201d Peter suggests.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that part of the plan, and Daddy\u2019s nervous enough as it is,\u201d I say. \u201cHe can\u2019t be thinking about how we\u2019re hiding in the bushes waiting to cue up music for them. It\u2019ll make him self-conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, we can add the music in post,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cWe need to be able to hear the dialogue.\u201d</p><p>I give her a look. \u201cKatherine, this isn\u2019t a movie. This is real life.\u201d</p><p>I leave them to go to the downstairs bathroom, and after I wash my hands, I\u2019m turning off the faucet when I hear Kitty say, \u201cPeter, when Lara Jean\u2019s gone, will you still come visit me sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you guys break up?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cWe\u2019re not breaking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you do?\u201d she presses.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She ignores this. \u201cBecause we never see Josh anymore, and he said he\u2019d visit too.\u201d</p><p>Peter scoffs. \u201cAre you kidding me? You think I\u2019m the same as Sanderson?</p><p>Me?</p><p>I\u2019m a completely different league than him. I\u2019m insulted you would even compare us.\u201d</p><p>Kitty lets out a relieved kind of laugh, the kind that sounds more like a sigh. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, kid. You and I have our own thing.\u201d</p><p>I love him so much for that I could cry. He\u2019ll look after Kitty for me, I know he will.</p><p>* *</p><p>Daddy told us they\u2019d get to the waterfall around noon, so we should be there by eleven forty-five to get into position. We end up going a little earlier than that, just to be on the safe side, at Kitty\u2019s insistence.</p><p>We pick a hiding spot far enough away that Ms. Rothschild won\u2019t spot us, but close enough to see. Kitty and I hide behind a tree, and Peter crouches behind one close by, phone in his hand, ready to record. Kitty wanted to be</p><p>the one to do it, but I make the executive decision that it should be Peter, because he isn\u2019t as emotionally invested in this moment and will have a steady hand.</p><p>Just after twelve, they come up the trail. Ms. Rothschild is laughing about something, and Daddy is laughing robotically with that same nervous look on his face. It\u2019s funny to watch them interact when she doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re watching. Kitty was right; it is a bit like a movie. He looks somehow younger next to her\u2014maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in love. They walk over to the waterfall, and Ms. Rothschild sighs with happiness. \u201cGod, it\u2019s gorgeous up here,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI can barely hear anything,\u201d Kitty whispers to me. \u201cThe waterfall is too loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. You\u2019re the one being loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture,\u201d Daddy says, fishing around in his windbreaker pocket.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were morally opposed to selfies!\u201d She laughs. \u201cHold on, let me try and fix my hair for this momentous occasion.\u201d She pulls her hair out of its ponytail holder and tries to fluff it up. Then she pops what looks like a cough drop or a piece of candy in her mouth.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s taking so long that for a second I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s lost the ring or his nerve, but then he gets down on one knee. Daddy clears his throat. It\u2019s happening. I grab Kitty\u2019s hand and squeeze it. Her eyes are shining. My heart is bursting.</p><p>\u201cTrina, I never expected to fall in love again. I thought I got my shot, and I was okay with that, because I had my girls. I didn\u2019t realize anything was missing. Then came you.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Rothschild\u2019s hands are covering her mouth. She has tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want to spend the rest of my life with you, Trina.\u201d Ms. Rothschild starts choking on her candy, and Daddy leaps up off his knee and starts pounding her on the back. She\u2019s coughing like crazy.</p><p>From his tree Peter whispers, \u201cShould I go do the Heimlich on her? I know how to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, my dad\u2019s a doctor!\u201d I whisper back. \u201cHe\u2019s got it.\u201d</p><p>As her coughing subsides, she stands up straight and wipes her eyes. \u201cWait. Were you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She claps her hands to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re all right, or yes, you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d Daddy asks her, and he\u2019s only half kidding.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you!\u201d she screams, and Daddy reaches for her, and they kiss.</p><p>\u201cThis feels private,\u201d I whisper to Kitty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the show,\u201d she whispers back.</p><p>Daddy hands Ms. Rothschild the ring box. I can\u2019t quite make out what he says next, but whatever it was, it makes her double over laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d Kitty asks me, just as Peter says, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear! Both of you be quiet! You\u2019re ruining the video!\u201d</p><p>Which is when Ms. Rothschild looks over in our direction.</p><p>Shoot.</p><p>We all pop back behind our respective trees, and then I hear Daddy\u2019s wry voice call out, \u201cYou can come out, guys. She said yes!\u201d</p><p>We run out from behind the trees; Kitty launches herself into Ms. Rothschild\u2019s arms. They fall over onto the grass, and Ms. Rothschild is laughing breathlessly, her laughter echoing through the woods. I hug Daddy, and meanwhile Peter\u2019s still playing videographer, recording the moment for posterity like the good boyfriend he is.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d I ask, looking up at my dad.</p><p>His eyes brimming with tears, he nods and hugs me tighter.</p><p>And just like that, our little family grows bigger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S THE FIRST NIGHT WE\u2019VE</p><p>all been together for dinner since the engagement, and Daddy\u2019s in the kitchen making a salad. Us girls are sitting in the living room just hanging out. Kitty is doing her homework; Ms. Rothschild is sipping on a glass of white wine. It\u2019s all very mellow\u2014perfect timing for me to bring up wedding business. I\u2019ve spent the last week working on a mood board for Daddy and Ms. Rothschild\u2019s wedding:</p><p>Pride and Prejudice</p><p>the movie, a whole wall of roses for the photo-booth area,</p> <p>The Virgin Suicides</p><p>, wine-bottle floral centerpieces as a nod to Charlottesville wineries.</p><p>When I present it to Ms. Rothschild on my laptop, she looks vaguely alarmed. She sets down her wine glass and looks closer at the screen. \u201cThis is beautiful, Lara Jean. Really lovely. You\u2019ve put a lot of time into this!\u201d</p><p>So much time, in fact, that I skipped Peter\u2019s lacrosse game this week, plus a movie night at Pammy\u2019s. But this is important. Of course I don\u2019t say any of this out loud; I just smile a beatific smile. \u201cDoes this vision feel in line with what you were thinking?</p><p>\u201cWell . . . to be honest, I think we were thinking we\u2019d just go to the justice of the peace. Selling my house and figuring out how I\u2019m going to fit all my junk in here is enough of a headache already.\u201d</p><p>Daddy comes out with the wooden salad bowl in his hands. Dryly he says, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying marrying me is a headache?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying, Dan! It\u2019s not like you have the time to plan a big wedding either.\u201d She takes a sip of wine and turns to me. \u201cYour dad and I have both been married before, so neither of us feels like making a big fuss. I\u2019ll probably just wear a dress I already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf</p><p>course</p><p>we should make a big fuss. Do you know how many years it took Daddy to find someone who\u2019d eat his cooking and watch his documentaries?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cMs. Rothschild, you\u2019re a miracle. For that we</p><p>have</p><p>to celebrate.\u201d I call out to my dad, who\u2019s disappeared back into the kitchen. \u201cDid you hear that, Daddy? Ms. Rothschild wants to go to</p><p>city hall</p> <p>. Please disabuse her of this notion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please stop calling me Ms. Rothschild? Now that I\u2019m going to be your wicked stepmother, you should at least call me Trina. Or Tree. Whatever feels right to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Stepmother?\u201d I suggest, all innocence. \u201cThat feels pretty right.\u201d</p><p>She swats at me. \u201cGirl! I will cut you.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, I dart away from her. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the wedding. I don\u2019t know if this is a sensitive issue or not, but did you keep your old wedding photos? I want to see what your bridal style was.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Rothschild pulls a terrible face. \u201cI think I threw out everything. I might have a picture tucked in an album somewhere. Thank God I got married before social media</p><p>was a thing. Can you imagine, getting divorced and having to take down all your wedding pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad luck to talk about divorce when you\u2019re planning your wedding?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWell then, we\u2019re already doomed.\u201d I must look alarmed because she says, \u201cI\u2019m kidding! I\u2019ll hunt around for a wedding picture to show you if you want, but honestly, I\u2019m not real proud of it. Smoky eye was the thing back then, and I took it a little too far. Plus I did that early two thousands thing with the chocolate lip liner and the frosted lip.\u201d</p><p>I try to keep my face neutral. \u201cRight, okay. What about your dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-shoulder, with a mermaid style skirt. It made my butt look amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit judging me!\u201d</p><p>Daddy puts his hand on Ms. Rothschild\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat if we did it here at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in the backyard?\u201d She considers this. \u201cI think that could be nice. A little barbecue, just family and a few friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t have any friends,\u201d Kitty says from across the living room, her math book in her lap.</p><p>Daddy frowns at her. \u201cI do too have friends. I have Dr. Kang from the hospital, and there\u2019s Marjorie, and Aunt D. But er, yes, it would be a small group on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus Nana,\u201d Kitty says, and both Daddy and Ms. Rothschild look nervous at the mention of Nana. Daddy\u2019s mother isn\u2019t the friendliest person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Grandma,\u201d I throw in.</p><p>Grandma and Ms. Rothschild met at Thanksgiving, and while Daddy didn\u2019t explicitly introduce her as his girlfriend, Grandma is shrewd and she doesn\u2019t miss a thing. She gave Ms. Rothschild the third degree, asking if she had any kids of her own, how long she\u2019d been divorced, if she had any student-loan debt. Ms. Rothschild held up pretty well, and when I walked Grandma out to the car to say good-bye, she said Ms. Rothschild was \u201cnot bad.\u201d She said she dressed young for her age, but she also said that Ms. Rothschild had a lot of energy and a brightness to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already done the big wedding thing,\u201d Ms. Rothschild says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be small on my side too. A few friends from college, Shelly from work. My sister Jeanie, my SoulCycle friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we be your bridesmaids?\u201d Kitty asks, and Ms. Rothschild laughs.</p><p>\u201cKitty! You can\u2019t just ask that.\u201d But I turn to Ms. Rothschild, waiting to hear what she will say.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says. \u201cLara Jean, would you be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be honored,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo you three girls, and my friend Kristen, because she\u2019ll kill me if I don\u2019t ask her.\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands together. \u201cNow that that\u2019s settled, let\u2019s get back to the dress. If it\u2019s going to be a backyard wedding, I feel like your dress should reflect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it has sleeves so my bat wings don\u2019t flap around,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMs. Roth\u2014I mean, Trina, you don\u2019t have bat wings,\u201d I say. She\u2019s very in shape from all her Pilates and SoulCycle.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cWhat are bat wings? That sounds gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Kitty obeys, and Ms. Rothschild lifts her arm and stretches it out; then at the last second she grabs Kitty and tickles her. Kitty\u2019s dying laughing, and so is Ms. Rothschild.</p><p>Breathlessly she says, \u201cGross? That\u2019ll teach you to call your wicked stepmother-to-be gross!\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks as happy as I\u2019ve ever seen him.</p><p>* *</p><p>Later that night in our bathroom, Kitty\u2019s brushing her teeth, and I\u2019m scrubbing my face with a new exfoliant I ordered off a Korean beauty site. It\u2019s walnut shells and blueberry. \u201cMason jars and gingham\u2014but elegant,\u201d I muse.</p><p>\u201cMason jars are played out,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cLook on Pinterest. Literally everybody does Mason jars.\u201d</p><p>Her words do have the ring of truth. \u201cWell, I\u2019m definitely wearing a flower crown on my head. I don\u2019t care if you say it\u2019s played out.\u201d</p><p>Flatly she says, \u201cYou can\u2019t wear a flower crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She spits out toothpaste. \u201cYou\u2019re too old. That\u2019s for flower girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t envisioning it correctly. I wasn\u2019t thinking baby\u2019s breath. I was thinking little pink and peach roses, with a lot of greenery. Pale green greenery, you know that kind?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, resolute. \u201cWe aren\u2019t fairies in a forest. It\u2019s too cutesy. And I know Gogo\u2019s going to agree with me.\u201d</p><p>I have a sinking feeling she will too. I decide to put this argument aside for now. It won\u2019t be won today. \u201cFor dresses, I was thinking we could wear vintage. Not off-white, but tea-stained white. Sort of nightgown-style. Very ethereal\u2014not fairy, more like celestial being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing a tuxedo.\u201d</p><p>I nearly choke. \u201cA what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tuxedo. With matching Converse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d</p><p>Kitty shrugs.</p><p>\u201cKitty, this wedding isn\u2019t black tie. A tuxedo isn\u2019t going to look right at a backyard wedding! The three of us should match, like a set! The Song girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told Tree and Daddy, and they both love the idea of me in a tux, so get over it.\u201d She\u2019s got that look on her face, the obstinate look she gets when she\u2019s really digging her heels in. Like a bull.</p><p>\u201cAt the very least you should wear a seersucker suit, then. It will be too hot for a tuxedo, and seersucker breathes.\u201d I feel like I\u2019ve made a concession here, so she should too, but no.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide everything, Lara Jean. It\u2019s not your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>I reach out to shake her, but she flounces off before I can. Over her shoulder, she calls out, \u201cWorry about your own life!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S AN EARLY-RELEASE DAY AND</p><p>I\u2019m hurrying down the hallway to meet Peter at his locker when Mrs. Duvall stops me. \u201cLara Jean! Are you coming to the mixer this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d I don\u2019t remember hearing anything about a mixer.</p> <p>She tsks me. \u201cI sent you a reminder e-mail last week! It\u2019s a little get-together for local students who were accepted to William and Mary. There\u2019ll be a few of you from our school, but lots of other schools too. It\u2019s a nice opportunity for you to meet some people before you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d I did see that e-mail, but I forgot all about it. \u201cI would love to go, but I can\u2019t because I have a . . . um, family obligation.\u201d</p><p>Which is, technically, true. Peter and I are going to an estate sale in Richmond\u2014he has to pick up end tables for his mom\u2019s antiques store, and I\u2019m looking for a cake table for Daddy and Trina\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Mrs. Duvall gives me a lingering look and says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be another one. A lot of people would kill to be in your spot, Lara Jean, but I\u2019m sure you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I assure her, and then I scuttle off to meet Peter.</p><p>The estate sale turns out to be a bust\u2014for me, anyway.</p><p>Peter picks up the end tables, but I don\u2019t see anything appropriate for an ethereal backyard wedding. There\u2019s one chest of drawers that is a possibility, if I painted it, maybe, or stenciled some rosebuds on it, but it costs three hundred dollars, and I have a feeling Daddy and Trina would balk at the price. I take a picture of it just in case.</p><p>Peter and I go to a place I read about on the Internet called Croaker\u2019s Spot, where we get fried fish and buttery cornbread dripping in sweet sauce. \u201cRichmond\u2019s cool,\u201d he says, wiping sauce off his chin. \u201cToo bad William and Mary isn\u2019t in Richmond. It\u2019s closer to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust by thirty minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway I was thinking about it, and it won\u2019t even be a full year until I\u2019m at</p> <p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d I start counting the months off my fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s really like nine months. And I\u2019ll be home for winter break, and then we have spring break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he says.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I get home, it\u2019s dark out, and Daddy, Trina, and Kitty are at the kitchen table finishing up dinner. Daddy starts to get up when I walk in. \u201cSit down, I\u2019ll fix you a plate,\u201d he says. With a wink he says, \u201cTrina made her lemon chicken.\u201d</p><p>Trina\u2019s lemon chicken is just chicken breasts with lemon seasoning cooked in Pam, but it\u2019s her specialty and it\u2019s pretty good. Sliding into a seat, I say, \u201cNo thanks, I just ate a ton of food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they serve dinner at the mixer?\u201d Daddy asks, sitting back down. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about the mixer?\u201d I ask him, leaning down to pet Trina\u2019s dog Simone, who followed me into the kitchen and is now sitting at my feet, hoping for a crumb.</p><p>\u201cThey sent an invitation in the mail. I put it on the fridge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, whoops. I didn\u2019t go. I went to Richmond with Peter to look for a cake table for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Daddy frowns. \u201cYou went all the way to Richmond on a school night? For a cake table?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. I quickly pull out my phone to show them. \u201cIt\u2019s a little expensive, but we could have the drawers kind of half-open, bursting with roses. Even if we didn\u2019t get this exact one, if you like it, I\u2019m sure I could find something similar to it.\u201d</p><p>Daddy leans in to look. \u201cDrawers of roses bursting out? That sounds very expensive and not exactly ecologically responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I suppose we could do daisies, but it doesn\u2019t really have the same effect.\u201d I cast a look over at Kitty before continuing. \u201cI want to circle back on the bridesmaid dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, I want to circle back on you skipping out on your college mixer to go to Richmond,\u201d Daddy interjects.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Daddy, I\u2019m sure there will be a million of them before fall,\u201d I tell him. \u201cKitty, about the bridesmaid dresses\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without even looking up, Kitty says, \u201cYou just wear the nightgown outfit on your own.\u201d</p><p>I choose to ignore the fact that she called it a nightgown outfit and say, \u201cIt won\u2019t look right if it\u2019s just me. The beauty of it is the set. All of us matching, very ethereal, like angels.</p><p>Then it becomes a look, a moment. If I wear it on my own it won\u2019t work. It needs to be all three of us.\u201d I don\u2019t know how many more times I have to say the word \u201cethereal\u201d to make people understand what the vibe of this wedding is.</p><p>Kitty says, \u201cIf you want to be a set, you\u2019re welcome to wear a tux too. I would be fine with that.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath to keep from screaming at her. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just see what Margot says about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot won\u2019t care either way.\u201d</p><p>Kitty gets up to put her plate in the sink, and when her back is turned, I raise my hands like I\u2019m going to strangle her. \u201cSaw that,\u201d she says. I swear, she has eyes in the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cTrina, what do you think?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I could care less what you guys wear, but you\u2019re going to have to run it by Margot and Kristen. They might have their own ideas.\u201d</p><p>Delicately I say, \u201cJust</p><p>FYI</p><p>, it\u2019s \u2018I couldn\u2019t care less,\u2019 not \u2018I could care less.\u2019 Because if you could, then you are technically caring.\u201d</p><p>Trina rolls her eyes, and Kitty slides back into her chair and says, \u201cWhy are you like this, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>I shove her in the side. To Trina I say, \u201cKristen is a grown woman, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine with whatever us kids do. She\u2019s an adult.\u201d</p><p>Trina doesn\u2019t look so sure. \u201cShe won\u2019t want anything that shows her arms. She\u2019ll try to convince you to put a matching cardigan on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>Trina puts her hands up. \u201cYou have to take it up with Kristen. Like I said, I could care less.\u201d She crosses her eyes at me, and I laugh and so does Kitty.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, can we talk more about this mixer you didn\u2019t go to?\u201d Daddy asks, his brow furrowed. \u201cThat sounded like a really nice event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the next one,\u201d I promise him. Of course, I don\u2019t mean it.</p><p>There\u2019s no point in me going to mixers and getting attached to people when I\u2019m only going to be there nine months.</p><p>* *</p><p>After I make myself a bowl of ice cream, I go upstairs and text Margot to see if she is awake. She is, so I immediately call her to shore up support on the dress situation, and Kitty\u2019s right\u2014Margot doesn\u2019t care either way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you guys want to do,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThe hottest places in hell are reserved for people who maintain neutrality in times of crisis,\u201d I say, licking my spoon.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI thought the hottest places in hell were reserved for women who don\u2019t help other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose hell has a lot of rooms. Honestly, don\u2019t you think Kitty will look silly in a tuxedo? It\u2019s a backyard wedding. The feel is supposed to be ethereal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll look any sillier than you\u2019ll look in a flower crown all by yourself. Just let her wear it, and you wear your flower crown, and I\u2019ll be neutral. Honestly, I don\u2019t even see the point in me being a bridesmaid when Ms. Rothschild</p><p>and I barely know each other. I mean, I know she\u2019s doing it to be nice, but it\u2019s so not necessary. It\u2019s all a bit much.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m regretting stirring the waters and pushing the whole tuxedo-versus-flower-crown issue. The last thing I want is for Margot to get any ideas about dropping out of the wedding. She\u2019s lukewarm on Trina at best. Hastily I say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to wear flower crowns. You and I could wear plain dresses and Kitty could wear her tux, and that would look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was that William and Mary mixer today? Did you meet any cool people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does everybody but me know about the mixer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cLara Jean, have you sent in your William and Mary deposit yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to! It\u2019s not due until May first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about changing your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I just haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet. Things have been crazy around here, with all the wedding planning and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like the wedding is getting really big. I thought they just wanted to do a simple thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re weighing our options. It\u2019ll still be simple. I just think the day should be really special, something we\u2019ll always remember.\u201d</p><p>After we get off the phone, I go downstairs to put my ice cream bowl in the sink, and on the way back, I stop in the</p><p>living room, where Mommy and Daddy\u2019s wedding portrait hangs above the fireplace. Her dress is lace, with cap sleeves and a flowy skirt. Her hair is up, in a side bun, with a few tendrils that slip out. She\u2019s wearing diamond earrings I never saw her wear in real life. She hardly ever wore jewelry, or much makeup, either. Daddy\u2019s in a gray suit, but no gray in his hair yet; his cheeks are apple smooth, no stubble. She looks the way I remember her, but he looks so much younger.</p><p>It hits me that we\u2019ll have to move the picture. It would just be too awkward for Trina to have to look at it every day. She doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it now, but after she\u2019s living here, after they\u2019re married, she\u2019s bound to feel differently. I could hang it in my room, though Margot might want it too. I guess I\u2019ll ask her when she\u2019s back.</p><p>* *</p><p>Trina\u2019s friend Kristen comes over after dinner later that week, armed with a bottle of ros\u00e9 and a stack of bridal magazines. The way Trina talks about Kristen, I was picturing someone really intimidating and tall, but Kristen is my height. She has brown hair cut in a short bob, tan skin. I\u2019m impressed by her collection of</p><p>Martha Stewart Weddings</p><p>\u2014it goes back years and years. \u201cPlease just don\u2019t crease the corners,\u201d she says, which makes me frown. As if I would ever.</p><p>\u201cI think we should discuss the bridal shower first,\u201d she says. She\u2019s petting Jamie Fox-Pickle; his sandy head is in her lap. I\u2019ve never seen him take to a stranger so quickly, which I take to be a good sign.</p><p>I say, \u201cI thought a tea party could be fun. I\u2019d make little</p><p>sandwiches with the crusts cut off, and little bite-sized scones, and clotted cream . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking a SoulCycle party,\u201d Kristen says. \u201cI\u2019d have matching neon tank tops made that say \u2018Team Trina.\u2019 We could rent out the whole class!\u201d</p><p>I try not to look disappointed, and just nod like,</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>\u201cGuys, both of those ideas sound so great, but I\u2019m thinking no bridal shower,\u201d Trina interjects. Kristen gasps and I do too. With an apologetic smile she explains, \u201cWe have too much stuff as it is. The whole point of a bridal shower is to shower the bride with everything she\u2019ll need for her house, and I can\u2019t think of one thing we\u2019d need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have an ice cream maker,\u201d I say. I\u2019ve been wanting to experiment with ice creams for a while now, but the one I want is more than four hundred dollars. \u201cAnd Daddy\u2019s always talking about a pasta machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can buy those things for ourselves. We\u2019re grown-ups, after all.\u201d Kristen opens her mouth to argue, but Trina says, \u201cKris, I\u2019m firm on this. No bridal shower. I\u2019m in my forties, for Pete\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve been to this rodeo before.\u201d</p><p>Stiffly Kristen says, \u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with anything. The point of a bridal shower is to make the bride feel special and loved. But fine. If it\u2019s that important to you, we won\u2019t do one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Trina says. She leans over and puts her arm around Kristen, who gives her a stern look.</p><p>\u201cBut where I will not negotiate is a bachelorette. You\u2019ve gotta have a bach. Period.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Trina says, \u201cI will not fight you on that. Maybe we can do your SoulCycle idea for my bachelorette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. We gotta go big. So, Vegas, am I right? You love Vegas. I\u2019m gonna e-mail the girls tonight so Sarah\u2019s husband can get us a suite at the Bellagio\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a no on Vegas,\u201d Trina says. \u201cThe bachelorette has to be local and</p><p>PG</p><p>so the girls can come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat girls?\u201d Kristen demands.</p><p>Trina points to me. \u201cMy girls.\u201d She smiles at me shyly and I smile back, feeling warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we did karaoke?\u201d I suggest, and Trina claps her hands in delight.</p><p>Kristen\u2019s mouth drops. \u201cNo offense, Lara Jean, but what the hell is going on here, Trina! You can\u2019t have your future stepchildren at your bach. It\u2019s just not right. We\u2019re not gonna be able to celebrate the way you\u2019re supposed to celebrate a bach. Like the old days\u2014aka get naked wasted so you can live up your last moments as a single woman.\u201d</p><p>Trina looks at me and shakes her head. \u201cFor the record, we never got \u2018naked wasted.\u2019 \u201d To Kristen she says, \u201cKris, I don\u2019t think of them as my future stepchildren. They\u2019re just . . . the girls. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have fun. Margot\u2019s in college, and Lara Jean\u2019s practically in college. They can be exposed to a little sangria and chardonnay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do love your white wine,\u201d I say, and Trina swats at my shoulder.</p><p>Kristen exhales loudly. \u201cWell, what about the little one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty\u2019s very mature for her age,\u201d Trina says.</p><p>Kristen crosses her arms. \u201cI\u2019m putting my foot down. You can\u2019t bring a child on a bachelorette. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKris!\u201d</p><p>At this I feel like I have to speak up. \u201cI\u2019m going to side with Kristen on this one. We won\u2019t be able to bring Kitty to karaoke. She\u2019s too young. They won\u2019t let an eleven-year-old in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be so disappointed, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll live,\u201d I say.</p><p>Kristen sips on her ros\u00e9 and says, \u201cDisappointment is good for kids; it prepares them for the real world, where it\u2019s not all about them and their feelings.\u201d</p><p>Trina rolls her eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re putting your foot down on having Kitty at the bachelorette, I\u2019m putting my foot down on penises. I mean it, Kris. No penis cake, no penis straws, no penis pasta. No penises, period.\u201d</p><p>I blush. There\u2019s such a thing as penis pasta?</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Kristen pushes out her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Can we move on to the actual wedding, please?\u201d</p><p>I run and get my laptop and pull up my vision board, which is when Kitty decides to grace us with her presence. She\u2019s been in the living room watching</p><p>TV</p><p>. \u201cWhere are we in the planning?\u201d she wants to know.</p><p>Kristen eyes her before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about food trucks?\u201d I suggest. \u201cLike, a waffle truck?\u201d</p><p>Kristen purses her lips. \u201cI was thinking barbecue. Trina loves barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say. \u201cBut a lot of people do barbecue, don\u2019t they? It\u2019s kind of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayed out?\u201d Kitty suggests.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say common.\u201d But yeah.</p><p>\u201cBut Trina loves barbecue!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan y\u2019all please stop talking about me like I\u2019m not here?\u201d Trina says. \u201cI do love barbecue. And can we do Mason jars?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m expecting Kitty to denigrate Mason jars again, but she doesn\u2019t say anything of the sort. She says, \u201cWhat do we think about edible flowers in the drinks?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that was one of my ideas that she just stole.</p><p>Trina does a shimmy in her seat. \u201cYes! I love it!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m quick to add, \u201cWe could do a nice punch bowl and float some flowers on top.\u201d</p><p>Kristen gives me an approving look.</p><p>Bolstered, I grandly say, \u201cAnd as for the cakes, we\u2019ll need a wedding cake and a groom\u2019s cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we really need two cakes?\u201d Trina asks, chewing on her nail. \u201cThere won\u2019t be that many people there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the South; we have to have a groom\u2019s cake. For yours I was thinking yellow cake with vanilla buttercream frosting.\u201d Trina beams at me. That\u2019s her favorite kind of cake, just plain. Not exactly exciting to bake, but it\u2019s her favorite. \u201cFor Daddy\u2019s, I was thinking . . . a Thin Mint cake! Chocolate cake with mint frosting, but with Thin Mints crumbled on top.\u201d I have such a vision for this cake.</p><p>This time Kitty\u2019s the one to give me an approving nod. I feel more in my element then I have in weeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>KITTY\u2019S MIXING NAIL-POLISH COLORS ON</p><p>a paper plate while I\u2019m looking up \u201ccelebrity updos\u201d for Trina\u2019s wedding hair. I\u2019m lying on the couch, with pillows propped up behind me, and she is on the floor, with nail-polish bottles all around her. Suddenly she asks me, \u201cHave you ever thought about, like, what if Daddy and Trina have a baby and it looks like Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Kitty thinks of all sorts of things that would never have occurred to me. I hadn\u2019t once thought of that\u2014that they might have a baby or that this pretend baby wouldn\u2019t look like us. The baby would be all Daddy and Trina. No one would have to wonder whose child he was or calculate who belongs to who. They\u2019d just assume.</p> <p>\u201cBut they\u2019re both so old,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTrina\u2019s forty-three. You can get pregnant at forty-three. Maddie\u2019s mom just had a baby and she\u2019s forty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a boy?\u201d</p><p>Daddy with a son. It\u2019s a startling thought. He\u2019s not exactly sporty, not in a traditional male sense. I mean, he likes to go biking and he plays doubles tennis in the spring. But I\u2019m sure there are things he\u2019d want to do with a son that he doesn\u2019t do with us because no one\u2019s interested. Fishing, maybe? Football</p><p>he doesn\u2019t care about. Trina cares more than he does.</p> <p>When my mom was pregnant with Kitty, Margot wanted another sister but I wanted a boy. The Song girls and their baby brother. It would be nice to get that baby brother after all. Especially since I won\u2019t be at home and have to hear it crying in the middle of the night. I\u2019ll just get to buy the baby little shearling booties and sweaters with red foxes or bunnies.</p><p>\u201cIf they named him Tate, we could call him Tater Tot,\u201d I muse.</p><p>Two red blotches appear on Kitty\u2019s cheeks, and just like that, she looks as young as I always picture her in my head: a little kid. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to have another baby. If they have a baby, I\u2019ll be in the middle. I\u2019ll be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I object. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMargot\u2019s oldest and smartest, and you\u2019re the prettiest.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m the prettiest?? Kitty thinks I\u2019m the prettiest?</p><p>I try not to look too happy, because she\u2019s still talking. \u201cI\u2019m only the youngest. If they have a baby, I won\u2019t even be that.\u201d</p><p>I put down my computer. \u201cKitty, you\u2019re a lot more than the youngest Song girl. You\u2019re the wild Song girl. The mean one. The spiky one.\u201d Kitty\u2019s pursing her lips, trying not to smile at this. I add, \u201cAnd no matter what, Trina loves you; she\u2019ll always love you, even if she did have a baby which I don\u2019t think she will.\u201d I stop. \u201cWait, did you mean it when you said I was the prettiest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I take it back. I\u2019ll probably be the prettiest by the time I get to high school. You can be the nicest.\u201d I leap off the couch and grab her by the shoulders like I\u2019m going to shake her, and she giggles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the nicest,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou are, though.\u201d She says it not like an insult, but not exactly like a compliment. \u201cWhat do you wish you had of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour nose. You have a little nubbin of a nose.\u201d I tap it. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>Kitty shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then she cracks up, and I shake her by the shoulders.</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about it later that evening. I hadn\u2019t thought of Daddy and Trina having a baby. But Trina doesn\u2019t have any children, just her \u201cfur baby\u201d golden retriever Simone. She might want a baby of her own. And Daddy\u2019s never said so, but is there a chance he\u2019d want to try one more time for a son? The baby would be eighteen years younger than me. What a strange thought. And even stranger still: I\u2019m old enough to have a baby of my own.</p><p>What would Peter and I do if I got pregnant? I can\u2019t even picture what would happen. All I can see is the look on Daddy\u2019s face when I tell him the news, and that\u2019s about as far as I get.</p><p>* *</p><p>The next morning, on the way to school in Peter\u2019s car, I steal a look at his profile. \u201cI like how you\u2019re so smooth,\u201d I say. \u201cLike a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could grow a beard if I wanted to,\u201d he says, touching his chin. \u201cA thick one.\u201d</p><p>Fondly I say, \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t. But maybe one day, when you\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cI</p><p>am</p><p>a man. I\u2019m eighteen!\u201d</p><p>I scoff, \u201cYou don\u2019t even pack your own lunches. Do you even know how to do laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man in all the ways that count,\u201d he boasts, and I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if you were drafted to go to war?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . aren\u2019t college kids given a pass on that? Does the draft even still exist?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know the answers to either of these questions, so I barrel forward. \u201cWhat would you do if I got pregnant right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, we\u2019re not even having sex. That would be the immaculate conception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we were?\u201d I press.</p><p>He groans. \u201cYou and your questions! I don\u2019t know. How could I know what I would do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you</p><p>think</p><p>you would do?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWhatever you wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you want to decide together?\u201d I\u2019m testing him\u2014for what, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who has to carry it. It\u2019s your body, not mine.\u201d</p><p>His answer pleases me, but still I keep going. \u201cWhat if I said . . . let\u2019s have the baby and get married?\u201d</p><p>Again Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019d say sure. Yeah!\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m the one frowning. \u201c \u2018Sure\u2019? Just like that? The</p><p>biggest decision of your life and you just say sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because I</p><p>am</p><p>sure.\u201d</p><p>I lean over to him and put my palms on his smooth cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s how I know you\u2019re still a boy. Because you\u2019re so sure.\u201d</p><p>He frowns back at me. \u201cWhy are you saying it like it\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>I let go. \u201cYou\u2019re always so sure of everything about yourself. You\u2019ve never been not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure of this one thing,\u201d he says, staring straight ahead. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d never be the kind of dad my dad is, no matter how old I am.\u201d</p><p>I go quiet, feeling guilty for teasing him and bringing up bad feelings. I want to ask if his dad is still reaching out to make amends, but the closed-up look on Peter\u2019s face stops me. I just wish he and his dad could fix things between them before he goes to college. Because right now, Peter</p><p>is</p><p>still a boy, and deep down, I think all boys want to know their dads, no matter what kind of men they are.</p><p>* *</p><p>After school, we go through the drive-thru, and Peter\u2019s already tearing into his sandwich before we\u2019re out of the parking lot. Between bites of fried chicken sandwich, he says, \u201cDid you mean it when you said before that you couldn\u2019t picture marrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you kind of said that. You said I\u2019m still a boy and you couldn\u2019t marry a boy.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019ve gone and hurt his feelings. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I meant I couldn\u2019t picture marrying anybody right now. We\u2019re both still babies. How could we</p><p>have</p><p>a baby?\u201d Without thinking, I say, \u201cAnyway, my dad gave me a whole birth-control kit for college, so we don\u2019t even have to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Peter nearly chokes on his sandwich. \u201cA birth-control kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Condoms and . . .\u201d Dental dams. \u201cPeter, do you know what a dental dam is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what? Is that what dentists use to keep your mouth open when they clean it?\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cNo. It\u2019s for oral sex. And here I thought you were this big expert and</p><p>you</p><p>were going to be the one to teach</p><p>me</p><p>everything at college!\u201d</p><p>My heart speeds up as I wait for him to make a joke about the two of us finally having sex at college, but he doesn\u2019t. He frowns and says, \u201cI don\u2019t like the thought of your dad thinking we\u2019re doing it when we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wants us to be careful is all. He\u2019s a professional, remember?\u201d I pat him on the knee. \u201cEither way, I\u2019m not getting pregnant, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He crumples up his napkin and tosses it in the paper bag, his eyes still on the road. \u201cYour parents met in college, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised he remembers. I don\u2019t remember telling him that. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how old were they? Eighteen? Nineteen?\u201d Peter\u2019s headed somewhere with this line of questioning.</p><p>\u201cTwenty, I think.\u201d</p><p>His face dims but just slightly. \u201cOkay, twenty. I\u2019m eighteen and you\u2019ll be eighteen next month. Twenty is just two years older. So what difference does two years make in the grand scheme of things?\u201d He beams a smile at me. \u201cYour parents met at twenty; we met at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve,\u201d I supply.</p><p>Peter frowns, annoyed that I\u2019ve messed up his argument. \u201cOkay, so we met when were kids, but we didn\u2019t get together until we were seventeen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get together</p><p>for real</p><p>until we were both basically seventeen. Which is basically the same thing as eighteen, which is basically the same thing as twenty.\u201d He has the self-satisfied look of a lawyer who has just delivered a winning closing statement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very long and twisty line of logic,\u201d I say. \u201cHave you ever thought about being a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but now I\u2019m thinking maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201c</p><p>UVA</p><p>has a great law school,\u201d I say, and I get a sudden pang, because college is one thing, but law school? That\u2019s so far away, and who knows what will happen between now and then? By then we\u2019ll be such different people. Thinking of Peter in his twenties, I feel a sense of yearning for the man I may never get to meet. Right now, today, he\u2019s still a boy, and I know him better than anybody, but what if it isn\u2019t always this way? Already our paths are diverging, a little more every day, the closer we get to August. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TRINA PUT HER HOUSE ON</p><p>the market a couple of weeks after she and Daddy got engaged. Kristen\u2019s a real estate agent, and she told her that now was the time to sell, because everybody likes to buy in the springtime. It turns out she was right; a couple made an offer on it the very same week\u2014sooner than any of us could have imagined. Daddy and Trina thought the house would sit on the market for at least a month, but now movers are unloading boxes at our house and everything\u2019s careening forward at lightning speed.</p><p>There was never any big discussion about who was moving in with who\u2014it was just understood that Trina was coming here. For one, our house is bigger, but also, it\u2019s easier to move one person than four. You would think. For one person, Trina has a lot of stuff. Boxes and boxes of clothes and shoes, her exercise equipment, random pieces of furniture, a huge velvet upholstered headboard that I know my dad is horrified by.</p> <p>\u201cIf it was me, I wouldn\u2019t want to move into another woman\u2019s house,\u201d Chris says. She\u2019s standing at my window, watching Trina direct the movers. She stopped by on her way to work to borrow a pair of my shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat other woman?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYour mom!</p><p>I would always feel like it was her house. Like, she picked the furniture, the wallpaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually Margot and I picked a lot of it,\u201d I say. \u201cI picked the dining room wallpaper; she picked the upstairs bathroom color.\u201d I remember that Margot and Mommy and I sat down on the living room floor with all the wallpaper books and carpet samples and paint chips spread around us. We spent the whole afternoon going over every book with a fine-tooth comb, with Margot and me battling over which blue was the right blue for the upstairs bathroom we\u2019d share. I thought robin\u2019s-egg blue, and Margot thought sky blue. Mommy finally had us do rock, paper, scissors for it, and Margot won. I sulked over it until I beat her out with my wallpaper choice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. I feel like if I was Trina, I would want a fresh start,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of impossible when her husband-to-be already has three kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. As fresh as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting a new bed, at least. It\u2019s coming tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chris perks up at this. Flopping on my bed, she says, \u201cEw, is it weird to think about your dad having sex?\u201d</p><p>I slap her on the leg. \u201cI don\u2019t think about that! So please don\u2019t bring it up.\u201d</p><p>Picking at the strings on her cutoffs, she says, \u201cTrina does have a great body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Chris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, I would kill to have her body at her age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not that old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d Chris preens at me prettily. \u201cIf I open the window, can I smoke in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know the answer to that question, Christina.\u201d</p><p>She pouts, but it\u2019s just for show because she knew I wasn\u2019t going to say yes. \u201cUgh. America is so annoying about smoking. So basic.\u201d</p><p>Now that Chris is going to Costa Rica, she relishes looking down on everything American. I still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s leaving. \u201cAre you really not going to prom?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret not going,\u201d I warn her. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working on the farm in Costa Rica, you\u2019ll suddenly remember how you didn\u2019t go to prom, and you will feel abject regret, and you\u2019ll have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, she says, \u201cI highly doubt it!\u201d</p><p>After Chris leaves for work, I\u2019m on my computer in the kitchen looking for bridesmaid dresses and/or prom dresses, and Daddy and Trina walk in from being outside with the movers. I try to look busy, like I\u2019m studying, in case they ask for help. Shrewd little Kitty has made herself scarce these past couple of days, and I\u2019m regretting not following her lead.</p><p>Daddy pours himself a glass of water, wiping sweat from his brow. \u201cDo you really need to bring that treadmill?\u201d he asks Trina. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even work properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works fine.\u201d</p><p>Gulping the rest of his water, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you use it.\u201d</p><p>She frowns at him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t use it. It means I don\u2019t use it in front of</p><p>you</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. When\u2019s the last time you used it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>This is a new side to Daddy\u2014bickering, losing his patience just barely. Trina brings it out of him, and I know it sounds strange, but I\u2019m glad for it. It\u2019s something I never realized was gone in him. There\u2019s making do, living a pleasant life, no big ups or downs, and there\u2019s all the friction and fire that come with being in love with someone. She takes forever to get ready, which drives him crazy, and she makes fun of his hobbies, like bird-watching and documentaries. But they just fit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THERE\u2019S A LACROSSE GAME TONIGHT,</p><p>and Pammy can\u2019t go because she has to work, and of course Chris would never deign to go to a lacrosse game, so I bring Kitty with me. She pretends to mull it over, musing aloud that it might be boring, but when I say, \u201cNever mind, then,\u201d she quickly agrees to come.</p><p>In the stands we run into Peter\u2019s mom and his younger brother, Owen, so we sit with them. He and Kitty proceed to each pretend the other doesn\u2019t exist\u2014he plays games on his phone and she plays games on hers. Owen is tall, but he sits hunched, with his hair in his eyes.</p> <p>We chat about my dad and Trina\u2019s engagement for a bit and I tell her some of my ideas for the wedding. She\u2019s nodding along and then she suddenly says, \u201cI hear congratulations are in order for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I say, \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Mary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were hoping to go to</p><p>UVA</p> <p>, but this might be for the best anyway.\u201d She gives me a sympathetic smile.</p><p>I smile back, unsure. Unsure of what, exactly, \u201cfor the best\u201d means. Is she glad I\u2019m not going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>with Peter? Does she think this means we\u2019re breaking up now? So all I</p><p>say is, \u201cWilliamsburg isn\u2019t really that far from Charlottesville anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her response is, \u201cHmm, yes, that\u2019s true.\u201d Then Peter scores a point, and we both stand up and cheer.</p> <p>When I sit back down again, Kitty asks me, \u201cCan we get popcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, glad to have an excuse to get up. To Peter\u2019s mom and brother I ask, \u201cDo you guys want anything?\u201d</p><p>Without looking up, Owen says, \u201cPopcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys can share,\u201d Peter\u2019s mom says.</p><p>I make my way down the bleachers, and I\u2019m heading for the snack bar when I notice a man, standing off to the side, his arms crossed, watching the game. He is tall; he has nut-brown hair. Handsome. When he turns his head and I see his profile, I know who he is, because I know that face. I know that chin, those eyes. He\u2019s Peter\u2019s dad. It\u2019s like seeing the Ghost of Christmas Future, and I\u2019m frozen in place, transfixed.</p><p>He catches me staring at him, and offers a friendly smile. I feel like I have no choice but to take a step forward and ask, \u201cExcuse me . . . but are you Peter\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, he nods. \u201cAre you a friend of his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lara Jean Covey. His, um, girlfriend.\u201d He looks startled, but then he recovers and extends his hand. I shake it firmly, to give a good impression. \u201cWow, you look just like him.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and I\u2019m struck anew by how much of him is in Peter. \u201cHe looks just like me, you mean.\u201d</p><p>I laugh too. \u201cRight. You were here first.\u201d</p><p>There is an awkward silence, and then he clears his throat and asks me, \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s great. Did you hear he\u2019s going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>on a lacrosse scholarship?\u201d</p><p>He nods, smiling. \u201cI heard that from his mom. I\u2019m proud of him. Not that I can take any credit for it\u2014but still. I\u2019m really proud of the kid.\u201d His eyes flicker back to the field, to Peter. \u201cI just wanted to see him play again. I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d He hesitates before saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t mention to Peter that I was here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so taken by surprise, all I can say is, \u201cOh . . . okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I appreciate it. It was nice to meet you, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too, Mr. Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>With that, I go back to the bleachers, and only when I\u2019m halfway up there do I remember I forgot the popcorn, so I have to go back down. When I get back to the snack bar, Peter\u2019s dad is gone.</p><p>Our team ends up losing, but Peter scores three points and it\u2019s a good game for him. I\u2019m glad his dad got to see him play, but I really wish I didn\u2019t agree to keeping it a secret from Peter. The thought makes my stomach hurt.</p><p>In the car I\u2019m still thinking about his dad, but then Kitty says, \u201cThat was weird what Peter\u2019s mom said about it being a good thing you weren\u2019t going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right! You took it that way too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere really wasn\u2019t any other way to take it,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>I check my side-view mirrors before turning left out of the school parking lot. \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant it in a</p><p>mean</p><p>way, exactly. She just doesn\u2019t want to see Peter get hurt, that\u2019s all.\u201d And neither do I, so maybe it\u2019s for the best that I don\u2019t say anything to Peter about seeing his dad tonight. What if he gets excited about his dad coming, and then his dad hurts him again? Abruptly I say, \u201cDo you wanna stop and get frozen yogurts?\u201d and of course Kitty says yes.</p><p>* *</p><p>Peter comes to the house after he showers up, and as soon as I see how happy he is, my mind is made up not to say anything.</p><p>We\u2019re lying on the living room floor doing face sheet masks. If the kids at school could see him now! Through gritted teeth he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s this one supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrighten dull skin.\u201d</p><p>He twists toward me and croaks, \u201cHello, Clarice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from</p><p>Silence of the Lambs</p><p>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I never saw that. It looked too scary.\u201d</p><p>Peter sits upright. He\u2019s terrible at sitting still. \u201cWe have to watch it right now. This is ridiculous. I can\u2019t be with someone who\u2019s never seen</p><p>Silence of the Lambs</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s my turn to pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovey, come on! It\u2019s a classic,\u201d Peter says, just as his phone buzzes. He answers it, and I hear his mom\u2019s voice on the other line. \u201cHey Mom . . . I\u2019m at Lara Jean\u2019s. I\u2019ll be home soon. . . . I love you too.\u201d</p><p>When he gets off the phone, I say, \u201cHey, I forgot to tell you this earlier, but at the game tonight, your mom said that maybe it was for the best that I didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sits up and pulls off his face mask.</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t say it exactly like that, but I think that\u2019s how she meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were her exact words?\u201d</p><p>I peel off my mask too. \u201cShe congratulated me on getting into William and Mary, and then I think she said, \u2018I know you were hoping to go to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, but this might be for the best anyway.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Peter relaxes. \u201cOh, she always talks like that. She looks for the bright side in things. She\u2019s like you.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem that way to me, but I don\u2019t push it, because Peter\u2019s very protective of his mom. I guess he\u2019s had to be, since it\u2019s just the three of them. But what if it didn\u2019t have to be? What if Peter has a real chance of having a relationship with his dad? What if tonight is proof? Casually, I ask him, \u201cHey, how many graduation announcements did you sign up for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. My family\u2019s small. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering. I signed up for fifty, so my grandma could send some to family in Korea.\u201d I hesitate before asking, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll send your dad one?\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cNo. Why would I?\u201d He picks up his phone. \u201cLet\u2019s see what movies we have left. If</p><p>Silence of the Lambs</p><p>is off the table, we could watch</p><p>Trainspotting</p><p>, or</p><p>Die Hard</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything for a moment, and then I snatch his</p><p>phone out of his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to pick! And I pick . . .</p><p>Am\u00e9lie</p><p>!\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>For someone who once put up such a fuss about not watching rom coms or foreign films, Peter sure loves</p><p>Am\u00e9lie.</p><p>It\u2019s about a French girl who is afraid to live in the world, so she concocts these whimsical fantasies in her head, with lamps that talk and paintings that move, and crepes that look like records. It makes me want to live in Paris.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what you\u2019d look like with bangs,\u201d Peter muses. \u201cCute, I bet.\u201d At the end of the movie, when she bakes a plum cake, he turns to me and says, \u201cDo you know how to bake a plum cake? That sounds delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, mini plum cakes could be good for the dessert table.\u201d I start researching recipes on my phone.</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you call me when you do your trial run,\u201d Peter says, yawning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TRINA AND I ARE ON</p><p>the couch drinking tea. I\u2019m showing her pictures of floral arrangements when Daddy walks through the front door and collapses on the couch with us. \u201cLong day?\u201d Trina asks him.</p><p>\u201cThe longest,\u201d he says, closing his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cQuestion,\u201d I say.</p><p>His eyes flutter open. \u201cYes, my middle-born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys thinking for the first dance?\u201d</p><p>He groans. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to think about dancing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. It\u2019s your wedding! Be present, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Trina laughs and pokes him in the side with her foot. \u201cBe present, Dan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Well, Trina\u2019s a big Shania Twain fan.\u201d They grin at each other. \u201cSo\u2014what about \u2018From This Moment On\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really do know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShania Twain?\u201d I repeat. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she sing that song \u2018Man! I Feel Like a Woman\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Trina holds her mug like it\u2019s a microphone and tilts her head. \u201cFrom this moment, I will love you,\u201d she sings, off-key.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I know that song,\u201d I say, trying to sound neutral.</p><p>\u201cPlay it for her on your phone,\u201d she says to Daddy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge,\u201d he warns me, and then he plays it.</p><p>It\u2019s the most un-him song I\u2019ve ever heard. But he\u2019s got a goofy smile on his face the entire time, and it only gets bigger when Trina puts her arm around his shoulder and makes him sway with her to the beat. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say, and suddenly I feel like crying. I clear my throat. \u201cSo now that the song is picked out, we can start ticking other stuff off the list. I\u2019ve been going back and forth with Tilly\u2019s Treats about doing mini banana puddings in little canning jars, and they say they can\u2019t do them for less than seven dollars apiece.\u201d</p><p>Worry lines cross Daddy\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat seems pricy, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a call in to a bakery in Richmond, and if the delivery price isn\u2019t too bad, that might be the way to go.\u201d I flip through my binder. \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy with desserts, I haven\u2019t had a chance to go meet with the band I\u2019ve been in touch with. They\u2019re playing in Keswick this weekend, so I might try and go see them play.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks at me with concern in his eyes. \u201cHoney, it seems like maybe you\u2019ve replaced baking with wedding planning as your stress relief. This is all a little much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe band isn\u2019t exactly a</p><p>band</p><p>,\u201d I quickly say. \u201cIt\u2019s a singer and a guy with a guitar. They\u2019re just starting out, so it\u2019s all very reasonable. I\u2019ll know more when I see them in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have videos you can watch?\u201d Trina asks.</p><p>\u201cSure, but it\u2019s not the same as seeing them live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need a band,\u201d Daddy says, exchanging a look with Trina. \u201cI think we\u2019d be fine with just playing music off the computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but we\u2019d need to rent sound equipment.\u201d I</p><p>start flipping through my binder, and Trina reaches out and puts her hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I love that you want to help us with this, and I\u2019m so grateful. But honestly, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t stress yourself out. Your dad and I don\u2019t really care about any of the details. We just want to get married. We don\u2019t need a food truck, or mini banana puddings. We\u2019d truly be just as happy ordering a bunch of barbecue from</p><p>BBQ</p><p>Exchange.\u201d I start to speak, and she stops me. \u201cYou only get one senior year of high school, and I want you to enjoy it. You have a hot boyfriend and you got into a great school. Your birthday is coming up soon. This is the time to just be young and celebrate and enjoy each other!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, within reason, of course,\u201d Daddy says hastily.</p><p>\u201cBut guys, I\u2019m not stressed out,\u201d I protest. \u201cFocusing on the wedding gives me a sense of peace! It\u2019s very calming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been a big help, but I think there are other things you could be focusing on that are more worthy of your time. Like finishing out your senior year, and preparing for college.\u201d Daddy has that firm, immovable look on his face, the one I see so seldom.</p><p>I frown. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want me to help out with the wedding anymore?\u201d</p><p>Trina says, \u201cI still want you to be in charge of the bridesmaid dresses, and I\u2019d love for you to bake our wedding cake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the groom\u2019s cake?\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cSure. But the rest of it we\u2019ll take care of. I swear I\u2019m only saying this to you for your own good, Lara Jean. No more haggling over prices with vendors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more impromptu road trips to Richmond for cake tables,\u201d Daddy adds.</p><p>I sigh a reluctant kind of sigh. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure . . .\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cJust go be young. Focus on your prom dress. Have you started looking yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d It\u2019s hitting me now that we are less than a month away from prom and I still don\u2019t have a dress. \u201cIf you\u2019re really sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure,\u201d Daddy says, and Trina nods.</p><p>As I head up the stairs, I hear Daddy whisper to her, \u201cWhy in the world are you encouraging her to go enjoy her hot boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Trina says.</p><p>He makes a harrumph sound. \u201cIt sure sounded like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, don\u2019t take everything so literally, Dan. Besides, her boyfriend</p><p>is</p><p>hot.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>I look at prom dresses on my computer, and I laugh out loud every time I think about Daddy calling Peter my \u201chot boyfriend.\u201d An hour into searching, I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019ve found my dress. It\u2019s ballerina style, with a metallic lattice bodice and a tulle skirt\u2014the website calls the color dusty pink. Stormy will be pleased.</p><p>With that done, I go on the William and Mary website and pay the enrollment deposit like I should\u2019ve done weeks ago.</p><p>* *</p><p>Later that week, on the ride to school, Peter says he got out of doing a delivery for his mom, and he can go with me to see the band play in Keswick.</p><p>Glumly I say, \u201cIt turns out Daddy and Trina don\u2019t want a band after all. Or much of anything, for that matter. They want this wedding to be very low maintenance. They\u2019re just going to borrow some speakers and play music off a computer. Guess what song they picked for their first dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat song?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018From This Moment On\u2019 by Shania Twain.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cI never heard of that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cheesy, but they love it, apparently. Do you realize that we don\u2019t have a song? Like, a song that\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s pick one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. You don\u2019t just</p><p>pick</p><p>your song. The song picks you. Like the Sorting Hat.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods sagely. He finally finished reading all seven Harry Potter books and he\u2019s always eager to prove that he gets my references. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to just . . . happen. A moment. And the song transcends the moment, you know? My mom and dad\u2019s song was \u2018Wonderful Tonight\u2019 by Eric Clapton. They danced to it at their wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did it become their song, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the first song they ever slow danced to in college. It was at a dance, not long after they first started dating. I\u2019ve seen pictures from that night. Daddy\u2019s wearing a suit that was too big on him and my mom\u2019s hair is in a French twist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about whatever song comes on next, that\u2019s our song. It\u2019ll be fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just make our own fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we can.\u201d Peter reaches over to turn on the radio.</p><p>\u201cWait! Just any radio station? What if it\u2019s not a slow song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay so we\u2019ll put on Lite 101.\u201d Peter hits the button.</p><p>\u201cWinnie the Pooh doesn\u2019t know what to do, got a honey jar stuck on his nose,\u201d a woman croons.</p><p>Peter says, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d as I say, \u201cThis can\u2019t be our song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest out of three?\u201d he suggests.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not force it. We\u2019ll know it when we hear it, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll hear it at the prom,\u201d Peter offers. \u201cOh, that reminds me. What color is your dress? My mom\u2019s going to ask her florist friend to make your corsage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dusty pink.\u201d It came in the mail yesterday, and when I tried it on for everybody, Trina said it was \u201cthe most Lara Jean\u201d dress she\u2019d ever seen. I texted a picture to Stormy, who wrote back, \u201cOoh-la-la,\u201d with a dancing woman emoji.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is dusty pink?\u201d Peter wants to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a rose gold color.\u201d Peter still looks confused, so I sigh and say, \u201cJust tell your mom. She\u2019ll know. And do you think you could bring a little corsage for Kitty, too, and act like it was your idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I could\u2019ve had that idea on my own, you know,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cYou should at least give me a chance to have ideas.\u201d</p><p>I pat him on the knee. \u201cJust please don\u2019t forget.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT\u2019S LATE. I\u2019M IN MY</p><p>bed looking through my welcome packet from William and Mary. It turns out William and Mary doesn\u2019t allow freshmen to have cars on campus, and I\u2019m about to call Peter to tell him, when I get a text from John Ambrose McClaren. When I first see his name on my phone, I feel a jolt of surprise, because it\u2019s been so long since we last talked. Then I read the text.</p><p>Stormy died in her sleep last night. The funeral is in Rhode Island on Wednesday. I just thought you\u2019d want to know.</p> <p>I just sit there for a moment, stunned. How can this be? When I last saw her, she was fine. She was great. She was Stormy. She can\u2019t be gone. Not my Stormy. Stormy, who was larger than life, who taught me how to apply red lipstick \u201cso it lasts even after a night of kisses and champagne,\u201d she said.</p><p>I start to cry and I can\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t get air in my lungs. I can barely see for crying. My tears keep falling on my phone, and I keep wiping it with the back of my hand. What do I say to John? She was his grandmother, and he was her favorite grandson. They were very close.</p><p>First I type,</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?</p><p>Then I delete it, because what could I possibly do to help?</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry. She had the most spirit of anyone I ever met. I\u2019ll miss her dearly.</p><p>Thank you. I know she loved you too.</p><p>His text brings fresh tears to my eyes.</p><p>Stormy was always saying that she still felt like she was in her twenties. That sometimes she\u2019d dream she was a girl again, and she\u2019d see her ex-husbands and they\u2019d be old but she\u2019d still be Stormy. She said when she woke up in the morning, she\u2019d be surprised to be in her old body with her old bones. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the gams, though,\u201d she said. And she did.</p><p>It\u2019s almost a relief that the funeral is in Rhode Island, too far away for me to go. I haven\u2019t been to a funeral since my mom died. I was nine, Margot was eleven, Kitty just two. The clearest memory I have of that day is sitting beside my dad, Kitty in his arms, feeling his body shake next to mine as he cried silently. Kitty\u2019s cheeks were wet with his tears. She didn\u2019t understand anything except that he was sad. She kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Daddy,\u201d and he would try to smile for her, but his smile looked like it was melting. I\u2019d never felt that way before\u2014like nothing was safe anymore, or would be ever again.</p><p>And now I\u2019m crying again, for Stormy, for my mom, for everything.</p><p>She wanted me to transcribe her memoirs for her.</p><p>Stormy Weather</p><p>, she wanted to call it. We never did get around to doing that. How will people know her story now?</p><p>Peter calls, but I\u2019m too sad to talk so I just let it go to voicemail. I feel like I should call John, but I don\u2019t really have the right. Stormy was his grandma, and I was just a girl who volunteered at her nursing home. The one person I want to talk to is my sister, because she knew Stormy too, and because she always makes me feel better, but it\u2019s the middle of the night in Scotland.</p><p>* *</p><p>I call Margot the next day, as soon as I wake up. I cry again as I tell her the news, and she cries with me. It\u2019s Margot who has the idea to have a memorial service for her at Belleview. \u201cYou could say a few words, serve some cookies, and people could share memories of her? I\u2019m sure her friends would like that, since they won\u2019t be able to make it to the funeral.\u201d</p><p>I blow my nose. \u201cI\u2019m sure Stormy would like it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be there for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish so too,\u201d I say, and my voice quivers. I always feel stronger with Margot beside me.</p><p>\u201cPeter will be there, though,\u201d she says.</p><p>Before I leave for school, I call my old boss Janette over at Belleview and tell her the idea about the memorial service. She agrees right away, and says we could have it this Thursday afternoon, before bingo.</p><p>When I get to school and tell Peter about Stormy\u2019s memorial service, his face falls. \u201cShit. I have to go to that</p><p>Days on the Lawn thing with my mom.\u201d Days on the Lawn is an open house for incoming first-years at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. You go with your parents; you sit in on classes, tour the dorms. It\u2019s a big deal. I was really looking forward to it, when I thought I might be going.</p><p>He offers, \u201cI could skip it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Your mom would kill you. You have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he says, and I believe him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really okay. You didn\u2019t know Stormy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just want to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe offer is what counts,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>* *</p><p>Instead of wearing black, I choose a sundress that Stormy once said she liked me in. It\u2019s white, with cornflower-blue forget-me-nots embroidered on the skirt, short puffy sleeves that go a little off the shoulder, and a nipped-in waist. Because I bought it at the end of summer, I\u2019ve only had the chance to wear it once. I stopped by Belleview on my way to meet Peter at the movies, and Stormy said I looked like a girl in an Italian movie. So I wear that dress, and the white sandals I bought for graduation, and a little pair of lacy white gloves that I just know she\u2019d appreciate. I found them at a vintage store in Richmond called Bygones, and when I put them on, I can almost imagine Stormy wearing them at one of her cotillions or Saturday night dances. I don\u2019t wear her pink diamond ring. I want the first time I wear it to be at my prom, the way Stormy would have wanted.</p><p>I bring out the punch bowl, a crystal bowl of peanuts, a stack of cocktail napkins embroidered with cherries that I found at an estate sale, the tablecloth we use for Thanksgiving. I put a few roses on the piano, where Stormy used to sit. I make a punch with ginger ale and frozen fruit juice\u2014no alcohol, which I know Stormy would have balked at, but not all of the residents can have it, because of their medications. I do put out a bottle of champagne next to the punch bowl, for anyone who wants to top off their punch with a little something extra. Lastly, I turn on Frank Sinatra, who Stormy always said should\u2019ve been her second husband, if only.</p><p>John said he\u2019d come if he made it back from Rhode Island in time, and I\u2019m feeling a little nervous for that, because I haven\u2019t seen him since almost exactly a year ago, on my birthday. We were never a thing, not really, but we almost were, and to me, that\u2019s something.</p><p>A few people file in. One of the nurses wheels in Mrs. Armbruster, who has fallen to dementia but used to be pretty friendly with Stormy. Mr. Perelli, Alicia, Shanice the receptionist, Janette. It\u2019s a good little group. The truth is, there are fewer and fewer people that I know at Belleview. Some of them have moved in with their children; a few have passed away. Not as many familiar faces in the staff, either. The place changed while I wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>I\u2019m standing at the front of the room, and my heart is pounding out of my chest. I\u2019m so nervous to make my speech. I\u2019m afraid of stumbling over my words and not doing her</p><p>justice. I want to do a good job on it; I want to make Stormy proud. Everyone\u2019s looking at me with expectant eyes, except for Mrs. Armbruster, who is knitting and staring off into space. My knees shake under my skirt. I take a deep breath, and I\u2019m about to speak when John Ambrose McClaren walks in, wearing a pressed button-down shirt and khakis. He takes a seat on the couch next to Alicia. I give him a wave, and in return, John gives me an encouraging smile.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cThe year was 1952.\u201d I clear my throat and look down at my paper. \u201cIt was summer, and Frank Sinatra was on the radio. Lana Turner and Ava Gardner were the starlets of the day. Stormy was eighteen. She was in the marching band, she was voted Best Legs, and she always had a date on Saturday night. On this particular night, she was on a date with a boy named Walt. On a dare, she went skinny-dipping in the town lake. Stormy never could turn down a dare.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Perelli laughs and says, \u201cThat\u2019s right, she never could.\u201d Other people murmur in agreement, \u201cShe never could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA farmer called the police, and when they shined their lights on the lake, Stormy told them to turn around before she would come out. She got a ride home in a police car that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the first time or the last,\u201d someone calls out, and everyone laughs, and I can feel my shoulders start to relax.</p><p>\u201cStormy lived more life in one night than most people do their whole lives. She was a force of nature. She</p><p>taught me that love\u2014\u201d My eyes well up and I start over. \u201cStormy taught me that love is about making brave choices every day. That\u2019s what Stormy did. She always picked love; she always picked adventure. To her they were one and the same. And now she\u2019s off on a new adventure, and we wish her well.\u201d</p><p>From his seat on the couch, John wipes his eyes with his sleeve.</p><p>I give Janette a nod, and she gets up and presses play on the stereo, and \u201cStormy Weather\u201d fills the room. \u201cDon\u2019t know why there\u2019s no sun up in the sky . . .\u201d</p><p>After, John shoulders his way over to me, holding two plastic cups of fruit punch. Ruefully he says, \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d tell us to spike it, but . . .\u201d He hands me a cup, and we clink. \u201cTo Edith Sinclair McClaren Sheehan, better known as Stormy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStormy\u2019s real name was Edith? It\u2019s so serious. It sounds like someone who wears wool skirts and heavy stockings, and drinks chamomile tea at night. Stormy drank cocktails!\u201d</p><p>John laughs. \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then where did the name Stormy come from? Why not Edie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d John says, a wry smile on his lips. \u201cShe\u2019d have loved your speech.\u201d He gives me a warm, appreciative sort of look. \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice girl, Lara Jean.\u201d I\u2019m embarrassed, I don\u2019t know what to say. Even though we never dated, seeing John again is what I imagine seeing an old boyfriend feels like. A wistful sort of feeling. Familiar, but just a little bit awkward, because there\u2019s so much left unsaid between us.</p><p>Then he says, \u201cStormy kept asking me to bring my girlfriend to visit her, and I never got around to it. I feel bad about that now.\u201d</p><p>As casually as I can, I say, \u201cOh, are you dating someone?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates for just a split-second and then nods. \u201cHer name is Dipti. We met at a Model</p><p>UN</p><p>convention at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. She beat me out for the gavel for our committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>We both start to speak at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided\u2014?</p><p>We laugh, and a sort of understanding passes between us. He says, \u201cI haven\u2019t decided. It\u2019s between College Park and William and Mary. College Park has a good business school, and it\u2019s really close to</p><p>DC</p><p>. William and Mary\u2019s ranked higher, but Williamsburg is in the boonies. So I don\u2019t know yet. My dad\u2019s bummed, because he really wanted me to go to</p><p>UNC</p><p>, but I didn\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I decide not to mention that I got wait-listed at</p><p>UNC</p><p>.</p><p>John shrugs. \u201cI might try and transfer there sophomore year. We\u2019ll see. What about you? Are you going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get in,\u201d I confess.</p><p>\u201cAw man! I hear they were insanely selective this year. My school\u2019s salutatorian didn\u2019t get in, and her application was killer. I\u2019m sure yours was too.\u201d</p><p>Shyly, I say, \u201cThanks, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where are you gonna go if not</p><p>UVA</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Mary.\u201d</p><p>His face breaks into a smile. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s awesome! Where\u2019s Kavinsky going?\u201d</p><p>\u201c</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cFor lacrosse, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about . . . Dipti?\u201d I say it like I don\u2019t remember her name, even though I do, I mean, I just heard him say it not two minutes ago. \u201cWhere\u2019s she going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got in early to Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole lot farther than</p><p>UVA</p><p>and William and Mary, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you guys going to . . . stay together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d John says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to at least give the long-distance thing a try. What about you and Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our plan too, for the first year. I\u2019m going to try to transfer to</p><p>UVA</p><p>for the second year.\u201d</p><p>John clinks his cup against mine. \u201cGood luck, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, John Ambrose McClaren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I end up going to William and Mary, I\u2019m going to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d I say.</p><p>I stay at Belleview a lot longer than I expected. Someone brings out their old records and then people start dancing, and Mr. Perelli insists on teaching me how to rumba, in spite of his bad hip. When Janette puts on Glenn Miller\u2019s song \u201cIn the Mood,\u201d my eyes meet John\u2019s, and we share</p><p>a secret smile, both of us remembering the</p><p>USO</p><p>party. It was like something out of a movie. It feels like a long time ago now.</p><p>It\u2019s strange to feel happy at a memorial for someone you loved, but that\u2019s how I feel. I\u2019m happy that the day has gone well, that we\u2019ve sent Stormy off in style. It feels good to say a proper good-bye, to have the chance.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I get back from Belleview, Peter\u2019s sitting on my front steps with a Starbucks cup. \u201cIs nobody home?\u201d I ask, hurrying up the walk. \u201cDid you have to wait long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Still sitting, he reaches out his arms and pulls me in for a hug around my waist. \u201cCome sit and talk to me for a minute before we go inside,\u201d he says, burying his face in my stomach. I sit down next to him. He asks, \u201cHow was Stormy\u2019s memorial? How\u2019d your speech go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, but first tell me about Days on the Lawn.\u201d I grab his Starbucks cup out of his hands and take a sip of coffee, which is cold.</p><p>\u201cEh. I sat in on a class. Met some people. Not that exciting.\u201d Then he takes my right hand in his, traces his finger over the lace of my gloves. \u201cThese are cool.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s something bothering him, something he isn\u2019t saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>He looks away. \u201cMy dad showed up this morning and wanted to come with us.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cSo . . . did you let him come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t elaborate. Just, nope.</p><p>Hesitantly, I say, \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s trying to have a relationship with you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had plenty of chances and now it\u2019s too late. That ship has fucking sailed. I\u2019m not a kid anymore.\u201d He lifts his chin. \u201cI\u2019m a man, and he didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. He just wants the credit. He wants to brag to his golf buddies that his son is playing lacrosse for</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. Then I think of how his dad looked when he was watching Peter out on the lacrosse field. There was such pride in his eyes\u2014and love. \u201cPeter . . . what if\u2014what if you gave him a chance?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s shaking his head. \u201cLara Jean, you don\u2019t get it. And you\u2019re lucky not to get it. Your dad\u2019s freaking awesome. He\u2019d do anything for you guys. My dad\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s just in it for himself. If I let him back in, he\u2019ll just fuck up again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe it is worth it. You never know how long you have with people.\u201d Peter flinches. I\u2019ve never said something like that to him before, brought my mom up like that, but after losing Stormy, I can\u2019t help it. I have to say it because it\u2019s true and because I\u2019ll regret it if I don\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s not about your dad. It\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about not having regrets later. Don\u2019t hurt yourself just to spite him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him anymore. I came over here to make you feel better, not to talk about my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But first, promise me you\u2019ll think about inviting him to graduation.\u201d He starts to speak, and I interrupt him. \u201cJust think about it. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s a whole month away. You don\u2019t</p><p>have to decide anything right now, so don\u2019t say yes or no.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighs, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to tell me no, but instead he asks, \u201cHow\u2019d your speech go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it went okay. I think Stormy would\u2019ve liked it. I talked about the time she got caught skinny-dipping and the police came and she had to ride home in a squad car. Oh, and John made it back in time.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods in a diplomatic sort of way. I\u2019d told him John might be coming today, and all he said was \u201cCool, cool,\u201d because of course he couldn\u2019t say anything different. John was Stormy\u2019s grandson, after all. \u201cSo where\u2019s McClaren going to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t decided yet. It\u2019s between Maryland and William and Mary.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyebrows fly up. \u201c</p><p>Really.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d He says it in a way that makes it clear he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s awesome at all.</p><p>I give him a funny look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Did he hear that you\u2019re going there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just told him today. Not that one thing has anything to do with the other. You\u2019re being really weird right now, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how would you feel if I told you Gen was going to</p><p>UVA</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not that bothered?\u201d I mean that sincerely. All of my bad feelings about Peter and Genevieve feel like such a long time ago. Peter and I have come so far since then. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s completely different. John and I never</p><p>even dated. We haven\u2019t spoken in months. Also, he has a girlfriend. Also, he hasn\u2019t even decided if he\u2019s going there or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s his girlfriend going then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnn Arbor.\u201d</p><p>He makes a dismissive sound. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna last.\u201d</p><p>Softly I say, \u201cMaybe people will look at you and me and think the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s literally not the same thing at all. We\u2019re only going to be a couple of hours apart, and then you\u2019re transferring. That\u2019s one year tops. I\u2019ll drive down on weekends. It\u2019s literally not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said literally twice,\u201d I say, to make him smile. When he doesn\u2019t, I say, \u201cYou\u2019ll have practice and games. You won\u2019t want to be at William and Mary every weekend.\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had this thought.</p><p>For just a moment Peter looks stung, but then he shrugs and says, \u201cFine, or you\u2019ll come up here. We\u2019ll get you used to the drive. It\u2019s basically all just I-64.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Mary doesn\u2019t let freshmen have cars. Neither does</p><p>UVA</p><p>. I checked.\u201d</p><p>Peter brushes this off. \u201cSo I\u2019ll get my mom to drop my car off when I want to come see you. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s far. And you can take the bus. We\u2019ll make it work. I\u2019m not worried about us.\u201d</p><p>I am, a little, but I don\u2019t say so, because Peter doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about practicalities. I guess I don\u2019t either.</p><p>Scooting closer to me, he asks, \u201cWant me to stay over tonight?</p><p>I can come back after my mom goes to bed. I can distract you if you get sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d I tell him, pinching his cheek.</p><p>\u201cDid Josh ever spend the night? With your sister, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I ponder this. \u201cNot that I know of. I mean, I really doubt it. We\u2019re talking about my sister and Josh, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s them,\u201d Peter says, dipping his head low and rubbing his cheek against mine. He loves how soft my cheeks are; he\u2019s always saying that. \u201cWe\u2019re nothing like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought them up,\u201d I start to say, but then he is kissing me, and I can\u2019t even finish a thought, much less a sentence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE MORNING OF PROM, KITTY</p><p>comes in my room as I\u2019m painting my toes. \u201cWhat do you think about this color with my dress?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you dipped your toenails in Pepto-Bismol.\u201d</p> <p>I peer down at my feet. It kind of does look like that. Maybe I should do a beige color instead.</p><p>The consensus is that the dress requires an updo. \u201cTo show off your collarbone,\u201d Trina says. I\u2019ve never thought of my collarbone as something to be shown off; in fact I\u2019ve never thought of my collarbone at all.</p><p>After lunch Kitty goes with me to the hair salon, to supervise. She tells the stylist, \u201cDon\u2019t make it too</p><p>done</p><p>, do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>The stylist gives me a nervous look in the mirror. \u201cI think so? You want it to look natural?\u201d She\u2019s talking to Kitty, not me, because it\u2019s obvious who is in charge. \u201cLike a natural chignon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not too natural. Think Grace Kelly.\u201d Kitty pulls up a picture on her phone and shows it to her. \u201cSee, like this, but we want the bun to the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust please don\u2019t use too much hairspray,\u201d I say meekly, as the stylist coils my hair into a knot at the nape of my neck and shows Kitty.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Kitty says to her. To me she says, \u201cLara Jean, she has to use hairspray if you want it to stay up.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m having second thoughts about an updo. \u201cAre we sure about the updo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kitty says. To the stylist she says, \u201cWe\u2019re doing the updo.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>The updo is more \u201cdone\u201d than I\u2019m used to. My hair is in a side bun; the top is smooth like a ballerina. It\u2019s pretty, but when I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t recognize myself. It\u2019s an older, sophisticated version of me who\u2019s going to the opera, or the symphony.</p><p>After all the time the woman at the salon spent putting my hair up, I end up taking it down when I get home. Kitty yells at me as she brushes my hair out, but I bear it. Tonight I want to feel like me.</p><p>\u201cHow are we doing your grand entrance?\u201d Kitty asks me as she sweeps the brush through my hair one last time.</p><p>\u201cGrand entrance?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cWhen Peter gets here. How are you going to enter the room?\u201d</p><p>Trina, who is lying on my bed eating a Popsicle, pipes up with, \u201cWhen I went to prom, we did a thing where the dads walked the girls down the stairs and then somebody would announce you.\u201d</p><p>I look at them both like they are nuts. \u201cTrina, I\u2019m not getting married. I\u2019m going to prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could turn off all the lights and put on music, and</p><p>then you walk out and do a pose at the top of the stairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>Her forehead creases. \u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you need a moment where everybody looks at you and only you,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a first look,\u201d Trina explains. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get the whole thing on video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d thought about this earlier, we could\u2019ve really done it up, and maybe it would\u2019ve gone viral.\u201d Kitty shakes her head at me in a disgusted way, as if this is somehow my fault.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I need is to go viral again,\u201d I tell her. Pointedly I say, \u201cRemember my hot tub video?\u201d</p><p>She at least looks a little abashed, for a second. \u201cLet\u2019s not linger on the past,\u201d she says, fluffing up my hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, birthday girl,\u201d Trina says to me. \u201cIs the plan still to go for barbecue tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I say. With Stormy passing away and prom and the wedding and everything else, I haven\u2019t given my birthday much thought. Trina wanted to throw me a big party, but I told her I\u2019d rather just have a family dinner out, and cake and ice cream back at the house. Trina and Kitty are baking the cake while I\u2019m at prom, so we\u2019ll see how that goes!</p><p>* *</p><p>When Peter and his mom arrive, I\u2019m still running around doing last minute things.</p><p>\u201cGuys, Peter and his mom are here,\u201d my dad calls up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cPerfume!\u201d I screech to Kitty, who sprays me. \u201cWhere\u2019s my clutch?\u201d</p><p>Trina tosses it to me. \u201cDid you pack a lipstick?\u201d</p><p>I open it to check. \u201cYes! Where are my shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Kitty says, picking them up off the floor. \u201cHurry up and get strapped in. I\u2019ll go downstairs and tell them you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open up a bottle of champagne for the grown-ups,\u201d Trina says, following her out.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so nervous. It\u2019s only Peter. I guess prom really is its own kind of magic. The last thing I do is put on Stormy\u2019s ring, and I think of how she must be looking down on me right now, happy I\u2019m wearing her ring on prom night, in honor of her and all the dances she went to.</p><p>When I come down the stairs, Peter is sitting on the couch with his mom. He is shaking his knee up and down, which is how I know he\u2019s nervous too. As soon as he sees me, he stands up.</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cYou look\u2014wow.\u201d For the past week, he\u2019s been asking for details on what my dress looks like, and I held him at bay for the surprise, which I\u2019m glad I did, because it was worth it to see the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou look wow too.\u201d His tux fits him so nicely, you\u2019d think it was custom, but it\u2019s not; it\u2019s a rental from After Hours Formal Wear. I wonder if Mrs. Kavinsky made a few sly adjustments. She\u2019s a marvel with a needle and thread. I</p><p>wish guys could wear tuxedos more often, though I suppose that would take some of the thrill away.</p><p>Peter slides my corsage on my wrist; it is white ranunculus and baby\u2019s breath, and it\u2019s the exact corsage I would have picked for myself. I\u2019m already thinking of how I\u2019ll hang it over my bed so it dries just so.</p><p>Kitty is dressed up too; she has on her favorite dress, so she can be in the pictures. When Peter pins a daisy corsage on her, her face goes pink with pleasure, and he winks at me. We take a picture of me and her, one of me and Peter and her, and then she says in her bossy way, \u201cNow just one of me and Peter,\u201d and I\u2019m pushed off to the side with Trina, who laughs.</p><p>\u201cThe boys her age are in for it,\u201d she says to me and Peter\u2019s mom, who is smiling too.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not in any of these pictures?\u201d Daddy wonders, so of course we do a round with him too, and a few with Trina and Mrs. Kavinsky.</p><p>Then we take pictures outside, by the dogwood tree, by Peter\u2019s car, on the front steps, until Peter says, \u201cEnough pictures! We\u2019re going to miss the whole thing.\u201d When we go to his car, he opens the door for me gallantly.</p><p>On the way over, he keeps looking at me. I keep my eyes trained straight ahead, but I can see him in my periphery. I\u2019ve never felt so admired. This must be how Stormy felt all the time.</p><p>* *</p><p>As soon as we get to prom, I tell Peter we have to get in line to take our official prom picture with the professional</p><p>photographer. He says we should just wait till the line dies down, but I insist. I want a good one for my scrapbook, before my hair goes flat. We do the requisite prom pose, with Peter standing behind me, his hands on my hips. The photographer lets us take a look at our picture, and Peter insists on taking another one because he doesn\u2019t like the way his hair looks.</p><p>After we take our picture, we find all of our friends on the dance floor. Darrell has matched his tie to Pammy\u2019s dress\u2014lavender. Chris is wearing a tight black bandage dress\u2014not unlike the one Kitty picked out for me to wear when she and Margot and I went shopping. Lucas looks like an English dandy in his suit, which is tailored to his body just beautifully. I finally convinced the two of them to come, by suggesting they just \u201cstop by.\u201d Chris said she was still going clubbing with her work friends, but from the looks of it, she isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. She\u2019s getting so much attention in her bandage dress.</p><p>\u201cStyle\u201d comes on and we all go crazy, screaming in each other\u2019s faces and jumping up and down. Peter goes craziest of all. He keeps asking me if I\u2019m having fun. He only asks out loud once, but with his eyes he asks me again and again. They are bright and hopeful, alight with expectation. With my eyes I tell him,</p><p>Yes yes yes I am having fun.</p><p>We\u2019re starting to get the hang of slow dancing, too. Maybe we should take a ballroom-dancing class when I get to</p><p>UVA</p><p>so we can actually get good at it.</p><p>I tell him this, and fondly he says, \u201cYou always want to take</p><p>things to the next level. Next-level chocolate chip cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave up on those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext-level Halloween costumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like for things to feel special.\u201d At this, Peter smiles down at me and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s just too bad we\u2019ll never dance cheek to cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could order you some dancing stilts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean high heels?\u201d</p><p>He snickers. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as ten-inch heels.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too bad your noodle arms aren\u2019t strong enough to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a roar like an injured lion and swoops me up and swings me around, just like I knew he would. It\u2019s a rare thing, to know someone so well, whether they\u2019ll pivot left or right. Outside of my family, I think he might be the person I know best of all.</p><p>* *</p><p>Of course Peter wins prom king. Prom queen is Ashanti Dickson. I\u2019m just relieved it isn\u2019t Genevieve up there, slow dancing with him with a tiara on her head. Ashanti is nearly Peter\u2019s height, so the two of them actually can dance cheek to cheek, though they don\u2019t. Peter looks out at me and winks. I\u2019m standing off to the side with Marshawn Hopkins, Ashanti\u2019s date. He leans over to me and says, \u201cWhen they come back, we should ignore them and just dance away,\u201d which makes me laugh.</p><p>I\u2019m proud of Peter out there, at how he dances so tall,</p><p>with his back so straight. At a pivotal moment in the song, Peter dips Ashanti, and everyone hoots and hollers and stomps their feet, and I\u2019m proud of that, too. People are so sincere in their affection for him; they can all celebrate Peter because he is nice, and he makes everyone feel good. He just gives the night a little extra shine, and they are glad for it, and so am I. I\u2019m happy he gets this send-off.</p><p>* *</p><p>One last dance.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet. It\u2019s not over yet. We still have the whole summer ahead. But high school, the two of us here together, Lara Jean and Peter as we are today, that part is done. We\u2019ll never be here exactly like this again.</p><p>I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s feeling sad too, and then he whispers, \u201cCheck out Gabe over there trying to casually rest his hand on Keisha\u2019s butt.\u201d</p><p>He turns me slightly so I can see. Gabe\u2019s hand is indeed hovering at Keisha Wood\u2019s lower back/butt area, like an indecisive butterfly looking for a landing spot. I giggle. This is why I like Peter so much. He sees things I don\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cI know what our song should be,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>And then, like magic, Al Green\u2019s voice fills the hotel ballroom. \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made them play this,\u201d I accuse. I\u2019m tearing up a little bit.</p><p>He grins. \u201cIt\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>Whatever you want to do . . . is all right with me-ee-ee.</p><p>Peter takes my hand and puts it on his heart. \u201cLet\u2019s, let\u2019s stay together,\u201d he sings. His voice is clear and true, everything I love about him.</p><p>* *</p><p>On the way to after-prom, Peter says he\u2019s hungry, and can we stop at the diner first.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be pizza at after-prom,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just eat there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want pancakes,\u201d he whines.</p><p>We pull into the diner parking lot, and after we park, he gets out of the car and runs around to the passenger side to open my door. \u201cSo gentlemanly tonight,\u201d I say, which makes him grin.</p><p>We walk up to the diner, and he opens the door for me grandly.</p><p>\u201cI could get used to this royal treatment,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey, I open doors for you,\u201d he protests.</p><p>We walk inside, and I stop short. Our booth, the one we always sit in, has pale pink balloons tied around it. There\u2019s a round cake in the center of the table, tons of candles, pink frosting with sprinkles and</p><p>Happy Birthday, Lara Jean</p><p>scrawled in white frosting. Suddenly I see people\u2019s heads pop up from under the booths and from behind menus\u2014all of our friends, still in their prom finery: Lucas, Gabe, Gabe\u2019s date Keisha, Darrell, Pammy, Chris. \u201cSurprise!\u201d everyone screams.</p><p>I spin around. \u201cOh my God, Peter!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still grinning. He looks at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s midnight. Happy birthday, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I leap up and hug him. \u201cThis is just exactly what I wanted to do on my prom night birthday and I didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d Then I let go of him and run over to the booth.</p><p>Everyone gets out and hugs me. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know people knew it was my birthday tomorrow! I mean today!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOf course we knew it was your birthday,\u201d Lucas says.</p><p>Darrell says, \u201cMy boy\u2019s been planning this for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so endearing,\u201d Pammy says. \u201cHe called me to ask what kind of pan he should use for the cake.\u201d</p><p>Chris says, \u201cHe called me, too. I was like, how the hell should I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d I hit Chris on the arm. \u201cI thought you were leaving to go clubbing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still might after I steal some fries. My night\u2019s just getting started, babe.\u201d She pulls me in for a hug and gives me a kiss on the cheek. \u201cHappy birthday, girl.\u201d</p><p>I turn to Peter and say, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI baked that cake myself,\u201d he brags. \u201cBox, but still.\u201d He takes off his jacket and pulls a lighter out of his jacket pocket and starts lighting the candles. Gabe pulls out a lit candle and helps him. Then Peter hops his butt on the table and sits down, his legs hanging off the edge. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I look around. \u201cUm . . .\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the opening notes of \u201cIf You Were Here\u201d by the Thompson Twins. My hands fly to my cheeks. I</p><p>can\u2019t believe it. Peter\u2019s recreating the end scene from</p><p>Sixteen Candles</p><p>, when Molly Ringwald and Jake Ryan sit on a table with a birthday cake in between them. When we watched the movie a few months ago, I said it was the most romantic thing I\u2019d ever seen. And now he\u2019s doing it for me.</p><p>\u201cHurry up and get up there before all the candles melt, Lara Jean,\u201d Chris calls out.</p><p>Darrell and Gabe help hoist me onto the table, careful not to set my dress on fire. Peter says, \u201cOkay, now you look at me adoringly, and I lean forward like this.\u201d</p><p>Chris comes forward and puffs out my skirt a bit. \u201cRoll up your sleeve a little higher,\u201d she instructs Peter, looking from her phone to us. Peter obeys, and she nods. \u201cLooks good, looks good.\u201d Then she runs back to her spot and starts to snap. It takes no effort on my part at all to look at Peter adoringly tonight.</p><p>When I blow out the candles and make my wish, I wish that I will always feel for Peter the way I do right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE NEIGHBORHOOD POOL ALWAYS OPENS</p><p>up on Memorial Day weekend. When we were little, Margot and I would count down the days. Our mom would pack ham and cheese sandwiches wrapped in wax paper, carrot sticks, and a big jug of apple water. Apple water was watered down sugar-free apple juice, but mostly water. I begged for soda out of the machine, or fruit punch, but no. Mommy would slather us up with sunscreen the same way she slathered butter on a turkey. Kitty used to scream her head off; she was too impatient for the rubdown. Kitty\u2019s always been impatient; she\u2019s always wanted more, now. It\u2019s funny how much of who we are as babies is who we are as we get older. I\u2019d never have known it if it weren\u2019t for Kitty. She still makes the same screwy faces.</p><p>Kitty isn\u2019t doing swim team this year; she says it isn\u2019t fun anymore now that none of her friends are doing it. When she didn\u2019t know I was watching, I saw her looking at the meet schedule on the community board with wistfulness in her eyes. I guess that\u2019s part of growing up, too\u2014saying good-bye to the things you used to love.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s lawns are freshly cut, and the air smells of clovers and green. The first crickets of summer are chirping. This is the soundtrack of my summer and every summer.</p><p>Peter and I have staked our claim on the lounge chairs farthest away from the kiddie pool, because it\u2019s less noisy. I\u2019m studying for my French final, or trying to, at least.</p><p>\u201cCome over here so I can get your shoulders first,\u201d I call out to Kitty, who is standing by the pool with her friend Brielle.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t burn,\u201d she calls back, and it\u2019s true; her shoulders are already tanned like golden brioche. By the end of summer they\u2019ll be dark as the crust on whole wheat bread. Kitty\u2019s hair is slicked back, a towel around her shoulders. She\u2019s all arms and legs now.</p><p>\u201cJust come over here,\u201d I say.</p><p>Kitty trots over to the lounge chairs Peter and I are sitting on, her flip-flops clacking against the pavement.</p> <p>I spray her with the sunscreen and rub it into her shoulders. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t burn. Protect your skin so you don\u2019t end up looking like an old leather bag.\u201d That\u2019s what Stormy used to tell me.</p><p>Kitty giggles at \u201cold leather bag.\u201d \u201cLike Mrs. Letty. Her skin is hot dog\u2013colored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t talking about any one person in particular. But yeah. She should\u2019ve worn sunscreen in her younger days. Let that be a lesson to you, my sister.\u201d Mrs. Letty is our neighbor, and her skin hangs on her like crepe.</p><p>Peter puts on his sunglasses. \u201cYou guys are mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSays the guy who once toilet-papered her lawn!\u201d</p><p>Kitty giggles and steals a sip of my Coke. \u201cYou did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll lies and propaganda,\u201d Peter says blithely.</p><p>As the day heats up, Peter convinces me to put down my French book and jump in the pool with him. The pool is crowded with little kids, no one as old as us. Steve Bledell has a pool at his house, but I wanted to come here, for old times\u2019 sake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare dunk me,\u201d I warn. Peter starts circling me like a shark, coming closer and closer. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>He makes a dive for me and grabs me by the waist, but he doesn\u2019t dunk me; he kisses me. His skin is cool and smooth against mine; so are his lips.</p><p>I push him away and whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss me\u2014there are kids around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nobody wants to see teenagers kissing in the pool where kids are trying to play. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d I know I sound like a priss, but I don\u2019t care. When I was little, and there were teenagers horsing around in the pool, I always felt nervous to go in, because it was like the pool was theirs.</p><p>Peter bursts out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re funny, Covey.\u201d Swimming sideways, he says, \u201c \u2018It isn\u2019t right,\u2019 \u201d and then starts laughing again.</p><p>The lifeguard blows the whistle for adult swim, and all the kids get out, including Peter and me. We go back to the lounge chairs, and Peter pushes them closer together.</p><p>I turn on my side and, squinting up at the sun, I ask him, \u201cHow old do you think you have to be to stay in the pool for adult swim? Eighteen or twenty-one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Twenty-one?\u201d He\u2019s scrolling on his phone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s eighteen. We should ask.\u201d I put on my sunglasses and start to sing \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d from</p><p>The Sound of Music</p><p>. \u201cYou need someone older and wiser, telling you what to do.\u201d I tap him on the nose for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m older than you,\u201d he objects.</p><p>I run my hand along Peter\u2019s cheek and sing, \u201cI am seventeen going on eighteen, I-I-I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSing it just once for me,\u201d I prompt. Peter gives me a look. \u201cPlease? I love it when you sing. Your voice is so clean.\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t help but smile. Peter never met a compliment he didn\u2019t smile at. \u201cI don\u2019t know the words,\u201d he protests.</p><p>\u201cYes you do.\u201d I pretend to wave a wand in his face. \u201c</p><p>Imperio!</p><p>Wait\u2014do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . an unforgivable curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very impressive, Peter K. And what does it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes you do things you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, young wizard. There\u2019s hope for you yet. Now sing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little witch.\u201d He looks around to see if anyone is listening, and then he softly sings, \u201cI need someone older and wiser telling me what to do. . . . You are seventeen going on eighteen . . . I\u2019ll depend on you.\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands in delight. Is there anything more intoxicating than making a boy bend to your will? I roll closer to him and throw my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re the one making</p><p>PDA</p><p>s!\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou really do have a pretty voice, Peter. You never should\u2019ve quit chorus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I ever took chorus is because all the girls were in chorus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then forget about joining a chorus at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. No a cappella groups either.\u201d I mean it to be a joke, truly, but Peter looks bothered. \u201cI\u2019m kidding! Join all the a cappella groups you want! The Hullabahoos are all guys, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to join an a cappella group. And I\u2019m not planning on looking at other girls, either.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cOf course you\u2019ll look at other girls. You have eyes, don\u2019t you? I swear, that\u2019s just as silly as when people say they don\u2019t see color. Everyone sees everyone. You can\u2019t help but see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d I sit up and put my French book back in my lap. \u201cAre you really not going to study at all for your</p><p>US</p><p>history final on Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I need to do at this point is pass,\u201d he reminds me.</p><p>\u201cIt must be nice, it must be nice,\u201d I sing.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not like William and Mary is taking away your spot if you get a C in French,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about French. I\u2019m worried about my calculus exam on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll kick you out for getting a C in calculus, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so, but I still want to finish well,\u201d I say. The countdown is really on, now that May is nearly over. Just one more week left of school. I stretch out my arms and legs and</p><p>squint up into the sun and let out a happy sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s come here every day next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m going on that training weekend, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s weird that the season is over and we won\u2019t be playing any more games together.\u201d</p><p>Our school\u2019s lacrosse team didn\u2019t make it to state championships. They knew it was a long shot, because as Peter likes to say, \u201cThere\u2019s only one of me.\u201d Ha! Next weekend he is off to a training camp with his new team at</p><p>UVA</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cAre you excited to meet your teammates?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI already know a few of the guys, but yeah. It\u2019ll be cool.\u201d He reaches over and starts braiding a section of my hair. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting better at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the whole summer to practice,\u201d I say, leaning forward so he can reach more of my hair. He doesn\u2019t say anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE END OF SCHOOL ALWAYS</p><p>has a particular feeling to it. It\u2019s the same every year, but this year the feeling is amplified, because there won\u2019t be a next year. There\u2019s an air of things closing down. Teachers wear shorts and T-shirts to class. They show movies while they clean out their desks. Nobody has the energy to care anymore. We\u2019re all just counting down, passing time. Everyone knows where they\u2019re going, and the right now already feels like it\u2019s in the rearview. Suddenly life feels fast and slow at the same time. It\u2019s like being in two places at once.</p><p>Finals go well; even calculus isn\u2019t as bad as I thought. And just like that, my high school career is coming to an end. Peter\u2019s gone away on his training weekend. It\u2019s only been one day and I\u2019m already longing for him the way I long for Christmas in July. Peter is my cocoa in a cup, my red mittens, my Christmas morning feeling.</p> <p>He said he\u2019d call as soon as he gets back from the gym, so I keep my phone by my side, with the volume up. Earlier this morning he called when I was in the shower, and by the time I saw it, he was gone again. Is this what the future looks like? It\u2019ll be different when I have classes and a schedule of my own, but for now it feels like I am standing on top of a lighthouse, waiting for my love\u2019s ship to come in. For a romantic kind</p><p>of person, it\u2019s not an altogether unpleasant feeling, not for now, anyway. It\u2019ll be different when it\u2019s not so novel anymore, when not seeing him every day is the new normal, but for now, just for now, longing is its own kind of perverse delight.</p><p>Late afternoon, I go downstairs in my long white nightgown that Margot says makes me look like</p> <p>Little House on the Prairie</p><p>and Kitty says makes me look like a ghost. I sit at the counter with one leg up and open a can of cling peaches and eat them with a fork, right out of the can. There\u2019s something so satisfying about biting into the skin of a syrupy cling peach.</p><p>I let out a sigh, and Kitty looks up from her computer and says, \u201cWhat are you sighing about so loudly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss . . . Christmas.\u201d I bite into another slice of peach.</p> <p>She brightens. \u201cSo do I! I think we should get a few deer to go in our front yard this year. Not the cheap kind, the classy wire kind that come covered in lights.\u201d</p><p>I sigh again and set down the can. \u201cSure.\u201d The syrup is starting to feel heavy in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cQuit sighing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does sighing feel so good?\u201d I muse.</p> <p>Kitty heaves a big sigh. \u201cWell, it\u2019s basically the same thing as breathing. And it feels good to breathe. Air is delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I spear another slice of peach. \u201cI wonder where you buy those kinds of deer. Target will probably sell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go to that store the Christmas Mouse. We can stock up on a bunch of stuff. Don\u2019t they have one in Williamsburg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, on the way to the outlet malls. You know, we could</p><p>use a new wreath, too. And if they have lavender lights, that could be cool. It would give it a winter-fairyland kind of feeling. Maybe the whole tree could be in pastels.\u201d</p><p>Dryly she says, \u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away.\u201d</p><p>I ignore her. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that Trina has a lot of her own holiday stuff. She has a whole Christmas village, remember? It\u2019s all packed away in those boxes in the garage.\u201d Trina\u2019s village isn\u2019t just a little nativity scene. It has a barber shop and a bakery and a toy store; it\u2019s intense. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where we\u2019ll put it.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to throw away some of our old stuff.\u201d God, Kitty doesn\u2019t have an ounce of sentimentality in her! In that same practical tone she adds, \u201cNot everything we have is so great anyway. Our tree skirt is scraggly and chewed-up-looking. Why keep something just because it\u2019s old? New is almost always better than old, you know.\u201d</p><p>I look away. Our mom bought that tree skirt at a Christmas fair the elementary school had. One of the</p><p>PTA</p><p>moms was a knitter. Margot and I fought over which to pick; she liked the red with tartan trim, and I liked the white because I thought it would look like our tree was standing in snow. Mommy went with the red, because she said the white would get dirty fast. The red has held up well, but Kitty\u2019s right; it\u2019s probably time to retire it. I\u2019ll never let her throw it away though, and neither will Margot. At the very least, I\u2019ll cut off a square and put it in my hat box for safekeeping.</p><p>\u201cTrina has a nice tree skirt,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s white fur. Jamie Fox-Pickle will love to snuggle with it.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes, and I jump to see if it\u2019s Peter, but it\u2019s only Daddy saying he\u2019s picking up Thai food for dinner, and do we want pad thai or pad see yew? I sigh again.</p><p>\u201cI swear, Lara Jean, if you sigh one more time!\u201d Kitty threatens. Eyeing me, she says, \u201cI know it\u2019s not really Christmas you\u2019re missing. Peter\u2019s been gone for like one day and you\u2019re acting like he went off to war or something.\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and type back</p><p>pad see yew</p><p>out of pure spite, because I know Kitty prefers pad thai.</p><p>That\u2019s when I get the e-mail notification. It\u2019s from</p><p>UNC</p><p>admissions. My application has been updated. I click on the link.</p><p>Congratulations . . .</p><p>I\u2019m off the wait list.</p><p>What in the</p><p>what</p><p>?</p><p>I sit there, stunned, reading it over and over. I, Lara Jean Song Covey, was accepted to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I can\u2019t believe it. I never thought I\u2019d get in. But I\u2019m in.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean? Hello?\u201d</p><p>Startled, I look up.</p><p>\u201cI just asked you a question three times. What\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . I think I just got in to</p><p>UNC</p><p>Chapel Hill.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cWhoa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird, right?\u201d I shake my head in wonder. Who\u2019d have ever thought it? Not me. I\u2019d all but forgotten about</p><p>UNC</p><p>after I got wait-listed.</p><p>\u201c</p><p>UNC</p><p>is a really hard school to get into, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I\u2019m still in a daze. After I didn\u2019t get into</p><p>UVA</p><p>, I felt so low, like I wasn\u2019t good enough to be there. But</p><p>UNC</p><p>! It\u2019s even harder to get into</p><p>UNC</p><p>out of state than it is</p><p>UVA</p><p>in state.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s smile fades a little. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you going to William and Mary? Didn\u2019t you already send in your deposit? And aren\u2019t you transferring to</p><p>UVA</p><p>next year anyway?\u201d</p><p>UVA</p><p>. For those few seconds, I forgot about transferring to</p><p>UVA</p><p>and I was just happy about</p><p>UNC</p><p>. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d I say. My phone buzzes, and my heart jumps, thinking it\u2019s Peter, but\u2019s it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a text from Chris.</p><p>Wanna go to Starb</p><p>I write back,</p><p>GUESS WHAT. I got into UNC!</p><p>OMG!</p><p>I\u2019m calling you</p><p>A second later my phone rings and Chris screams, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you! I mean, wow. I just . . . it\u2019s such a great school. I figured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I glance over at Kitty, who is watching with eagle eyes. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m still going to William and Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t</p><p>UNC</p><p>a better school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s higher ranked. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cTo visit? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now! Spontaneous road trip!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s four hours away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not. It\u2019s only three hours and twenty-five minutes. I just looked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time we get there, it\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock. Big deal. We\u2019ll walk around, get dinner, and then drive back. Why not! We\u2019re young. And you need to know what you\u2019re saying no to.\u201d Before I can protest again, she says, \u201cI\u2019m picking you up in ten minutes. Pack some snacks for the road.\u201d Then she hangs up.</p><p>Kitty is eyeing me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to North Carolina? Right now?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling pretty euphoric at the moment. I laugh and say, \u201cI guess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re going there instead of William and Mary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m just going to visit. Nothing\u2019s changed. Don\u2019t tell Daddy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014because. You can tell him I\u2019m with Chris, and that I won\u2019t be at dinner, but don\u2019t mention anything about</p><p>UNC</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019m getting dressed and flying around the house like a banshee, throwing things into a tote. Dried wasabi peas, Pocky sticks, bottled water. Chris and I have never gone on a road trip together before; I\u2019ve always wanted to do that with her. And what would it hurt to just look at Chapel Hill, just to see? I won\u2019t</p><p>be going there, but it\u2019s still fun to think about.</p><p>Chris and I are halfway to Chapel Hill before I realize my phone is dying and I forgot to pack my charger. \u201cDo you have a car charger?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She\u2019s singing along to the radio. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot!\u201d We\u2019ve eaten up most of her phone battery using the</p><p>GPS</p><p>, too. I feel a little uneasy about traveling out of state without a full charge on my phone. Plus, I told Kitty not to tell Daddy where I was going. What if something were to happen? \u201cWhat time are we getting back, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit worrying, Granny Lara Jean. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She rolls down her window and mine and starts fumbling around for her purse. I get her purse from the floor of the backseat and pull out her cigarettes before she wrecks the car. When we\u2019re at a red light, she lights her cigarette and inhales deeply. \u201cWe\u2019ll be like pioneers. It just adds to the adventure. Our forefathers didn\u2019t have cell phones either, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember, we\u2019re only going to look. I\u2019m still going to William and Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just remember\u2014options are everything,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>That\u2019s what Margot\u2019s always telling me. Those two have more in common than they think.</p><p>We spend the rest of the trip surfing radio stations and singing along and talking about whether or not Chris should dye her hair pink in the front. I\u2019m surprised by how fast the time goes. We get to Chapel Hill in just under three hours and thirty minutes, like Chris said we would. We find a parking spot right on Franklin Street, which I guess is their main</p><p>street. The first thing that strikes me is how similar</p><p>UNC</p><p>\u2019s campus is to</p><p>UVA</p><p>\u2019s. Lots of maple trees, lots of green, lots of brick buildings.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I stop to admire a pink flowering dogwood tree. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they have so many dogwood trees, since it\u2019s Virginia\u2019s state flower. What do you suppose is North Carolina\u2019s state flower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Can we please eat? I\u2019m starving.\u201d Chris has the attention span of a fly, and when she is hungry, everybody better watch out.</p><p>I put my arm around her waist. I\u2019m suddenly feeling very tender toward her for taking me on this trip to see what might have been. \u201cLet\u2019s fill that belly up, then. What do you want? Pizza? A hoagie? Chinese food?\u201d</p><p>She puts her arm around my shoulder. Her mood is already picking up at the mention of different cuisines. \u201cYou pick. Anything but Chinese food. Or pizza. You know what, let\u2019s get sushi.\u201d</p><p>A couple of guys pass on the street, and Chris calls out, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>They turn around. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d one says. He\u2019s black, handsome, tall, with muscular arms in a</p><p>CAROLINA WRESTLING</p><p>T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the best sushi around here?\u201d Chris asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat sushi, so I can\u2019t really say.\u201d He looks at his red-haired friend, who is less cute but still cute. \u201cWhere do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpicy Nine,\u201d he says, eyeing Chris. \u201cJust go down Franklin that way and you\u2019ll run right into it.\u201d He winks at her,</p><p>and they go back to walking in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cShould we go after them?\u201d she says, her eyes following them as they walk away. \u201cFind out what they\u2019re up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>I steer her in the direction they pointed us to. \u201cI thought you were hungry,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s one point in the</p><p>UNC</p><p>column, am I right? Hotter guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure William and Mary has good-looking guys too.\u201d Quickly I add, \u201cNot that it matters to me, because I obviously have a boyfriend.\u201d Who still hasn\u2019t called, mind you. My phone is down to 5 percent, so by the time he does, it\u2019ll be too late.</p><p>* *</p><p>After we eat sushi, we wander around on Franklin Street, stopping in stores. I consider buying a</p><p>UNC</p><p>Tar Heels basketball hat for Peter, but he probably wouldn\u2019t wear it, since he\u2019ll be a Wahoo.</p><p>We pass a pole with signs on it, and Chris stops short. She points to a sign for a music hall called Cat\u2019s Cradle. A band called Meow Mixx is playing tonight. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Chris says.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of Meow Mixx before?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat kind of music do they play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares. Let\u2019s just go!\u201d She grabs my hand. Laughing, we run down the street together.</p><p>There\u2019s a line to get inside, and the band has already started to play; snatches of dancey music float through the</p><p>open door. A couple of girls are waiting in line in front of us, and Chris throws her arms around me and tells them, \u201cMy best friend just got into</p><p>UNC</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>I feel warm inside hearing Chris call me her best friend\u2014to know that we still matter to each other, even though she has her work friends and I have Peter. It makes me feel sure that when she\u2019s in Costa Rica, or Spain, or wherever she ends up, we\u2019ll still be close.</p><p>One of the girls hugs me and says, \u201cCongratulations! You\u2019re going to love it here.\u201d Her hair is in milkmaid braids, and she\u2019s wearing a T-shirt that says</p><p>HILLARY IS MY PRESIDENT.</p><p>Adjusting the lollipop enamel pin in her hair, her friend says, \u201cPut down Ehaus or Craige for your dorm. They\u2019re the most fun.\u201d</p><p>I feel sheepish as I say, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not coming here; we just came to visit. For fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, where are you going?\u201d she asks me, a slight frown on her freckled face.</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Mary,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not definite though,\u201d Chris butts in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty definite,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI came here over Princeton,\u201d the braided girl tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s how much I loved it when I visited. You\u2019ll see. I\u2019m Hollis, by the way.\u201d</p><p>We all introduce ourselves and the girls tell me about the English department, and going to basketball games at the Dean Dome, and the places on Franklin Street that don\u2019t</p><p>card. Chris, who zoned out during the English department part of the conversation, is suddenly all ears. Before we go inside, Hollis gives me her number. \u201cJust in case you come here,\u201d she says.</p><p>When we get inside, the venue is pretty full, lots of people standing near the stage, drinking beers and dancing to the music. The band is actually just two guys with guitars and a laptop, and their sound is sort of electronica pop. It fills the whole room. It\u2019s a mixed crowd in the audience: some older guys in rock band T-shirts and beards, closer to my dad\u2019s age, but also a lot of students. Chris tries to wipe off the stamp on her hand to get us beers, but is unsuccessful. I don\u2019t mind, because I don\u2019t really like beer, and also, she still has to drive us back tonight. I start asking around to see if anyone has a phone charger, which Chris slaps my arm for. \u201cWe\u2019re on an adventure!\u201d she yells. \u201cWe don\u2019t need cell phones for an adventure!\u201d</p><p>Then she grabs my hand and pulls me along with her to the edge of the stage. We dance our way to the middle, and we jump along to the music, even though we don\u2019t know any of the songs. One of the guys went to</p><p>UNC</p><p>, and midway through the show, he leads the crowd in the Tar Heels fight song. \u201cI\u2019m a Tar Heel born, I\u2019m a Tar Heel bred, and when I die I\u2019m a Tar Heel dead!\u201d The crowd goes nuts, the whole room is shaking. Chris and I don\u2019t know the words, but we shout, \u201cGo to hell, Duke!\u201d along with everyone else. Our hair swings wildly in our faces; I\u2019m sweaty, and suddenly I\u2019m having the best time. \u201cThis is so much fun,\u201d I scream in Chris\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSame!\u201d she screams back.</p><p>After the second set Chris declares that she is hungry, so we are off into the night.</p><p>We walk up the street for what feels like ages when we find a place called Cosmic Cantina. It\u2019s a tiny Mexican place with a long line, which Chris says must mean they either have good food or really cheap food. Chris and I inhale our burritos; they are stuffed full with rice and beans and melting cheese and homemade pico de gallo. It tastes pretty plain, except for the hot sauce. So hot my lips burn. If my phone weren\u2019t dead and Chris\u2019s phone weren\u2019t nearly dead, I\u2019d have searched online for the best burrito in Chapel Hill. But then we might not have found this place. For some reason it\u2019s the best burrito of my life.</p><p>After we eat our burritos, I say, \u201cWhat time is it? We should head back soon if we want to get back before one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve barely seen any of campus,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you want to see in particular? Like, I don\u2019t know, a boring library or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody knows me like you do, Chris,\u201d I say, and she bats her eyelashes. \u201cThere is one place I want to see . . . it\u2019s in all the brochures. The Old Well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go,\u201d she says.</p><p>As we walk, I ask her, \u201cDoes Chapel Hill seem like Charlottesville to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it seems better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like Kitty. You think everything new is better,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think everything old is better,\u201d she counters.</p><p>She has a point there. We walk the rest of the way in companionable silence. I\u2019m thinking about the ways</p><p>UNC</p><p>does and doesn\u2019t remind me of</p><p>UVA</p><p>. The campus is quiet, I guess because most kids have gone home for summer break. There are still people walking around, though: girls in sundresses and sandals and boys in khaki shorts and</p><p>UNC</p><p>baseball caps.</p><p>We cross the green lawn, and there it is: the Old Well. It sits between two brick residence halls. It\u2019s a small rotunda, like a mini version of the one at</p><p>UVA</p><p>, and there is a drinking fountain in the center. There\u2019s a big white oak tree right behind it, and there are azalea bushes all around, hot pink like a lipstick color Stormy used to wear. It\u2019s enchanting.</p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to make a wish or something?\u201d Chris asks, stepping up to the fountain.</p><p>\u201cI think I heard that on the first day of classes, students take a sip of water from the fountain for good luck,\u201d I say. \u201cEither good luck or straight As.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need straight As where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019ll take the luck.\u201d</p><p>Chris bends down to take a sip, and a couple of girls walking by caution, \u201cFrat guys pee in that fountain all the time\u2014don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Her head snaps back up and she jumps away from the fountain. \u201cEw!\u201d Hopping down, she says, \u201cLet\u2019s take a selfie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t; our phones are dead, remember? We\u2019ll just have to have the memory in our hearts like the old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Chris says. \u201cShould we hit the road?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m not ready to leave just yet. What if I never get to come back? I spot a bench facing one of the brick buildings and go over and sit down, \u201cLet\u2019s stay a little bit longer.\u201d</p><p>I hug my knees to my chest and Chris sits down next to me. Fiddling with the stack of bracelets on her arm, she says, \u201cI wish I could come here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo college or to</p><p>UNC</p><p>?\u201d I\u2019m so caught off guard by the pensive note in her voice that I don\u2019t stop to correct her, to remind her that I won\u2019t be coming here either.</p><p>\u201cEither. Both. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m psyched about Costa Rica. It\u2019s just . . . I don\u2019t know. Like, what if I\u2019m missing out by not going to college at the same time as everybody else.\u201d She looks at me then, a question in her eyes.</p><p>I say, \u201cCollege will be here waiting for you, Chris. Next year, the year after. Whenever you want it.\u201d</p><p>Chris twists around and looks out at the lawn. \u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll see. I can picture you here, Lara Jean. Can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cI have a plan. William and Mary for a year, then</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you and Peter have a plan. That\u2019s why you\u2019re holding back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Peter and I have a plan. But it\u2019s not the only reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the main one.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t deny it. The thing that\u2019s missing no matter where I go, if it\u2019s William and Mary or if it\u2019s here, is Peter.</p><p>\u201cSo why not go here for a year, then?\u201d Chris asks me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference if you\u2019re here or William and Mary? An hour? Either way, you\u2019re not at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. Why not be here?\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for me to answer her; she hops up and runs out onto the lawn, and she kicks off her shoes and does a series of cartwheels.</p><p>What if I came here and I ended up loving it? What if, after a year, I didn\u2019t want to leave? What then? But wouldn\u2019t it be great if I loved it? Isn\u2019t that the whole point? Why bet on not loving a place? Why not take a chance and bet on happiness?</p><p>I lie down and stretch my legs out on the bench and look up at the sky. There is a canopy of tree branches high above my head\u2014one tree sits by the building; the other is planted in the lawn. Their branches reach across the walkway and meet in the middle. What if Peter and I could be like these two trees, far apart but still touching? Because I think maybe I could be happy here. I think maybe I could picture myself here too.</p><p>What was it Stormy said? The last day I saw her, the day she gave me her ring?</p><p>Never say no when you really want to say yes.</p><p>* *</p><p>When Chris pulls up to my house, it\u2019s just after three a.m. and every single light is on. Gulp. I turn to Chris. \u201cCome in with me?\u201d I plead.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You\u2019re on your own. I\u2019ve gotta go home and deal with my own mom.\u201d</p><p>I hug Chris good-bye, get out of the car, and trudge up to the front steps. The door flies open as soon as I\u2019m fumbling</p><p>around in my bag for my keys. It\u2019s Kitty, in her big sleep T-shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I step inside, and Daddy\u2019s right behind her, still dressed in his work clothes. Trina\u2019s on the couch, giving me a look like,</p><p>You\u2019re in for it, and I feel sympathy for you, but also, you could\u2019ve at least called.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been all night!\u201d he shouts. \u201cAnd why weren\u2019t you answering your phone!\u201d</p><p>I shrink backward. \u201cI ran out of battery. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize it had gotten so late.\u201d I briefly consider making a joke about how this is why millenials should wear watches, to lighten the mood, but I don\u2019t think a joke will do the trick this time.</p><p>Daddy starts pacing around the living room. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you use Chris\u2019s phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris\u2019s phone died too. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been worried half to death! Kitty says you left with Chris without saying where you were going. . . .\u201d At this, Kitty gives me a look. \u201cI was five seconds from calling the police, Lara Jean! If you hadn\u2019t walked in the door when you did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I begin. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just so irresponsible.\u201d Daddy\u2019s muttering to himself, not even listening. \u201cLara Jean, you might be eighteen, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>From the couch, Trina says, \u201cDan, please don\u2019t say, \u2018but you\u2019re still living under my roof.\u2019 It\u2019s such a clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Daddy spins around and says to her, \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 for a reason! It\u2019s a good line! It\u2019s a very good line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, just tell them where you were,\u201d Kitty says, impatient.</p><p>Daddy shoots an accusing look her way. \u201cKitty, did you know where she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made me swear not to tell!\u201d</p><p>Before he can reply, I say, \u201cI was in North Carolina with Chris.\u201d</p><p>He throws his hands up in the air. \u201cIn North Carolina! What in the\u2014what in the world? You crossed state lines without even telling me? With a dead phone battery, to boot!\u201d</p><p>I feel sick to my stomach for worrying him. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t call. I could\u2019ve borrowed somebody\u2019s phone. I guess I just got carried away with the night, with being there. I didn\u2019t want to think about home or real life. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. I should\u2019ve called.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cWhy were you in North Carolina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in North Carolina because . . .\u201d I pause. If I say it now, that\u2019s it. \u201cBecause I got into</p><p>UNC</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>Daddy\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou did? That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s wonderful. But what about William and Mary?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I lift my shoulders into a shrug.</p><p>Trina lets out a scream and jumps up from the couch, dropping the flannel blanket she had wrapped around her and nearly tripping herself in the process. Daddy grabs me into his arms and sweeps me into a hug, and Trina joins in. \u201cOh my God, Lara Jean!\u201d she says, slapping me on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a Tar Heel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy,\u201d Daddy says. He wipes a tear from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m still furious with you for not calling. But I\u2019m also happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re really going, then?\u201d Kitty asks from her perch on the stairs.</p><p>I look over at her. I smile shakily and say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going.\u201d Peter and I will find a way. We\u2019ll make it work.</p><p>I tell them every little detail of the night: going to a show at Cat\u2019s Cradle, eating burritos at Cosmic Cantina, the Old Well. Trina makes popcorn, and it\u2019s nearly dawn before any of us goes to sleep. As Daddy shuffles off to bed, Trina whispers to me, \u201cYour daddy just aged ten years in one night. Look at him walking like he needs a cane. Thanks to you, I\u2019m marrying an old man.\u201d We both start laughing, and neither of us can stop. I think we\u2019re delirious from lack of sleep. Trina rolls onto her back and kicks her legs in the air, she is laughing so hard. Kitty, who has fallen asleep on the couch, wakes up and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d which only makes us laugh harder. On his way up the stairs, Daddy stops and turns around and shakes his head at the two of us.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are already ganging up on me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFace it, Daddy. You\u2019ve always lived in a matriarchy.\u201d I blow him a kiss.</p><p>He frowns. \u201cHey, don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten about you staying out all night without even a phone call home.\u201d</p><p>Whoops. Maybe too soon for such gaiety. As he trudges up the stairs, I call out, \u201cI truly am sorry!\u201d</p><p>Sorry for not calling, but not sorry for going. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WHEN I WAKE UP, I</p><p>loll about in my bed for a while, stretching out my arms and legs like a big X, reaching north, south, east, west. Last night feels like a dream. Is it really true? Am I really going to</p><p>UNC</p><p>?</p> <p>Yes, yes I really am. How crazy, how thrilling that your whole life trajectory can change in just one night. I\u2019ve always been scared of change, but right now I don\u2019t feel that way. I feel excited. I\u2019m seeing now what a privilege it is, to be excited about where I\u2019m going. Peter and Chris and Lucas, they\u2019re going where they want to go, but my future felt like a second choice because it was, no matter how great a school William and Mary is.</p><p>UNC</p><p>is a choice I didn\u2019t even know I had, like a door that magically appeared, a door that could lead anywhere.</p><p>When I\u2019m done with my reverie, I look at my clock and see that I\u2019ve slept the whole day away. I sit up, turn my phone on, and see all the missed calls and voice mails from my dad and Kitty from the night before. I delete those without listening to them, so I don\u2019t have to hear the anger in Daddy\u2019s voice; then I see that Peter left me a voice mail too. When I see his name on my phone, my heart does a little dive into my stomach. There are texts, too, wondering where I am. I call him back, but he doesn\u2019t answer, so I figure he must be training. I leave a message telling him to</p><p>just come over when he gets back home. We\u2019re supposed to go to Steve Bledell\u2019s party tonight. I\u2019m nervous to tell Peter the news. Our plan was set, and now I\u2019m changing things around, but it\u2019s not like I knew this door would open for me. He\u2019ll understand. I know he will.</p><p>I flop back on my bed and FaceTime Margot. She\u2019s outside walking, on her way somewhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cGuess what.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got into</p><p>UNC</p><p>!\u201d</p><p>She promptly screams and drops her phone. Thankfully, it falls in the grass. She scrambles to pick it up. She\u2019s still screaming. \u201cOh my God! This is amazing! This is the best news! When did you find out?\u201d</p> <p>I roll onto my stomach. \u201cYesterday! Chris and I went to visit last night, and Gogo, it was so much fun. We went to see a band play, and we danced and we screamed ourselves silly. My throat is sore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wait\u2014you\u2019re going, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Margot screams again, and I laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s</p><p>UNC</p><p>\u2019s campus like?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a lot like</p><p>UVA</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that. I\u2019ve heard the campuses are very similar. The towns, too. Both liberal, but Chapel Hill maybe even a little more so. Lots of great minds there. I can\u2019t wait to look at the course book with you.\u201d She starts walking again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it there. Maggie Cohen, she was a year above me, she</p><p>loves</p><p>it. You should talk to her.\u201d Beaming, Margot says to me, \u201cThis is when everything begins, Lara Jean. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>After I get off the phone with Margot, I take a bubble bath and do all my rituals: face mask, loofah, brown sugar\u2013lavender scrub. In the bath, I practice what I\u2019m going to say to Peter.</p><p>There are two trees, on opposite sides, and their branches meet in the middle</p><p>. . . . I stay in for so long, Kitty screams at me to hurry up. When I get out of the tub, I dry my hair and then curl it; I redo my nails and I even apply the lemon cuticle cream I bought but never remember to use.</p><p>Daddy, Trina, and Kitty have gone out to see a movie, so I\u2019m all alone in the house when Peter arrives around eight. He\u2019s wearing new</p><p>UVA</p><p>sweats; his hair is freshly washed and still damp. He smells like Dove soap, which I love on him. He pulls me in for a hug, leaning his body weight into me. \u201cI\u2019m so sore,\u201d he says, falling onto the living room couch. \u201cCan we not go to Steve\u2019s tonight? I just want to stay here and hang out with you and not have to talk to people. I\u2019m fucking exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, and take a deep breath to tell him my news, but then he looks up at me with weary eyes.</p><p>\u201cThose guys on the team are in incredible shape. It was hard to keep up.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cHey, you\u2019re in good shape too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as them. I need to get my act together.\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cSo are you finally gonna tell me where you were last night?\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the couch and face him, my legs tucked</p><p>under my butt. I put the backs of my hands to my cheeks, which feel flushed. Then I put them in my lap. \u201cWell, okay.\u201d I pause. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. This is so crazy, but I was in North Carolina with Chris.\u201d</p><p>Peter raises his eyebrows. \u201cWeird. Okay. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there because . . . I got into</p><p>UNC</p><p>!\u201d</p><p>He blinks. \u201cWow. That\u2019s . . . wow. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>I take another deep breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want to go there, but then when Chris and I visited, the town was really charming, and the people were really nice, and there\u2019s this bench, by the Old Well, where if you lie down and look up, two trees on opposite sides, they meet in the middle. Their branches touch, like this.\u201d I start to demonstrate, and then I stop, because I realize Peter isn\u2019t really listening. He\u2019s staring into space. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re going there now and not William and Mary?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nods to himself. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, I am. It just sucks that you\u2019re going to be so far away. Like, if I had to get in my car and drive to Chapel Hill right now, I\u2019d fall asleep at the wheel. How far away is Charlottesville from Chapel Hill? Four hours?\u201d</p><p>I feel a sinking sensation in my stomach. \u201cThree hours and twenty-five minutes. I know it sounds long, but I swear it goes by fast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s double how long it takes to get from</p><p>Charlottesville to William and Mary. And that\u2019s without traffic.\u201d He drops his head back against the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not double,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s an extra hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>He looks over at me, and I see the regret in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just really wiped right now. This is going to be a lot harder than I thought it would be. Not you and me, but college. I\u2019m going to be at practice 24/7, and when I\u2019m not at practice, I\u2019m training or I\u2019m in class or I\u2019m sleeping. It\u2019s gonna be intense. Nothing like high school. It\u2019s a lot of pressure. And . . . I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so far away.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen him like this before. He looks so defeated. When it comes to lacrosse, to school, he\u2019s always so easygoing, so confident. Everything\u2019s always come easily for him. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to be great. You\u2019re just starting out. Once you get the hang of things, it\u2019ll be like always.\u201d Shyly I say, \u201cAnd . . . we\u2019ll get the hang of things too.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden he sits up straight. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s go to that party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You\u2019re all dressed up. Let\u2019s not waste your hair.\u201d He pulls me toward him. \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate your big W.\u201d</p><p>I put my arms around him and hug him to me. His shoulders feel tight; I can feel the tension in his back. Most boys wouldn\u2019t notice a thing like that: that I curled my hair, put on a blouse. I try to concentrate on that and not on how he didn\u2019t really congratulate me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AT STEVE BLEDELL\u2019S HOUSE, A</p><p>bunch of people are in the family room smoking pot and watching soccer on the huge flat-screen</p><p>TV</p><p>mounted on the wall. Lucas is here, and when I tell him my big news, he picks me up and spins me around. \u201cYou\u2019re getting out of here too!\u201d he shouts.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m only going next door to North Carolina,\u201d I say, laughing. What an unexpected thrill to say those words out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s</p><p>away</p> <p>.\u201d Lucas sets me back down on the floor and puts his hands on my cheeks. \u201cThis is going to be very good for you, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the kitchen getting myself a Coke when Genevieve walks in, barefoot, wearing a Virginia Tech hoodie and carrying a beer in a Virginia Tech koozie. She sways on her feet before saying, \u201cI heard you got into Chapel Hill. Congrats.\u201d</p><p>I wait for the whammy, the underhanded little dig, but it doesn\u2019t come. She just stands there, a little drunk but sober enough. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cCongrats on Tech. I know you always wanted to go there. Your mom must be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Did you hear Chrissy\u2019s going to Costa Rica? Lucky bitch.\u201d She takes a sip of her beer. \u201cChapel Hill and here are pretty far away, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that far. Just three hours,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that. I hope he stays as devoted to you as he is today. But knowing him, I seriously doubt it.\u201d Then she lets out a loud belch, and the look of startled surprise on her face is so funny, I almost laugh out loud. For a second it looks like she might too, but she stops herself, glares, and leaves the kitchen.</p><p>I only catch glimpses of Peter throughout the night, talking to other people, swigging on his beer. He seems to be in a better mood. He\u2019s smiling; his face is a little flushed from the beer. He\u2019s drinking a lot more than I\u2019ve seen him drink.</p><p>Close to one, I go looking all around the house for Peter, and when I find him, he\u2019s with a bunch of people playing flip cup on the Ping-Pong table in Steve\u2019s garage. They are all cracking up over something he just said. He sees me standing at the top of the steps and beckons to me. \u201cCome play with us, Covey,\u201d he says, too loudly.</p><p>My feet stay planted on the steps. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to get home.\u201d</p><p>His smile slips. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll get a ride or call an Uber to come get me.\u201d I turn to leave, and Peter follows me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that. I\u2019ll take you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019re drunk.\u201d I try not to make the words sound mean, but it is what it is.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk. I\u2019ve only had three beers over the course of, what, three hours? I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t drink so you don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s nothing. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can smell your breath, and I know you wouldn\u2019t pass a breathalyzer.\u201d</p><p>Peter peers at me. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just don\u2019t want you driving me home. You shouldn\u2019t drive yourself home either. You should just spend the night here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you are mad.\u201d He leans closer to me and looks around before he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for before. I should\u2019ve been more excited for you. I was just tired is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say, thought it isn\u2019t, not completely.</p><p>Stormy used to have a saying. Leave with the one you came with, unless he\u2019s a drunk\u2014then find your own way home. I end up getting a ride home from Lucas, and I make it before my curfew, just. After last night, I can\u2019t be pushing it.</p><p>Peter keeps texting me, and I\u2019m petty enough to be glad he\u2019s not enjoying himself anymore. I make him wait long minutes before I text back a terse reply not to drive home tonight, and he texts back a picture of him lying on Steve\u2019s couch, with somebody\u2019s jacket as a blanket.</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep, so I go downstairs to make myself a grilled cheese sandwich. Kitty\u2019s down there too, watching late-night</p><p>TV</p><p>and playing a game on her phone. \u201cWant a grilled cheese?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says, looking up from her phone.</p><p>I make Kitty\u2019s first. I keep pressing the sandwich into</p><p>the pan, so the bottom gets crispy and the sandwich flattens. I cut off another dab of butter and watch it melt into a puddle, still feeling a bit out of sorts from the night, when out of nowhere it comes to me. Direct contact. The bread needs direct contact with the hot pan to get the right amount of crisp.</p><p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the answer to my chocolate chip cookie problem. All this time, I\u2019ve been using my Silpat baking sheet so the cookies don\u2019t stick to the pan. Parchment paper is the answer. It\u2019s whisper thin, unlike Silpat. With parchment paper, the dough has more direct contact with heat, and therefore the dough spreads more! Voil\u00e0, thinner cookies.</p><p>I\u2019m so determined, I start grabbing ingredients from the pantry. If I make the dough right this minute, it can rest all night, and I\u2019ll be able to test my theory tomorrow.</p><p>* *</p><p>I sleep in again, because there\u2019s no school thanks to teacher meetings and because I was up till three making my dough and watching</p><p>TV</p><p>with Kitty. When I wake up, just like the day before there are texts from Peter.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I\u2019m a dick.</p><p>Don\u2019t be mad.</p><p>I read his texts over and over. They\u2019re spaced minutes apart, so I know he must be fretting over whether I\u2019m still</p><p>mad or not. I don\u2019t want to be mad. I just want things to go back to how they were before.</p><p>I text back:</p><p>Do you want to come over for a surprise?</p><p>He immediately replies:</p><p>ON MY WAY</p><p>\u201cThe perfect chocolate chip cookie,\u201d I intone, \u201cshould have three rings. The center should be soft and a little gooey. The middle ring should be chewy. And the outer ring should be crispy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear her give this speech again,\u201d Kitty says to Peter. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient,\u201d he says, squeezing her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over, and then we get cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe perfect cookie is best eaten while still warm, but still delicious at room temperature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t quit talking, they won\u2019t be warm anymore,\u201d Kitty grumbles. I shoot her a glare, but truthfully, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here to be a buffer between Peter and me. Her presence makes things feel normal.</p><p>\u201cIn the baking world, it is a truth universally acknowledged that Jacques Torres has perfected the chocolate chip cookie. Peter, you and I tasted it for ourselves just a few months ago.\u201d I\u2019m really stretching it now to make them</p><p>suffer. \u201cHow will my cookie measure up? Spoiler alert. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>Kitty slides off her stool. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m out of here. A chocolate chip cookie isn\u2019t worth all this.\u201d</p><p>I pat her on the head. \u201cOh, naive little Kitten. Dear, foolish girl. This cookie is worth all this and more. Sit or you will not partake.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she sits back down.</p><p>\u201cMy friends, I have finally found it. My white whale. My golden ring. The cookie to rule them all.\u201d With a flourish, I whisk off the tea towel and present them with my flat, chewy, non-puffy cookies, artfully arranged on the plate.</p><p>To my dismay, Peter shoves one in his mouth whole. With his mouth full he says, \u201cDelicious!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still worried that I\u2019m upset, so he\u2019ll say anything right now. \u201cEat slower. Savor it, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Kitty is the true critic to please. Eagerly I say, \u201cI used muscovado sugar. Can you taste that hint of molasses?\u201d</p><p>She is munching thoughtfully. \u201cI can\u2019t taste the difference between this one and the one you made two batches ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time I used chocolate f\u00e8ves and not chunks. See the way the chocolate melts in streaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a f\u00e8ve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just say disc. Also didn\u2019t Daddy get mad because you spent thirty dollars on chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he was</p><p>mad</p><p>. Maybe annoyed. But I think</p><p>he\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Kitty gives me a look, like,</p><p>Yeah, right</p><p>, and I mumble, \u201cIt\u2019s Valrhona, okay? It doesn\u2019t come cheap. And also, it was a two-pound bag! Look, that isn\u2019t the point. Can\u2019t you tell how much crispier the edges are, and how much chewier it is in the center? Do I need to explain to you guys again about Silpat versus parchment paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got it,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>Peter hooks his finger into the loop of my jeans and pulls me closer. \u201cBest cookie of my life,\u201d he declares. He\u2019s really laying it on thick, but I\u2019m not quite done being mad.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are so corny,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cI\u2019m taking my share of the cookies and getting out of here.\u201d She starts stacking cookies on a napkin, rapid-fire.</p><p>\u201cOnly take three!\u201d</p><p>She puts two back, then heads upstairs.</p><p>Peter waits until she is gone before he asks, \u201cAre you still pissed at me? I\u2019ll never drink on a night I\u2019m supposed to drive you ever again, I promise.\u201d He gives me his winning smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay with me going to</p><p>UNC</p><p>?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>His smile fades, and there is a slight hesitation before he nods. \u201cIt\u2019s like you said. We\u2019ll get the hang of it, whatever it is.\u201d For the briefest of moments his eyes search mine, and I know he\u2019s looking for reassurance. That\u2019s when I put my arms around him and hug him tight to me, tight enough that he knows I\u2019m here; I won\u2019t let go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>NOW THAT I\u2019VE MADE MY</p><p>decision to go to</p><p>UNC</p><p>, there are suddenly things to do, and right away.

She tells me I\u2019m the only one from our class going there, and she can\u2019t wait to add it to the list of accepted schools. \u201cI knew you\u2019d make me proud,\u201d she says, nodding her head. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>Our caps and gowns have arrived, and Peter and I go to the gym to pick ours up, along with graduation announcements.</p><p>We sit down on the bleachers to try our caps on, and Peter tilts mine to the side and says, \u201cYou look cute.\u201d</p><p>I blow him a kiss. \u201cLet me see your announcements.\u201d I want to see his name all fancy in calligraphy.</p><p>He passes me the box and I open it. I run my fingers along the embossed letters.</p><p>Peter Grant Kavinsky.</p> <p>Then I say, \u201cHave you given any more thought to inviting your dad?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks around to see if anyone\u2019s listening before saying in a low voice, \u201cWhy do you keep bringing that up?\u201d</p><p>I reach out and touch Peter\u2019s cap. \u201cBecause I think that, deep down, you want him to be there. If only so he can see all that you\u2019ve accomplished and all that he\u2019s missed out on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he says, and I leave it at that. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s decision.</p><p>* *</p><p>On the way home from school Peter asks me, \u201cWanna see a movie tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cTrina\u2019s friend Kristen is coming over to go over final details of Trina\u2019s bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a sly look. \u201cAre you guys going to a strip club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Ew. Like I would ever want to see any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee any of what?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cOiled-up muscles.\u201d I shudder. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you don\u2019t have big muscles.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cHey, I\u2019m built.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze his bicep, and he automatically flexes against my fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re nice and lean with little muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to emasculate a guy, Covey,\u201d he says as he turns down my street.</p><p>I feel bad, because now I\u2019m remembering how he said he wasn\u2019t in the same shape the other guys on the lacrosse team were in. \u201cI like you just the way you are,\u201d I quickly say, and he laughs, so he can\u2019t be that hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your dad doing for his bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cHave you met my dad? He\u2019s the last person who would ever have a bachelor party. He doesn\u2019t even have any guy friends to have a party with!\u201d I stop and consider this. \u201cWell, I guess Josh is the closest thing he has. We haven\u2019t seen much of him since he went to school, but he and my dad still e-mail every so often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what your family sees in that guy,\u201d Peter says sourly. \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about him?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a touchy subject. Peter\u2019s paranoid my dad likes Josh better than him, and I try to tell him it\u2019s not a contest\u2014which it definitely isn\u2019t. Daddy\u2019s known Josh since he was a kid. They trade comic books, for Pete\u2019s sake. So, no contest. Obviously my dad likes Josh better. But only because he knows him better. And only because they\u2019re more alike: Neither of them is cool. And Peter\u2019s definitely cool. My dad is bewildered by cool.</p><p>\u201cJosh loves my dad\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have the same taste in movies.\u201d</p><p>Peter throws in, \u201cAnd Josh was never in a hot tub video with one of his daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, let it go already! My dad\u2019s forgotten about that.\u201d \u201cForgotten\u201d might be too strong of a word. Maybe more like he\u2019s never brought it up again and he hopefully never will.</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, believe it. My dad is a very forgiving, very forgetful man.\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re pulling into my driveway, Peter suddenly says, \u201cWhat if I threw your dad a bachelor party? We could do steaks, maybe cigars\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t smoke cigars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just steaks, then. Geez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteaks and no strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, give me a little credit, Covey! Besides, I\u2019m not twenty-one yet. I doubt I could even get in.\u201d</p><p>I give him a dirty look.</p><p>Quickly he says, \u201cNot that I would even want to. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to go to one with my girlfriend\u2019s dad.\u201d He shudders. \u201cThat\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then what\u2019s the plan? Grill some steaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll go to a nice steakhouse. We\u2019ll get dressed up; it\u2019ll be a real guys\u2019 night. Maybe we\u2019ll even wear suits.\u201d</p><p>I suppress a smile. Peter will never admit it, but he loves to get dressed up. So vain. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ask him about it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI think</p><p>you</p><p>should ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he says yes, who should I invite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh?\u201d I suggest it half-heartedly, knowing he won\u2019t agree.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Doesn\u2019t he have any work friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that many close friends at work,\u201d I say. \u201cJust Dr. Kang. . . . You could invite my uncle Victor. And sometimes he goes on bike rides with Mr. Shah from down the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get me their e-mails</p><p>ASAP</p><p>?\u201d Peter asks me. \u201cI want to get the invites out as soon as I get the okay from your dad. When\u2019s the bachelorette? The weekend after next?\u201d</p><p>My heart surges. I\u2019m so touched by how eager Peter is to impress my dad. \u201cIt\u2019s the third Friday of the month. We\u2019re waiting for Margot to come home.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Kitty was suspiciously serene about not being invited to Trina\u2019s bachelorette night, and I thought to myself, Wow, Kitty\u2019s really growing up. She gets that it\u2019s not about her; she understands that the night is about Trina.</p><p>But of course Kitty always has a long game.</p><p>For the first time in a while, she\u2019s riding to school with us. She wanted Peter to take her in his Audi, but I put my foot down and said I needed to get to school too. So we\u2019re all in his mom\u2019s minivan like old times.</p><p>However, Kitty is up front and I am in the backseat.</p><p>From the passenger seat Kitty sighs heavily and rests her head against the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Peter asks.</p><p>\u201cThe bridesmaids won\u2019t let me go on the bachelorette night,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the only one left out.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d Peter looks at me in the rearview mirror. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you guys let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a karaoke bar! We can\u2019t bring Kitty in because she\u2019s too young. Honestly, I think I was barely allowed to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you guys just go to a restaurant like we\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s not a real bachelorette.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you guys are going to a strip club or something\u2014wait, did you change your mind? Are you going to a strip club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the big deal? Just go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s not my decision. You\u2019ll have to take it up with Kristen.\u201d I smack the back of Kitty\u2019s arm. \u201cSame goes for you, you little fiend! Quit trying to weasel your way in by manipulating Peter. He has no power here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, kid,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>Kitty slumps in her seat and then straightens. \u201cWhat if I came to the bachelor night instead?\u201d she suggests. \u201cSince you\u2019re just going to a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>Peter stutters, \u201cUh\u2014uh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have to talk to the guys. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll ask? Because I like steak too. I like it so much. I\u2019ll order steak with a baked potato on the side, and for dessert I\u2019ll have a strawberry sundae with whipped cream.\u201d Kitty beams a smile at Peter, who smiles back weakly.</p><p>When we get to the elementary school and she hops out, perky and puffed up like a chickadee, I lean forward in my seat and say into Peter\u2019s ear, \u201cYou just got played.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WITH ONLY THREE DAYS LEFT</p><p>of school, yearbooks arrive. There are several blank pages in the back for signatures, but everybody knows the place of honor is the back cover. Of course I\u2019ve saved mine for Peter. I never want to forget how special this year was.</p><p>My yearbook quote is \u201cI have spread my dreams under your feet; / Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.\u201d I had a very hard time choosing between that and \u201cWithout you, today\u2019s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday\u2019s.\u201d Peter was like, \u201cI know that\u2019s from</p> <p>Am\u00e9lie</p><p>, but what the hell is a scurf?\u201d and honestly, he had a point. Peter let me write his. \u201cSurprise me,\u201d he said.</p><p>As we walk through the cafeteria doors, someone holds the door for us, and Peter says, \u201cCheers.\u201d Peter\u2019s taken to saying cheers instead of thanks, which I know he learned from Ravi. It makes me smile every time.</p><p>For the past month or so, the cafeteria\u2019s been half-empty at lunch. Most of the seniors have been eating off-campus, but Peter likes the lunches his mom packs and I like our cafeteria\u2019s french fries. But because the student council\u2019s passing out our yearbooks today, it\u2019s a full house. I pick up my copy and run back to the lunch table with it. I flip to his</p><p>page first. There is Peter, smiling in a tuxedo. And there is his quote:</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d \u2014Peter Kavinsky.</p><p>Peter\u2019s brow furrows when he sees it. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means, here I am, so handsome and lovely to look at.\u201d I spread my arms out benevolently, like I am the pope. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Darrell busts out laughing, and so does Gabe, who spreads his arms out too. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d they keep saying to each other.</p><p>Peter shakes his head at all of us. \u201cYou guys are nuts.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I kiss him on the lips. \u201cAnd you love it!\u201d I drop my yearbook in front of him. \u201cWrite something memorable,\u201d I say, leaning over his shoulder. \u201cSomething romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair is tickling my neck,\u201d he complains. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate.\u201d</p><p>I straighten up and rock back on my heels, arms crossed. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to think of something good with you looking over my shoulder?\u201d he says. \u201cLet me do it later.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head firmly. \u201cNo, because then you never will.\u201d</p><p>I keep bugging him about it, until finally he says, \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to write,\u201d which makes me frown.</p><p>\u201cWrite down a memory, or a hope, or\u2014or anything.\u201d I\u2019m disappointed and trying not to show it, but would it be so hard for him to think of something on his own?</p><p>\u201cLet me take it home tonight so I can take my time with it,\u201d he says hastily.</p><p>I spend the rest of the day filling up my yearbook, and people write generic things like</p><p>Good luck at</p><p>UNC</p><p>,</p><p>and</p><p>You made freshman year gym fun</p><p>, and</p><p>Add me on Instagram,</p><p>but also more meaningful things, like</p><p>I wish you had started coming out more sooner, so I\u2019d know you better.</p><p>Ben Simonoff writes,</p><p>It\u2019s always the quiet ones that are the most interesting. Stay interesting.</p><p>I hand the yearbook over to Peter at the end of the day. \u201cKeep it safe,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>* *</p><p>The next morning, he forgets to bring it to school with him, which is annoying, because I want to get the whole senior class\u2019s signatures, and I still have a few more to go. Tomorrow is the last day of school.</p><p>\u201cDid you at least finish it?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I just forgot it,\u201d he says, wincing. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it tomorrow, I swear.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Beach Week is a tradition where we\u2019re from. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. The day after graduation, the senior class packs up and goes to Nags Head for a week. Never in a million years did I think I would be going. For one thing, you have to gather up enough friends to rent a house together\u2014like ten friends! Before Peter I didn\u2019t have ten friends I could rent a beach house with. Somebody\u2019s parent has to rent the house in their name, because no one wants to rent out a house to a bunch of high school kids. Margot didn\u2019t go her year. She and Josh went camping with some friends. She said Beach Week wasn\u2019t really her thing. A year ago, it wouldn\u2019t have been my</p><p>thing either. But now I have Peter, and Pammy, and Chris and Lucas.</p><p>When the topic of Beach Week first came up months ago, Peter asked me if I thought my dad would let me stay at his house. I said no way. Instead I\u2019m staying with a bunch of girls. Pammy\u2019s older sister Julia rented the house, and Pammy assured me it had air-conditioning and everything. She said the boys\u2019 house was on the beach and we were two rows back, but it was better this way because then we could junk up their house with sand and ours would stay pristine.</p><p>My dad said yes at the time, but I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s forgotten about it, because when I bring up Beach Week tonight at dinner, he looks confused. \u201cWait, what\u2019s Beach Week again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when everybody goes to the beach after graduation and parties all week,\u201d Kitty explains, stuffing her slice of pizza in her mouth.</p><p>I shoot her a look.</p><p>\u201cMy Beach Week was</p><p>insane</p><p>,\u201d Trina says, and a fond smile crosses her face.</p><p>I shoot Trina one too.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s forehead creases. \u201cInsane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t</p><p>that</p><p>insane,\u201d Trina amends. \u201cIt was just a fun girls trip. One last fling with all the girls before college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter staying?\u201d Daddy asks me, and now his forehead looks as wrinkled as a walnut.</p><p>\u201cIn a boy house. I told you all about it ages ago and you</p><p>said yes, so you can\u2019t go back on it now. It\u2019s the day after graduation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there won\u2019t be any adult supervision? Just kids?\u201d</p><p>Trina puts her hand on Daddy\u2019s arm. \u201cDan, Lara Jean isn\u2019t a kid anymore. In a few months she\u2019ll be living on her own. This is just practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I know you\u2019re right. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d He sighs heavily and stands up. \u201cKitty, help me clear the table, will you?\u201d</p><p>As soon as they\u2019re gone, Trina turns to me, and in a low voice she says, \u201cLara Jean, I know you\u2019re not a drinker, but here\u2019s a pro tip that you can take with you to Beach Week and college and beyond. Always, always have a buddy system in place. It\u2019ll go like this: One night, you get to drink. The next night, your girlfriend gets to drink. That way one person is always sober enough to hold the other person\u2019s hair back and make sure nothing bad happens.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I say, \u201cPeter will be there. He\u2019ll hold my hair back if need be. Or I can just wear it in a ponytail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I\u2019m just saying, for the future.\u201d For when he isn\u2019t there. My smile dims, and she quickly goes on to say, \u201cAt my Beach Week, we took turns cooking dinner for the house. When it was my turn, I made chicken parmesan and all the smoke detectors went off and we couldn\u2019t figure out how to make the beeping stop all night!\u201d She laughs. Trina has such an easy laugh.</p><p>\u201cI doubt my Beach Week will get that crazy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope it gets a</p><p>little</p><p>crazy,\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THIS IS THE LAST TIME</p><p>we\u2019ll walk up this staircase together, Peter taking the stairs two at a time, me nipping at his heels, huffing and puffing to keep up.

It\u2019s the last day of school. I want to say good-bye to Mr. Lopez.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cGoody-goody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew who I was when you started dating me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he says.</p><p>Before we go our separate ways, I hold out my hands and wait expectantly.

I only got half the signatures I wanted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, rubbing his hand through his hair and making it go all messy. \u201cDo you want me to go back home and get it? I can go right now.\u201d He looks genuinely sorry, but I\u2019m still annoyed.</p><p>When I don\u2019t say anything right away, Peter starts to head back toward the stairs, but I stop him. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just pass it around at graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. We\u2019re not even here the full school day; I don\u2019t want him to have to run back home just for my yearbook.</p><p>Classes are pretty lax; we mostly just walk around saying good-bye to teachers, the office staff, the cafeteria ladies, the school nurse. A lot of them we\u2019ll see at graduation, but not everyone. I pass around cookies that I baked last night. We get our final grades\u2014all good, so no worries there.</p><p>It takes me forever to clean out my locker. I find random notes I saved from Peter, which I promptly put in my bag so I can add them to his scrapbook. An old granola bar. Dusty black hair ties, which is ironic because you can never seem to find a hair tie when you need one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sad to throw any of this stuff away, even this old granola bar,\u201d I say to Lucas, who is sitting on the floor keeping me company. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it there at the bottom of my locker every day. It\u2019s like an old pal. Should we split it, to commemorate this day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably got mold.\u201d Matter-of-factly he says, \u201cAfter graduation I probably won\u2019t see any of these people again.\u201d</p><p>I throw him a hurt look. \u201cHey! What about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you. You\u2019re coming to visit me in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh! Yes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah Lawrence is so close to the city. I\u2019ll be able to go to Broadway shows whenever I want. There\u2019s an app for same-day student tickets.\u201d He gets a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you. We\u2019ll go to a gay bar, too. It\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everybody else I can take or leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have Beach Week,\u201d I remind him, and he nods.</p><p>\u201cFor the rest of our lives, we\u2019ll always have Beach Week,\u201d he says mockingly, and I throw a hair tie at him.</p><p>Lucas can mock me for being nostalgic all he wants. I know these days are special. High school</p><p>will</p><p>be a time we remember the whole rest of our lives.</p><p>* *</p><p>After school, Peter and I go to his house because mine is a disaster zone with wedding stuff, and Peter\u2019s mom has her book club after work, and Owen has soccer, so we have the</p><p>house all to ourselves. It seems the only place we\u2019re ever truly alone is in his car, so moments like these are rare and of note. My last drive home from high school, and Peter K. is the one who\u2019s driving me. It\u2019s fitting, to end high school the way I spent it\u2014riding in the passenger seat of Peter\u2019s car.</p><p>When we go up to his room, I sit down on his bed, which is neatly made, with the comforter pulled in tight; the pillows look fluffed, even. It\u2019s a new comforter, probably for college\u2014a cheery red and cream and navy tartan that I\u2019m sure his mom picked out. \u201cYour mom makes your bed, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d I ask him, leaning back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, without an ounce of shame. He flops onto the bed, and I scoot over to make room for him.</p><p>Late afternoon light filters in through his pale curtains, and it casts the room in a dreamy kind of filter. If I were going to name it, I would call it \u201csummer in the suburbs.\u201d Peter looks beautiful in this light. He looks beautiful in any light, but especially this one. I take a picture of him in my mind, just like this. Any annoyance I felt over him forgetting my yearbook melts away when he snuggles closer to me, rests his head on my chest, and says, \u201cI can feel your heart beating.\u201d</p><p>I start playing with his hair, which I know he likes. It\u2019s so soft for a boy. I love the smell of his detergent, his soap, everything.</p><p>He looks up at me and traces the bow of my lip. \u201cI like this part the best,\u201d he says. Then he moves up and brushes his lips against mine, teasing me. He bites on my bottom lip</p><p>playfully. I like all his different kinds of kisses, but maybe this kind best. Then he\u2019s kissing me with urgency, like he is utterly consumed, his hands in my hair, and I think, no, these are the best.</p><p>Between kisses he asks me, \u201cHow come you only ever want to hook up when we\u2019re at my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I guess I never thought about it before.\u201d It\u2019s true we only ever make out at Peter\u2019s house. It feels weird to be romantic in the same bed I\u2019ve slept in since I was a little girl. But when I\u2019m in Peter\u2019s bed, or in his car, I forget all about that and I\u2019m just lost in the moment.</p><p>We\u2019re at it kissing again\u2014Peter\u2019s shirt is off; mine is still on\u2014when the phone rings downstairs, and Peter says it\u2019s probably the repairman calling about when he\u2019s coming to fix the pipes. He puts on his shirt and runs downstairs to answer it, and that\u2019s when I spot my yearbook on his desk.</p><p>I get out of bed and pick it up and flip to the back. It\u2019s still empty. When Peter comes back upstairs, I\u2019m sitting on his bed again and I don\u2019t mention my yearbook, I don\u2019t ask why he still hasn\u2019t written in it. I\u2019m not sure why. I tell him I\u2019d better get going, because Margot\u2019s coming home from Scotland tonight, and I want to stock the fridge with all her favorite foods.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face falls. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hang out a little longer? I can take you to the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still have to clean up the upstairs, too,\u201d I say, standing up.</p><p>He tugs on my shirt and tries to pull me back onto the bed. \u201cCome on, five more minutes.\u201d</p><p>I lie back down next to him and he cuddles in close, but I\u2019m still thinking about the yearbook. I\u2019ve been working on his scrapbook for months; the least he can do is write me a nice yearbook message.</p><p>\u201cThis is good practice for college,\u201d he murmurs, pulling me toward him, wrapping his arms around me. \u201cThe beds are small at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. How big are the beds at</p><p>UNC</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>My back to him, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t get to see the dorms.\u201d</p><p>He tucks his head in the space between my neck and shoulder. \u201cThat was a trick question,\u201d he says, and I can feel him smile against my neck. \u201cTo check and see if you visited a random</p><p>UNC</p><p>guy\u2019s dorm room with Chris. Congrats, you passed the test.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. Then my smile fades and I give him a test of my own. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget to take my yearbook with me when we leave.\u201d</p><p>He stiffens for a second and then says in an easy tone, \u201cI have to hunt it down. It\u2019s here somewhere. If I can\u2019t find it, I\u2019ll just bring it over later.\u201d</p><p>I pull away from him and sit up. Confused, he looks up at me. \u201cI saw my yearbook on your desk, Peter. I know you haven\u2019t written anything yet!\u201d</p><p>Peter sits up and sighs and scrubs his hand through his hair roughly. His eyes flit over to me and then back down again. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to write. I know you want me to write some great, romantic thing, but I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of times, and I just\u2014I freeze</p><p>up. You know I\u2019m not good at that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Feelingly, I tell him, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say as long as it\u2019s from the heart. Just be sweet. Be you.\u201d I crawl closer to him and put my arms around his neck. \u201cOkay?\u201d Peter nods, and I give him a little kiss, and he surges up and kisses me harder, and then I don\u2019t even care about my dumb yearbook anymore. I am aware of every breath, every movement. I memorize it all, I hold it in my heart.</p><p>When we break away, he looks up at me and says, \u201cI went to my dad\u2019s house yesterday.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He invited me and Owen to come over for dinner, and I wasn\u2019t going to go, but then Owen asked me to come with him and I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>I lie back down, rest my head on his chest. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine, I guess. His house is nice.\u201d I don\u2019t say anything; I just wait for him to go on. It feels like a long time before he says, \u201cYou know that old movie you made me watch, where the poor kid was standing outside with his nose pressed to the glass? That\u2019s how I felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old movie\u201d he\u2019s referring to is</p><p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</p><p>, when Charlie is watching all the kids go hog wild at the candy store but he can\u2019t go inside because he doesn\u2019t have any money. The thought of Peter\u2014handsome, confident, easy Peter\u2014feeling that way makes me want to cry. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have pushed him so hard to reconnect with his dad.</p><p>\u201cHe put up a basketball hoop for those kids. I asked him</p><p>for one so many times, but he never did it. His kids aren\u2019t even athletic. I don\u2019t think Everett\u2019s picked up a basketball once in his whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Owen have a good time?\u201d</p><p>This he grudgingly concedes. \u201cYeah, he and Clayton and Everett played video games. My dad grilled hamburgers and steaks. He even wore a damn chef\u2019s apron. I don\u2019t think he ever helped my mom in the kitchen once the whole time they were married.\u201d Peter pauses. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the dishes, though, so I guess he hasn\u2019t changed that much. Still, I could tell he and Gayle were trying. She baked a cake. Not as good as yours, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cake?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDevil\u2019s food cake. Kind of dry.\u201d Peter hesitates before he says, \u201cI invited him to graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d My heart swells.</p><p>\u201cHe kept asking about school, and . . . I don\u2019t know. I thought about what you said, and I just did it.\u201d He shrugs, like he doesn\u2019t care much either way if his dad\u2019s there or not. It\u2019s an act. Peter cares. Of course he cares. \u201cSo you\u2019ll meet him then.\u201d</p><p>I snuggle closer to him. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>He gives a little laugh. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor giving your dad a chance even though he doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d I look up at him and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a nice boy, Peter K.,\u201d and the smile that breaks across his face makes me love him even more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AFTER PETER DROPS ME OFF</p><p>at home, I end up having just enough time to run to the grocery store and pick up chips and salsa, ice cream, challah bread, Brie, blood-orange soda\u2014you know, all the essentials\u2014and then come home and clean the upstairs bathroom and make up Margot\u2019s bed with fresh sheets.</p><p>Daddy picks Margot up at the airport on the way home from work. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s been home since Trina moved in. When we step inside the house with her suitcases, I see her looking around the living room; I see her eyes flit to the mantel, where there is now framed art that Trina brought over from her house\u2014it\u2019s an abstract painting of the shoreline. Margot\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, but I know she notices. How could she not? I moved Mommy and Daddy\u2019s wedding portrait into my room the day before Trina moved in. Margot\u2019s looking around the whole room now, silently noting everything that is different. The embroidered throw pillows Trina brought with her, a framed picture of her and Daddy on the day he proposed on the side table by the couch, the armchair we switched out for Trina\u2019s. All of Trina\u2019s little knickknacks, of which there are many. Now that I\u2019m looking at it all through Margot\u2019s eyes, it</p> <p>is</p><p>kind of cluttered.</p><p>Margot takes off her shoes and opens the door to the shoe</p><p>closet and sees how stuffed it is\u2014Trina has a lot of shoes, too. \u201cGeez, this closet is packed,\u201d she says, shoving Trina\u2019s cycling shoes to the side to make room for her booties.</p> <p>After we lug her suitcases upstairs and Margot changes into comfy clothes, we come back down for a snack while Daddy fixes dinner. I\u2019m sitting on the couch, chomping on chips, when Margot suddenly stands up and declares that she\u2019s going to go through the shoe closet and get rid of all her old shoes. \u201cRight now?\u201d I say, my mouth full of chips.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. When Margot gets it into her head to do something, she does it right away.</p><p>She dumps everything out of the shoe closet and sits on the floor cross-legged, going through piles, deciding which ones to keep and which to donate to the Salvation Army. She holds up a pair of black boots. \u201cTo keep or to toss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep them or give them to me,\u201d I say, scooping salsa with a tortilla chip. \u201cThey look so cute with tights.\u201d</p><p>She tosses them in the keep pile. \u201cTrina\u2019s dog sheds so much,\u201d Margot grouses, plucking dog fur off of her leggings. \u201cHow do you ever wear black clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lint roller in the shoe case. And I guess I don\u2019t wear that many black clothes?\u201d I really should wear black more often. Every fashion blog emphasizes the importance of a little black dress. I wonder if there will be a lot of occasions for a little black dress at college. \u201cHow often do you get dressed up at Saint Andrews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that often. People mostly wear jeans and boots when they go out. Saint Andrews isn\u2019t that dressy of a place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get dressed up even to go to a wine-and-cheese night at your professor\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get dressed up for high table dinners with professors, but I\u2019ve never been invited to one\u2019s house. Maybe they do that at</p><p>UNC</p><p>, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe!\u201d</p><p>Margot holds up a pair of yellow rain boots. \u201cKeep or toss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no help. You\u2019ve voted to keep everything.\u201d She tosses the rain boots into the cardboard giveaway box.</p><p>It seems both of my sisters are pretty ruthless about throwing away old things. When Margot\u2019s done sorting through everything, I go through the box one more time to see if there isn\u2019t anything I can save. I end up taking her rain boots and a pair of patent-leather Mary Janes.</p><p>* *</p><p>That night I\u2019m heading to the bathroom to brush my teeth when I hear Trina\u2019s hushed voice coming from Margot\u2019s room. I stop in the hallway to listen like a little spy, like Kitty. \u201cThis is a little awkward, but you left this in the bathroom, so I stuck it in a drawer just in case you wanted to keep it private.\u201d</p><p>Margot\u2019s cool voice returns, \u201cKeep it private from whom? Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, from your dad. Or whoever. I just wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s an obstetrician. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s never seen birth-control pills before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. I just . . .\u201d Lamely she says again, \u201cI just</p><p>wasn\u2019t sure. If it was a secret or not, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. I appreciate the thought, but I don\u2019t keep secrets from my dad.\u201d</p><p>I scurry back to my bedroom before I hear Trina\u2019s reply. Eek.</p><p>* *</p><p>The day before graduation, Peter comes over to hang out at the house. I\u2019m sewing little flowers onto my graduation cap, Kitty\u2019s watching</p><p>TV</p><p>on the floor on her beanbag, and Margot\u2019s shelling beans into a mixing bowl. She has a recipe she wants to try out for dinner tonight. A wedding show is on the</p><p>TV</p><p>, one of those who-had-the-best-wedding type programs.</p><p>\u201cHey, for your dad\u2019s wedding, what about one of those sky-lantern ceremonies, where you light up the lantern and make a wish and release it into the sky?\u201d Peter pipes up. \u201cI saw it in a movie.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m impressed. \u201cPeter, that\u2019s a really nice idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that in a movie too,\u201d Kitty says. \u201c</p><p>Hangover Part Two</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d I give them both a look. Peter is quick to ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t that an Asian tradition? Could be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a Korean tradition, it\u2019s Thai,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cRemember, the movie takes place in Thailand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it matters, because it\u2019s not like Trina is even Asian,\u201d says Margot. \u201cWhy would she need to appropriate Asian culture into her wedding just because we\u2019re Asian? It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d I say. \u201cShe wants us to feel</p><p>included. The other day she was saying it might be nice to acknowledge Mommy in some way.\u201d</p><p>Margot rolls her eyes. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she knew her a little. They were all neighbors, after all. I don\u2019t know, I thought during the ceremony, like, maybe the three of us could light a candle. . . .\u201d I trail off because Margot doesn\u2019t look at all convinced. \u201cIt was just an idea,\u201d I say, and Peter makes a</p><p>yikes</p><p>face at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think that sounds kind of awkward? I mean, this wedding is about Trina and Daddy starting a new life together, not the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d Peter agrees.</p><p>Peter works hard to impress Margot. He\u2019s always taking her side. I pretend to be annoyed by it, but really I am touched. Of course he should take her side. It\u2019s his job to take her side. It shows that he gets how important her good opinion is to me, and he gets the place she has in my life. I could never be with someone who didn\u2019t understand how important my family is to me.</p><p>When Margot leaves to take Kitty to piano lessons, Peter says, \u201cYour sister is really not loving Ms. Rothschild, huh.\u201d Peter still hasn\u2019t gotten the hang of calling Ms. Rothschild Trina, and he likely never will. In our neighborhood, none of the kids growing up called the adults by their first names. Everyone was Miss or Mrs. or Mr., except for Daddy, who was Dr.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Gogo</p><p>dislikes</p><p>Trina,\u201d I say. \u201cShe likes her; she just isn\u2019t used to her yet. You know how Trina is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he says. \u201cI also know how your sister is. It took her forever to warm up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t forever. You\u2019re just used to people liking you from the very first minute they meet you.\u201d I give him a sidelong look. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so very charming.\u201d He scowls, because I don\u2019t say it like a compliment. \u201cGogo doesn\u2019t care about charm. She cares about real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now she loves me,\u201d he says, all confidence. When I don\u2019t answer right away, he says, \u201cRight? Doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Later that day, after Peter leaves to help his mom out at her store, Margot and Trina get into a spat over, of all things, hair. I\u2019m in the laundry room, ironing my dress when I hear Trina say, \u201cMargot, when you shower, would you mind picking up your hair out of the drain catch? I was cleaning the tub this morning and I noticed it.\u201d</p><p>Then comes Margot\u2019s quick reply. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I just don\u2019t want the drain to get clogged.\u201d</p><p>A minute later Margot\u2019s in the laundry room with me. \u201cDid you hear that? Can you believe her? How does she even know it was my hair and not yours or Kitty\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair is lighter, and it\u2019s shorter,\u201d I point out. \u201cPlus, Kitty and I pick ours up because we know it grosses Trina out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, dog fur all over my clothes grosses</p><p>me</p><p>out! Every time I take a breath, I feel like I\u2019m inhaling fur. If she\u2019s so concerned about housekeeping, she should vacuum more often.\u201d</p><p>Trina comes up behind Margot, looking stony-faced, and</p><p>says, \u201cI actually vacuum once a week, which is the standard amount.\u201d</p><p>Margot\u2019s gone red. \u201cSorry. But if you have a dog that sheds as much as Simone, I think twice a week is probably more appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell that to your dad, since I haven\u2019t seen him pick up a vacuum once in the whole time I\u2019ve known him.\u201d Trina stalks off, and Margot\u2019s mouth drops open, and I go back to ironing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that was a bit much?\u201d she whispers to me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, though. Daddy never vacuums. He sweeps, and he mops, but he doesn\u2019t vacuum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrina isn\u2019t one to be trifled with,\u201d I tell her. \u201cEspecially not when she\u2019s about to get her period.\u201d Margot stares at me. \u201cWe\u2019re synced up. It\u2019s only a matter of time before you are too.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Margot and I go to the mall, ostensibly so I can get a new strapless bra for my dress, but really because Margot wants to escape Trina. When we get back, the downstairs rugs are freshly vacuumed and neat as a pin, and Kitty is putting the vacuum cleaner away, which I can tell Margot feels bad about.</p><p>At dinner Trina and Margot are cordial to each other, as if nothing happened. Which, in some ways, is worse than a fight. At least when you\u2019re in a fight, you\u2019re in it with someone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE DAY OF MY GRADUATION,</p><p>I wake up early and lie in bed listening to the sounds of the house waking up. Daddy is puttering around downstairs making coffee; Margot has the shower running; Kitty is probably still sound asleep. Trina, too. They\u2019re both late sleepers.</p><p>I will miss these house sounds when I\u2019m gone. A part of me is already homesick for them. Another part of me is so, so excited to take this next step, and I never thought I would be, not after things didn\u2019t turn out the way I\u2019d hoped.</p> <p>* *</p><p>For my graduation present, Margot gives me a college kit. A pink satin eye mask with my name embroidered on it in pale silvery blue. A</p><p>USB</p> <p>drive shaped like a gold tube of lipstick. Earplugs that look like circus peanuts, pink fuzzy slippers, a nylon makeup bag covered in sketches of bows. I love every single thing in the kit equally.</p><p>Kitty makes a beautiful card. It\u2019s a collage of pictures of us, but she\u2019s used some sort of app to turn the pictures into line drawings, like a coloring book. She\u2019s colored them all with coloring pencils. On the inside she\u2019s written,</p><p>Congratulations. Have fun at college. P.S. I\u2019ll miss you an 11.</p><p>Tears spring to my eyes, and I scoop Kitty into my arms and hug her tightly, for so long that she says, \u201cAll right, all right\u2014enough already,\u201d</p><p>but I can tell she is pleased. \u201cI\u2019m going to frame it,\u201d I declare.</p> <p>My gift from Trina is a vintage tea set\u2014cream with pink rosebuds and rimmed in gold. \u201cIt was my mom\u2019s,\u201d she tells me, and I feel like I could cry, I love it so much. When I hug her, I whisper in her ear, \u201cThis is my favorite gift,\u201d and she winks at me. Winking is one of Trina\u2019s talents. She\u2019s great at it, very natural.</p><p>Daddy sips from his coffee and then clears his throat. \u201cLara Jean, your gift from me is one that Margot and Kitty will also partake in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, what is it?\u201d Kitty presses.</p><p>\u201cHush, it\u2019s my gift,\u201d I say, looking at Daddy expectantly.</p> <p>Grinning, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sending you three girls to Korea with Grandma this summer. Happy graduation, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>Kitty screams and Margot is beaming, and I\u2019m in shock. We\u2019ve been talking about going to Korea for years. Mommy always wanted to take us. \u201cWhen, when?\u201d Kitty asks.</p><p>\u201cNext month,\u201d Trina says, smiling at her. \u201cYour dad and I will go on our honeymoon, and you guys will jet off to Korea.\u201d</p><p>Next month?</p><p>\u201cAw, you guys aren\u2019t coming?\u201d Kitty pouts. Margot, on the other hand, is smiling. Ravi\u2019s visiting family in India over the summer, and she doesn\u2019t have any big plans.</p><p>\u201cWe really want to come, but I can\u2019t take that much time away from the hospital,\u201d Daddy says, regretful.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow long will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all of July,\u201d Daddy says, gulping the rest of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cGrandma and I have set the whole thing up. You\u2019re going to stay at your great-aunt\u2019s in Seoul, you\u2019ll take Korean language classes a few times a week, and you\u2019re going on a tour of the whole country, too. Jeju, Busan, the works. And Lara Jean, something special for you\u2014a Korean pastry-making class! Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be in English.\u201d</p><p>Kitty starts doing a little dance in her seat.</p><p>Margot looks at me then, her eyes shining. \u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to bake Korean cream cakes! We\u2019ll go shopping for face masks and stationery and cute things, like, every day. By the time we come back, we\u2019ll be able to watch Korean dramas without subtitles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d I say, and Margot and Kitty and Daddy start discussing all the logistics, but Trina looks over at me closely. I keep the smile on my face.</p><p>A whole month. By the time I get back, it\u2019ll be nearly time to leave for college, and Peter and I will have spent the summer apart.</p><p>* *</p><p>At graduation all the girls wear white dresses. All white everything. I\u2019m wearing Margot\u2019s dress from two years ago\u2014sleeveless with Swiss dots and a crisp knee-length skirt. Trina\u2019s taken up the hemline for me because I\u2019m shorter. Margot wore it with Converse, and I\u2019m wearing white patent-leather sandals with a T-strap and little perforations.</p><p>In the car on the way over, I smooth down my skirt and say to Kitty, \u201cMaybe you could wear this dress for your high</p><p>school graduation too, Kitten. And you\u2019ll pose by the oak tree just like we did. It\u2019ll be a beautiful triptych.\u201d I wonder what shoes Kitty will wear. She\u2019s about as likely to wear white stilettos as she is white Reeboks or white roller skates.</p><p>Kitty makes a sour-lemon face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear the same dress as you and Margot. I want my own dress. Besides, it\u2019ll</p><p>really</p><p>be out of style by then.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s a triptych?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, um, three pieces of art that come together and make one.\u201d Furtively, I google \u201ctriptych\u201d on my phone to make sure I\u2019m telling her the right thing. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, three panels, sort of hinged side by side. They\u2019re meant to be appreciated together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading that off your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just double-checking,\u201d I say. I smooth my dress down again, making sure my cap is in my bag. I\u2019m graduating from high school today. It snuck up on me\u2014growing up, I mean. In the driver\u2019s seat, Trina\u2019s looking for a parking spot, and Margot\u2019s next to her, texting on her phone; Kitty\u2019s next to me, looking out the window. Daddy has driven separately, to pick up Grandma. Nana, Daddy\u2019s mom, is in Florida with her boyfriend and won\u2019t be able to make it. I only wish my own mom were here for this. All these big moments she\u2019s missing, that she\u2019ll keep missing. I have to believe that she knows, that somehow she still sees. But I also just wish I could have a hug from my mom on my graduation day.</p><p>* *</p><p>Throughout the valedictorian speech, I keep looking out in the crowd for Peter\u2019s family. I wonder if his dad is sitting with Peter\u2019s brother and his mom, or separately. I wonder if I\u2019ll get to meet Peter\u2019s two half brothers too. I\u2019ve already spotted my own family\u2014they are hard to miss. Every time I look in their direction, they all wave madly. Plus, Trina\u2019s wearing a wide brimmed Kentucky Derby hat. Whoever is sitting in the row behind her probably can\u2019t see a thing. Margot exercised a lot of self-control by not rolling her eyes when Trina came downstairs wearing it. Even Kitty said it was \u201ca bit much,\u201d but Trina asked me what I thought and I said I loved it, which I kind of do.</p><p>Our principal calls my name, \u201cLara Jean Song Covey,\u201d but he pronounces it Laura, which trips me up for a second.</p><p>When I accept my diploma from him and shake his hand, I whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s</p><p>Lara</p><p>, not</p><p>Laura.\u201d</p><p>My plan was to blow my family a kiss as I walked across the stage, but I get so nervous that I forget. Over the applause I can hear Kitty\u2019s whoop, Daddy\u2019s whistle. When it\u2019s Peter\u2019s turn, I clap and scream like crazy, and of course everyone else does too. Even the teachers clap extra loud for him. It\u2019s so obvious when teachers have favorites. Not that I could blame them for loving Peter. We all do.</p><p>After we are declared graduates, after we throw our caps in the air, Peter makes his way past the throngs of people to find me. As he moves through the crowd, he\u2019s smiling, making jokes, saying hi to people, but there\u2019s something wrong. There\u2019s a blankness in his eyes, even as he grabs me for a</p><p>hug. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, kissing me swiftly on the lips. \u201cSo we\u2019re officially college kids now.\u201d</p><p>Looking around, I straighten my robe and say, \u201cI didn\u2019t see your mom and Owen in the stands. Did your dad sit with them? Are your brothers here? Should I come over now or after I take pictures with my family?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. He doesn\u2019t quite meet my eyes. \u201cMy dad couldn\u2019t come last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some kind of emergency. Who knows.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. His dad seemed so sincere when I saw him at the lacrosse game. \u201cI hope it was a really big emergency to miss his own son\u2019s high school graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter shrugs like he doesn\u2019t care either way, but I know that can\u2019t be true. His jaw is set so tight, he could break his teeth.</p><p>Over his shoulder I see my family making their way through the crowds to get to me. You can\u2019t miss Trina\u2019s hat, even in this swarm of people. My dad\u2019s carrying a big bouquet of all different-colored roses. Grandma\u2019s wearing a cranberry-colored suit; her hair is freshly permed.</p><p>I feel so rushed and panicky for more time with Peter, to comfort him, to just be at his side. I grab his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, and I want to say more, of course I do, but my family arrives, and everyone\u2019s hugging me. Peter says hi to my grandma and takes some pictures with us before he escapes to find his mom and brother. I call out to him, but he\u2019s too far away, and he doesn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>After we take pictures, Daddy, Trina, Grandma, Kitty, Margot, and I go to a Japanese restaurant for lunch. We order plates and plates of sashimi and sushi, and I wear a napkin bib so soy sauce doesn\u2019t fling onto my white dress. Trina sits next to Grandma and chatters in her ear about all manner of things, and I can just hear Grandma thinking,</p><p>Damn, this girl talks a lot</p><p>\u2014but she\u2019s trying, and that\u2019s what Grandma appreciates. I\u2019m trying to be festive and appreciative and in the moment, since this lunch is in my honor, but all I can think of is Peter and how hurt I am on his behalf.</p><p>Over mochi ice cream, Grandma tells us about all the places she wants to take us in Korea: the Buddhist temples, the outdoor food markets, the skin clinic where she goes to get her moles lasered off. She points at a tiny mole on Kitty\u2019s cheek and says, \u201cWe\u2019ll get that taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks alarmed, and Trina\u2019s quick to ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t she too young?\u201d</p><p>Grandma waves her hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Then Kitty asks, \u201cHow old do you have to be to get a nose job in Korea?\u201d and Daddy nearly chokes on his beer.</p><p>Grandma gives her a threatening look. \u201cYou can never, ever change your nose. You have a lucky nose.\u201d</p><p>Kitty touches it gingerly. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery lucky,\u201d Grandma says. \u201cIf you change your nose, you\u2019ll change your luck. So never do it.\u201d</p><p>I touch my own nose. Grandma\u2019s never said anything about my nose being lucky.</p><p>\u201cMargot, you can get new eyeglasses in Korea,\u201d Grandma</p><p>says. \u201cIt\u2019s very cheap to buy eyeglasses in Korea. All the newest fashions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d Margot says, dunking a piece of tuna in her soy sauce. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted red frames.\u201d</p><p>Grandma turns to me and asks, \u201cWhat about you, Lara Jean? Are you excited about the cooking class?\u201d</p><p>\u201c</p><p>So</p><p>excited,\u201d I say brightly. Underneath the table I text Peter.</p><p>Are you okay?</p><p>We\u2019re almost done at lunch.</p><p>Come over anytime.</p><p>The ride home from the restaurant is just Daddy and me, because Trina, Margot, and Kitty are driving Grandma back home. When Margot said she\u2019d ride with us, Grandma insisted that Margot come along with them. She knows Margot isn\u2019t crazy about Trina; I know she\u2019s just trying to matchmake them a bit. Grandma doesn\u2019t miss a beat.</p><p>On the drive home, Daddy looks over at me from the driver\u2019s seat with misty eyes and says, \u201cYour mom would\u2019ve been so proud of you today, Lara Jean. You know how much she cared about your education. She wanted you to have every opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Fingering the tassel on my graduation cap in my lap, I ask him, \u201cDo you think Mommy was sad she never got to get her master\u2019s? I mean, not that she ever regretted having Kitty or anything. Just, do you think she wished things happened differently?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s taken aback. Glancing at me, he says, \u201cWell, no. Kitty really was a happy surprise. I\u2019m not just saying that. We always wanted a big family. And she planned on going back after Kitty was in preschool full-time. She never gave up that plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. She was going to get her master\u2019s. In fact she was going to take a class that fall. She just . . . ran out of time.\u201d Daddy\u2019s voice chokes a little. \u201cWe only had eighteen years together. We had as many years as you\u2019ve been alive, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>A lump gathers in my throat. When you think about it, eighteen years with the person you love isn\u2019t much time at all. \u201cDaddy, can we stop by the drugstore? I want to get some photo paper.\u201d Peter and I took a picture together in our caps and gowns this morning, before the ceremony. It\u2019ll be the last page of his scrapbook, our last high school chapter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PETER COMES OVER AFTER HAVING</p><p>dinner with his mom and Owen. When he rings the bell, I run to the front door and the first thing I do is ask if he\u2019s spoken to his dad, but he brushes me off, the very picture of nonchalance. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, taking off his shoes. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want him to come in the first place.\u201d</p><p>This stings, because it feels like maybe he\u2019s blaming me, and maybe he should\u2014after all, I was the one who kept pushing him to invite his dad. I should\u2019ve listened to him when he said no.</p> <p>Peter and I go upstairs to my room, and I hear my dad jokingly call out, \u201cKeep the door open!\u201d the way he always does, which makes Peter wince.</p><p>I sit down on the bed, and he sits far away from me at my desk. I go over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is my fault. I never should have pushed you to invite him. If you\u2019re mad at me, I don\u2019t blame you one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be mad at you? It\u2019s not your fault he sucks.\u201d When I don\u2019t say anything, he softens. \u201cLook, I\u2019m really not sad. I\u2019m not anything. You\u2019ll meet him another time, okay?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve actually already met him before.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>I swallow. \u201cI accidentally met him at one of your lacrosse games. He asked me not to mention it\u2014he didn\u2019t want you to know he was there. He just wanted to watch you play. He said he missed it.\u201d The muscle in Peter\u2019s jaw jumps. \u201cI should have told you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s like I said, I don\u2019t give a shit what he does.\u201d I start to say something in return, but he interrupts before I can. \u201cCan we just not talk about him anymore? Please?\u201d</p><p>I nod. It\u2019s killing me to see the hurt in his eyes that he\u2019s trying so hard to hide, but I feel like if I keep pressing him, it\u2019ll make things worse. I just want to make him feel better. Which is when I remember his gift. \u201cI have something for you!\u201d</p><p>Relief washes over his face, the tension in his shoulders loosens. \u201cAw, you got me a graduation gift? I didn\u2019t get you anything, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t expect anything.\u201d I jump up and get his scrapbook out of my hatbox. As I present the scrapbook to him, I find my heart is jumping all over the place. With excitement, and with nervousness. This will cheer him up, I know it will. \u201cHurry up and open it!\u201d</p><p>Slowly he does. The first page is a picture I found in a shoe box when Kitty and I were cleaning out the attic to make room for Trina\u2019s boxes. It\u2019s one of the few from our middle school days in the neighborhood. It\u2019s the first day of school; we\u2019re waiting for the bus. Peter\u2019s arms are slung around John McClaren and Trevor Pike. Genevieve and I have our arms linked; she is whispering a secret to me, probably about Peter.</p><p>I am turned toward her and not looking at the camera. I\u2019m wearing a heather-gray camisole of Margot\u2019s and a jean skirt, and I remember feeling very grown-up in it, like a teenager. My hair is long and straight down my back, and it looks pretty much the same as it does now. Genevieve tried to convince me to cut it short for middle school, but I said no. We all look so young. John with his rosy cheeks, Trevor with his chubby ones, Peter with his skinny legs.</p><p>Underneath the picture I wrote,</p><p>THE BEGINNING.</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d he says tenderly. \u201cBaby Lara Jean and Baby Peter. Where\u2019d you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a shoe box.\u201d</p><p>He flicks John\u2019s smiling face. \u201cPunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d he says.</p><p>There\u2019s our homecoming picture. Last Halloween, when I dressed up as Mulan and Peter wore a dragon costume. There\u2019s a receipt from Tart and Tangy. One of his notes to me, from before.</p><p>If you make Josh\u2019s dumb white-chocolate cranberry cookies and not my fruitcake ones, it\u2019s over.</p><p>Pictures of us from Senior Week. Prom. Dried rose petals from my corsage. The</p><p>Sixteen Candles</p><p>picture.</p><p>There are some things I didn\u2019t include, like the ticket stub from our first real date, the note he wrote me that said,</p><p>I like you in blue.</p><p>Those things are tucked away in my hatbox. I\u2019ll never let those go.</p><p>But the really special thing I\u2019ve included is my letter, the one I wrote to him so long ago, the one that brought us</p><p>together. I wanted to keep it, but something felt right about Peter having it. One day all of this will be proof, proof that we were here, proof that we loved each other. It\u2019s the guarantee that no matter what happens to us in the future, this time was ours.</p><p>When he gets to that page, Peter stops. \u201cI thought you wanted to keep this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to, but then I felt like you should have it. Just promise you\u2019ll keep it forever.\u201d</p><p>He turns the page. It\u2019s a picture from when we took my grandma to karaoke. I sang \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d and dedicated it to Peter. Peter got up and sang \u201cStyle\u201d by Taylor Swift. Then he dueted \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d with my grandma, and after, she made us both promise to take a Korean language class at</p><p>UVA</p><p>. She and Peter took a ton of selfies together that night. She made one her home screen on her phone. Her friends at her apartment complex said he looked like a movie star. I made the mistake of telling Peter, and he crowed about it for days after.</p><p>He stays on that page for a while. When he doesn\u2019t say anything, I say, helpfully, \u201cIt\u2019s something to remember us by.\u201d</p><p>He snaps the book shut. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says, flashing me a quick smile. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to look at the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, later.\u201d</p><p>Peter says he should get back home so he can pack for Beach Week, and before we go back downstairs, I ask him again if he\u2019s okay, and he assures me that he is.</p><p>* *</p><p>After Peter leaves, Margot comes up to my room and helps me pack. I\u2019m sitting cross-legged on the floor, arranging my suitcase, and she\u2019s passing me piles. I\u2019m still feeling worried about Peter, so I\u2019m glad to have her company to take my mind off things.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re already graduated,\u201d Margot says, folding a stack of T-shirts for me. \u201cIn my head you\u2019re still the same age you were when I left.\u201d Teasingly she says, \u201cForever sweet sixteen, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as grown-up as you now, Gogo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll always be shorter than me, at least,\u201d she says, and I throw a bikini top at her head. \u201cPretty soon we\u2019ll be packing you up for college.\u201d</p><p>I stuff a curling iron into the pocket of my suitcase. \u201cMargot, when you first went to college, what did you miss most about home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you guys, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what else? Like, what were the unexpected things you missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed giving Kitty a kiss good night after she\u2019d had a bath and her hair was clean.\u201d</p><p>I make a snorty sound. \u201cA rare occasion!\u201d</p><p>Margot takes her time, thinking about what else. \u201cI missed a good hamburger. Hamburgers taste different in Scotland. More like . . . meat loaf. Meat loaf on a bun. Hmm, what else? I missed driving you guys around. I felt like the captain of a ship. I missed your baked goods!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ones?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ones did you miss the most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lemon cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me, I would\u2019ve sent you one.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure sending a cake overseas is exorbitantly expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make one now,\u201d I say, and Margot kicks her legs up happily.</p><p>* *</p><p>So we go downstairs and that\u2019s what we do. Kitty is asleep; Daddy and Trina are in their bedroom with the door closed. As much as I love Trina, that\u2019s a strange thing to get used to as well. Daddy\u2019s door was never closed. But I suppose he needs his time too, time where he\u2019s not a dad. Not even for sex, but just to talk, to take a breath. But also for sex, I guess.</p><p>Margot\u2019s measuring flour when I ask, \u201cDid you have on music when you and Josh first did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me lose count!\u201d Margot dumps all the flour back in the canister and starts over again.</p><p>\u201cWell, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nosy! I swear, you\u2019re worse than Kitty.\u201d</p><p>I roll a lemon around on the counter to warm it up before I start squeezing. \u201cSo it was just . . . silent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t</p><p>silent</p><p>. There was the sound of someone mowing their lawn. And his mom had the dryer going. Their dryer is really loud. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his mom wasn\u2019t home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do that. My roommate brought someone home once and I pretended to be asleep, but honestly, I was trying not to laugh. The guy was a heavy breather. He was a moaner, too.\u201d</p><p>We both giggle.</p><p>\u201cI hope my roommate doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust set up ground rules in the beginning. Like who can use the room when, that kind of thing. And just remember that you should try to be understanding, because Peter will be visiting a lot, and you don\u2019t want to use up her goodwill.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t had sex yet, right?\u201d Quickly she adds, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about it?\u201d Margot asks, trying to sound casual. \u201cBecause of Beach Week?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer her right away.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been thinking about it, not Beach Week specifically, anyway. The thought of Peter and me having sex in the future, for it to be as commonplace as us going to the movies or holding hands\u2014it\u2019s a little strange to imagine. I just wouldn\u2019t want it to be less special, after we do it. I want it to always be a sacred thing, not something to take for granted because everybody else does it, or because we\u2019ve done it before. I suppose anything can become ordinary or commonplace if you do it enough times, but my hope is that this never is. Not for us. \u201cI think I definitely want music,\u201d I say, straining lemon juice into a glass measuring cup. \u201cThat way if I\u2019m a heavy breather or he\u2019s a heavy breather, we</p><p>won\u2019t really know. And it\u2019ll be more romantic. Music makes everything more romantic, doesn\u2019t it? One second you\u2019re walking your dog in the suburbs, and then you put on Adele, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re in a movie and you\u2019ve just had your heart brutally broken.\u201d</p><p>Margot says, \u201cIn movies they never put on a condom, so make sure you\u2019re in real life for that part.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s enough to shake me out of my reverie. \u201cDaddy gave me a whole kit. He left it in the upstairs bathroom for me. Condoms, cream, dental dams.\u201d I burst out laughing. \u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018dental dam\u2019 the unsexiest word you ever heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think \u2018gonorrhea\u2019 is!\u201d</p><p>Abruptly I stop laughing. \u201cPeter doesn\u2019t have gonorrhea!\u201d Now Margot\u2019s the one cracking up. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just teasing. But I think you should pack your kit just in case things go in that direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGogo, I\u2019m not planning on having sex at Beach Week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said just in case! You never know.\u201d She pushes her hair out of her face and in a serious tone, she says, \u201cI\u2019m really glad my first time was with Josh, though. It should be with someone who really knows you. Someone who loves you.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Before I go to bed, I open up that kit and take out the condoms and pack them deep in the bottom of my suitcase. Then I pick out my prettiest bra and underwear set, pale pink edged in electric blue lace, never been worn, and I pack that too. Just in case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PETER\u2019S AT MY HOUSE BRIGHT</p><p>and early to pick me up. Everyone else is caravanning down together, but Peter wanted it to be just him and me in his two-seater. He\u2019s in a good mood; he\u2019s brought donuts for us like old times. He says they\u2019re all for me, though. Ever since he came back from that training weekend with his lacrosse team, he\u2019s been in fitness mode.</p><p>We\u2019re moving stuff around in his car to make room for my suitcase when Kitty comes running out to say hi. She spots the bag of donuts resting on top of my bag and she snags one. Her mouth full, she says, \u201cPeter, did Lara Jean tell you the news about Korea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d he says.</p><p>My head snaps up and I throw Kitty a look. \u201cI was just about to. Peter, I didn\u2019t get a chance to tell you yesterday. . . . My dad\u2019s sending us to Korea for my graduation present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s cool,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to see our relatives and do a tour around the country, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>I glance over at him. \u201cNext month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me in dismay. \u201cA</p><p>month</p> <p>? That long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d We\u2019re already in mid-June. Only two months of summer left from here and then he\u2019ll still be here and I\u2019ll be in Chapel Hill.</p><p>\u201cA month,\u201d he repeats. Before Peter, I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about going to Korea for a month. I would have rejoiced. And now . . . I\u2019d never say so to Daddy or Margot or Kitty, but I don\u2019t want to go. I just don\u2019t. I do. But I don\u2019t.</p><p>When we\u2019re in the car, on our way, I say, \u201cWe\u2019ll FaceTime every day. It\u2019s a thirteen-hour time difference, so if I call you at night, it\u2019ll be your morning.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks gloomy. \u201cWe were gonna go to Bledell\u2019s for his Fourth of July weekend, remember? His dad got a new boat. I was going to teach you how to wakeboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do when you\u2019re all the way over there? The summer\u2019s going to suck. I wanted to take you to Pony Pasture.\u201d Pony Pasture is a little park on the James River in Richmond; there are big stones you can lie out on, and you can float down the river on inner tubes. Peter\u2019s gone before, with friends from school, but I never have.</p><p>\u201cWe can go when I come back,\u201d I say, and he nods halfheartedly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bring back lots of presents. Face masks. Korean candy. A present a day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me back some tiger socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they make them big enough,\u201d I say, just to make a joke, just to make him smile. This week will have to be the</p><p>most perfect, the best ever, to make up for the fact that I\u2019ll be gone all summer.</p><p>Peter\u2019s phone buzzes, and he ignores the call without looking to see who it is. A minute later it buzzes again, and Peter\u2019s face goes tight.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cMy dad,\u201d he says shortly.</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s calling to apologize and explain how he could miss his own son\u2019s graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know why. He told my mom Everett had an allergic reaction so they took him to urgent care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a pretty good excuse. Is Everett okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really even that allergic. When I eat strawberries, my tongue itches. Big deal.\u201d With that, Peter turns on the music, and we don\u2019t talk for a while.</p><p>* *</p><p>The girls\u2019 house is second row, with a view of the beach. It\u2019s on stilts, like all the other houses in the second row. There are three levels, with the kitchen and living room on the bottom level, and the bedrooms on the top levels. Chris and I share a room with two beds on the top level. It\u2019s like we are at the top of a lighthouse. The bedspreads are turquoise with seashells on them. Everything smells a little mildewy, but it\u2019s not a bad house.</p><p>All of the girls in the house have taken up different roles, except for Chris, whose main role has been to sleep on the beach all day with a water bottle of beer. The first day she</p><p>came back with her chest and face lobster red; the only unburned part of her was where her sunglasses were. She was embarrassed but she played it off, saying it\u2019s her base tan for Costa Rica. Pammy is the den mom. She promised her parents she wouldn\u2019t drink, so she\u2019s taken it upon herself to check on the other girls and bring water and Advil to their beds in the morning. Kaila\u2019s really good with a flatiron. She can even curl with it, something I\u2019ve never managed to quite get the hang of. Harley\u2019s good at coordinating and making plans with the other houses.</p><p>I\u2019m the cook. When we first got to the house, we went out and did a big shopping trip and bought cold cuts, granola, dried pasta and jars of sauce, salsa, cereal. The one thing we didn\u2019t buy was toilet paper, which we ran out of on the second day. Every time we leave the house to eat lunch or dinner out, one of us steals a wad of toilet paper from the restaurant bathroom. Why we don\u2019t just go buy more, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s turned into kind of a game. Chris is the clear winner, because she managed to get an economy-size roll out of the dispenser, and she smuggled it out under her shirt.</p><p>The boys come over every day to freeload and also because their house is already filled with sand. We\u2019ve nicknamed it the Sandcastle. Just sitting on their couch, it\u2019s like getting a body scrub, and you stand up feeling exfoliated and not in a good way.</p><p>I wonder if this is what it would feel like to live in a sorority house. At first it\u2019s kind of charming, like those boarding</p><p>houses in the 1940s, borrowing nail polish and playing music while we get ready, eating ice cream in bed. But then on Wednesday, Kaila and Harley get into a screaming fight at one in the morning over who left the flatiron on and our neighbors call the police. That same night Pammy gets drunk, and I sit next to her on the beach for hours while she cries, because she feels guilty about breaking her word to her parents. The next night, some of the girls go out to a club and bring back three guys from Montana. One has shifty eyes and I make sure to lock my bedroom door that night. In my and Chris\u2019s room, I text Peter, who\u2019s already gone back to his house. He comes right back and camps out downstairs \u201cto keep my eye on them.\u201d</p><p>Peter and I spend our days at the beach, where I sit and read and he goes for long runs. Since we\u2019ve been here, he goes running all the time, because he can\u2019t work out like he does at home, in the gym. He goes for a long run in the morning before it gets hot, a short one midday, and another long one at dusk. Except for the day I make him go with me to the Wright Brothers museum in Kill Devil Hills. I went there as a kid with my family, before Kitty was born, but I was too little to climb up to the monument. We go all the way to the top and take in the view.</p><p>All week, Peter has been as winsome and winning as ever, especially in front of other people\u2014always with an easygoing smile on his face, always the first to suggest an activity, a game. But with me he\u2019s been distant. Like even though he\u2019s right here next to me, he feels far away.</p><p>Unreachable. I\u2019ve tried to broach the topic of his dad again, but he just laughs it off. He hasn\u2019t brought up my trip to Korea again either.</p><p>Every night there\u2019s a party at one of the houses\u2014except ours. We never host, because Pammy is worried about losing our security deposit. The nice thing about it is, all the different groups are hanging out in a way that people didn\u2019t in high school. There is something freeing about knowing it\u2019s all over. We won\u2019t all be together like this again, so why not? In that spirit, Chris hooks up with Patrick Shaw, a guy from Josh\u2019s anime club.</p><p>Tonight the party is at Peter\u2019s house. I have no idea how they\u2019re getting their security deposit back, because the place is in sandy shambles: One of the wicker chairs on the deck is broken, there are beer cans everywhere, and someone sat down on the beige living room couch in a wet orange towel and now there\u2019s a big orange spot in the middle. I\u2019m making my way through the kitchen when I see John Ambrose McClaren, going through the refrigerator.</p><p>I freeze. Peter\u2019s been in such an unpredictable mood; I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do when he sees John at his house.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to decide if I should go find Peter and tell him John\u2019s here, when John\u2019s head pops up behind the refrigerator door. He\u2019s holding a carrot and munching on it. \u201cHey! I thought I might see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, cheerfully, as if I weren\u2019t just contemplating backing away before he saw me. I come over and he gives</p><p>me a one-armed hug, because he\u2019s still holding the carrot. \u201cHave you seen Peter?\u201d I ask him. \u201cThis is the house he\u2019s staying in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, we just got here.\u201d John looks tan, his hair is bleached from the sun, and he\u2019s wearing a worn blue-and-white-checked shirt and khaki shorts. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally close to here. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got a house in Duck.\u201d He smiles and then offers me his carrot. \u201cWant a bite?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo thanks. So where did you decide on for school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Mary.\u201d John holds his hand up for a high five. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually . . . I\u2019m going to Chapel Hill. I got in off the wait list.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cAre you serious? That\u2019s awesome!\u201d He pulls me in for a hug. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s actually the perfect place for you. You\u2019re going to love it there.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking toward the kitchen door, thinking of how I can gracefully exit this conversation, when Peter strolls into the kitchen with a beer in his hand. He stops short when he sees us. I\u2019m cringing inside, but he just grins and shouts, \u201cMcClaren! What up!\u201d They do a guy hug, where they pull each other in and then just kind of bump into each other. When they back away, Peter\u2019s eyes linger on the carrot in John\u2019s hand. Every day, Peter\u2019s made himself a carrot-and-berry protein shake, and I just know he\u2019s</p><p>smarting over John taking one. He\u2019s counted out exactly how many carrots he needs for the rest of the week.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean was just telling me she got into Carolina,\u201d John says, resting his back against the countertop. \u201cI\u2019m so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you always wanted to go there, right?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes are still on the carrot.</p><p>\u201cEver since I was a kid. It was my top choice.\u201d John gives me a playful nudge. \u201cThis girl snuck in there like a thief in the night. Took my spot right out from under me.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I say, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m just kidding with you.\u201d John takes a bite of his carrot. \u201cI really might transfer, though. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Peter puts his arm around my waist and takes a swig of beer. \u201cYou should. We could all go to a Tar Heels game together.\u201d He says it genially enough, but I can hear the tension underneath.</p><p>John doesn\u2019t miss it either. \u201cFor sure,\u201d he says. Then he polishes off the rest of his carrot and tosses the stem into the sink. \u201cI want you guys to meet my girlfriend, Dipti. She\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d He pulls his phone out of his pocket and sends her a text.</p><p>We\u2019re still standing around when she finds us. She is taller than me, sporty-looking, shoulder-length black hair, dark skin, maybe Indian. She has a nice white smile and one dimple. She\u2019s wearing a silky white romper and sandals. I\u2019m regretting my decision to wear a</p><p>UVA</p><p>T-shirt of Peter\u2019s and cutoffs. We introduce ourselves, and then she</p><p>hops up on the countertop and asks, \u201cSo how do you guys know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcClaren was my</p><p>BFF</p><p>back in middle school,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThey used to call us Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Who do you think was Butch and who do you think was the Sundance Kid, Dipti?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I never saw that movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButch was the main guy.\u201d Peter points to himself. \u201cAnd the Sundance Kid over there\u201d\u2014he points to John\u2014\u201che was the sidekick.\u201d Peter cracks up, and I\u2019m cringing inside, but John just shakes his head in his good-natured way. Peter grabs John\u2019s bicep. \u201cYo, have you been working out?\u201d To Dipti he says, \u201cThis kid used to have spaghetti arms and read all day, but now look at him. He\u2019s a stud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I still read,\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cWhen Peter and I first got together, I thought maybe he didn\u2019t know how to read,\u201d I say, and John doubles over laughing.</p><p>Peter laughs too, but not as heartily as he was a second ago.</p><p>* *</p><p>When it gets late, Peter says I should just stay over instead of going back to my house. I say no, because I don\u2019t have my toothbrush or any of my things, but really, I\u2019m just annoyed with him for the way he acted in front of John.</p><p>On the walk back to my house, Peter says, \u201cDipti seems cool. Good for McClaren. Doubt they\u2019ll stay together, though. They\u2019ll probably visit each other once and be broken up by Christmas, if that.\u201d</p><p>I stop walking. \u201cThat\u2019s a lousy thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just being honest.\u201d</p><p>I face him, and salty beach wind whips my hair around my face. \u201cOkay, if you\u2019re \u2018just being honest,\u2019 then maybe I will be too.\u201d Peter raises an eyebrow and waits for me to continue. \u201cYou acted like a jerk tonight. Insecurity is not a good look on you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Peter makes a derisive sound. \u201cInsecure? About what? McClaren? Please. Did you see how he just went into my fridge and ate my carrots?\u201d</p><p>I start walking again, faster. \u201cWho cares about your carrots!\u201d</p><p>He jogs to catch up with me. \u201cYou know I\u2019m trying to get in shape for lacrosse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, do you know that?\u201d We are now standing in front of my house. Angry walking sure gets you places in a hurry. \u201cGood night, Peter.\u201d I turn on my heel and start walking up the steps, and Peter doesn\u2019t try to stop me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE NEXT MORNING, I WAKE</p><p>up unsure if Peter and I are in a fight. Last night felt like a fight, only I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s mad at me or if I\u2019m supposed to be mad at him. It\u2019s an unsettling feeling.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be mad at him. I leave for Korea on July 1. We don\u2019t have time to get into dumb fights over carrots and John Ambrose McClaren. Every second we have left together is precious.</p> <p>I decide to make him French toast as a peace offering. His favorite breakfast food, besides donuts, is French toast. In the kitchen I find a box of sugar in the cabinet, milk, half a loaf of bread, a couple of eggs, but no cinnamon. The cinnamon is essential.</p><p>I take Pammy\u2019s car keys and drive to the little market near our house, where I buy a shaker of cinnamon, butter, a dozen eggs, and a new loaf of white bread, because I figure I might as well make toast for Peter\u2019s whole house while I\u2019m at it. At the last second, I throw in a bag of carrots.</p><p>Everyone at his house is still asleep, and the place looks even worse than it did the night before. Beer bottles all over the place, empty bags of chips strewn about, bathing suit trunks drying on furniture. Dirty dishes are piled high in the</p><p>sink, and I have to wash a bowl and a spatula caked in old egg in order to start cooking.</p><p>Because the bread is fresh, my first few pieces end up disintegrating in the egg mix, but I get the hang of it on the third try, dipping the bread for only a few seconds before I drop it in the frying pan.</p><p>The boys drift downstairs, and I keep frying more French toast. Every time the stack dwindles, I add more. Peter\u2019s the last one down, and when I offer him a piece, one of the good crispy ones, he shakes his head and says he\u2019d better not, because of his diet. He doesn\u2019t meet my eyes as he says it. He just doesn\u2019t want to eat something I made.</p> <p>After breakfast I don\u2019t stick around, and again Peter doesn\u2019t try to stop me. I drive back home and wake up Chris, who is still in last night\u2019s clothes. \u201cI have a piece of French toast for you downstairs,\u201d I say. I brought her the piece I saved for Peter.</p><p>* *</p><p>There\u2019s a cookout that night, at a house a few streets down from ours. Our house brings tubs of neon-yellow potato salad and all the wine coolers we have left. Since it\u2019s the last night, we are emptying out the fridge.</p><p>Out on the deck, I end up in a conversation with Kaila and Emily Nussbaum, one of Genevieve\u2019s friends. I\u2019ve barely seen Genevieve at all this week, because she\u2019s here with her church friends, and her house is a mix of people from other schools.</p> <p>Emily asks me, \u201cSo are you and Kavinsky really going to stay together?\u201d</p><p>Right this second?</p><p>I have no idea, seeing as how we\u2019ve barely said two words to each other all night. Of course I don\u2019t say that. Whatever I say to Emily will get right back to Genevieve. Gen might have moved on, but she would surely still take pleasure in Peter and me being in a fight. I say, \u201cYes, we\u2019re staying together.</p><p>UNC</p><p>and</p><p>UVA</p><p>aren\u2019t that far.\u201d</p><p>Kaila sucks up rum and Diet Coke out of her straw, giving me a sidelong look. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re an interesting girl, Lara Jean. You seem shy and kind of babyish at first, but you\u2019re actually very confident. That was a compliment, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. If someone is giving you a compliment, I don\u2019t think they should have to tell you they\u2019re giving you one; it should probably be obvious to the person receiving it. I take a sip of the drink Chris made me, and I nearly spit it out because she made it so strong. She called it a grown-up Shirley Temple, whatever that means.</p><p>\u201cI can see why Kavinsky likes you,\u201d Kaila says. \u201cI hope it works out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Emily puts her feet up on my chair and says, \u201cIf Blake broke up with me, I would freak out. I would be absolutely devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you guys are super intense. You\u2019ll probably get married right after college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Emily says, but she\u2019s obviously pleased.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all are going to the same school. It\u2019s different.\u201d Kaila regards me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever do long distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing my man every day. I don\u2019t want to wonder what he\u2019s up to. Like, am I a possessive person? Yes. But also, I don\u2019t want to have to play catch-up at the end of the day. I need to be a part of his daily life and he needs to be a part of mine.\u201d She crunches ice with her teeth.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened with Margot and me when she went to college. The distance came slowly, like seawater filling up a boat, without us even realizing it. Before you know it you\u2019re underwater. We made it through, but we\u2019re sisters. Sisters always find their way back to each other. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same for boyfriends. The thought of it happening to Peter and me fills me with such sadness. How will we ward it off? By talking every day? Visiting at least once a month? He said it himself\u2014his life is going to be so busy and so full because of lacrosse. He\u2019s already changing, with his healthy diet and his workouts. And we\u2019re fighting, and we never fight, not really. Not the kind of fights you can\u2019t take back. So what now? How do we negotiate this next step?</p><p>I stay a few more minutes, and when Emily and Kaila start talking about whether or not to rush a sorority, I make my escape to find Peter. Between this conversation and last night\u2019s fight, I just want him close, while we\u2019re still in the same vicinity. I find him standing around with a bunch of guys who are building a bonfire. He already seems so far away, and I want so badly for things to feel normal between us again. I take big sip of my grown-up Shirley Temple, for</p><p>courage. Our eyes meet, and I mouth,</p><p>Do you want to go?</p><p>He nods. I start to head back inside, and he follows me.</p><p>As I take another sip of my grown-up Shirley Temple, he asks, \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething Chris made me.\u201d</p><p>He takes the red Solo cup from me and tosses it in the trash on our way out.</p><p>Our walk back to my house is pretty quiet, except for the sound of the ocean waves. I don\u2019t think either of us knows what to say, because whatever is wrong between us, we both know it wasn\u2019t John Ambrose McClaren, or the carrots.</p><p>As we make our way down the street, I hear Peter\u2019s subdued voice. \u201cAre you still mad about last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw the carrots you bought in the fridge. Sorry I didn\u2019t eat your French toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you? I know it wasn\u2019t because of your diet.\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what my problem was. I\u2019ve just been in a weird mood.\u201d</p><p>I look over at him; his face is obscured by the dark. \u201cWe only have a little bit of time before I leave for Korea. Let\u2019s not waste it.\u201d Then I slide my hand in his, and he squeezes it.</p><p>The house is completely empty, for the first time all week. All the other girls are still at the party, except for Chris, who ran into somebody she knows through Applebee\u2019s. We go up to my room, and Peter takes off his shoes and gets in my bed. \u201cWant to watch a movie?\u201d he asks, stretching his arms behind his head.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t want to watch a movie. Suddenly my heart is racing, because I know what I want to do. I\u2019m ready.</p><p>I sit down on the bed next to him as he says, \u201cOr we could start a new show\u2014\u201d</p><p>I press my lips to his neck, and I can feel his pulse jump. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t watch a movie or a show? What if we . . . do something else instead.\u201d I give him a meaningful look.</p><p>His body jerks in surprise. \u201cWhat, you mean like now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Now. Now feels right. I start planting little kisses down his throat. \u201cDo you like that?\u201d</p><p>I can feel him swallow. \u201cYes.\u201d He pushes me away from him so he can look at my face. \u201cLet\u2019s stop for a second. I can\u2019t think. Are you drunk? What did Chris put in that drink she gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not drunk!\u201d I had a little bit of a warm feeling in my body, but the walk home woke me right up. Peter\u2019s still staring at me. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Peter swallows hard, his eyes searching mine. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, because I really, truly am. \u201cBut first can you put on Frank Ocean?\u201d</p><p>He grabs his phone, and a second later the beat kicks in and Frank\u2019s melodious voice fills the room. Peter starts fumbling with his shirt buttons and then gives up and starts to pull my shirt up, and I yelp, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s so startled, he jumps away from me. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I leap off the bed and start rummaging through my suitcase.</p><p>I\u2019m not wearing my special bra and underwear set; I\u2019m wearing my normal every day cappuccino-colored bra with the frayed edges. I can\u2019t lose my virginity in my ugliest bra.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cJust wait one second.\u201d</p><p>I run to the bathroom and change out of my old bra and underwear and put on the lacy ones. Then I brush my teeth, look at my face in the mirror. This is it. I, Lara Jean Song Covey, am about to lose my virginity to Peter K.</p><p>Peter calls out, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sec!\u201d Should I put my clothes back on or just come out in my bra and underwear? He\u2019s never seen me in just my underwear before. Well, I guess he\u2019s about to see me without any clothes at all, so I might as well.</p><p>I step out of the bathroom, carrying my clothes in front of me like a shield, and Peter does a double take when he sees me and quickly takes his shirt off. I can feel myself blush. I stuff my bra and underwear in my suitcase, and then dig around inside until I find the packet of condoms. I take one out and then climb back into bed and get under the sheets. \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your bra,\u201d Peter says, peeling the sheet away from me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He moves closer to me and kisses my eyelid. First the left, then the right. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything tonight, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to.\u201d I hold up the condom, and Peter\u2019s</p><p>eyebrows shoot up. \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s kit. Remember, I told you he made me a contraception kit?\u201d</p><p>Taking the condom from me, he kisses my neck and says, \u201cCan we not talk about your dad right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter rolls on top of me. My heart is thrumming in my chest, the way it does whenever I am close to him, but now even more so, because everything\u2019s about to change. I\u2019m going somewhere with him I\u2019ve never gone before. He\u2019s careful to keep his weight on his forearms, to not crush me, but I don\u2019t mind the weight of his body on mine. His hand is in my hair the way I like; his lips are warm. We\u2019re both breathing fast.</p><p>And then he\u2019s suddenly not kissing me anymore. I open my eyes and he\u2019s hovering above me, his brow furrowed. \u201cIs this because we had a fight last night? Because, Covey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of the fight. I just\u2014I just want to feel close to you.\u201d Peter\u2019s looking at me so intently, and I can tell he\u2019s waiting for more, for me to give him some grand reason. It\u2019s pretty simple, really. \u201cIt\u2019s not all of a sudden. I want to have sex with you because I love you and I want it to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014because you\u2019re my first love, so who else would it be?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolls off me and sits up; his head is in his hands.</p><p>I sit up too, pulling the sheet up around me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything for what feels like forever.</p><p>\u201cPlease just say it.\u201d I\u2019m starting to feel sick to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He can\u2019t look at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . I just have a lot on my mind. Between lacrosse, and my dad not showing up at graduation, and now you\u2019re leaving for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the whole summer. Just July. I\u2019ll be back at the end of July! Why are you fast-forwarding the whole summer away?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cIt just seems like you\u2019re leaving and you don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it wasn\u2019t my choice! My dad surprised me! You\u2019re not being fair, Peter.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for a long beat. \u201cWhat about</p><p>UNC</p><p>? Are you even planning on transferring to</p><p>UVA</p><p>anymore? When it was William and Mary, it was a given, and now it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><p>I wet my lips. My heart is pounding out of control. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe? But maybe not.</p><p>UNC</p><p>feels different to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound like a bad thing! Would you rather I go somewhere and be unhappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemporarily unhappy,\u201d he corrects.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lara Jean. Do you really think that shitty of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I . . . I just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re acting this</p><p>way. I want to at least give</p><p>UNC</p><p>a real chance. I want to give myself a chance.\u201d My eyes well up with tears, and it\u2019s hard to speak. \u201cAnd I think you should want that for me too.\u201d</p><p>Peter flinches like I\u2019ve hit him. This bed is small, but it feels like he\u2019s so far away from me right now. I ache inside, wanting to go to him. But I can\u2019t.</p><p>Silently he puts his shirt back on. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go,\u201d he says. Then he gets up, walks out the door, and leaves. I wait for the front door to shut before I start to cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AS WE PACK UP THE</p><p>car that morning, I keep thinking Peter might show up to take me home, but he doesn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t reach out to him, either. I ride back up to Virginia with the girls.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear anything from Peter until the next day. I get a text that says:</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry for last night. I was a dick.</p><p>We\u2019re gonna make this work, I promise.</p><p>I have to do some stuff for my mom but can I see you later?</p><p>I text back:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>He texts back:</p><p>I really am sorry.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to text back,</p><p>I love you, too</p> <p>, when my phone rings. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s house number, and I answer it eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>There is surprised silence on the other end, then a little laugh to cover it up. \u201cHi, Lara Jean. This is Peter\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>I am mortified. \u201cOh! Hi, Mrs. Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>She wants me to come over and chat with her. She says Peter isn\u2019t home, that it\u2019ll be just the two of us. She must have sent him out to run errands for her so she could ask me over. What can I do but go?</p><p>I put on a yellow sundress and lipstick, brush my hair, and drive to Peter\u2019s house. She answers the door with a ready smile on her face; she\u2019s wearing a gingham blouse and Bermuda shorts. \u201cCome on in,\u201d she says.</p><p>I follow her into the kitchen, and she says, \u201cLara Jean, would you like something to drink? Sun tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, climbing onto a stool.</p><p>Peter\u2019s mom pours me a glass of sun tea out of a plastic frosted pitcher. She hands me the glass and says, \u201cThank you for coming over here to visit with me, just us girls. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say again. My skin is prickling.</p><p>She takes my hands in hers. Her hands are cool and dry; mine suddenly feel clammy. \u201cPeter\u2019s been through a lot, and he\u2019s worked so hard. I\u2019m sure you know how disappointing it was for him when his dad didn\u2019t come to graduation.\u201d Her eyes search mine, and I nod. \u201cHe pretends he doesn\u2019t care, but he\u2019s hurting inside. He came back from Beach Week talking about transferring to</p><p>UNC</p><p>for his sophomore year. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>I can feel all the blood rush to my face. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that. He . . . he hasn\u2019t said a word to me about it.\u201d</p><p>She nods, as if she suspected as much. \u201cIf he were to transfer, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play for a year. That means he wouldn\u2019t keep his athletic scholarship. Out-of-state tuition is very expensive, as I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d</p><p>It is. Daddy said it would be all right, that Margot only has two more years of college, and Kitty has ages before it\u2019s her turn. But I know it\u2019s expensive. And I know, even though we don\u2019t talk about it, that my dad makes more money than Peter\u2019s mom does.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s dad says he wants to contribute, but his dad isn\u2019t someone to be depended on. So I can\u2019t count on him.\u201d She pauses delicately. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping I can count on you.\u201d</p><p>I rush to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019ll tell Peter not to transfer to North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I appreciate that so much, I really do, but it\u2019s not just transferring that I\u2019m worrying about. I\u2019m worried about his mind-set. When he gets to</p><p>UVA</p><p>, he needs to be focused. He\u2019s going there to be a student athlete. He can\u2019t be driving down to North Carolina every weekend. It just isn\u2019t practical. You\u2019re both so young. Peter\u2019s already making big life decisions based on you, and who even knows what\u2019s going to happen with you two in the future. You\u2019re teenagers. Life doesn\u2019t always work out the way you think it\u2019s going to work out. . . . I don\u2019t know if Peter ever told you this, but Peter\u2019s dad and I got married very young. And I\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d just hate to see you two make the same mistakes</p><p>we did.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cLara Jean, I know my son, and he\u2019s not going to let you go unless you let him go first.\u201d</p><p>I blink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d do anything for you. That\u2019s his nature. He\u2019s loyal to his very core. Unlike his father.\u201d Mrs. Kavinsky looks at me with sympathetic eyes. \u201cI know you care about Peter and you want what\u2019s best for him. I hope you\u2019ll give what I said some thought.\u201d She hesitates, then says, \u201cPlease don\u2019t mention anything to him. Peter would be very upset with me.\u201d</p><p>I struggle to find my voice. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her smile is bright, relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet girl, Lara Jean. I know you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d She pats my hands and releases them. Then she changes the subject, asking me about my dad\u2019s wedding.</p><p>When I get back to my car, I flip down the mirror and see that my cheeks are still stained pink. It feels like the time in seventh grade when Chris\u2019s mom found her cigarettes and she thought we\u2019d both been smoking them. I wanted to say it wasn\u2019t me, but I couldn\u2019t. I just shriveled up with shame. That\u2019s how I feel right now. Like I\u2019ve gotten in trouble.</p><p>Was it foolish of Peter and me to think that we could be the exception to the rule? Is Peter\u2019s mom right? Are we making a huge mistake? Suddenly it feels like every decision we make is so momentous, and I\u2019m so scared to make the wrong one.</p><p>* *</p><p>Back at home, Daddy, Margot, and Kitty are in the living room debating over where to go for dinner. It\u2019s such a normal</p><p>thing to be discussing on a Thursday evening, but I feel so strange, because it\u2019s as if the earth is shifting beneath my feet, and the ground isn\u2019t steady anymore, but everyone around me is talking about food.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel like, Lara Jean?\u201d Daddy asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry,\u201d I say, looking down at my phone. What will I say to Peter when he calls? Do I tell him? \u201cI might just stay home.\u201d</p><p>Daddy peers at me. \u201cAre you all right? Coming down with something? You look pale.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Seoul House?\u201d Margot suggests. \u201cI\u2019ve really been craving Korean food.\u201d</p><p>Daddy hesitates, and I know why. Trina doesn\u2019t exactly have the most sophisticated palate. She lives off of Diet Coke and chicken fingers; kale salads are about as adventurous as she gets. When we order sushi, she\u2019ll only eat California rolls and cooked shrimp. She doesn\u2019t eat any fish at all. But nobody\u2019s perfect.</p><p>\u201cTrina\u2019s not big on Korean food,\u201d I say, to spare Daddy having to say it. My phone buzzes, but it\u2019s just an email from</p><p>UNC</p><p>\u2019s housing department.</p><p>Incredulous, Margot says, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little spicy for her.\u201d Hastily he adds, \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. She can get the bulgogi sliders or the fried rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Korean food either,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Seoul House,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cTrina will be fine.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Daddy goes to make a reservation, I say to Margot, \u201cDon\u2019t judge Trina for not liking Korean food.</p><p>She can\u2019t help it if she can\u2019t eat spicy stuff.\u201d</p><p>Kitty is quick to jump in with, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t judge her.\u201d</p><p>A hurt look flashes across Margot\u2019s face, and she protests, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what you were thinking,\u201d I say. I know what she\u2019s thinking because I\u2019ve had the same thought. And I\u2019m now in the curious position of having to defend Trina for something I also think is annoying. It wouldn\u2019t kill Trina to broaden her culinary horizons.</p><p>\u201cFried rice, though? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if she doesn\u2019t like Korean food?\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cKorean food is our biggest link to Korean culture,\u201d Margot tells her. \u201cAre we just never going to eat Korean food anymore because Trina doesn\u2019t like it?\u201d Margot doesn\u2019t wait for us to answer. \u201cI just hope she realizes that when she marries Daddy, she gets the whole package, and Korea\u2019s a part of that package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot, she knows that,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019ll get to eat Korean food every day this summer.\u201d Every day this summer when I\u2019m away from Peter.</p><p>\u201cI wish Daddy and Trina were coming too,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d Margot says. \u201cWhat would Trina even eat in Korea?\u201d She\u2019s halfway joking but not really.</p><p>Kitty, who is petting Jamie, ignores her and asks me, \u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of Jamie Fox-Pickle and Simone when we\u2019re all gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog sitter?\u201d I suggest. My heart\u2019s not really in it. I\u2019m</p><p>only halfway here. All I can think of is Peter. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Margot looks around the room. Her eyes land on Trina\u2019s big armchair. \u201cThis house feels so small all of sudden. There isn\u2019t enough room for all of Trina\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>Kitty says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that small when you\u2019re not here.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cKitty!\u201d</p><p>All the color drains from Margot\u2019s face, and then her cheeks go splotchy. \u201cDid you really just say that to me?\u201d</p><p>I can tell Kitty regrets it, but she lifts her chin in her stubborn Kitty way. \u201cWell, I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brat.\u201d Margot gets the words out strong, but I see her face as she turns to go upstairs, and I know she\u2019s going to her room to cry in private.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019s gone, I turn to Kitty. \u201cWhy did you say that to her?\u201d</p><p>Tears leak from her eyes. \u201cBecause! She\u2019s been so mean to Tree for no reason.\u201d</p><p>I wipe her tears with the back of my hand. I feel like crying too. \u201cGogo feels left out, that\u2019s all. We know Trina, because we\u2019ve had time to know her. But Margot doesn\u2019t know her at all. And Kitty\u2014Gogo practically raised you. You don\u2019t talk to her like that.\u201d</p><p>Halfheartedly, she mutters, \u201cI talk to you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different and you know it. We\u2019re closer in age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you and I are on the same level?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014no. Margot and I are almost on the same level, and you\u2019re on the level below us, because you\u2019re the</p><p>youngest. But you and I are more on the same level than you and Margot. Just try and understand her. She doesn\u2019t want to feel like her place has been taken.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s shoulders hunch. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just needs a little reassurance, that\u2019s all. Be understanding.\u201d Kitty doesn\u2019t reply or lift her head, but I know she\u2019s hearing me. \u201cYou</p><p>are</p><p>a little brat, though.\u201d Her head snaps up and she lunges at me, and I laugh. \u201cGo upstairs and say sorry to Gogo. You know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Kitty actually listens to me for once. She goes upstairs, and then, sometime later, they both come down with red eyes. In the meantime I get a text from Peter, asking if I can come out. I tell him I can\u2019t, that I\u2019m going out to dinner with my family, but I\u2019ll see him tomorrow night. The guys are meeting us at the karaoke bar after they have their steak dinner. I hope that by the time I see him, I\u2019ll know what to do.</p><p>* *</p><p>In my room that night, I am painting my nails mint green for the bachelorette party tomorrow night, and Margot is lying on my bed looking at her phone. \u201cDo you want me to do your nails too?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care,\u201d she says.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cListen, you have to stop being in a bad mood about Trina. She and Daddy are getting married, Gogo.\u201d</p><p>Margot sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Trina. Trina\u2019s . . . Trina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Margot chews on her top lip, something I haven\u2019t seen her do since she was little. \u201cIt\u2019s like I came back and there was a</p><p>whole new family here that I wasn\u2019t a part of.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell her that nothing has changed, that she\u2019s still just as much a part of it as she always was, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. Life here kept going on without her, just like it\u2019ll keep going on without me when I leave this fall.</p><p>A tear rolls down her cheek. \u201cAnd I miss Mommy.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens up. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Kitty could have known her.\u201d Margot sighs. \u201cI know it\u2019s selfish . . . but I guess I just never pictured Daddy getting married again. I thought he\u2019d date, maybe have a long-term girlfriend at some point, but married?\u201d</p><p>Gently I say, \u201cI never really thought about it either, but then when you left for Scotland, I don\u2019t know . . . it just started making more sense. The thought of him having someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it\u2019s good for Kitty, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she thinks of Trina as hers. I have my own relationship with Trina, but Kitty\u2019s had a special thing with her from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, she\u2019s like a pit bull with Trina!\u201d Margot laughs a shaky kind of laugh. \u201cShe really loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s why you got so upset about Korean food today. You think that if Daddy stops cooking Korean food because Trina doesn\u2019t like it, Kitty won\u2019t have that connection anymore. And if we forget Korea, we forget Mommy.\u201d Tears are rolling down her cheeks, and she is wiping them away with the back of her sweatshirt sleeve. \u201cBut we\u2019ll never forget Korea, and we\u2019ll never forget Mommy. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Margot nods and takes a deep breath. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve cried twice today! It\u2019s so un-me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me, and I smile back, as brightly as I can. Her brow furrows. \u201cLara Jean, is something up with you? You\u2019ve seemed sort of . . . I don\u2019t know, melancholy, ever since you got back from Beach Week. Did something happen with you and Peter?\u201d</p><p>I want so desperately to tell her everything, to lay all my burdens upon my big sister, to have her tell me what to do. Things would be so much simpler if she would just tell me what to do. But I know what Margot would do, because she\u2019s already done it.</p><p>Don\u2019t be the girl who goes to college with a boyfriend.</p><p>That\u2019s what my mom said. That\u2019s what Margot said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FOR THE BACHELORETTE, KRISTEN DECIDED</p><p>the theme of the night should be the nineties, because there\u2019s nothing Trina loves better than the nineties, so everyone has to dress up in nineties clothes. Honestly, I think the whole reason behind the theme is because Kristen wants to wear a crop top and show off her abs. She arrives at the house in a blue T-shirt that says</p><p>SKATER GURL</p><p>and baggy jeans, and her hair is parted down the middle. She\u2019s wearing dark brown lipstick, very matte.</p> <p>The first thing she does is turn on a nineties station, which blasts all over the whole house. The girls are meeting here, and the boys (and Kitty) are meeting at the steakhouse. I\u2019m glad, because I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say to Peter.</p><p>We\u2019re still getting ready. I\u2019m going with a floral babydoll dress I found on Etsy, and cream-colored knee socks and black platform Mary Janes. I\u2019m brushing my hair into two ponytails when Kristen comes upstairs to do inspections, carrying a martini glass that says</p><p>Maid of Honor</p> <p>in pink cursive. \u201cAw, you look cute, Lara Jean,\u201d she says, sipping on her cocktail.</p><p>I tighten my ponytails. \u201cThank you, Kristen,\u201d I say. I\u2019m just glad my outfit is up to snuff. I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind, and I would hate to mess up Trina\u2019s night.</p><p>Kitty and Margot are on the floor; Kitty is painting Margot\u2019s nails black. Margot has chosen to go the grunge route\u2014a long flannel shirt and jeans and a pair of Doc Martens I borrowed from Chris.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d Kitty asks Kristen.</p><p>\u201cCosmopolitan. I have more downstairs in a Sprite bottle. Not for you, though.\u201d</p><p>Kitty rolls her eyes at this. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the shower,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Kristen tilts her head and squints at me. \u201cYou\u2019re missing something.\u201d She puts down her glass and digs into her clutch and pulls out a lipstick. \u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . is it the color you\u2019re wearing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s called Toast of New York. It was the shit back in the day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . ,\u201d I hedge. Kristen looks like she smeared Hershey\u2019s kisses all over her lips and then the chocolate dried.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about wearing this.\u201d I put down my hairbrush and show her a shiny pink lip gloss. \u201cDidn\u2019t the Spice Girls wear lip gloss like this? Weren\u2019t they from the nineties?\u201d</p><p>Kristen frowns. \u201cThey were more late nineties, early two thousands, but yes. I guess that\u2019ll work.\u201d She points her lipstick at Margot. \u201cYou need this, though. Your outfit isn\u2019t nineties enough.\u201d She watches as Kitty puts the finishing touches on Margot\u2019s nails. \u201cI used to use a Sharpie,\u201d Kristen says. \u201cYou girls don\u2019t know how lucky you are to have all these options. We used</p><p>to have to make do. Sharpies for black, Wite-Out for white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Wite-Out?\u201d Kitty asks her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You children don\u2019t even know what Wite-Out is?\u201d</p><p>As soon as Kristen turns her back to pick up her cocktail, Kitty bares her teeth at her and hisses silently.</p><p>\u201cI saw you in the mirror,\u201d Kristen says.</p><p>\u201cI meant for you to,\u201d Kitty says back.</p><p>Kristen eyes her. \u201cHurry up and finish with your sister\u2019s nails so you can do mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>A minute later the doorbell rings, and all three of them head downstairs. I hear Kristen yell, \u201cYou get the door; I\u2019ll get the drinks!\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>Trina\u2019s sorority sister Monique is wearing a slip dress with big sunflowers splashed all over it, and a white T-shirt underneath, plus black platform Mary Janes that look like space shoes. Her friend Kendra from SoulCycle is wearing overalls with a pink ribbed cami and a matching pink scrunchie in her hair. A lot of the stuff people are wearing, the kids from school wear too. Fashion really is cyclical.</p><p>The nineties theme was the right call, because Trina is delighted by all of it.</p><p>\u201cI love your dress!\u201d Kendra says to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage.\u201d</p><p>She recoils in real horror. \u201c</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Are the nineties considered vintage now?\u201d</p><p>Trina says, \u201cYes, girl. Their nineties are our seventies.\u201d</p><p>She shudders. \u201cThat\u2019s terrifying. Are we old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re geriatric,\u201d Trina says, but cheerfully.</p><p>In the car on the way to the karaoke bar, I get a text from Peter\u2014it\u2019s a picture of him and my dad in their suits, smiling big. My heart lurches when I see it. How do I let a boy like that go?</p><p>* *</p><p>We have a private room reserved at the karaoke bar. When the waitress comes around, Margot orders a pomegranate margarita, which Trina notices, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. What could she say? Margot\u2019s in college. She\u2019ll be twenty in a month.</p><p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really sweet,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want a sip?\u201d</p><p>I would surely love a sip. Peter\u2019s texted twice from the steakhouse, asking how my night is going, and my stomach is tied up in knots. Furtively I look over at Trina, who is doing a duet with Kristen. She might not have said anything to Margot, but I have a feeling she will say something to me.</p><p>\u201cIn Scotland, the drinking age is eighteen,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>I take a quick sip, and it\u2019s good, tart and icy.</p><p>Meanwhile, everybody\u2019s looking through songbooks, trying to decide what songs to put in. The rule of the night is only nineties music. It takes a while for people to get warmed up, but then the drinks start coming fast and furious, and people are shouting out song numbers for the queue.</p><p>Trina\u2019s friend Michelle goes up next. She croons, \u201cThere was a time, when I was so broken-hearted . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this song,\u201d I say. \u201cWho sings this song?\u201d</p><p>Kristen pats me on the head indulgently. \u201cAerosmith, baby girl. Aerosmith.\u201d</p><p>They all get up and sing Spice Girls.</p><p>Margot and I sing \u201cWonderwall\u201d by Oasis. When I sit back down, I\u2019m breathless.</p><p>Trina\u2019s SoulCycle friend Kendra is swaying to the beat of whatever nineties song Trina and Kristen are dueting, her frosted martini glass in the air. It\u2019s acid green.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking, Kendra?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cApple martini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good. Can I try it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, have a sip! They\u2019re so fruity you can\u2019t even taste it.\u201d</p><p>I take a little hummingbird sip. It is sweet. It tastes like a Jolly Rancher.</p><p>When Kristen and Trina\u2019s number is up, they fall on the couch beside me, and Kendra jumps up to sing a Britney Spears song.</p><p>Kristen is slurring, \u201cI just want us to stay close, you know? Don\u2019t be boring. Don\u2019t be, like, a mom all of a sudden, okay? I mean, I know you have to be a mom, but like, don\u2019t be a</p><p>mom</p><p>mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be a mom mom,\u201d Trina says soothingly. \u201cI could never be a mom mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise to still come to Wine Down Wednesdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Kristen lets out a sob. \u201cI just love you so much, girl.\u201d</p><p>Trina has tears in her eyes too. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Kendra\u2019s martini is just sitting on the table all alone. I take another sip when no one is looking, because it does taste good. And then another. I\u2019ve finished the glass when Trina spots me. She raises her eyebrows. \u201cI think you might\u2019ve had a little</p><p>too</p><p>much fun at Beach Week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely drunk a thing at Beach Week, Trina!\u201d I protest. I frown. \u201cIs it drunk or is it drank?\u201d</p><p>Trina looks alarmed. \u201cMargot, is your sister drunk?\u201d</p><p>I put my hands up. \u201cGuys, guys, I don\u2019t even drank!\u201d</p><p>Margot sits down next to me, examines my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been drunk before in my life. Am I drunk now? I do feel very relaxed. Is that what drunk feels like, when your limbs are loose, kind of silky?</p><p>\u201cYour dad is going to kill me,\u201d Trina says with a groan. \u201cThey just dropped Kitty off back at home. They\u2019ll be here any minute. Lara Jean, drink a lot of water. Drink this whole glass. I\u2019m going to get another pitcher.\u201d</p><p>When she returns a few minutes later, the bachelor party is in tow. She gives me a warning look.</p><p>Don\u2019t act drunk,</p><p>she mouths. I give her a thumbs-up. Then I jump up and throw my arms around Peter.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d I shout above the music. He looks so cute in his button-down and tie. So cute I could cry. I bury my face in his neck like a squirrel. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so, so very much.\u201d</p><p>Peter peers at me. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I only had like two sips. Two drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrina let you drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I giggle. \u201cI stole sips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get you out of here before your dad sees you,\u201d Peter says, eyes darting around. My dad is looking through a songbook with Margot, who is giving me a look that says,</p><p>Get it together.</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt a living soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out to the parking lot so you can get some air,\u201d he says, putting his arm around me and hustling me out the door and through the restaurant.</p><p>We step outside, and I sway on my feet a little. Peter\u2019s trying not to smile. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m a weightlight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLightweight.\u201d He pinches my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cRight. Weightlight. I mean, lightweight.\u201d Why is that so funny? I can\u2019t stop laughing. But then I see the way he is looking at me, with such tenderness, and I stop. I don\u2019t feel like laughing anymore. I feel like crying. Look at the way he made my dad\u2019s bachelor party so special. Look at all the ways he loves me so well. I have to love him back just as much. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do until this very moment, but now I know. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to say to you.\u201d I straighten up suddenly and accidentally knock Peter in the collarbone, which makes him cough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Here\u2019s what I want to say to you. I want you to do what you\u2019re supposed to do and I want to do what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>He has a half smile on his face. Shaking his head at me, he says, \u201cWhat are you talking about, Covey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about, I don\u2019t think we should be in a long-distance\u2014a long-distance relationship.\u201d</p><p>His smile is fading. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you need to do all the things you need to do at</p><p>UVA</p><p>, like play lacrosse, and study, and I need to do what I need to do at</p><p>UNC</p><p>, and if we try to stay together, everything will just fall apart. So we can\u2019t. We just, we just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He blinks and then his face goes very still. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to stay together?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, and the hurt on his face sobers me up. \u201cI want you to do what you\u2019re supposed to do. I don\u2019t want you to do something for me.</p><p>UVA</p><p>is what you\u2019ve worked for, Peter. That\u2019s where you have to be. Not at</p><p>UNC</p><p>.\u201d</p><p>He turns ashen. \u201cDid you talk to my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, no . . .\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw twitches. \u201cGot it. Say no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, listen to me, Peter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. Just for the record, I mentioned</p><p>UNC</p><p>to my mom as a throwaway possibility. It wasn\u2019t anything definite. Just something I threw out there. But it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t want me to come.\u201d He starts to walk away from me, and I grab his arm to stop him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying! I\u2019m saying that if you came, if you gave up everything you\u2019ve worked for at</p><p>UVA</p><p>, you\u2019d only end up resenting me.\u201d</p><p>Flatly he says, \u201cJust stop it, Lara Jean. I saw this coming a mile away. Ever since you decided to go to</p><p>UNC</p><p>, you\u2019ve been saying good-bye to me.\u201d</p><p>My arm drops away from him. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the scrapbook, for one thing. You said it was to remember us by. Why would I need something to remember us by, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how I meant it! I spent months working on that scrapbook. You\u2019re putting this all on me, but you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been pushing me away. Ever since Beach Week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s talk about what happened that night at Beach Week.\u201d I can feel my face flush as he looks at me with a challenge in his eyes. \u201cThat night you wanted to have sex, it was like you were trying to put a bow on this whole thing. Like you were putting me in your\u2014your hatbox. Like I played my part in your first love story, and now you can go on to the next chapter.\u201d</p><p>I feel light-headed, unsteady on my feet. Peter, who I thought I understood so well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you took it that way, but that\u2019s not how I meant it. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt clearly is how you meant it, because you\u2019re doing it right now. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Is there some hidden truth to what he\u2019s saying, even a little bit? It\u2019s true that I wouldn\u2019t want my first</p><p>time to be with anyone else. It\u2019s true that it felt right to have it be with Peter, because he\u2019s the first boy I ever loved. I wouldn\u2019t want it to be with some boy I meet in college. That boy is a stranger to me. Peter I\u2019ve known since we were kids. Was I just trying to close a chapter?</p><p>No. I did it because I wanted it to be him. But if that\u2019s how he sees it, maybe it\u2019s easier this way.</p><p>I swallow. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe I did want my first time to be with you so I could close a chapter on high school. On us.\u201d</p><p>He freezes. I see the pain in his eyes, and then his face closes up like a shuttered empty house. He starts to walk away. This time I don\u2019t try to stop him. Over his shoulder he says, \u201cWe\u2019re good, Covey. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, I turn to the side and throw up everything I drank and ate tonight. I\u2019m bent over, heaving, when Trina and Daddy and Margot walk out of the karaoke bar. Daddy rushes over to me. \u201cLara Jean, what\u2019s the matter? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I mumble, wiping my eyes and mouth.</p><p>His eyes widen, alarmed. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d He looks accusingly at Trina, who is rubbing my back. \u201cTrina, you let Lara Jean drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a few sips of a pomegranate martini. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look fine!\u201d</p><p>Trina stands up straight, her hand still on my back. \u201cDan, Lara Jean\u2019s a young woman now. You can\u2019t see it, because you still see her as a little girl, but she\u2019s grown up so much in the time I\u2019ve known her. She can handle herself.\u201d</p><p>Margot breaks in. \u201cDaddy, I let her have a few sips of my drink\u2014that\u2019s it. She really doesn\u2019t have any tolerance. Frankly, it\u2019s something she should work on before she gets to college. Don\u2019t blame Trina.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks from Margot to Trina and back to Margot. She is standing shoulder to shoulder with Trina, and in that</p><p>moment they are united. Then he looks over at me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. This is all on Lara Jean. Get in the car.\u201d</p><p>On the way home we have to pull over once so I can throw up again. It\u2019s not the pomegranate martini that\u2019s making me want to die. It\u2019s the look on Peter\u2019s face. The way the light in his eyes went away. The hurt\u2014if I close my eyes I can see it. The only other time I\u2019ve seen him look that way was when his dad didn\u2019t show up at graduation. And now that look is there because of me.</p><p>I start to cry in the car. Big sobs that make my shoulders shake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d my dad says with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, but not that big of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I broke up with Peter.\u201d I can barely get the words out. \u201cDaddy, if you could\u2019ve seen the look on his face. It was\u2014terrible.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, he asks, \u201cWhy did you break up with him? He\u2019s such a nice boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I weep. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He takes one hand off the steering wheel and squeezes my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it will be,\u201d he says, stroking my hair.</p><p>I made the right choice tonight. I did, I know it. Letting him go was the right thing.</p><p>I can see the future, Peter. That way lies heartbreak. I won\u2019t do it. Better to part while we can still see each other in a certain way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I WAKE UP IN THE</p><p>middle of the night crying, and my first thought is, I want to take it back. I\u2019ve made a huge mistake and I want to take it all back. Then I cry myself back to sleep.</p><p>In the morning, my head throbs, and now I\u2019m the one throwing up in the bathroom, just like the girls at Beach Week, only there\u2019s no one to hold my hair back. I feel better after, but I lie on the bathroom floor for a while in case another wave of nausea hits. I fall asleep there, and wake up to Kitty shaking me by the arm. \u201cMove, I have to pee,\u201d she says, stepping over me.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me up,\u201d I say, and she drags me to my feet. She sits down to pee and I splash cold water on my face.</p><p>\u201cGo eat some toast,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cIt\u2019ll soak up the alcohol in your stomach.\u201d</p><p>I brush my teeth and stumble downstairs to the kitchen, where Daddy is cooking eggs and Margot and Trina are eating yogurt.</p><p>\u201cRise and shine, little girl,\u201d Trina says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou look like someone ran you over with a truck,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be grounded right now if it weren\u2019t for the wedding,\u201d Daddy says, trying to sound stern and failing. \u201cEat some scrambled eggs.\u201d</p><p>I gag at the thought.</p><p>\u201cFirst eat some toast,\u201d Margot instructs. \u201cIt\u2019ll soak up the alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Kitty said.\u201d</p><p>Trina points her spoon at me. \u201cAnd then, once you\u2019ve put some food in your belly, you can have two Advil. Never, ever take Advil on an empty stomach. You\u2019ll be feeling much better in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d I vow, and Margot and Trina exchange a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>I spend the whole day in bed, lights off with the curtains drawn. I want so badly to call Peter. To ask him to forgive me. I don\u2019t even remember everything I said. I remember the gist of it, but the memory itself is blurry. The one thing I do remember so clearly, what I\u2019ll never forget, is the stricken look on his face, and it makes me hate myself for putting it there.</p><p>I give in. I text him. Just three words.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>I see the . . . on the other end. My heart pounds madly as I wait. But the reply never comes. I try calling, but my call goes straight to voice mail, and I hang up. Maybe he\u2019s already deleted me from his phone, like he did his dad. Maybe he\u2019s just . . . done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHRIS IS THE FIRST TO</p><p>leave. she comes by the house that week and says, \u201cI can\u2019t go to your dad\u2019s wedding this weekend. I\u2019m leaving for the Dominican Republic tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Chris doesn\u2019t look the least bit sorry; she has a huge grin on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy. A spot opened up for me at an eco-hotel, and there\u2019s no way I can pass this up. They speak Spanish in the Dominican Republic, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I thought you were going to Costa Rica!\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she says, \u201cThis other opportunity came up so I pounced on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving so soon! You weren\u2019t supposed to leave until August. When do you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . I guess that\u2019s the beauty of it. I could stay for six months, or something else will come up and I\u2019ll go there.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cSo you\u2019re leaving for good, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for</p><p>good</p><p>. Just for now.\u201d</p><p>Something inside of me knows that this really is for good. I don\u2019t see Chris coming back here a year from now</p><p>to go to Piedmont Virginia Community College. This is Chris, the stray cat, who comes and goes as she pleases. She\u2019ll always land on her cat tippy-toes.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so sad. You\u2019ll be fine without me. You have Kavinsky.\u201d For a second I can\u2019t breathe. Just hearing his name is like a dagger in my heart. \u201cAnyway we\u2019re all leaving soon enough. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not going to be left behind.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s how it would feel to her\u2014staying here, going to a community college, working at Applebee\u2019s. I feel a surge of gladness that instead of that, she\u2019s off on an adventure. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving so soon.\u201d I don\u2019t tell her that Peter and I broke up, that I don\u2019t have him anymore. Today isn\u2019t about me and Peter; it\u2019s about Chris, and her exciting new future. \u201cCan I at least come help you pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already packed! I\u2019m only bringing the essentials. My leather jacket, bikinis, a few crystals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you bring sneakers and work gloves and that kind of thing, just in case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear sneakers on the plane, and whatever else I need, I\u2019ll get when I\u2019m there. That\u2019s the whole point of an adventure. Pack light and figure the rest out as you go.\u201d</p><p>I thought we\u2019d have more time, me and Chris in my bedroom, sharing secrets late into the night, eating chips in bed. I wanted to cement our friendship before she left: Lara Jean and Chrissy, like the old days.</p><p>It\u2019s all ending. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THAT NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING</p><p>, when my cakes are cooling on the kitchen counter and everyone at my house is setting up lawn chairs outside, I drive over to Chris\u2019s to say good-bye.</p><p>As soon as she lets me in, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not letting you in here if you cry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I feel like this is going to be the last time I ever see you.\u201d A tear slips down my cheek. There is a finality to this moment. I know it, I just know it. Chris is catapulting on to the next thing. Even if we see each other again, it won\u2019t be like this. She\u2019s a restless spirit. I\u2019m lucky to have had her for as long as I did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably see me again next week when I fly right back home,\u201d she jokes, and there is the tiniest note of trepidation in her voice. Chris, with all her bluster and bravado, is nervous.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You\u2019re just getting started. This is it, Chris.\u201d I jump up and hug her. I\u2019m trying not to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so corny,\u201d she says, but I could swear I see tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d I tell her. I take the present out of my bag and give it to her.</p><p>She tears off the wrapping paper and opens the box. It\u2019s a picture of the two of us in a little heart frame, no bigger than a Christmas tree ornament. We are at the beach, in matching bathing suits; we are twelve, maybe thirteen. \u201cHang this up on your wall wherever you go so people know you have somebody waiting for you back home.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes tear up and she brushes them with the back of her hand. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re the worst,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard people say you meet your best friends in college, and they\u2019re the ones you\u2019ll know your whole life, but I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll know Chris my whole life too. I\u2019m a person who saves things. I\u2019ll hold on forever.</p><p>* *</p><p>When I get back home, Trina\u2019s at SoulCycle. Daddy is still outside setting up the chairs, Margot is steaming our bridesmaid dresses, and Kitty is cutting paper flags for the bunting that will go over the dessert table. I get to work icing the wedding cake\u2014yellow cake with buttercream frosting, just like I promised Trina. Daddy\u2019s groom\u2019s cake is already done, Thin Mints and all. This is my second try with the wedding cake\u2014I scrapped the first one because I didn\u2019t trim enough off the tops of the layers and when I stacked it, the cake looked hopelessly lopsided. This second one is still a tiny bit uneven, but a thick layer of buttercream covers all manner of sins, or so I keep telling myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting enough frosting on that cake to give us all diabetes,\u201d Kitty remarks.</p><p>I bite my tongue and keep spinning the cake and frosting the top so it\u2019s smooth. \u201cIt looks all right, doesn\u2019t it, Margot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks professionally done,\u201d she assures me, zooming the steamer along the hem of her dress.</p><p>As I sail past Kitty, I can\u2019t resist saying, \u201cP.S., the last three flags you cut are crooked.\u201d</p><p>Kitty ignores me and sings to herself, \u201cSugar shock, whoa baby, that cake\u2019ll give us sugar shock,\u201d to the tune of that oldies song \u201cSugar Shack.\u201d It\u2019s probably my own fault for playing it whenever I bake.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last time it\u2019ll be just us,\u201d I say, and Margot looks over at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it won\u2019t be just us anymore,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Margot says, and I\u2019m fairly certain she means it.</p><p>Families shrink and expand. All you can really do is be glad for it, glad for each other, for as long as you have each other.</p><p>* *</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep, so I go downstairs to make a cup of Night-Night tea, and as I run the water for my kettle, I look out the window and see the red embers of a cigarette glowing in the darkness. Trina is outside smoking!</p><p>I\u2019m debating whether or not to forego my tea ritual and go to bed before she sees me, but as I\u2019m emptying the kettle, she comes back inside, a can of Fresca in her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she says, startled.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d I say, just as she says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Kitty!\u201d</p><p>We both laugh.</p><p>\u201cI swear it was a good-bye smoke. I haven\u2019t had a cigarette in months!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you one,\u201d Trina says, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of Night-Night tea?\u201d I ask her. \u201cMy mom used to make it for us. It\u2019s very soothing. It\u2019ll make you feel nice and cozy and ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like heaven.\u201d</p><p>I fill the kettle and put it on the stove. \u201cAre you nervous about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not nervous . . . just, nerves, I guess? I really want everything to go off\u2014without a hitch.\u201d A giggle escapes her throat. \u201cPun intended. God, I love a good pun.\u201d Then she straightens up and says, \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on with you and Peter.\u201d</p><p>I busy myself with spooning honey into mugs. \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d The last thing Trina needs on the night before her wedding is to hear about my problems.</p><p>She gives me a look. \u201cCome on, girl. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess we\u2019re broken up?\u201d I shrug my shoulders high so I don\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey. Bring that tea over here and come sit next to me on the couch.\u201d</p><p>I finish making the tea and bring the mugs over to the couch and sit next to Trina, who tucks her legs under her and drapes a blanket over both of us. \u201cNow tell me everything,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI guess things started to go sideways when I got into</p><p>UNC</p><p>. Our plan was for me to go to William and Mary and then I\u2019d transfer, and we\u2019d be long distance for the first year. But</p><p>UNC</p><p>is a lot farther, and when I visited, I knew I wanted to be there. Not with one foot in and one foot out, you know?\u201d I stir my spoon. \u201cI really want to give it a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a thousand percent the right attitude.\u201d Trina warms her hand on her tea mug. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you broke up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not entirely. Peter\u2019s mom told me he was talking about transferring to</p><p>UNC</p><p>next year. She wanted me to break up with him before he messed up his life for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn! Peter\u2019s mom is kind of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t use those exact words, but that was the gist of it.\u201d I take a sip of tea. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him to transfer for me either. . . . My mom used to say not to go to college with a boyfriend, because you\u2019ll lose out on a true freshman experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair, your mom never met Peter Kavinsky. She didn\u2019t have all the facts. If she had met him . . .\u201d Trina lets out a low whistle. \u201cShe might\u2019ve been singing a different tune.\u201d</p><p>Tears fill my eyes. \u201cHonestly I regret breaking up with him and I wish I could take it all back!\u201d</p><p>She tips up my chin. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever forgive me for hurting him like that. He doesn\u2019t let people in easily. I think I\u2019m probably dead to him.\u201d</p><p>Trina tries to hide a smile. \u201cI doubt that. Look, you\u2019ll talk to him at the wedding tomorrow. When he sees you in that dress, all will be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>I sniffle. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is. You don\u2019t plan a man\u2019s bachelor party and then not show to the wedding. Not to mention the fact that he\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I hurt him again?\u201d</p><p>She wraps both her hands around her mug of tea and takes a sip. \u201cYou can\u2019t protect him from being hurt, babe, no matter what you do. Being vulnerable, letting people in, getting hurt . . . it\u2019s all a part of being in love.\u201d</p><p>I take this in. \u201cTrina, when did you figure out that you and my dad were the real thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . I think I just\u2014decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided on him. On us.\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cOn all of it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so crazy to think that a year ago, she was just our neighbor Ms. Rothschild. Kitty and I would sit on our stoop and watch her run to the car in the morning and spill hot coffee all over herself. And now she\u2019s marrying our dad. She\u2019s going to be our stepmom, and I\u2019m so glad for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE AIR SMELLS LIKE HONEYSUCKLES</p><p>and summer days that go on and on. It is the perfect day to get married. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any place prettier than Virginia in June. Everything in bloom, everything green and sunny and hopeful. When I get married, I think I might like it to be at home too.</p><p>We woke up early, and it seemed like there would be plenty of time, but of course we\u2019re running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Trina is flying around the upstairs in her silky ivory robe that Kristen bought her. Kristen bought pink ones for us bridesmaids, with our names embroidered in gold on the front pocket. Trina\u2019s says</p> <p>The Bride</p><p>. I\u2019ve got to hand it to Kristen. She\u2019s annoying but she has vision. She knows how to make things nice.</p><p>Trina\u2019s photographer friend takes a picture of all of us in our robes, Trina sitting in the middle like a very tan swan. Then it\u2019s time to get dressed. We compromised on Kitty\u2019s tuxedo\u2014she\u2019s wearing a white short-sleeved button-down shirt, a jaunty plaid bow tie, and pants that hit at her ankle. Her hair is in Swiss Miss braids, tucked under and pinned up. She looks so pretty. She looks so . . . Kitty. I compromised by putting baby\u2019s breath in my hair but no flower crown. I also compromised on my vision of fairy nightgowns for Margot</p><p>and me. Instead we are wearing vintage 1950s floral dresses that I found on Etsy\u2014Margot\u2019s is cream with yellow daisies, and mine has pink flowers and straps that tie at the shoulder. Mine must have been owned by a short person, because we didn\u2019t even have to alter it, and it hits at the knees, right where it\u2019s supposed to, .</p> <p>Trina is a beautiful bride. Her teeth and dress look very white against her tanned skin. \u201cI don\u2019t look silly, do I?\u201d She casts a nervous look in my direction. \u201cToo old to wear white? I mean, I</p><p>am</p><p>a divorc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Margot answers before I can. \u201cYou look perfect. Just perfect.\u201d</p> <p>My older sister has a way of sounding right. Trina\u2019s whole body relaxes, like one big exhale. \u201cThank you, Margot.\u201d Her voice goes tremulous. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d Kitty screeches.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I tell her. \u201cDon\u2019t scream. Trina needs serenity.\u201d Kitty\u2019s been a nervous bundle of energy all day; it\u2019s like her birthday and Christmas and first day of school combined.</p><p>Trina fans her armpits. \u201cI\u2019m sweating. I think I need more deodorant. Kitty, do I smell?\u201d</p> <p>Kitty leans in. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve already taken a hundred pictures today, and we\u2019ll take hundreds more, but I know this one will be my favorite. Us three Song girls flocked in tight around Trina, Margot dabbing at Trina\u2019s eyes with a tissue, Kitty standing on a footstool fussing with Trina\u2019s hair, Trina\u2019s arm around me. We\u2019re smiling so big. Things are ending, but they are beginning, too.</p><p>As for Peter, there\u2019s been no word. Every time a car comes down our street, I go to the window to see if it\u2019s him, but it never is. He isn\u2019t coming, and I don\u2019t blame him one bit. But still I hope, because I can\u2019t help but hope.</p><p>* *</p><p>The backyard is covered in Christmas lights and white paper lanterns. Granted, there\u2019s no wall of roses, but it still looks lovely. All of the chairs are set up; the runner is rolled out in the middle for Trina to walk down. I greet guests as they come in\u2014it\u2019s a small group, under fifty people. The perfect size for a backyard wedding. Margot\u2019s sitting with Grandma, Nana, and Trina\u2019s dad and sister in the first row, keeping them company while I walk around saying hello to our neighbors the Shahs, Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor, my cousin Haven, who compliments my dress. Throughout it all, I keep my eyes trained on the driveway, waiting for a black Audi that doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>When \u201cLullaby\u201d by the Dixie Chicks begins to play, Kitty, Margot, and I get into our places. Daddy walks out and stands on the groom\u2019s side, and we all look toward the house, where Trina is making her way toward us. She is resplendent.</p><p>We cry throughout the vows, even Margot, who never cries. They go with the traditional ones, and when Reverend Choi, the pastor from Grandma\u2019s church, says, \u201cYou may kiss the bride,\u201d Daddy turns beet red, but he kisses Trina with a flourish. Everyone claps; Kitty whoops. Jamie Fox-Pickle barks.</p><p>* *</p><p>The father-daughter dance was Trina\u2019s idea. She said she\u2019d already been there and done that and didn\u2019t feel the need to</p><p>do it again, and that it would be far more meaningful for us girls to do it instead. We practiced earlier this week, on the dance floor Daddy rented.</p><p>We planned the father-daughter dance to go Margot first, then I cut in, then Kitty cuts in. The song Daddy chose is \u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely,\u201d a song Stevie Wonder wrote for his daughter when she was first born.</p><p>Kitty and I stand off to the side, clapping to the beat. I know she\u2019s already relishing her moment to cut in on me.</p><p>Before Daddy releases Margot, he pulls her close and whispers something in her ear, and she gets tears in her eyes. I won\u2019t ask what he said; it is a moment just for them.</p><p>Daddy and I have practiced a few moves. The crowd-pleaser is when we dance-walk side by side and shimmy together in unison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d he says. \u201cMy middle girl.\u201d It\u2019s my turn for my eyes to fill. I kiss him on the cheek and hand him off to Kitty. Daddy swings her around just as the harmonica starts up.</p><p>I\u2019m walking off the dance floor when I see him. Peter, in a suit, standing to the side, beside the dogwood tree. He looks so handsome I can hardly stand it. I cross the backyard, and he watches me the whole time. My heart is pounding so hard. Is he here for me? Or did he just come because he promised my dad?</p><p>When I\u2019m standing in front of him, I say, \u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks away. \u201cOf course I came.\u201d</p><p>Softly I say, \u201cI wish I could take back the things I said the</p><p>other night. I don\u2019t even remember all of them.\u201d</p><p>Looking down, he says, \u201cBut you meant them, right? So it\u2019s a good thing you said them then, because somebody had to and you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cAbout</p><p>UNC</p><p>. About me not transferring there.\u201d He lifts his head, his eyes wounded. \u201cBut you should have told me my mom talked to you.\u201d</p><p>I take a shaky breath. \u201cYou should have told me you were thinking about transferring! You should\u2019ve told me how you were feeling, period. You shut down after graduation; you wouldn\u2019t let me in. You kept saying everything was going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was fucking scared, okay!\u201d he bursts out. He looks around to see if anyone heard, but the music is loud, and everyone is dancing; no one is looking at us, and it\u2019s like we are alone here in this backyard.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you so scared about?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>His hands tighten into fists at his sides. When he finally speaks, his voice comes out raw, like he hasn\u2019t used it in a while. \u201cI was scared that you were going to go to</p><p>UNC</p><p>and you were gonna figure out I wasn\u2019t worth it, and you were going to leave.\u201d</p><p>I take a step closer to him. I put my hand on his arm; he doesn\u2019t pull away from me. \u201cBesides my family, you\u2019re the most special person to me in the world. And I meant some of those things I said the other night, but not the part when I said I only wanted to lose my virginity to you to close a chapter on us. I wanted it to be you because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Peter puts one arm around my waist, pulls me in, and, looking down at me, he says fiercely, \u201cNeither of us wants to break up. So why should we? Because of some shit my mom said? Because your sister did it that way? You\u2019re not the same as your sister, Lara Jean. We\u2019re not the same as Margot and Sanderson or anybody else. We\u2019re you and me. And yeah, it\u2019s gonna be hard. But Lara Jean, I\u2019ll never feel for another girl what I feel for you.\u201d He says it with all the certainty only a teenage boy can have, and I have never loved him more than at this very moment.</p><p>* *</p><p>\u201cLovin\u2019 in My Baby\u2019s Eyes\u201d is playing, and Peter takes my hand and leads me out to the lawn.</p><p>We\u2019ve never danced to this kind of song before. It\u2019s the kind of song where you sway together and make a lot of eye contact and smile. It feels different, like we\u2019re already older versions of Peter and Lara Jean.</p><p>Across the dance floor, Trina and Kitty and Margot are dancing in a circle, with Grandma in the middle. Haven is dancing with my dad. She catches my eye and mouths,</p><p>He\u2019s so cute.</p><p>Peter, not my dad. He is. He is so, so cute.</p><p>I will never forget tonight, not for as long as I live. One day, if I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ll tell some young girl all my stories, just like Stormy told me hers. And I\u2019ll get to live them again.</p><p>When I\u2019m old and gray, I will look back on this night, and I will remember it just as it was.</p><p>Is.</p><p>We\u2019re still here. It\u2019s not the future yet.</p><p>* *</p><p>That night, after all the guests have gone, after the chairs have been stacked back up, and the leftovers put in the fridge, I go up to my room to change out of my dress. Sitting on the bed is my yearbook. I flip to the back of the book, and there it is, Peter\u2019s message to me.</p><p>Only, it\u2019s not a message, it\u2019s a contract.</p><p>Lara Jean and Peter\u2019s Amended Contract</p><p>Peter will write a letter to Lara Jean once a week. A real handwritten letter, not an e-mail.</p><p>Lara Jean will call Peter once a day. Preferably the last call of the night, before she goes to bed.</p><p>Lara Jean will put up a picture of Peter\u2019s choosing on her wall.</p><p>Peter will keep the scrapbook out on his desk so any interested parties will see that he is taken.</p><p>Peter and Lara Jean will always tell each other the truth, even when it\u2019s hard.</p><p>Peter will love Lara Jean with all his heart, always. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE NIGHT BEFORE I LEAVE</p><p>for college, there is a Perseids meteor shower in the forecast. It\u2019s supposed to be a good one. Peter and I are going out to the lake to watch. Kitty doesn\u2019t say so, but she wants to come too; she\u2019s dying to. Her whole body is rigid with wanting and not being able to ask. Any other time I would say yes.</p><p>When I say good-bye, her lips twist in disappointment for just a second, but she hides it well. How hard it must be to be the youngest sometimes, to be the one left behind.</p> <p>In the car I feel sick with guilt for being so possessive about my time with Peter. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s so little time left now. . . . I\u2019m a terrible big sister. Margot would have brought her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d I say. I\u2019m too ashamed to say out loud that I should have invited Kitty along.</p><p>When I come home for fall break, we\u2019ll do something the three of us. Peter and I will take her to the midnight show at the drive-in, and she\u2019ll go in her pajamas and I\u2019ll set up the backseat with a blanket for when she falls asleep. But tonight I want it to be just Peter and me, just this once. There\u2019s no use lingering in the guilt and ruining the night, when I\u2019ve already done the selfish deed. And if I am truly honest with</p><p>myself, I would do it again. That\u2019s how covetous I am of every last moment I have left with Peter. I want his eyes only on me; I want to talk only to him, to be just him and me for this little while longer. One day she\u2019ll understand. One day she\u2019ll love a boy and want to keep him all to herself and not share his attention with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWe should have let Kitty come,\u201d I burst out suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel bad too. Do you think she\u2019s mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad, probably.\u201d</p><p>But neither of us suggests turning the car around and going back to get her. We are silent, and then we are both laughing, sheepish and also relieved. Assuredly, Peter says, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring her next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d I echo. I reach over and grab his hand, and lock my fingers around his, and he locks back, and I am comforted in knowing that tonight he feels the exact same way, and there is no distance between us.</p><p>We spread a blanket out and lie side by side. The moon looks like a glacier in the navy night. So far I don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary. It looks like the normal night sky to me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve gone to the mountains,\u201d Peter says, turning his face to look at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is perfect,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway, I read that stargazing is a waiting game no matter where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have all night,\u201d he says, pulling me closer.</p><p>Sometimes I wish we\u2019d met when we were twenty-seven. Twenty-seven sounds like a good age to meet the person you\u2019re</p><p>going to spend the rest of your life with. At twenty-seven, you are still young, but hopefully you are well on your way to being the you you want to be.</p><p>But then I think, no, I wouldn\u2019t give up twelve, thirteen, sixteen, seventeen with Peter for the world. My first kiss, my first fake boyfriend, my first real boyfriend. The first boy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry. Stormy would say that that is the most monumental moment of all. She told me that that\u2019s how a boy lets you know that you\u2019re his. I think for us it was the opposite. It\u2019s how I knew he was mine.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to forget any of this. The way he\u2019s looking at me at this very moment. How, when he kisses me, I still get shivers down my back, every time. I want to hold on to everything so tight.</p><p>\u201cThe first sixth-grade assembly.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I saw you. You were sitting in the row in the front of me. I thought you were cute.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNice try.\u201d It\u2019s so endearingly Peter to make up stuff to try and sound romantic.</p><p>He keeps going. \u201cYour hair was really long and you had a headband with a bow. I always liked your hair, even back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Peter,\u201d I say, reaching up and patting him on his cheek.</p><p>He ignores me. \u201cYour backpack had your name written on it in glitter letters. I\u2019d never heard of the name Lara Jean before.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. I hot-glued those glitter letters to my backpack myself! It took me forever trying to get them straight enough. I\u2019d forgotten all about that backpack. It was my prized possession.</p><p>\u201cThe principal started picking random people to come on stage and play a game for prizes. Everybody was raising their hands, but your hair got caught in your chair and you were trying to untangle it, so you didn\u2019t get picked. I remember thinking maybe I should help you, but then I thought that would be weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you remember all that?\u201d I ask in amazement.</p><p>Smiling, he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just do.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s always saying how origin stories are important.</p><p>At college, when people ask us how we met, how will we answer them? The short story is, we grew up together. But that\u2019s more Josh\u2019s and my story. High school sweethearts? That\u2019s Peter and Gen\u2019s story. So what\u2019s ours, then?</p><p>I suppose I\u2019ll say it all started with a love letter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a splendid time,\u201d she concluded happily, \u201cand I feel that it marks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u2014L. M.
