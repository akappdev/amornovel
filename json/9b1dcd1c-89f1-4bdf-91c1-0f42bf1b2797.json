She could hear her own footfalls as she walked through it, her own heartbeat as she stared into her coffee. She could feel her fear, closer, stronger than it had ever been before. The new house was so still, the memories that her New York home had held were absent here.</p><p>She had moved to be closer to Tess. To try in some way to make up for the cruel, bitter words she had thrown at her daughter. And she had moved to live again. She had hidden from herself and from the memories of her marriage for so many years that she was feeling the deprivation in ever increasing levels. Her family was here. Her sister, her friends. They were all here. With Tess gone, the New York house was too silent, too lonely. Though this one wasn\u2019t much different today.</p><p>She still wore the cream lace dress she had chosen for the wedding, though the matching wide brimmed hat had been thrown carelessly on the embroidered chair that sat inside the front entryway. She felt lost in a way she hadn\u2019t felt in years. A loneliness she couldn\u2019t explain haunted her; needs she couldn\u2019t admit to shadowed her mind and her desires. So she thought of Tess instead.</p> <p>The wedding had been one of the most beautiful Ella had attended in her life. Her daughter, her baby, had made a gorgeous bride. The pervert she had married had looked handsome and darkly seductive.</p><p>She ran her fingers over the careful upsweep of her auburn hair, feeling the pinch of hairpins holding it in place. Her hairdresser had followed her orders to the letter. Not a strand of hair had slipped free of its mooring. Her dress hadn\u2019t creased, and her silk stockings hadn\u2019t dared slip or snag. She looked as well dressed now, six hours after the wedding, as she had when she left that morning.</p><p>Thankfully, with the move to Virginia, the damage she had done to the relationship with her daughter was healing. In her shock, in her rage, she had been hurtful to Tess. But, still, she couldn\u2019t believe what she had walked in on.</p><p>Her hands trembled as heat flooded her face. It had been Jesse, not James, but the likeness was too great. The twins were identical in nearly every way, even to their sexual preferences. Tall and distinguished, with a lean muscular build and dark toned skin that looked perpetually tanned. Thick, black hair fell along their napes, straight and glossy, tempting the women around them to touch.</p><p>Her legs trembled as she sat down at the small, walnut kitchen table. Her fingers trembled as they covered her lips. Her heart pounded with hard, driving beats within her chest. It had been her worst nightmare come to life, except her daughter played the role Ella had played within those dark visions.</p> <p>Not with Cole, but with James. And there lay the demon that lurked in her mind. Perverse, depraved. She had walked away from her marriage and the life she had fought to build because of her husband Jase\u2019s perverse desires. The light spankings she had managed to tolerate, though they had seared her with shame. Being restrained had been easier, though even then, what pleasure had filtered through the experience had been tainted by the fact that she knew, knew what was coming and she knew she couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>Her lack of submission to Jase\u2019s needs had finally broken their relationship. She hadn\u2019t been able to give him the trust, the control he needed. She had been terrified, knowing instinctively what would come next, who would come next. And she knew she would never be able to maintain her control, her sanity, if James touched her.</p><p>He had been at Tessa\u2019s wedding. He had watched her with knowing eyes, so green, so wicked, her body had pulsed with depravity. He had shaken her hand, the heat and pleasure of his touch nearly taking her breath. And all the time he had watched her, knew her, tormented her.</p><p>She stalked to the glass door that led to the cool, foliage sheltered area of the garden. The slender heels of her shoes created a hollow, lonely tap against the wood of the porch as she moved to the end of the vine-covered shelter. Her hand gripped the thick post, her nails biting into the wood as she fought her anger, her fears for her daughter.</p><p>Tess was too much like Jase. Ella had always been afraid of that, especially after the books she had found years ago, hidden in Tess\u2019s bedroom. Her desires were extreme, and evidently she had no fear of them. Unlike her mother, who fought the demons, the knowledge of her own needs.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get the image of it out of her mind. She couldn\u2019t fight the dark nightmares of James, holding her, taking her as another did. She never knew, never cared who joined them in those nightmare images, all she saw, all she knew was James.</p> <p>One day, Ella, you\u2019ll have to stop running. When you do, let me know.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d she bit out, turning and moving purposely to the house. She wasn\u2019t running, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to let him know anything.</p><p>Jase\u2019s sexual tastes had nearly ruined her life, and now they would ruin Tess\u2019s. No man could truly love a woman, truly respect her, if he allowed another to touch her, to take her.</p><p>She fought the ripple of response between her thighs. The creamy moisture that she fought to ignore, the desires she kept carefully banked, always hidden. Controlled. She couldn\u2019t let him break her, couldn\u2019t let him see her response to him. If anyone had the power to break her heart, it was James Wyman.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ignore him; she couldn\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t exist. Due to her own foolishness, he would soon be a daily part of her life. But she could handle it, she assured herself. She had spent her life practicing the careful control that had sustained her over the years. She could handle James Wyman, easily. It was all a matter of control.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It was all a matter of control. James watched as Ella Delacourte led him up the carpet-covered stairs to the bedroom he would be using while he stayed in her home. He was still amazed that she had given into Tess\u2019s request that she allow James to stay in the house until the home he was buying was ready to move into.</p><p>Her slender waist and gently flared hips drew attention to the delicate, perfect curves of her ass as she moved in front of him. Dressed in gray silk slacks and a pearl gray blouse, she was the epitome of grace and elegance. Calm, controlled...so perfectly controlled it made him itch to hear her scream. To hear that perfectly pitched voice ragged and hot, begging him to fuck her deep and hard, to take her however he wished. He wanted, needed, to break that control.</p> <p>And Ella knew it. She had been well warned years before, and he wasn\u2019t a joking man. But he was a patient man. He had waited five years for the chance at the only woman he knew that could make him think of forever. The only one he knew would challenge his mind, as well as his sexuality. If he could manage to keep from getting kicked out of the house.</p><p>He hid his grin. He knew Ella was desperate to make up for the painful words she had thrown at her daughter when she caught her sandwiched between Cole and Jesse. She had been furious, outraged, and if Jesse was right, certain at first that it was James rather than Jesse who had participated in Tess\u2019s first m\u00e9nage.</p><p>Tess, too, wanted that relationship repaired, but she also wanted her mother happy. She had been more than happy to participate in James\u2019 plot to get closer to her mother. Especially after he convinced her how long he had been waiting for the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cYou can use the kitchen and the washroom if you do your own cooking and laundry. The living room is okay for entertaining, but I have to ask that if you need overnight female companionship you rent a motel. I won\u2019t have it in my home, James.\u201d She pushed open the bedroom door before turning to face him.</p><p>She wore only a minimum of makeup today to accentuate her eyes and her graceful cheekbones. Her lips were colored with a soft dawn shade, and at the moment the lower lip appeared slightly swollen, as though she had been biting at it as she walked upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a teenager, Ella.\u201d He watched her carefully, aware that her blue eyes were a shade darker than normal, the pupils slightly dilated. He wondered if her pussy was wet, or if she had mastered control over even that part of her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of your age,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you then to get settled in. If you need anything, the house is laid out fairly simple, and everything is easy to find. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla?\u201d He stopped her as she turned for the door.</p><p>He caught the ready, tense set of her body, as though she were preparing herself for a battle. She turned back to him, her expression carefully closed, cool.</p><p>\u201cYes, James?\u201d She kept her voice well modulated, soft yet not simpering.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to come out of my room if I\u2019m a very good boy?\u201d James kept his voice low, teasing. There was no way in hell he was going to get close to her if she didn\u2019t loosen up a little.</p><p>She was wary, almost frightened of him, and she almost succeeded in hiding it. Almost. He knew her better than she knew herself in some ways. She stiffened further, her perfectly arched brows snapping into a frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for your games.\u201d Her voice was non-confrontational, but the flush along her cheekbones warned him of the coming storm. Damn, he loved pissing her off. Watching her eyes glitter in ire, her pale cheeks flushing so prettily. It gave him a glimpse of what she would look like in passion.</p><p>He tilted his head curiously. \u201cShame. Tess assured me you would welcome my company. I\u2019m feeling as though I\u2019m putting you out, Ella. Perhaps I should stay in a hotel until the house is ready.\u201d</p><p>For a moment\u2014a very brief, infuriating moment\u2014satisfaction glittered in her eyes, until she remembered Tess and her promise to make James comfortable. Her lips thinned as she drew in a deep, careful breath. The smile that she pasted on her face had little to do with warmth; it damned near caused frostbite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfectly welcome, James. Tess\u2019s little friends are always welcome in my home, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Little friends? He chuckled silently. She was finding every opportunity to remind him that he was several years younger than she was. The six years made little difference to him. As a matter of fact, it seemed perfect. An older man would never keep up with the passions he knew ran beneath that cool exterior.</p><p>He allowed a smile to curve his lips as he stared at her intently. \u201cLittle friends? I\u2019m hardly that young, Ella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far from it,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI have work to do, James. Make yourself at home, and perhaps I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>But not if she could help it.</p><p>\u201cWhat type of work?\u201d He stopped her again. \u201cI was unaware you worked. Jase should have given you a very healthy settlement from the divorce.\u201d By God, if he hadn\u2019t, James would be talking to him about it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d She frowned again. \u201cWhat I do, James, I do for my own pleasure and how Jase decided to pay me for the divorce is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>Pay her for the divorce? James was damned well aware that she was much less than happy in that marriage, yet she sounded bitter, rejected. Had she cared more for Jase than he had once thought? That idea didn\u2019t set well in his mind, or in his heart.</p><p>\u201cElla, you weren\u2019t happy, and neither was Jase,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to discuss this with you.\u201d She straightened her shoulders majestically, her lips thinning as her anger grew. \u201cI don\u2019t mind your presence here, James, but I don\u2019t have time to entertain you. You\u2019ll have to find your amusements elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said no women.\u201d She stopped again as she turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo women.\u201d She shook her head tightly, her voice strained. \u201cNot in my home, James. Never again in my home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cYou know, you need a housekeeper or a cook.\u201d James\u2019 voice early the next afternoon had her jumping in startled awareness as she finished filling the coffeepot. She turned, facing him, thinking what a shame it was that one man would have such sexual presence.</p><p>He stood propped against the doorway, dressed in dark blue silk slacks and a lighter blue silk shirt. His jacket was held at his shoulder by the crook of his finger, and his green eyes regarded her with lustful secrets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of cooking my own meals and cleaning my home.\u201d She shrugged. She had been raised to do for herself, and cleaning gave her something to do, a way to occupy her hands when her body was filled with restless energy.</p><p>He straightened from the doorframe, walking to the table with a casual male grace that threatened to take her breath. She turned quickly from him, moving to the cabinet to retrieve her coffee cup. She fought to still her shaking hands, the nervousness in her stomach that wouldn\u2019t seem to go away. She felt immature, like a quaking child before him. It was...unbalancing.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you became busy? Or found a lover?\u201d he asked her then.</p><p>Ella fought back her panic. She felt aged, past the time when she could have worried about the future, or a man in her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a lover, James.\u201d She poured her coffee, moving with what she hoped was casual unconcern to the work isle in the center of the room.</p><p>She leaned her hip against it, lowering her head as she concentrated on stirring cream and sugar into the dark liquid. She was aware that he was watching her, his eyes dark, intent. She was well aware of his desire for her; a desire she knew wouldn\u2019t last beyond the moment. She had no illusions about herself. She was growing older, and her body was slowly showing the signs of it. It wasn\u2019t something she worried much about, until she was faced with James. He made her feel young, made her feel desired, and it was dangerous to allow herself to be convinced that it could go further. Too dangerous for her heart.</p><p>She watched as he laid the jacket over the back of a chair then moved to the cabinet and snagged a cup for himself. His arm reached up, muscles bunching in his shoulders and back. She shivered, her hands itching to touch him, to feel the strength of motion beneath his flesh.</p><p>He turned back to her, leaning against the counter as he regarded her quizzically. \u201cDo you have a lover?\u201d</p><p>His voice was whisky rough and dark. It caused arousal to zip along her nerve endings, her skin to become sensitive, needy for his touch. She hated it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really none of your business.\u201d She fought to stay in control. He would leave soon; she knew Jase depended on him at the corporate offices. Not that she understood any of the legal talk she had ever heard in the past, but his job, she knew, was complicated and often required late nights and full days. She was hoping that would keep him out of her hair for the most part.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to make it my business.\u201d His voice hardened imperceptibly as he watched her, his gaze brooding.</p><p>Ella couldn\u2019t stop the surprise that she knew was reflected on her face. She blinked over at him, her chest tightening in unwanted excitement, her vagina throbbing in unwanted preparation for his touch.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to?\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand his desire for her in any way. \u201cI\u2019m not in the market for complications, James. A lover is, by his very nature, a complication.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, his lips quirking in amusement as she raised the coffee cup to her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever get horny, Ella?\u201d She nearly dropped the cup. The coffee she had just taken into her mouth threatened to choke her as it went down the wrong way.</p><p>She wheezed, her eyes widening, tearing as she stared at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d she bit out when she could breathe again. \u201cIs that any of your business, in any way, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it is.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders with deceptive laziness. \u201cI want you, Ella. I want to lay you down and touch you in all the ways a man can. I want to fuck you until you\u2019re screaming out in agony, because it feels so damned good it hurts. So yeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>The breath lodged in her throat. She felt her cunt cream, her thighs tremble at the thought of him powering into her, fucking her as she screamed. She had never screamed, never wanted anything desperately enough to beg. But she couldn\u2019t have James. Anger, directed at herself, at him, poured through her.</p><p>She felt her face flush, her body tremble, as she fought for control.</p><p>\u201cSorry, James.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cI\u2019m really not in the market for a toy boy this year. I guess you just lucked out.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him time to reply. Before he could cut her down, before he could tempt her further, she swept from the room, rushing to the safety of her bedroom where her control wasn\u2019t as important. Where it wouldn\u2019t matter if the tears that filled her eyes escaped. All that mattered was that James didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t survive this. Ella escaped to her bedroom, locked the door clumsily behind her and stood against it, breathing raggedly. She was flushed, heated, her body tingling. She hated it.</p><p>Her fists clenched as she felt her vagina spasm, growing wetter by the second as she remembered the sound of his dark, velvet voice. The deep baritone stroked over her senses then plunged heatedly into her womb. How was she supposed to maintain her control this way? She despised the person she had been while married to Jase. She had acted like a harpy, her fury and fears driving her to rages that had terrified her.</p><p>For years. Years she had fought him and what he wanted from her. Because she had known how much he wanted from her. The sexual excesses he enjoyed. She pressed her fists to her stomach, fighting the driving, insidious images that pounded at her brain. She could have tolerated it, she told herself. She could have allowed herself to let go if she hadn\u2019t known the man who would eventually arrive.</p><p>Jase was nothing if not honest. He had never lied to her when his sexuality had begun emerging. They had been in their early twenties, and his need to dominate, to control her sexual responses had at first seemed merely harmless play. He hated her controlled sexuality. Her fear of letting go, of giving him the responsibility of pleasing her.</p><p>Ella had hated his need for it. She had married him because she was pregnant. She had cared for him, had felt a warmth and gentle desire for him, but what he needed she had never wanted. Until she met James. Until she saw in his wicked, knowing eyes, the truth about herself.</p><p>God, he had been twenty-six, and she was already in her thirties. She had felt like a cradle robber, looking at him, feeling her pussy gush with moisture, her breasts swelling in desire. And then, she had begun to fantasize. When Jase took her, his cock burrowing into her as he held her to the bed, she imagined it was James.</p><p>When he tied her to the bed, her nipples would bead instantly as she thought of James tying her down, thought of James tormenting her body, driving her ragged with need. And when Jase had suggested a m\u00e9nage, she had thought of James, yet still pretended her husband wasn\u2019t truly serious.</p><p>Until the day James had walked into the room Jase had set up for his play. Tied to the narrow bed, her legs gaped open, as Jase grew more and more frustrated over her lack of response. James had walked in, his brilliant eyes going to her smooth, bare pussy and she had creamed instantly. She had fought Jase, vowing to never allow him to touch her again. The screaming match that ensued lasted for years. Until the divorce.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand it. For years she had pushed her own needs back, fought to forget James and the terrible desires that raged through her system. Until she walked in and saw Tess with Jesse, James\u2019 twin brother. Betrayal had sliced through her soul. And Jesse, damn his black heart, had known. She had seen it in his eyes, in the sardonic lift of his mouth.</p><p>Her hand raised to one throbbing breast as the ache in her nipples seemed to only grow. Her fingers glanced over the hard point beneath the silk blouse and sheer bra she wore. Her breath caught on a gasp at the electrified pleasure that washed over her.</p><p>She felt her pussy cream furiously, spilling the thick essence along her bare cunt lips. Jase had started her habit of shaving there. It was one of the few things he had taught her that she was thankful for. Until now. Now, the incredible sensitivity of her bare inner lips was a curse. She could feel her juices, hot and slick, coating her flesh as they eased from her vagina, and it only made her ache more.</p><p>How was she going to bear having him in her house? Her arms wrapped around her waist as her womb clenched. He hadn\u2019t been here an hour yet and already she could think of nothing but his touch moving over her, his hands stroking her, spanking her... She whimpered. She didn\u2019t want that, she cried silently, couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cElla, you in there? I\u2019m ordering lunch, how do you feel about pizza?\u201d He knocked on her door, startling her into jumping away from it with a tight gasp.</p><p>God, wasn\u2019t he ever going to leave for work? Surely he wouldn\u2019t be here for lunch. She couldn\u2019t handle it.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She was horrified at the husky, needy quality of her voice. She cleared her throat and swallowed tightly. \u201cI\u2019m tired. You eat. I\u2019m going to lay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, come out and talk to me,\u201d he cajoled, his voice soft, filled with such wicked promises she had to bite her lip to keep from calling him to her. \u201cIt\u2019s just pizza, nothing else.\u201d Amusement was like a dark vein of sin in his tone.</p><p>She glanced at the clock, then the bedside window. She could find no reasonable excuse to stay hidden in her room, and she knew if she continued to refuse it would only make him suspicious.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she bit out, feeling her nails piercing the skin of her palms. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a while. I need to freshen up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting on you. Don\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Ella tore desperately at her clothes to remove them. She was too hot, too aroused to go to him like this. If she didn\u2019t find relief, no matter how minute, she would burn in flames of desire if he so much as brushed against her.</p><p>She jerked the drawer of her bedside table open and pulled out the slender, slim line vibrator she had purchased years ago. The soft, supple latex flexed in her palm as she stretched out on her bed. It wasn\u2019t thick or long, but buying the damned thing had been one of the hardest things she had ever done in her life.</p><p>Her body was already primed, her cunt so wet and sticky that when she ran her fingers through the narrow slit, it clung to her fingers. Her clit was swollen, so large and sensitive she gasped as she circled it with the head of the slender dildo. She eased the control switch on the vibration up, shuddering as the device began to hum.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t still her gasp of breath as she slid it into the hungry opening of her pussy. Her muscles closed on it, relishing in the hum, but still greedy for more. She pushed it deeper, feeling the sensitive tissue part for the invader.</p><p>Ella writhed on the bed, her eyes clenched tightly closed as the fingers of her other hand gripped one of her tight, elongated nipples and pinched lightly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t groan, she told herself. She couldn\u2019t cry out his name as she had done since seeing him at the wedding and agreeing to let him stay. She couldn\u2019t pretend it was James pushing inside her wet pussy, fucking her tight depths. But she couldn\u2019t help it either. Her mind formed the image. His body hard and muscular, his cock thick and long as it pushed inside her.</p><p>Her control weakened as a small whimper escaped her throat. It wasn\u2019t going to be enough. Oh God, she could feel it, the weakness of her body, the incredible arousal searing her nerve endings. She would never achieve a climax hard enough to still the raging pain.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, Ella.\u201d The words were like a splash of cold water.</p><p>Her eyes flew open to see James, fully dressed, his green eyes glowing with lust as he stared down at her nude, perspiring body. From her breasts to her still slender thighs, spread invitingly as she moved the vibrating dildo inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Embarrassment washed over her as she realized he really was standing there, watching her. He was real this time, not a figment of her imagination.</p><p>She would have jumped from the bed if James hadn\u2019t moved to stop her, pinning her shoulders to the mattress as he forced her legs closed holding the vibrator inside her pussy as he stared down at her, his powerful legs clamped on the outside of hers as she stared up at him in horror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes were dark, wicked, his expression filled with sensuality, with lust. Her legs were clamped together as his fingers moved to the control box at her side and he thumbed the power up to its highest level.</p><p>Her body jerked in response as the heat flared higher, hotter inside her tormented depths.</p><p>\u201cWho do you imagine inside you, Ella?\u201d His voice was deep, rough. \u201cWho\u2019s fucking that tight pussy for you, in your mind?\u201d</p><p>The deep baritone of his voice stroked over her nerve endings, sending her senses into overdrive. Her hips jerked in reflex, her clit pulsing, throbbing in reaction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she cried out, fighting the pleasure as he forced her wrists into one broad hand, holding her securely as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs it me, Ella?\u201d he asked her softly. \u201cDo I fuck you in your fantasies? I sure as hell fuck you in mine. Hard and deep, Ella, but my cock is a hell of a lot thicker than that baby pecker you picked. When I push inside you, you\u2019re going to be so damned tight you\u2019ll come from the pleasure/pain alone. Come for me now, Ella. Come for me baby, so we can discuss this rationally.\u201d</p><p>Ella couldn\u2019t bear it. His voice was enough to make her juices flood her pussy, making the vibration echo along her sensitized flesh.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She fought to hold onto her control. She couldn\u2019t do this. It was too horrifying, too humiliating. Dear God, how had he opened a locked door?</p><p>He leaned closer, his legs loosening from around hers, his hand moving between their bodies as he watched her. She twisted against him as he forced his hand between her slick thighs and gripped the end of the dildo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, Ella.\u201d He pulled it back as she cried out, staring up at him, seeing his grimace of hot, desperate lust. \u201cLike this.\u201d The vibrator was thrust into her pussy, squishing through the thick juices, pounding into her womb as he began to fuck her hard and fast with her own dildo.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Her body stiffened as ripples of electricity began to flare through her womb. She could have survived it. She fought for control and it was nearly in her grasp when his head lowered to her nipples.</p><p>It had been nearly a decade since a man had touched her. Nearly ten years of fantasizing about this, aching and dreaming of his dominate touch. When his teeth gripped her nipple, his tongue rasping over it as he fucked the vibrator hard and deep inside her pussy, she lost all sense of control.</p><p>An orgasm unlike anything she had ever known ripped through her body. She felt the juices spray from her pussy as James groaned, fucking her harder with the latex toy, pushing her thighs apart and heading for her clit. When his lips covered it, his tongue stroked it, she screamed. Her hips arched, her pussy greedily sucking at the vibrator as her clit exploded, and she was flung into a vortex of pleasure that horrified her with its force.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t stop. Her upper body jerked from the bed as her muscles contracted, her pussy exploding so hard, so deep, every bone and muscle spasmed in response. She shuddered, feeling the muscles tightening on the vibration inside her as she shook in the grip of her orgasm.</p><p>Moments, hours later she collapsed to the bed again, though her womb continued to contract in deep, hard surges as the thick cream flowed from between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d James soothed her gently and she realized she was crying. His lips feathered over her cheek as he slowly lowered the speed of the vibrator, bringing her back to sanity. She could smell the slight earthy scent of her pussy on his lips, and shuddered at the knowledge of it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cEase back to me, Ella. It\u2019s okay now.\u201d He eased back to look at her as the tears welled from her eyes, pouring down her cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Ella,\u201d he whispered gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, it\u2019s what we both needed for now.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, fighting now to be free of him, to remove the proof of her need, her own perversions from the dripping channel between her thighs. She rolled to her side to escape him, but before she could get away, he pushed her down again, on her stomach, the vibrator once again trapped inside her quaking flesh.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ella.\u201d His voice was hard, tight with lust as his hand smoothed over the quivering cheeks of her rear. \u201cYou won\u2019t run from it, and by God, I won\u2019t let you hide from it any longer.\u201d His fingers ran down the cleft of her ass as he hummed in approval.</p><p>The juices that flowed from her pussy had slicked the area, giving his fingers greater ease despite the tightening of her muscles.</p><p>\u201cJames. No,\u201d she cried out as he circled the tight opening of her anus. Horror and shame streaked through her system, because despite her embarrassment, she could feel the entrance relaxing, her betraying body sucking at the tip of his finger.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He was breathing hard at her ear, his chest laboring under his breaths. \u201cFor now, Ella. I\u2019ll leave you, this time. But you have fifteen minutes to bring that pretty ass out to the living room where we can discuss this with relative sanity. You will not run, Ella. You will not hide. You\u2019ve come in my mouth now, and I\u2019ll be damned, but I won\u2019t wait much longer to feel you coming around my cock. Fifteen minutes.</p><p>He moved quickly from her, stalking to the door. \u201cAnd the next fucking time you try to lock a door against me, I\u2019ll break the son of a bitch down. Fifteen minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>James was shaking as he stalked to the pristine, perfectly organized living room. His hands, his entire body, were nearly shuddering in reaction, in lust and need, and he feared the loss of his own control. Never. In his entire sexual life his own control had never been so sorely tempted as it had been in Ella\u2019s bed, watching her push that pitiful excuse for a dildo inside her tight pussy.</p><p>The vibrating toy was slender, soft to the touch, a teaser. A toy to use to drive her to distraction and make her hungry for more, and she didn\u2019t even know it. But he intended to do his best to instruct her on the best toys for the job. The job of preparing her, opening her, driving her insane for his final possession.</p><p>Jerking the cell phone from his waistband he made a quick call. His eyes watched the door carefully as he put in the order to the online supplier of adult products. A collection of toys, of devices, and he alone would show her the proper use of them.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have long. It would take her five minutes, he guessed, to work herself up. Another five to struggle back into her clothing as she fought the lethargy of her orgasm. Damn. He shook his head as he gave the owner of the adult products store the list. Damn, she had climaxed like nothing he had ever seen. Her pussy had gripped that dildo so tight, so hard, he\u2019d had to struggle to fuck her through the rippling pleasure.</p><p>He had watched her abdomen, seeing the convulsive shudders of her womb beneath her flesh as she cried out his name. But she hadn\u2019t screamed it, and he swore before the week was over, she was going to scream his name.</p><p>He had just flipped the phone close and pushed it back in its slim holder when she stormed into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou dirty son of a bitch!\u201d she screamed with rage and fear. \u201cYou dirty, perverted bastard. This is my home. Mine. And you can fucking leave now.\u201d</p><p>No control. She flew at him, her face flushed, murder in her eyes, intent on knocking the hell out of him. He didn\u2019t think so. He had seen that bruise Jase had sported for a week years before their divorce.</p><p>Before she could land the blow he grabbed her wrists, shackling them together in one hand behind her back. His arm went around her waist and he jerked her against him. Before she could curse him again, his lips slanted over hers.</p><p>She bit at him, but he nipped at her lip warningly a second before his tongue plunged into her mouth. She was heat and anger, and desperate, hungry lust. She groaned into the kiss, fighting his hold though her lips opened for his tongue, then suckled it tight into her mouth.</p><p>James groaned, his cock jerking beneath his zipper at the thought of her mouth enclosing it in such hot pleasure. But for now, his mouth had her, and the taste of her was indescribable. Sweet and warm, filled with the heady, aroused whimpers of a woman overcome with her own desires, pleasured, hungry for more.</p><p>He allowed his tongue to stroke the inside of her mouth, to twine with hers as his head slanted, angling closer to allow his lips to stroke hers. She was trembling in his arms, and he knew her pussy would be dripping, wet and aching. And tight. He groaned at the thought of that as he lifted her closer. She had been so tight on that damned slender vibrator that he could barely fuck her with it. She would strangle his cock. His body tensed, his tongue fucking her mouth as she growled in greedy passion beneath his kiss.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get enough of her. She arched to him, her breasts unconfined beneath the loose silk shirt she wore, her pants-covered thighs plastered to his as she pressed her mound hard against the thick erection beneath his slacks. The soft cotton pants she wore would do her little good, he promised himself. She would soak them with the juices from her sweet little cunt just as she had the silk slacks.</p><p>With a muttered groan he pulled back from the kiss and stared into her face. Her eyes were dazed, her expression slack with sensual need. He could have her now if he was willing to take her. To give her no time for thought, to allow her to believe he had forced the control from her as he had in the bedroom. That would only hurt his intent. It would do nothing to further his own personal goals.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled, holding onto her as he pushed her into the recliner at his side. \u201cSit there. And don\u2019t get up, Ella, or I promise, you\u2019ll regret it,\u201d he warned her as she made to do just that.</p><p>Evidently she heard the strain of his own fight for control in his voice. She pressed herself tighter against the back of the chair, staring up at him with wide eyes.</p><p>James drew in a tight breath. His cock throbbed beneath his pants, pleading for a touch, no matter how timid, no matter how forced. He gritted his teeth and moved back from her.</p><p>\u201cTen years,\u201d he bit out, watching her broodingly. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for ten years, Ella, and I\u2019m tired of fighting it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, shock darkening her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Her voice was thready, desperate.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s more than possible.\u201d Disgust welled inside him. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you until I could barely breathe, ever since I walked into that damned house of Jase\u2019s and saw all that careful control as you fought to give him at least part of what he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed and her eyes looked wild.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I couldn\u2019t see who you were, Ella? Every time I saw you, you watched me as though you were terrified. Your nipples would harden, your face would flush, and I knew you wanted me. Me, Ella. And I fought it, fought it just as fucking hard as you did until I walked into that playroom.\u201d</p><p>He remembered it clearly. Seeing her strapped down on the cot, unaroused, but trying, as Jase fought to pleasure her. He had seen her small cunt; dry yet looking so soft, so tender, as Jase touched it. Then she had seen him. She had fought Jase, screaming at him, crying, but James had watched her cunt. And within seconds it had glistened, her juices spreading over the delicate lips.</p><p>He had left. Turned and stalked from the room because he couldn\u2019t stand to see her lying there, crying brokenly as she cursed her husband. Jase had given up. He hadn\u2019t loved her, and James knew it. What he needed sexually drove him, until he began to bring other women to his bed as his wife moved to the solitary comfort of a downstairs bedroom.</p><p>Never in my home. Never again, she had said earlier. He had seen the humiliation flash in her gaze. Jase had brought other women to her home, had taken them to his bed, destroying the pride that was so much a part of her.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave.\u201d Her voice quivered as she crossed her arms beneath her breasts, refusing to look at him. \u201cI want you to leave now.\u201d</p><p>James snorted. \u201cDo you enjoy wasting your breath, Ella? You don\u2019t want me to leave. You\u2019re just too fucking scared for me to stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head desperately.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he all but snarled. \u201cProve it then. Stand up, Ella, and drop those pants. Let me sink my fingers into that tight cunt and see if you\u2019re still wet and ready for me, because I bet you are. I bet you would come again, Ella...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She jerked to her feet, her voice raspy, hoarse. \u201cYou\u2019re younger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you harder than any man your own age could ever hope to.\u201d He stood in front of her, staring down at her furiously. \u201cBetter yet, Ella, I\u2019ll fuck you like you need it. I\u2019ll make all those nasty little fantasies of yours reality, and then I\u2019ll teach you some you could have never imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t listen to this,\u201d she raged heatedly. \u201cI let you come into my house as a guest...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll come in your pussy as your lover,\u201d he bit out, breaking over her outraged declaration. \u201cYour pussy, your mouth, your ass. Wherever I can get my cock in, Ella, I\u2019ll fuck you until I can fill every inch of your body with my cum.\u201d</p><p>She collapsed back in the chair. He could see her trembling, fighting herself as well as him.</p><p>\u201cBut we both know it\u2019s not that easy, don\u2019t we, baby?\u201d He stooped in front of her, his hands going to the button of her pants. \u201cWe both know that what I want will be more intense, and a hell of a lot more serious than anything Jase ever asked of you, and that\u2019s what\u2019s scaring the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d Her hand covered his as her voice broke. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what, Ella?\u201d he asked her, tenderness\u2014fuck, love\u2014welling inside him so deep, so strong it nearly strangled him. \u201cDon\u2019t give you what you need? Don\u2019t satisfy your fantasies, your desires? Don\u2019t show you how damned good it\u2019s going to hurt when my cock pushes inside your tight pussy? Sorry, baby, but I think I just reached the end of my control. I won\u2019t let you run anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ella watched James, seeing the determination in his eyes, the lust that flushed his face, tightened his features, and she couldn\u2019t find the words to fight him. She trembled before him instead, her body still weak, still vibrating in longing after the climax he had given her earlier. She needed more. Her thighs trembled, her cunt gushing her juices as she tried to find a way to make him leave.</p><p>She could make him. She could call the police and he wouldn\u2019t stop her. She could have him thrown out. She could scream if she could find the breath after that kiss. But she knew she couldn\u2019t bear to see him dragged away. Couldn\u2019t bear the humiliation she knew he would face. But she couldn\u2019t give in to him either. She wouldn\u2019t give in to him. At least, not entirely.</p><p>\u201cJust us,\u201d she finally whispered, trembling. \u201cJust sex.\u201d</p><p>His whole body tightened. She had expected him to finish removing her pants, to give her what she needed. She didn\u2019t expect him to draw away from her.</p><p>\u201cI take control,\u201d he said broodingly. \u201cWhatever I want to give you, Ella, however I want to give it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy terms,\u201d she bit out desperately, then watched in horror as he shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ella. My terms as my woman. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>My terms as my woman. Your choice. The words resounded in her head that night and all the next day. James was the head corporate lawyer for Delacourte Electronics, and with the growth of Jase\u2019s business, she knew he often put in long hours working, both in the office and at home, she guessed. That left the house silent and lonely that next day.</p><p>She wandered through the rooms, tired from the restlessness of her sleep the night before, and torn between her desires and his. She remembered clearly Jase\u2019s demented sexual games. Not that any of them made sense to her at the time. What was the purpose in tying a woman down? Unless your fantasy was rape, which he always swore wasn\u2019t true. She hadn\u2019t had a clue until James walked into that damned room and stared with flaring lust at her naked, bound body.</p><p>Ella remembered, clearly, her own agonizing humiliation. Spread open while her husband touched her, as she fought to find arousal in the game he wanted to play. But there had been none. Nothing until James\u2019 eyes had centered on her thighs, spearing past her boredom with an instant, flaring heat. She had creamed herself in seconds, and the terror that Jase, or even James would realize it, had nearly destroyed her.</p><p>She sighed morosely as she walked out to the back porch and threw herself into one of the padded loungers there. The late afternoon sun was passing over, but beneath the cool shelter of the low trees and thick vines that wrapped around the porch, Ella was spared the blinding heat. The outer heat. Her inner heat was killing her.</p> <p>She had finally given up on changing panties. After the second pair, she had thrown her hands up in disgust and stopped. After ten years of no sexual activity, of fighting her desires and her needs, her body was evidently taking over. It wouldn\u2019t stop producing the hot, slick fluid that would ease James\u2019 entrance into her tight pussy. And it was tight. She shuddered in longing. Tight and greedy, anxious to feel James\u2019 thick, hard cock sliding into it.</p><p>She was losing her mind. She closed her eyes as she tightened her thighs against the empty ache in the center of her body. Her vibrator had disappeared. She didn\u2019t know how, or why, but somehow James had managed to steal it, or hide it, because it was no place to be found. And she needed it.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty there, Ella.\u201d She jumped as James stepped to the doorway, staring at her with those hot, sin-filled eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\u2019re supposed to be working.\u201d She would have jumped from the lounge chair if he hadn\u2019t moved to stand in front of it.</p><p>She stared up at him, fighting to control her breathing as well as the desire that shook her to her soul.</p><p>\u201cI took the rest of the day off.\u201d He shrugged his broad shoulders as he pushed his hands into the pockets of his pants. The action only drew attention to the thick ridge beneath the material. \u201cIs your pussy wet?\u201d</p><p>Ella blinked as the question took her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d her voice squeaked in shock.</p><p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d he growled. \u201cMake me crazier. It\u2019s your chance for revenge, Ella. Tell me how wet your pussy is.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, breathing fast and hard as she seriously considered the request.</p><p>\u201cGo back to work,\u201d she finally whispered desperately, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cElla, remember how nice I was to you yesterday when my mouth sucked that sweet little clit of yours?\u201d</p><p>How could she forget?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to break into my room, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to suck my cock like that, Ella. While you\u2019re tied belly down on my bed, my cock thrusting slow and easy in your mouth and I inflate the plug I\u2019m going to push up your sweet, virgin ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Why are you doing this to me?\u201d Her pussy was gushing between her thighs, so hot it felt blistered by her need. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, James, surely you can find someone to fuck. Do you have to torture me this way?\u201d</p><p>She pushed her fingers through her loose hair, feeling the silky strands brush her shoulders, almost shivering at the caress against her ultra sensitive flesh. She was being driven crazy, and he knew it. Maybe it was some kind of messed up mid-life crisis, she thought desperately. Because she knew her own arousal had never tormented her to this degree. It was hell and she wanted it to stop. She wanted him to leave. Or did she?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t waste my breath answering that question,\u201d he bit out as he stooped down at the end of the lounger. \u201cYou want to control it, Ella? Do you really think you can?\u201d</p><p>He was so handsome he broke her heart. Hard and toned, his body muscular and so filled with male grace that it took her breath every time she looked at him. And his face, arrogant with just a touch of the aristocratic in his strong, straight nose and superior expression.</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019m asking you to stop this.\u201d Her heart was racing out of control. How was she supposed to deny him when her body ached so desperately for him?</p><p>He was like a fever in her blood. As long as she stayed away from him, she could survive it. But now, with his desire for her so clear, her needs raging through her body, she couldn\u2019t find the will to resist him. She was weak. She admitted it and she hated it. Hated the emotional and physical responses that she couldn\u2019t fight any longer.</p><p>\u201cLay back for me, Ella,\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cLay back, and let me show you what I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>Ella watched him helplessly. Her body was tense, demanding action. Demanding that she do as he ask and lay back in the lounger for him. She watched as his tongue touched his sensual lips, as though anticipating a meal, and she knew what he wanted. Knew what he would do to her. Her pussy gushed in response.</p><p>She whimpered as he moved, his hands reaching for her arms, pulling them gently, taking the support she used to keep her body upright as he released the back support of the lounger. He lowered her until her back rested on the flat surface.</p><p>Ella stared up at him, trembling, hating the weakness that flooded her body. Damn him. He was so assured, so sensual, so damned tempting she could barely keep her senses intact.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d Her breath caught in arousal as his fingers went to the tiny buttons of her bodice. Her breasts were unbound beneath the fabric, her nipples hard, on fire for his touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of touching you, Ella,\u201d he whispered, his green eyes darkening, the thick black lashes lowering sensually over the wicked orbs. \u201cAched to taste you. Do you have any idea the hell I\u2019ve gone through for the last ten years, wanting to hear you scream my name as you climax for me?\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped her lips as the last button of the dress came free, and he was able to spread the edges apart with slow deliberation. Her body was laid out before him then, only the thin silk of her panties left to cover the front of her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet for me, Ella,\u201d he whispered, his eyes centering on the pale green triangle of fabric. \u201cAnd you still shave your pretty pussy, don\u2019t you? When my tongue caresses it, laps up all that thick cream, you\u2019ll feel every soft touch, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His hand spread her legs slowly. Ella gripped the sides of the lounger, watching him, mesmerized by the sensuality in his expression, the hunger reflected in his eyes, in the curve of his lips.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d She whispered his name, her voice rough, pleading as she caught his hands when they moved to the band of her panties. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish the sentence, couldn\u2019t force the words past her lips.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t what, baby?\u201d he asked her gently, his fingers hooking in the elastic, pulling her panties down, away from her weak grip. \u201cCan\u2019t lay back and feel good for me? Can\u2019t see if what we\u2019ve waited for all these years isn\u2019t as good as our imaginations? Why can\u2019t you do that?\u201d</p><p>He was hypnotizing her, she thought desperately. Stealing her will with the sound of his deep, rough voice. Making her crazy for him with that dark, hooded look.</p><p>She trembled as he removed the scrap of silk then spread her legs wider. All the while he watched her from the side of the lounger, his chest moving hard and fast, as he seemed to fight for breath himself, his eyes darkening lustfully.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Ella, you\u2019re prettier than I ever imagined.\u201d His hand moved up her thigh until his fingers grazed the desperate heat and thick juices that coated her cunt. The proof of her weakness. The proof that she was just as depraved, just as perverted as Jase had been, because she knew, knew beyond a shadow of a doubt exactly what James wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She jerked from him, moving before he could stop her, stumbling from the lounger then rushing desperately away from him. Away from her own needs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Jumping to her feet, she rushed to her bedroom, fighting her tears, her fears. James\u2019 voice was dark, angry behind her, spurring her forward, making her heart beat in dread. If he touched her again, asked her again, she wouldn\u2019t be able to refuse him. He was her weakness. He was her sin.</p><p>She slammed the door behind her, then fought to drag the suitcase from her closet. She couldn\u2019t stand it. If he wouldn\u2019t leave, then she would. He could have the fucking house. Do whatever the hell he wanted. She couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She ignored her dress as it flared away from the front of her body, ignored her nakedness beneath it. She had to leave, had to get away from him.</p><p>Bent over, her mind centered on pulling the damned case from the small utility closet, she was unaware that James had followed her until he burst into the bedroom, gripped her hips and tossed her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she screeched as she came to her knees, clutching the sides of her dress. Her eyes widened as she watched him undress. Slowly. Watching her with narrowed, intent eyes.</p><p>The air in the bedroom heated, thinned, until she had to fight for breath. She sat on her knees, gripping the edges of her dress together, fighting just to breathe as each article of clothing was dropped to the floor, until he wore nothing but his own brazen sexuality.</p><p>Dear God. He was naked. All dark, sleek skin and toned muscle. Especially the bulging length of his cock. It was thick and hard, the head flared and appearing bruised, it was so engorged with blood. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes from it, couldn\u2019t stop the whimper that escaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cFirst lesson,\u201d he growled dominantly, his voice brooking no refusal. \u201cTake your dress off and lay down on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d She repeated her earlier question.</p><p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d he bit out, his hand going to the engorged flesh rising between his thighs. She watched, mesmerized, as his fingers stroked the hard cock. \u201cSo it might be best to placate me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the dresser and picked up the articles she hadn\u2019t seen until then, in one hand. He must have placed them there before coming to her on the back porch.</p><p>The first looked like a slender cock, the middle thinner than the flared head, with a hose and bulb leading from the base. With it was a small tube of gel lubrication. In the other hand, he picked up the leather wrist and ankle restraints. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your ass, eventually,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cWhile I\u2019m fucking your sweet mouth and your tight little pussy, I\u2019m going to be preparing your ass to take me. The inflatable plug will take care of that. \u201c</p><p>Inflatable? How much did it inflate? It already looked too damned big to her.</p><p>\u201cJames, please.\u201d She shook her head, reduced to pleading. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me. I don\u2019t think I can bear it.\u201d Physically she was dying for it, emotionally, she was terrified.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start out easy.\u201d He wasn\u2019t asking her, he was demanding. \u201cUndress and lie on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the restraints. \u201cWhy do you have to tie me down?\u201d</p><p>He laid everything at the bottom of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about control.\u201d He eased the straps of her sundress from her shoulders. \u201cThe one losing it, the one possessing it. My pleasure, Ella, comes from yours. But you think you have to control that pleasure. Fight it. I want you restrained, unable to run from me, unable to fight what I need to give you. I want you to lose that control that keeps you locked inside your own fears.\u201d She trembled as the material of her dress skimmed her swollen breasts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she whispered, almost groaning as his lips feathered her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf your pussy doesn\u2019t get wet and hot for me, if your body doesn\u2019t scream out for more, then I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll know if it\u2019s not right for you.\u201d The dress fell to the bed behind her. \u201cNow, lie down for me, on your stomach first.\u201d</p><p>Ella licked her lips. God she wanted him. She had controlled it with Jase, no matter the fantasies of James that had tormented her. Surely she could control her heart, if nothing else.</p> <p>Shaken, weakened by her own desires, her own fantasies, she did as he ordered.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been taken anally, Ella?\u201d he asked her then. \u201cNot a plug, but by Jase, or anyone else?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, careful to keep her face buried in the blankets of the bed. He attached the leather restraints to her legs first, the small links of the chains rattling as he secured them to the short bedposts. He moved then to her wrists. His hands were gentle, caressing, the leather cool as he secured it above each hand before securing the chains to the headboard.</p><p>She was spread out. Though there was some slack in the chains, she wouldn\u2019t be able to go far if she did move. She shuddered, dragging in air with a sense of desperation as her arousal intensified. Never with Jase had she felt the trepidation and searing desire that she did now. As though she had known Jase was no threat to her, neither emotionally nor sexually, but James was. He could destroy her. If she let him.</p><p>\u201cSo nice,\u201d he whispered as he moved back to the bottom of the bed, moving between her spread thighs.</p><p>His hands ran up the backs of her thighs as she trembled beneath his touch. Long-fingered and broad, his hands were warm and slightly calloused, creating an exciting friction on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI used to hide and watch you whenever I saw you out in public,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI knew you would run if you saw me, and I loved watching you move, Ella. Watching the sweet curves of you ass flex, the line of your back, the tilt of your head. I would drink the sight of you in.\u201d</p><p>Ella\u2019s hands clenched in the blankets beneath her as his hands cupped the lower curves of her rear, spreading her apart sensually. She could feel her cunt, drenched and hot, rippling with convulsive shudders of need. She couldn\u2019t stop the involuntary flexing of her buttocks, or the little whimper that escaped her throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d he asked her, his voice low, rough.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had to fight for air. She felt intoxicated and yet on the edge of panic.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He patted her rear a little sharply in approval. Ella flinched at the tingling heat that washed up her spine from the light tap. \u201cNow, I want you to try to relax for me a little, Ella. I want to put the plug inside you, get you ready, before we go any further.\u201d</p><p>Relax? He was kidding, she thought. He had to be.</p><p>She felt him moving at the bottom of the bed, his body shifting beneath her before his hair brushed her leg. She jerked as his hands went under her thighs, lifting her a bit before his tongue thrust hard and fast inside the soaked channel of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh God! James!\u201d she cried out, her back bowing in reflex, angling her hips higher for the invasion.</p><p>His tongue was like a flame, searing her vagina as he pushed in hard, then pulled back slowly. As though he had already shaken the foundations of her desire, he began to lap at her. His tongue licked and stroked, drawing her juices from her body as he murmured his appreciation of her taste, or her need, she wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>His fingers moved to the gentle curve of her cunt lips, spreading them marginally as his tongue delved higher, licking through the slit, circling her clit. Teasing strokes of his demon tongue had her grinding her pussy into his mouth, and yet with little ease. As she moved closer, his mouth drew farther away.</p><p>She was only barely aware of his fingers probing between her buttocks, slick with the cool gel of the lubrication that coated them. One long finger pierced her puckered opening as James\u2019 tongue speared deep inside her cunt once again.</p><p>Ella\u2019s eyes flew open as a gasp escaped her lips. Braced only partially on her knees, the slack in the restraints taken up by her position, there was no way to escape the invasion. She moaned, a drawn out sound of shocked pleasure, heated pain as his tongue fucked her clenching vagina once again.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whimpered his name, fighting to hold onto her control.</p><p>Her anus stretched around the probing finger, welcoming the heated sensations that came from his smooth, stroking movements. He didn\u2019t answer her unspoken plea, one she wasn\u2019t certain of herself, rather he pulled the finger back, added another and pushed into the tight entrance once again.</p><p>A cry strangled in Ella\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cEasy, darlin\u2019.\u201d His voice was a rough croon as his fingers began to gently scissor inside her anus, stretching her slowly as he slurped at the juices running from her heated cunt.</p><p>The bite of pain was intoxicating, addicting. Pleasure swelled inside her as he stretched her, licked her, his other hand moving up her body until it tucked beneath her breast, his fingers plucking at her nipple. She was shaking, suspended between lust and that sharp bite of pain, and terrified he would stop.</p><p>He prepared her slowly. The pleasure became a tormenting surge of sensations as his fingers prepared her anus gently. There was no impatience, as Jase had often shown, no irritation that it took so long to prepare her. Beneath his unhurried caresses she eased, relaxed, until he was working three long fingers in and out of the back passage as her strangled moans echoed around the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby,\u201d he crooned into the dripping folds of her pussy. \u201cSo sweet and tight, Ella.\u201d</p><p>She moaned in protest as his fingers pulled free, then moaned again in rising pleasure as his tongue began circling her clit. She was unaware of his hands for long moments, unaware that more was coming. Her dazed senses only knew his hard breaths between her thighs, his stroking tongue...</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cJames...\u201d She wailed his name as the head of the butt plug seared her anus as he pushed it into the tight entrance.</p><p>She fought the restraints, pressed harder into his licking tongue and nearly came to the smooth, stroking movements as fire lanced through her rectum. Thickly lubricated, the plug invaded her slowly, stretching her, burning her, bringing her so close to orgasm she had to bite her lip to keep from screaming out for it.</p><p>\u201cJames, please.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the strangled plea tearing from her throat as the anal plug lodged inside her anus, her muscles clenching on it, her pussy shuddering in reaction to the pleasure/pain.</p><p>He moved then, despite her protesting cry, pulling himself from beneath her thighs and kneeling behind her. Her hips arched to him, her body desperate, mindless. His hand landed on the upturned cheek of her ass in a surprisingly sharp blow.</p><p>Ella stilled. At first, shock arced through her body, then an excitement that had her stilling in fear. She didn\u2019t like it, she assured herself. It was depraved, perverted. She wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, if you need to get off, Ella, you come to me. No more vibrators unless I insert them. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames...\u201d She shook her head, needing to protest, yet unable to.</p><p>His hand landed on the opposite cheek of her ass. She flinched, her body shuddering at the heat. She wouldn\u2019t like this, she promised herself, though her pussy convulsed in nearing orgasm.</p><p>Then she felt the plug, seated so snugly in her rear, begin to swell. Slowly stretching her, burning her as his fingers went to her dripping vagina. One slid slowly inside her, caressing the thin muscle that separated her vagina from her anus. She could feel the enlargement of the plug as he caressed her there. The steady growth, the burning pain, the striking pleasure that shot through her body like flares of lightning.</p><p>\u201cThe plug enlarges, Ella, to eight and a half inches and several inches around. Almost as thick, almost as long, as my cock.\u201d She was struggling for breath when the swelling stopped. \u201cSeven inches is all you can take now. When you can take it all, Ella, then I\u2019ll fuck you there.\u201d</p><p>Ella writhed against the blankets, fighting to accept the thickness of the device that stretched her anus. She could feel the heat steaming from her pussy, the sensitivity of her body, the agonizing need that was as much pain as it was pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere, baby.\u201d He was beside her then. Ella opened her eyes, staring up at him as he helped her to lever herself up as far as the chains he had loosened would allow.</p><p>She trembled, knowing what he wanted, more than eager to give it to him. She licked her lips slowly then allowed his cock to push slowly between them. He was thick and hard, so hot and demanding she moaned in exquisite anticipation as she closed her lips tightly around him and suckled slowly at his flesh. He burrowed in, sliding over her tongue until he was almost gagging her, poised at the entrance to her throat.</p><p>He stopped, breathing roughly as his hand wrapped around the flesh where her lips were closed around it. Then his hips began to move. She heard his groan as her tongue licked at him, her mouth sucking him as he began to fuck her with smooth, powerful strokes. She was restrained, at his mercy, a receptacle for whatever he commanded. She was helpless. She was insane with lust.</p><p>She suckled his cock with moist, noisy appreciation. There was no shame in the sounds she made, no trepidation that he would give her more than she could take. At least, not in this instance. There was only the hot male taste of him. Only the need to make him as crazy to come as she was.</p><p>\u201cDamn, even your mouth is tight,\u201d he groaned as he fucked her slowly. \u201cHot and tight, Ella. But your pussy\u2019s going to be hotter, tighter. Like fucking a virgin with that butt plug filling your ass, tightening your cunt.\u201d</p><p>She trembled as his wicked words washed over her, but she suckled his cock like a woman starved for a man. She licked beneath the head, slurped at it, starved for the taste of his seed. The shaft throbbed, pulsed, but he held onto his control as she slowly lost hers.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled long moments later as he pulled back from her.</p><p>Ella moaned in protest, struggling against the restraints, as she tried to follow the burgeoning erection. His hand landed on the curve of her ass again. A warning slap that only made her pussy vibrate with increased need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to fuck you, Ella. I\u2019ll strangle you if I try to take my pleasure in your mouth now.\u201d</p><p>Ella stilled. Her breath rasped from her throat, fear suddenly trembling through her with almost the same force as her lust did. His cock was large, thick. The plug in her anus had tightened her vagina, and it had been more than a decade since anything larger than her small vibrator had invaded the channel. He would kill her with his cock...</p><p>\u201cNot like this, I want to watch you take me, Ella.\u201d She was too weak to fight him as he released the restraints on her ankles and her wrists.</p><p>He turned her over on her back, then replaced them carefully. Ella stared up at him, unable to protest, unable to fight him. She ached in ways she could have never imagined. Her pussy felt as though it was boiling with heat, and the fullness in her anus only called attention to the emptiness of her vagina.</p><p>He leaned over her, his expression so gentle, so filled with approval that her heart clenched. When his lips covered hers, her womb flexed with melting desire. His kiss was hot, heated, tasting of her intimate juices and his male need. She moaned into his lips, wishing she could hold him to her, touch him, as she felt his cock nudge against the sensitive opening of her vagina.</p><p>\u201cElla,\u201d he groaned her name, his hand touching her damp hair, the other holding her hip as the head of his cock invaded her tight opening.</p><p>\u201cOh God! James!\u201d Her head tossed as he began to push slowly inside.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Ella. It\u2019s okay, baby. You can take me.\u201d She struggled against the restraints, crying out as he separated the sensitive muscles, powering through the drenched, fisted grip of her pussy.</p><p>She bucked beneath him, barely aware of her sharp cries of pleasure...or were they of pain? Her movements drove him deeper inside her. Deeper. Deeper. Her hips arched to him as he slid into the hilt, the pulse and throb of the heavy veins beneath his hard flesh echoing through her body.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Ella,\u201d he cursed her, his voice rough as he fought for control. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight I could come now. Look what you\u2019ve denied us all these years. All these years, Ella, you stole this from us.\u201d</p><p>She screamed then. She had sworn she would never scream for him. But when he began the hard driving rhythm inside her tight clasp, the pleasure/pain that tore through her body pushed the desperate scream from her throat. She was bound to the bed, unable to fight the sensations, helpless against the rocking strokes that tore past her muscles, made her accept her own desires, the pain and the pleasure and the need for more.</p><p>Too many years longing. Too many nights dreaming. On the third stroke Ella exploded. The orgasm that tore through her body had her tightening further, screaming out his name, her body shaking, tensing, convulsing as she fought the strength of her release. But she couldn\u2019t fight it. Couldn\u2019t escape the hard, quickening strokes of his cock as he fucked her through the cataclysm, then a last desperate lunge as his seed jetted hot and harsh inside her convulsing pussy.</p><p>\u201cElla.\u201d He cried out her name as his lips buried at her neck.</p><p>She felt his release spurting inside her, her own rushing through her quaking vagina as her soul rocked with the pleasure, and she knew the emotions she had fought for so many years.</p> <p>Her vision dimmed as she lost her breath with the last wave of intense sensation. Tears fell from her eyes, and as she collapsed back on the bed, she knew in her soul she would never be the same again.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cHey, Ella, you missed dinner. Are you in there?\u201d Ella jerked awake at the sound of her friend\u2019s voice that evening, her shocked eyes going to the bedside clock. Damn, she had forgotten about Charlie having the key to the house, and her habit of just coming in as she pleased.</p><p>It was dark, a little after ten, and James was still in the bed with her. Even worse, his half erect cock was still buried in her pussy where it had been after her last climax.</p><p>She moved to jerk away, but his arm around her hips stopped her, and her heart raced as his cock began to harden inside her.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute, Charlie,\u201d she called out, pushing at his arm. \u201cI fell asleep. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hurry,\u201d Charlie called back. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late and I need to head home.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the other woman\u2019s footsteps fading away from the bedroom door eased her harsh breathing until she felt James thrust inside the tight grip of her vagina as his throttled groan sounded at her ear.</p><p>\u201cI have to get up,\u201d she whispered, pulling at his arm, wanting nothing better than to push back against him, to scream out in the pleasure again.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, though there was no anger in his tone, only regret.</p><p>Ella bit her lip as the hot length of flesh eased from her and he rolled lazily to his back as he reached over and flipped on the light at his side of the bed. She looked back at him as she wrapped the blanket around her and rose to her feet. He was naked and unashamed of it. His long fingers scratched at his chest as he smothered a drowsy yawn. His erection lay against his lower stomach, glistening with her juices and his earlier release. He looked sexy as hell.</p><p>Ella shook her head before he could tempt her any further, grabbed her robe and rushed to the bathroom. It took longer than she would have liked to clean the evidence of their spent passion from her body. Thankfully, James had removed the butt plug earlier, though her vagina, and her tender back entrance were still a little sensitive.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she left the bathroom, covered in her long gown and robe. James still lay on the bed, watching her through narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes narrowed further. \u201cWho does know?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips nervously. \u201cJust Tess and Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His tone of voice suggested he might see more than she was actually saying. \u201cSo you want me to stay put?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Hell yes, she did. Her friends rarely kept secrets. What Charlie knew, Terrie would know, and Marey would know and Tamera. She winced at the thought. She especially didn\u2019t want Tamera to know.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He shrugged, though she didn\u2019t trust his tone of voice. \u201cGo visit your friend. I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Ella breathed in deeply in relief before she rushed from the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time. What were you doing in there, anyway?\u201d Charlie turned from the refrigerator as Ella moved into the kitchen.</p><p>Charlie was nearly five years younger than Ella, slim and sophisticated, dressed in a gray silk sheath with matching heels. Her long, black hair fell to the middle of her shoulders like a fall of midnight silk, contrasting to the perfect peaches and cream perfection of her bare shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI was asleep.\u201d Ella went to the coffee pot and put on a fresh brew of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never asleep before midnight, Ella,\u201d Charlie scoffed. \u201cHell, you\u2019re still up at one and two in the morning. I know, I can see your bedroom light from my house.\u201d</p><p>Ella lowered her head. She was unaware Charlie kept such a close eye on her. It was disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I take a nap.\u201d She shrugged, flipping the switch and listening to the machine begin to hum as it began to heat the water. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to her friend, aware of Charlie\u2019s steady regard as she took a slice of cheesecake from the refrigerator and moved to the table. She collected a fork from the cabinet as she passed by it, but still, she watched Ella.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\u2019re acting strange.\u201d Charlie was the most perceptive of her friends, but Ella didn\u2019t like how easily even she was reading her.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d Ella moved two cups from the cabinet and set cream and sugar on the table. \u201cI was just tired, Charlie.\u201d</p><p>She was just damned uncomfortable now. Her thighs were weak and tender, her breasts marked by James\u2019 mouth, her body longing to return to him. She usually enjoyed her friend\u2019s visits, and looked forward to them. Charlie was usually easy going and filled with laughter, but now she just wanted her to leave. Ella wanted to return to James, his heat, his hard body.</p><p>\u201cElla, you aren\u2019t acting right, honey.\u201d Charlie watched her with sharp, deep blue eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Ella shook her head as she poured the coffee. She had to fight the trembling of her hands, and the knowledge that everything was suddenly out of control. And not just sexually.</p><p>She set Charlie\u2019s coffee cup in front of her, then moved to the other side of the table and sat down. As she looked up, her stomach dropped. Charlie was staring across the room in complete shock. Ella\u2019s head turned slowly, knowing what held her rapt attention. Her brows snapped into a frown as James walked barefoot through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were fixing coffee, baby.\u201d He wore blue jeans and nothing else. And those damned jeans. The top button was loose, and the waistband rode low on his tight abdomen. Right above it was a strawberry love bite. She remembered marking him, and now her face flamed as she realized her friend couldn\u2019t miss it.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Charlie breathed as she obviously fought for breath, her gaze swinging from Ella to James.</p><p>Ella could only cover her face as James poured his coffee, dropped a quick kiss to the top of her head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll finish up some of that paperwork you dragged me away from earlier while you talk to your friend.\u201d</p><p>She peeked through her fingers as he ambled away. The jeans molded his buttocks to perfection, and Charlie wasn\u2019t missing a second of the view as he left the room.</p><p>As he disappeared through the doorway, Charlie turned to her, her eyes wide, her expression shocked.</p><p>\u201cJames Wyman,\u201d she breathed out in shock. \u201cOh my God! Ella, you fucked James Wyman? Or is it Jesse?\u201d she squeaked in fear, well aware of Tess\u2019s interlude with Jesse Wyman and Cole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ella squirmed in her chair. No, she thought, he had fucked her, thoroughly. And more than once. She sighed tiredly. Everyone would know it now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Jesse,\u201d she groaned, pushing her fingers restlessly through her hair. \u201cYou should know better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d she squealed.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Charlie, shut up,\u201d she shushed her frantically. \u201cHe\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, do you have any idea what you\u2019re doing? What you\u2019re getting into?\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cHoney, he and Jesse have shared their women more than once...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d Ella came out of her chair, her hands trembling violently as she shoved them into the pockets of her robe.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not with Jesse, but Ella, James and Jesse aren\u2019t the only members of their pack, hon. I could name you half a dozen now.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Charlie sat back in her chair, her mouth falling open in surprise. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? They\u2019re called the Trojans, babe. Because of their dominance, and their sharing. They like submissives, Ella. You aren\u2019t a submissive. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not,\u201d Ella bit out. But she wondered. What James had done to her that night, the dark promises he had made to her as he buried his cock inside her over and over again, threatened her belief that she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cElla, those men, they don\u2019t mess with women who aren\u2019t submissive. Women who won\u2019t give them that ultimate commitment.\u201d Charlie came to her feet, facing her in concern. \u201cYou ran from Jase because of his demands. James will be worse.\u201d</p><p>Ella shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m in control,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe won\u2019t do it if I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when he leaves because you can\u2019t do it?\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cDammit, Ella, haven\u2019t you been hurt enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my choice, Charlie.\u201d She raised her head in determination. \u201cMy choice. No matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>Charlie watched her silently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one,\u201d she finally said slowly. \u201cThe one that came in while Jase had you tied down. The reason you divorced him and moved so damned far away for so long.\u201d</p><p>Ella turned away, her lips opening as she fought to drag in more air, to stem the panic rising in her chest.</p><p>\u201cStop, Charlie,\u201d she whispered, turning back to her as she stared at her friend pleadingly. \u201cPlease, let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God. You\u2019re in love with him.\u201d Charlie shook her head, amazement shaping her expression. \u201cElla, he\u2019s the one. The reason you ran and turned into a bitter old nun. My God. He\u2019s younger than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix years...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shares his women,\u201d she pointed out again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you will to keep him.\u201d Charlie was angry now. Her voice throbbed with it, her face flushing with it. \u201cYou will, Ella. Because you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Her hand sliced through the air as her soul trembled with the knowledge. \u201cThis isn\u2019t any of your business, Charlie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t.\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice rose with her anger. \u201cDammit, Ella, I watched you destroy yourself after that divorce. Turning into a bitter old woman before your time because of that bastard...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice.\u201d Ella was shaking with her own anger now. \u201cAnd remember, Charlie, I didn\u2019t ask you for your opinion then or now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you have to ask for it,\u201d Charlie snorted is disgust. \u201cReally, Ella. It\u2019s voluntary, darling.\u201d The sarcasm was a clear sign that Charlie was rapidly losing her temper. Ella wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Ella\u2019s head swung around to the doorway and she wanted to groan in dismay when she saw James standing there, watching them mockingly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know how to dress?\u201d she bit out in irritation, seeing all the smooth, perfect muscle that she knew Charlie was eating up with her eyes.</p><p>He arched a dark brow questioningly. \u201cI thought all good little boy toys went around half naked? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re firing me after only a few hours on the job.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>It was well after midnight before Charlie left. After James\u2019 mocking statement and his declaration that he was going to bed to let them discuss him in peace, Ella broke out the wine. Some nights, there was nothing you could do but get a shade tipsy and remember all the reasons why you didn\u2019t want a man in your life. Charlie was eager to go along with her. Evidently all that smooth male muscle and blatant sexuality had been too much for her to deal with at one time as well.</p><p>Finally, her friend weaved her way to the limo waiting on her, thanked her aging driver nicely as he opened the door for her, and crawled into the vehicle. Ella herself felt she was walking reasonably straight until she closed the door and turned around. She proceeded to walk into the embroidered chair that sat off to the side. She frowned down at it in irritation before backing up and trying again.</p><p>She needed to go to bed. But James was in her bed. She stopped as she headed through the kitchen. Of course James was in her bed. That was where he belonged, she decided with a sharp, rather jerky nod before squaring her shoulders and heading to the room.</p><p>He was waiting on her. How had she known he would still be awake and waiting on her? His expression was cool, arrogant, as she removed her robe and started to lie down.</p><p>\u201cThe gown.\u201d His voice was dark, foreboding.</p><p>Ella stopped, staring at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asked him haughtily. \u201cI sleep in my gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it off or I\u2019ll tear it off.\u201d There was no mercy in his voice, no change in his expression.</p><p>Ella snorted. \u201cSome boy toy you are, James. I might have to fire you after all. You are supposed to obey me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the gown off. I won\u2019t tell you again, Ella.\u201d Her insides trembled at the dark brew of anger and desire that throbbed in his voice.</p><p>She did as he said, suddenly too nervous not to. She watched him helplessly as the silk gown slithered to the floor, leaving her bare before his eyes. What did he see, she wondered? She was older; her body wasn\u2019t as toned, as pretty as it had been ten years before. She knew all her problem areas, had stared at them in the mirror more times than she could count.</p><p>He pulled the blankets back then and patted the bed beside him. Watching him warily, she got into bed, lying on her back as he stopped her from turning on her side. His big hand moved to her stomach, caressing the flesh there as her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be regulated to the bedroom, hidden, a secret you keep from everyone,\u201d he warned her coldly as he stared down at her. \u201cDo you understand me, Ella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d She shook her head, her brain clouded with the alcohol, her emotions sensitized from her friend\u2019s warnings, and James\u2019 demands. \u201cWhy are you even here, James? In my bed. My life,\u201d she sighed wearily.</p><p>\u201cYou have to figure that one out on your own,\u201d he growled, his hand moving until he could brush back the lingering strands of hair that clung to her cheek, her neck. \u201cYou should have already figured it out, Ella, but you refuse to look beyond your own fears. I won\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened only marginally as she stared up at him. In the soft light of the lamp, his features were shadowed, savage yet softening with tenderness. She lifted her hand until she could touch the roughness of his beard-shadowed jaw, loving the warmth and roughness of his flesh.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of you,\u201d she whispered bleakly. \u201cFor so many years, I dreamed of you, James. You\u2019ll break my heart if I let you. I can\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>His gaze became shuttered. \u201cGo to sleep, Ella. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He moved then, turning out the light before lying down beside her, wrapping his arms around her as he pulled her close. Ella stared up at the dark ceiling, feeling the warmth and vitality of his body as he held her. Feeling the hard length of his cock against her thigh.</p><p>She breathed out regretfully. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you when you\u2019re gone, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Ella,\u201d he warned, his voice soft yet commanding. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to push me much further tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will, James.\u201d She shook her head, the wistful sadness inside her heart too much to bear. \u201cI was used to being alone.\u201d</p><p>Silence met her words. He wasn\u2019t asleep; his body was too tight, too tense for her to believe that. His anger thickened the air in the room, though, and she realized she didn\u2019t really want him angry. Keeping him angry was to keep him at arm\u2019s length, a safe distance from making her body torment her with its needs. But he was close now, he had already taken her, more than once, and the little aches in her body proved that.</p><p>\u201cI used to fantasize about you.\u201d She frowned as she thought of the years that had passed. \u201cHow silly is that, James? That\u2019s when what little satisfaction I had found with Jase in all those years was gone. The moment you stepped into that room destroyed it all.\u201d</p><p>His cock jerked against her thigh.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, Ella. I won\u2019t warn you again.\u201d She shivered at the dominating tone of his voice.</p><p>She turned her head to look at him, seeing only the shadowed impression of his form beside her. Her eyes lowered as she wondered what it would be like to see him out of control. All that cool purpose burned away. Could she do it? Could she make James Wyman, master of women, lose control? Her pussy gushed with the thought. She had heard rumors for years. Women talked, and unfortunately she heard the tales. And they talked about James and his cool control, his sexual deliberation. None had broken that calm. None had made him lose control.</p><p>She rolled on her side slowly, shivering as she felt him adjust his erection to her new position. His body tightened further.</p><p>\u201cMaybe having a boy toy would be nice.\u201d She smoothed her hand up his chest, her nails glancing his hard male nipple as she scratched lightly over it.</p><p>He caught her hand, holding it still against his chest as he stared at her through the darkness.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d make a good toy, Ella?\u201d he asked her, his voice silky, dangerous. \u201cIt could blow up in your hands, sweetheart. You don\u2019t want to continue on the course.\u201d</p><p>She was just tipsy enough to smile. To lean forward and swirl her tongue over the sensitive nub of his nipple. She heard his breath catch, felt his body tighten further.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the point?\u201d she asked him as she moved lower, her tongue stroking down his hard abdomen as the muscles there clenched tightly.</p><p>His hands threaded through her hair, clenching on the strands as she nipped at his flesh, trying to halt her movements. Ella couldn\u2019t halt her gasp. The prickling heat in her scalp was more exciting then she wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cElla.\u201d He spoke her name sharply, a demand, a command to stop, warning her in the sheer dangerous throb that lingered in the tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat, James?\u201d she asked him softly. Her head held still just below his heart, but her hands were free. She raked her nails up his thighs, loving the sound of his breath catching in his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to lose control, Ella,\u201d he warned her softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, her teeth nipping at his skin as her nails ran alongside his bulging cock.</p><p>It was exhilarating, exciting. He was breathing harder now, his heart racing beneath her ear. She tugged at the grip on her hair, whimpering with the stimulation, that sharp flare of pleasure that raced through her body. Her head lowered until her tongue was able to reach the flared, hot crown of his cock. He jerked as she licked it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The grip he had on her hair was fierce, the burning along her scalp intense, but it only fired her body as a distant amazement pierced her brain. The pain was a fiery cascade of sensations that nearly broke her. She was out of control. She, who had kept her control wrapped about her like a mantle of protection, had fallen as easily to this man as a virgin with no knowledge of the heartache awaiting her.</p><p>She pulled further against his grip, crying out as she felt her cunt clench at the ache. Her lips capped the turgid head of his erection, slurping noisily as her tongue licked, stroked. She wanted him deep within her mouth, wanted to feel him fucking into it, unable to halt his own spiraling pleasure. To destroy his control as he had destroyed hers.</p><p>One hand gripped the thick shaft as his hips jerked, burying the smooth crown in her suckling mouth. She heard his strangled moan above her, felt his erection throb with a deep, hard flex of the tightened muscle.</p> <p>\u201cEnough.\u201d His voice was thicker now as he pulled at her hair. When that didn\u2019t help, he gripped her head, pulling her up as she cried in protest.</p><p>He flipped her to her back, jerking the blankets off the bed as he came over her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, Ella,\u201d he bit out fiercely. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tempt me this way.\u201d</p><p>She undulated beneath him, raking her hard-tipped breasts against his chest, rubbing her aching pussy against the thigh wedged between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do, James?\u201d she asked him, tempting him, tempting fate and the dark visions suddenly rushing through her head. \u201cHow will you punish me? Will you share me then, to show me my place? To regain your control?\u201d</p> <p>He stilled. His hands held her wrists to the mattress as he stared down at her, his savage expression only barely discernable. He was breathing hard and fast now, fighting to regain the upper hand, and now she knew how to make him lose it.</p><p>\u201cCan you bear it, James?\u201d she asked him softly. \u201cWill you join in, or merely watch as another man takes me, making me scream as you do, fucking me like you do...\u201d</p><p>Before she could anticipate him, his control broke. His legs wedged between her thighs and his cock pushed inside her swollen pussy in one hard, long stroke. She screamed out at the invasion, at the instant, fiery pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re tempting, Ella?\u201d he groaned as she fought to accept the heavy girth buried in her cunt. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing to me?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t still. His hips moved, his cock thrusting in and out of her in long smooth strokes as he fought to hold back. She didn\u2019t want him to hold back. She didn\u2019t want to hold back. Not any longer.</p><p>\u201cHow will you do it, James? How can you make me accept it? I dare you to try.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t expect the consequences of those words. His lips slammed down on hers, slanting across hers as his tongue drove deep into her mouth. At the same time, the thrusts of his cock inside her vagina increased in strength and power.</p><p>Ella cried into the kiss, her tongue tangling with his as she tilted her hips to take him deeper, harder inside her sensitive cunt. She could feel her muscles gripping him, the thickness, the heat of his erection thrusting past the sensitive tissue, stroking nerve endings already enflamed with a lust she had never thought herself capable of.</p><p>And with each stroke, each demanding invasion into the core of her body, she was reminded of what caused his loss of control. The thought of her with him and with another. Two cocks, hard and strong, pushing into her over and over again...</p><p>Her body tightened, her cunt clamping down on the pistoning power of his cock as she exploded to the images twisting through her mind, her body. She tried to scream, but her mouth with filled with James. She tried to buck him away from her, to escape the driving pleasure, the knowledge, but her pussy was filled with James. Filled with him until he groaned hard and deep, powered into her one last brutal thrust before he exploded.</p><p>The wash of his hot seed inside her channel triggered another, smaller climax as she whimpered beneath him. Her body shuddered, her womb rippling with the orgasm as the ice that had once encased her heart shattered.</p><p>She loved James Wyman. And Ella knew to the farthest depths of her soul, that the love filling her would be her ultimate destruction.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in three hours.\u201d Ella lay face down on the bed at noon the next day, breathing through the fiery fullness that invaded her anus.</p> <p>James had taken her again when they woke up. He had been quiet, almost reflective as they showered and ate breakfast. Later they had lain around the pool until after a light lunch that he had prepared himself. They hadn\u2019t talked much, but the silence hadn\u2019t been uncomfortable.</p><p>Ella had been wary, though. He wasn\u2019t pushing her, for anything. He was contemplative as though his loss of control the night before bothered him in some way. An hour after lunch he laid out the box that contained a mild anal douche and ordered her to use it. His voice had hardened, sending heat streaking through her pussy.</p><p>\u201cSo what am I supposed to do for three hours?\u201d She turned her head, watching him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Preparing her for the anal invasion had left her hot, wet. She wanted him now, before he left.</p><p>\u201cWait on me.\u201d His voice brooked no refusal. \u201cLeave the plug in. I\u2019ve removed the inflator, so you can dress, do what you normally do. Just do it as it eases the muscles there.\u201d</p><p>He had inflated it farther than before. Through a tormenting hour of heated touches, burning strokes of his tongue in and out of her pussy, but never enough to push her over the edge. She was burning with lust now and reluctant to move. The thick intruder buried in her anus stretched the muscles there with fiery precision. He had given her all she could take, yet had assured her that it still had not been fully inflated.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fair...\u201d She stopped. The look in his eyes was almost frightening.</p><p>She settled back on the bed, watching as his brooding look eased only slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou pushed last night, Ella. You may think you\u2019ve gotten away with it, but you haven\u2019t. When I get back, I\u2019ll show you just how you haven\u2019t. If you get yourself off, I\u2019ll punish you, Ella. I\u2019ll tie you down to this bed and leave you there for the remainder of the night, and I\u2019ll make sure you know how painful arousal can really be.\u201d</p><p>She trembled at the sound of his voice. She had no doubt he would do it, too. If she was restrained, there would be no tempting his control, no pushing his personal limits. He could torment her as long as he liked. He had proved that in the last hour.</p><p>He released the restraints that held her, leaving the chains attached to the bed as he moved away from her.</p><p>\u201cWear a dress. Something loose and light. When I get back, we\u2019ll see how much control you have, baby.\u201d</p><p>Something about those words had trepidation skittering through her body. She eased up slowly on the bed, feeling her pussy clench, drench further as the plug bit at her tender anal muscles. She stared up at him silently, watching as his eyes darkened, his body tensing at the sight of her swollen, hard-tipped breasts, and the arousal that she knew was obvious in her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, James?\u201d she asked him softly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Ella.\u201d He pushed his hands into the pockets of his slacks as he watched her, his voice throbbing with an emotion she didn\u2019t want to name. \u201cI\u2019ve waited ten years, and in those years you have refused to take my desire for you, or my needs seriously, let alone your own. Tonight, you will take those needs seriously. You\u2019ll take me seriously, Ella.\u201d</p><p>Had she ever seen him look so powerful, so commanding? Suddenly, she felt much younger than him, and definitely much less experienced. His command of his own power, his own control, went beyond age or experience, and entered that unknown realm of supreme self-confidence. He knew what he was doing, she realized suddenly. James had a plan, just as he always had, she knew now. But why and what that the plan was, she couldn\u2019t decide.</p><p>\u201cNo other men.\u201d She shook her head, her hand trembling as she pushed her fingers through her hair. \u201cI mean it, James. No one else.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cYou no longer set your own limits, Ella. I do. You\u2019ll learn that tonight. Whatever I want, however I want it, and you\u2019ll love it. Or you can continue to be a coward and deny what I know you feel for me. If that\u2019s the case, my bags are packed. Set them on the porch and I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, fear suddenly shaking her soul. \u201cSo I\u2019m part of an orgy or I\u2019m nothing to you, period?\u201d she asked him, feeling her heart thunder in her chest. But what really terrified her was the clench of arousal that rippled through her cunt.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ella. I would never put you in the middle of an orgy,\u201d he promised her smoothly. \u201cWhat I will put you in the middle of is more pleasure than you\u2019ve known could exist. Pleasure I know you want. Need. Even now, after the past three days, you aren\u2019t satisfied. You climax until you nearly pass out with the pleasure of it, but you need more. And, by God, tonight I\u2019ll make sure you have what you need, or I won\u2019t bother trying anymore. I love you, Ella. Love you until my heart breaks with it, but I won\u2019t beg you, and I won\u2019t let you deny either of our needs. Now think about that.\u201d</p><p>Shock exploded through her body as he turned and left the room. She could feel her face paling, her body weakening at a knowledge he had possessed, and yet she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It made sense now. James wasn\u2019t a man to chase after any woman, to care one way or the other if his desires weren\u2019t returned. Yet, he had chased her for ten years. Not in an obvious, lovesick manner, but in his own controlled, brooding way. He had made her aware of her own body, her own desires, even as she tried to hide from them, and made her more than aware of him.</p><p>She bit her lip, staring at the door, remembering his driving demands, his loss of control the night before. No other woman had managed that. Had it happened, she would have known about it. And his need for her wasn\u2019t diminishing. Like hers, it seemed to be growing stronger.</p><p>Even after the excesses of the past days, the fiery heat and lust that flared between them. He was right, she had kept reaching for more. Something, some unknown dark desire kept pushing her.</p><p>She shook her head, fighting the awakening realization. For years she had fought Jase, not because she secretly wanted what he offered, but because he didn\u2019t satisfy her. He didn\u2019t bring her to the mindless orgasms James could bring her to. He didn\u2019t make her pussy drench with a look. His needs hadn\u2019t filled her with this strange excitement and nervousness. She had never wanted to break the control he thought he had.</p><p>She eased from the bed and walked slowly to the shower. A cool shower. She needed to think, she needed to make sense of the past and of the present. But more than anything, she had to decide if the desires that filled James were truly a part of her own needs, or just a part of her desperation to keep him now that she had held him. She had to know, before she took the chance of losing him forever.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Of the five friends Ella had kept over the years, Terrie was perhaps the freest; the one Ella felt would be the most likely to understand her present predicament.</p><p>Silence met her request for long minutes. \u201cCharlie called this morning, too,\u201d Terrie finally said softly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Ella closed her eyes. Of course Charlie had called. Terrie, and Marey and most likely Pamela as well. Just what she needed, everyone to know who and what she was doing. Her parents would know, too, if they were still alive. Poor Charlie, she couldn\u2019t keep anything from their small group of friends, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cI just need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right over then.\u201d She could almost hear Terrie\u2019s sharp nod.</p><p>Ella hung up the phone, sighing deeply. Terrie would know James the best. She had been married to one of his two brothers, the bastard. Ella, for one, was glad to see his final demise. Thomas Wyman had been a stone cold prick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she waited for the other woman to arrive, Ella made sweet iced tea, moved about the kitchen preparing glasses and fought to ignore the heat in her rear. The plug was driving her crazy. Her panties were damned near drenched from the moist heat of her pussy and no matter what she did her nipples wouldn\u2019t soften and just go the hell away. The scrape of the light cotton fabric of her sundress over them was about to drive her to distraction.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she heard the front door open then close, and Terrie\u2019s voice calling out her name from the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen.\u201d For as long as Ella could remember, the kitchen was the favored spot for her and her friends to talk, to argue, to visit. Either over coffee or sweet tea, it was there they seemed to find the most comfort.</p><p>She set the glasses of ice and the pitcher of tea on the table as Terrie swept into the room. She stopped inside the doorway, looking around curiously. \u201cIs the boy toy in residence today?\u201d</p><p>Ella winced at the question, though it could have been the tight, erotic tugging of the plug in her rear as she sat down, she thought.</p><p>\u201cJames went somewhere,\u201d she sighed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s meeting Jesse for lunch.\u201d Terrie shrugged as she sat down across from her. \u201cJesse was supposed to come over to the house and fix the faucet for me but James had some kind of emergency.\u201d</p><p>Ella watched her friend suspiciously. \u201cAre you sleeping with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d Terrie\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, not James,\u201d she bit out. \u201cJesse. I know you\u2019re not sleeping with James, you would have killed him by now.\u201d</p><p>Terrie poured the glasses of tea and slid one closer to Ella. \u201cJesse isn\u2019t like James, Ella.\u201d</p><p>Ella lifted her brows at that surprising statement. \u201cHave you lost your mind, Terrie?\u201d she asked her carefully. \u201cI caught him with Cole and Tessa. You are aware of this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ella, you were so drunk that night when you called us over that you couldn\u2019t keep it to yourself,\u201d Terrie sighed regretfully. \u201cI am aware that he likes to play. But he\u2019s not all dominant and fierce like Cole and James are. Jesse\u2019s softer.\u201d</p><p>Ella snorted. Terrie hadn\u2019t seen Jesse, her beloved brother-in-law, that day as he lay beneath Tess, obviously spurting his release inside her. The man was just as dominant as his brother. He just hid it from Terrie. The reasons he would do so worried Ella. Terrie didn\u2019t need more heartbreak, or more pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about Jesse anyway,\u201d Terrie reminded her. \u201cWe\u2019re here to talk about you and James.\u201d</p><p>Ella was smart enough to recognize the same denial tactics she had used herself with James. She sighed wearily. Maybe Terrie was the wrong friend to call.</p><p>Maybe Jesse was the wrong brother to call. Unfortunately, James thought, he was his only brother. Even when Thomas had been alive, Jesse was still the only brother he had to talk to. The only other person he trusted.</p><p>\u201cI love her, Jesse. What if she won\u2019t accept it?\u201d James couldn\u2019t get the thought out of his mind.</p><p>His sexuality was a part of him, a part he didn\u2019t want to change, and saw no reason to change. Could he have been so wrong about Ella? Was he mistaking the excitement, the unspoken challenge she tempted him with? Could he do without watching another man fuck her? He could, it wasn\u2019t about sharing her. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t be a common thing. He wasn\u2019t that depraved. He wanted his woman to himself. And only one man. He had already discussed it with the one he had chosen to introduce her into the pleasures of a threesome. But could she accept it?</p><p>James was well aware that Charlie had, in depth, given Ella all the gossip she thought she had on the Trojans. He snorted silently. The ninny who had pinned that name on them didn\u2019t have the sense God gave a goose. Unfortunately, one of the leading members of the unofficial group had married her. He sighed wearily.</p><p>Whatever name you put to it, they were a group, of sorts. Nearly a dozen men who had met in college, and over the course of several years had gravitated together based on their sexual practices and their need to discuss and learn from each other\u2019s mistakes. There had been many. Often due to a member\u2019s unlucky choice of a lover who refused or even reviled their dominance. At present, there were eight of them, all in their thirties, all still looking for that one woman who could accept them.</p><p>Jesse leaned back in his chair, tipping his beer back and taking a healthy drink as James watched him. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cShe most likely knows what\u2019s coming, James. Ella can be a pure witch when she\u2019s riled. If she hasn\u2019t cut your balls off yet, then most likely she\u2019s not going to.\u201d</p> <p>James winced. That didn\u2019t do much to reassure him. He tipped his own beer back, staring up at the ceiling of Jesse\u2019s home as he contemplated the coming evening. He had called Saxen earlier to set the time to meet him at Ella\u2019s home, and as that time rapidly approached, he found he was becoming more nervous than he had thought he would be.</p><p>\u201cSaxen was my choice for tonight,\u201d he informed his brother quietly.</p><p>Jesse nodded slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good choice.\u201d</p><p>The tall, dark-skinned engineer worked with them at Delacourte Electronics as well, and was one of the most dependable men James knew.</p><p>He had spent over an hour talking to Jesse and getting nowhere. He wasn\u2019t any closer to stilling the nerves running riot inside him than he was to begin with.</p><p>\u201cYou have been of absolutely no help whatsoever,\u201d he finally sighed as he set the empty bottle on the glass coffee table and rose to his feet to leave. \u201cRemind me of this when you finally decide to get off your ass and make your move on Terrie.\u201d</p><p>Jesse grunted as he rose to his feet to his feet. \u201cDamned women. What did we do to deserve them?\u201d</p><p>James shook his head. \u201cI would say we were just lucky, but I\u2019m starting to wonder about that one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>His bags weren\u2019t sitting on the porch. James pulled in behind Saxen\u2019s Mustang and breathed out a hard sigh of relief. He\u2019d be damned, but he had never been this nervous in his life. His entire future, his relationship with Ella and his own needs were riding on this final day. If she turned him away, would he have the strength to stay in control and to walk away from one of the most important aspects of his sexuality?</p><p>He would if he had to. He admitted that to himself. Ella was more important than his desire, more important than his life. But he knew if he allowed it to happen, then neither of them would ever know complete fulfillment. That was his main concern. He knew Ella, better sometimes than she knew herself, and he knew she needed the extreme boundaries of sex just as intensely as he needed it for her. Pulling the keys from the ignition, he opened the door and stepped out of the car as Sax unfolded his tall frame from the other car.</p><p>\u201cYou need a bigger car, Sax.\u201d James repeated the comment he made every time he watched the other man slide from the low-slung car.</p><p>\u201cJames, that\u2019s my baby,\u201d Sax grinned, his teeth flashing white against his dark skin as he ran his hand over his slick, shaved head.</p><p>The sleek, little blue car was indeed one of his prized possessions, though he could have afforded better. That and the Harley. Sax had a set number of priorities. He had achieved all but one. Poor man, Sax had his eye set on a woman that wasn\u2019t about to let him anywhere near her. She would make his life hell, James knew.</p><p>\u201cShe might throw us out of the house.\u201d James paused at the bottom of the steps as he glanced at Sax. \u201cShe might shoot us.\u201d</p><p>Sax chuckled. \u201cIf you\u2019re brave enough to go after this one, James, then she should be brave enough to accept you. You\u2019ve gotten this far without frostbite. I bet you last through the night.\u201d</p><p>Ella\u2019s nickname, The Ice Queen, had followed her even after her divorce to Jase.</p><p>\u201cFrostbite?\u201d James murmured as he shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the least of our worries, Sax.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and stepped inside. He had left explicit instructions for her in the letter he had left in the living room before he went to Jesse\u2019s. He had been careful not to voice those instructions for fear of her outright rejection. If she didn\u2019t want this, then the luggage on the porch would have been a more humane way to cut his heart from his chest. Of course, a bullet would be more permanent.</p><p>\u201cShe should be in her room,\u201d he murmured. \u201cEither restrained to the bed or waiting with the gun.\u201d</p><p>Sax chuckled behind him, and in the sound James could feel the other man\u2019s excitement. Sax was one of the few men who hadn\u2019t known Ella during her marriage to Jase. He had wanted his partner in this next experience with Ella to be free of any preconceived notions or ideas of loyalty. Ella was his. Sax would continue to join in periodic threesomes with him and Ella if this first session went as James hoped.</p><p>Just as Jesse would continue with Cole and Tess until he took that final step in securing his own woman. After marriage, there was no need, no desire to touch another woman. The commitment was strong, the need so extreme that other women held no attraction. It was often a confusing, hotly debated issue among the men who shared in this lifestyle. The need to see their women experiencing that pleasure of an added element to their sexuality. The periodic addition of another man, and in one case he knew of, another woman.</p><p>He stopped at Ella\u2019s bedroom door, took a deep breath and opened it slowly as Sax leaned against the doorframe. God help him. He nearly came in his slacks. She had buckled the straps to her ankles as he ordered, and her arm into one of the wrist restraints. She was staring at the ceiling, her breathing hard and rough as he walked slowly into the room.</p><p>He moved to the free wrist restraint and bent over to buckle it slowly. He caressed her wrist, feeling the hard throb of blood in the vein beneath her skin. She gazed up at him, a shade of fear mixing with the excitement in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Ella?\u201d He sat on the side of the bed, cupping her cheek gently as he stared down at her.</p><p>She was trembling. He could feel the fear and excitement traveling through her. It would heighten the sensations, he knew; make the arousal, the coming orgasm more intense, hotter and brighter. He could barely hold back his own anticipation. He had waited, longed for this more years than he could count.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She breathed out roughly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything right now, James. Don\u2019t ask me questions like that.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked into a soft, gentle smile. Despite her words, he could see that she was more than ready. Her breasts were swollen, her nipples hard little points atop the firm mounds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only be restrained until we think you\u2019re ready to be released,\u201d he promised her softly as he stood by the bed and began to undress.</p><p>The word \u201cwe\u201d had a small, strangled whimper escaping her throat. He watched the shiver that worked over her body, the way her nipples tightened, hardened further.</p><p>\u201cIs the plug still inside you?\u201d he asked her gently as he dropped his shirt to the floor, aware that Sax was slowly undressing behind him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was low, breathless. \u201cYou told me to take it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou followed my directions exactly?\u201d He kept his voice firm, stern.</p><p>Her eyes were wide, dark as she watched him, careful not to look toward his hips. Nervousness and excitement had her body quivering on a finely balanced edge of desire and lust.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>He stripped off his pants and boxers, his hand going to the near-to-bursting erection that stood out from his body. He was so damned hard he knew he wouldn\u2019t make it five minutes if he didn\u2019t find relief soon. A relief he knew her sweet, suckling mouth would provide him.</p><p>\u201cSax, loosen the chains on the footboard. I need her sweet mouth first, or I won\u2019t make it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. She\u2019s beautiful, James.\u201d Sax spoke for the first time as he moved to the bed, his own cock thick and hard as he stared down at Ella.</p><p>Her gaze flickered to him, her eyes widening as they caught the sight of his cock, as hard and long as James, if not a bit more. Her gaze flew up to him and he could see the fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered, her hands curling into fists as he sat down beside her on the bed again.</p><p>\u201cThe fear is good, to a point, Ella,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cYou have to trust me, though. You have to trust that I won\u2019t allow you to be harmed, that I will never threaten you, never cause you undue pain in any way. Without that trust, baby, we\u2019re wasting our time here.\u201d</p><p>His hand reached out to cup one of her full breasts, his fingers gripping the nipple firmly. She breathed in roughly, the little point tightening further. Leaning to her he drew one of the hard points into his mouth, relishing the thick moan that vibrated at her throat.</p><p>When his head rose, he was pleased to see the flush of lust, of deepening desire coloring her once pale face.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ella,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAbove all things, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head sharply. \u201cFine. Fine.\u201d She was breathing hard and deep, then her eyes widened, shock flaring in her expression as her gaze went between her thighs.</p><p>James followed her look and his lips quirked into a smile. Sax couldn\u2019t resist soft, wet pussy, and he was lapping at the creamy mound now with the intent concentration of a man enjoying a prized dessert.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but watch, and Sax gave a show worthy of any porn star as he made certain each touch, each stroke could be clearly seen. His tongue ran through the narrow slit, parting it, gathering the thick juices on the tip of it before he licked them into his mouth and started again. Slow, teasing strokes of his tongue that circled her pink pearl clit then returned to her tender opening to start all over again.</p><p>Then his fingers parted her, his dark flesh an erotic contrast to her pale skin. When he had her lips flared open, his tongue distended then disappeared slowly inside her vagina. James\u2019 cock jerked at the sight of it, imagining the feel of her pussy gripping the other man\u2019s tongue, her muscles rippling around it as he fucked in and out of the hot channel.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d He saw her hips jerk, the muscles of her abdomen tightening as her body tensed, her legs moving against the restraints.</p><p>Sax was slurping on her now, sucking as much of the thick honey from between her thighs that he could reach. And James knew even more would replace it. It would be impossible to suck that well of sweetness dry.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d James leaned forward, his tongue licking over her lips as she stared up at him with dark, shocked eyes. \u201cJust enjoy, Ella. Just enjoy.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. A long, wet kiss that had her moaning into his lips, her head lifting from the pillow as she fought to get closer. Sax\u2019s noisy feast below seemed to make the kiss more desperate, heated, as her body began to clamor for release. A release she would be screaming for before it ever came.</p><p>His lips moved from hers, his own breathing rough, impatient, as they traveled down her neck, moving unerringly to the hard-tipped breasts that rose and fell roughly. She was moaning, her head thrashing on the pillow as she fought to get closer to the mouths tormenting her.</p><p>Sax would tease her. He wouldn\u2019t want her release coming until she was sandwiched between them, no more than James did. And she would be ready for them. Then he heard her shocked gasp, the moan of near pain that erupted from her throat and knew Sax was preparing her back entrance as he stroked her cunt hotter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d He kissed her nipple, licking it gently as he rose to his knees beside her. \u201cJust enjoy, Ella. Just let it feel good.\u201d</p><p>He gripped his cock in his hand, grimacing at the near black of her eyes, the flush of lust on her face. She was so beautiful it was damned near killing him.</p><p>\u201cJames, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d She bucked against Sax\u2019s mouth as James looked to the other man.</p><p>Sax had pulled back, watching as two of his fingers sank slowly in her pussy, two up the forbidden depths of her anus. Her heels were pressed into the mattress, fighting for leverage to thrust against the shallow thrusts. Sax wasn\u2019t about to hurry, though. He knew as well as James did, the pleasure she would experience from the teasing.</p><p>Sax\u2019s head lowered again then, unable to keep his lips, his tongue from the soaked slit that flowered open for him. He murmured his enjoyment into her flesh, his eyes closing as he savored each lick. James felt his cock drip with his own pre-cum at the sight. Her moans, her ragged breaths, the unconscious sexuality reflecting in her face, in her jerky movements, was more than he could bear. If he didn\u2019t push his swollen cock into her mouth soon he was going to go insane.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>Ella wanted to scream, to find some way to release the surging sensations building in her body, but she couldn\u2019t find the breath. Seconds later the choice was taken out of her hands as James\u2019 cock slipped past her lips, filling her mouth, as his rough groan echoed around her.</p><p>Her lips tightened on him, her tongue licking over the thick veins, the tight flesh in greedy hunger, as the scents and sounds of sexual need wrapped around her. The flared head of his erection sank nearly to her throat as her tongue worked desperately along the shaft. She suckled him, pulling her head back then pushing forward, tempting him to fuck her mouth, to spill the hot rich seed that tasted like nectar on her tongue.</p><p>Between her thighs, Sax was lapping at her cunt, his tongue dipping into her vagina, two large fingers sliding deep inside her anus. She shuddered with the sensation, moaning around the flesh thrusting between her lips as she fought to suckle it, to tempt him into the release she knew he was teetering on the edge of.</p><p>She was suspended on a rack of agonizing pleasure and desperate fear. She had seen the other man\u2019s cock, thick and hard, the dark flesh appearing angry, eager to take her. How would she bear it? How would her body hold two thick shafts like that at the same time?</p><p>\u201cElla, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d James\u2019 voice was thick and deep as his hand gripped the halfway point of his cock and his thrusts became harder. \u201cYour mouth is so sweet, so hot.\u201d</p><p>She felt the head pulse against her tongue as she delved beneath it to the sensitive spot that she knew would make him groan with dark lust. The sound shot to her womb, ripping through her with almost climactic intensity. She tightened her mouth on him, slurping on his hard flesh hungrily as his thrusts became harder, his breathing rougher.</p><p>He was on the edge of release, she could feel it, almost taste it, but she was as well, and the tormentor between her thighs was refusing to send her over. She strained against his suckling mouth, his piercing tongue, but nothing seemed to be enough.</p><p>She growled around James\u2019 cock as she fought for that one stroke, that one caress, that would send her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d A sudden, light slap to her mound as the other man moved back had her stilling in surprise.</p><p>Her eyes flew to James\u2019 face as he watched her, then glanced down once again.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d James voice was soft. \u201cShe\u2019s not sucking me properly, Sax. I think she needs to be punished for it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was full of James\u2019 cock, but her strangled scream should have been enough. When the lightly stinging blow landed, she felt her entire body flinch. Not from pain, but from shameful pleasure. Her clit throbbed, pulsed, so swollen and sensitive now that the light blow was agony and ecstasy all in one.</p><p>Her mouth tightened on James\u2019 cock, her tongue stroking, her mouth suckling as she knew he liked it, but she was determined that when the restraints came off, so did her fa\u00e7ade of submission. This was all well and good, but she would make certain they both paid for the tormenting arousal.</p><p>Another blow landed. She jerked, moaning in protest at the streaking sensations. Her clit swelled further, throbbing in an agony of arousal. When the next blow came, she growled around the cock thrusting into her mouth and raised her hips for more. More. One more blow aimed just right, and her clit would explode.</p><p>But the next smack never came. Instead his tongue stroked, caressed, running around her clit with light, deliberately teasing strokes. She rewarded James, the beast, with a firmer suction on his erection, driving him past his own control.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ella. Baby. I\u2019m going to come now. Take me, Ella.\u201d He powered in, his moan deep and hard as his cock suddenly exploded.</p><p>Thick and hot, his seed shot into her mouth as his body jerked with the pleasure she knew was washing over him. In return, the mouth on her cunt only teased her more. She continued to suckle James\u2019 flesh, drawing the last drop of his tangy seed from the tip as she fought to keep from screaming out in agony.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d James pulled back from her, his cock still hard, leaving her suckling mouth reluctantly.</p><p>Perspiration coated his body. His eyes were dark, his face flushed, his lips heavy with sensuality as his hands went to her breasts once again.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, baby?\u201d His hands went to the restraints at her wrists as Sax moved away from her to loosen those at her ankles.</p><p>Ella shuddered. Her pussy was on fire, desperate, yearning. Every nerve ending in her body was sensitized and throbbing for release. When they released her, Sax moved to the side of the bed, laying back, the bulging length of his heavily veined cock rising to his abdomen. As she watched, he rolled a condom over the throbbing shaft, preparing to take her.</p><p>Ella moved, coming quickly to her knees as she caught James\u2019 shoulders, her hands moving to his head as she pressed her lips to his. The surprising action seemed to fray his hard-won control. His tongue plunged into her mouth as she felt him moving her, Sax lifting her.</p><p>They lifted her over Sax\u2019s big body until she felt the wide, flared head of his cock nudging at her vagina. She pulled back then, staring up at James, seeing the heady excitement in his gaze as the other man clasped her hips, holding her still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you anally first,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThen Sax will take you. Scream for me, Ella. Don\u2019t worry about control, don\u2019t worry about anything. Just the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She groaned as Sax drew her down to him, his lips whispering over her cheek, her neck, as he drew her head to his hard shoulder. Below, his cock throbbed at the opening of her cunt</p><p>\u201cRelax, Ella,\u201d Sax\u2019s voice was soft, soothing. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing else you\u2019ll ever experience. Nothing else you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>She flinched as she felt two fingers, slick and cool, slide into the prepared depths of her anus. She cried out, pressing closer, desperate to drive the hard cock inside her pussy as James tormented her back entrance.</p><p>\u201cStay still, Ella.\u201d Sax\u2019s fingers tightened at her hips. \u201cPatience, beautiful. Patience.\u201d</p><p>Then James moved into position. She felt the head of his cock nudge against the little puckered hole a second before he began to press inside. She tried to arch, but Sax held her close and still. Her wail, one of agonizing arousal and the sharp bite of erotic pain, was muffled against the shoulder beneath her as James entered her with excruciating slowness.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she cried out his name as Sax\u2019s hands held her still, closer, his cock throbbing at the portal of her cunt.</p><p>She felt the burning stretch of tight muscles, heard James groan, praising the heat and the grip of her tight channel. One hand gripped a buttock, flexing, tightening on her as he surged inside her last few inches with a hard, shockingly deep groan.</p><p>Impaled, stretched and overfilled, Ella fought to breathe through the first fiery thrust, then to adjust to the invasion. She tightened on his cock, her breaths beseeching cries as her cunt flooded with moisture, convulsed and fought for release.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d James groaned behind her. \u201cNow, Sax, I won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She felt the condom-covered tip of his cock force its way into the entrance of her pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bucked against them, the heat and hardness searing her, the pleasure/pain more than she could bear as he worked his cock inside her by slow degrees.</p><p>She tried to thrash in their arms, tried to force Sax to enter her faster, harder, dying for the orgasm she knew was just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cJames. Damn. She\u2019s tight.\u201d He groaned beneath her as he rocked inside her, the slick inner juice easing his way, but not by much.</p><p>As each agonizing inch pressed into her cunt, she could feel James, thicker, harder, as he throbbed inside her ass.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Sax groaned. \u201cHold on, baby, I\u2019m giving it all to you.\u201d</p><p>She screamed, loud and deep, as the last inches powered inside her with a strong surge of his hips, burying his erection into her to the hilt. A second later, James began to move behind her.</p><p>The sounds of wet sex, desperate cries and hard male groans filled the air as Ella shuddered, her body jerking almost spasmodically in the grip of a lust she could have never imagined. The two men, their thrusts perfectly timed, began to fuck her with hard, driving strokes. Muscles protested, flared with heat, but parted beneath the driving strokes of the two thick shafts possessing her.</p><p>Between them, Ella cried out their names repeatedly, pushing herself into each thrust, flying higher, surging deeper into the ecstatic orgasm she knew was building faster, harder inside her.</p><p>Their thrusts quickened then, pushing into her body with rapid movements, rasping her clit against the wiry roughness of Sax\u2019s pubic hair until the moment insanity hit. She felt her mind, her heart, her womb and her pussy explode. Convulsively, simultaneously, as her scream rocked the air between them. Behind her, James stiffened at that moment, his hot seed flooding her anus as Sax thrust into her tightening pussy one last time and tightened, his groan of release sounding hard and loud at her ear.</p><p>\u201cElla, baby.\u201d James leaned over her, holding her close as she continued to cry out, her body shuddering so harshly she feared she would break apart.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she cried out his name, tears wetting her face as another vibration wracked her body, tightening her, blinding her. She tightened on the cocks still filling her, riding her through the mindless orgasm until she collapsed, boneless, against Sax\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cElla. God. Baby.\u201d James pulled her from Sax, easing her into his arms as he fell to the bed, holding her close, tight, as the other man moved from the bed.</p><p>Ella could still feel the internal shudders racing through her womb, her own release dripping from her cunt as James rocked her, his lips caressing her face, his hands stroking her back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d She burrowed closer against his chest, too exhausted to hold him to her, praying he would hold her to him instead.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he whispered at her ear, his vow echoing to her soul. \u201cNever, Ella. I\u2019ll always be here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cShe asleep?\u201d Sax was waiting in the kitchen, dressed, looking smartly presentable. He didn\u2019t look as though he spent the last hours helping James fuck Ella into another screaming climax. James had held her in his arms, stroking her body, easing her through the destructive shudders of her orgasm before moving to take her again himself.</p><p>After the first violent sensations had eased from her body, neither man had been able to leave her in peace. She responded to each touch, each stroke of their hands as though it were the first time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep.\u201d James nodded, wishing he were as well. He had never been so exhausted in his life.</p><p>\u201cWill she be okay?\u201d Sax glanced back at the hallway that led to her bedroom, a frown shaping his brow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d James was sure of that. Her sleepily muttered words as she finally gave into her own exhaustion assured him of it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you waited long enough for her.\u201d Sax rolled his broad shoulders as he headed for the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m heading home now. I need to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>James followed him to the door and as the other man turned back to him, lifted a brow questioningly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your help now,\u201d Sax said with a fierce frown. \u201cYou and Cole set up Ella\u2019s downfall. I expect your help setting up my woman\u2019s fall.\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cYou have a deal, Sax. Give me a chance to figure out how to get to her, and I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Sax nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting. Impatiently, but waiting.\u201d</p><p>He walked out the front door, closing it softly behind him. James sighed deeply, secured the locks and then returned to Ella\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>She was in the same position he had left her in, curled up on her side, her auburn hair a cloud of silk around her face, her expression peaceful, serene. Had he ever seen her peaceful or serene before he invaded her life? He shook his head, knowing he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs he gone?\u201d she mumbled as he eased into the bed beside her.</p><p>Surprised, James stared down at her closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, tucking the blankets around her again.</p><p>Her voice was drowsy, replete, as she snuggled against him. \u201cNo more threesomes.\u201d She yawned. \u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled gently. \u201cLet me know when you need to move and I\u2019ll do it for you,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Silence thickened around them again for long seconds.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked, her voice even, though he heard the worry in her tone.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Many things.\u201d He smiled against her hair. \u201cBut I\u2019m not leaving, Ella. Not now, not ever. You\u2019re mine. You submitted to it, baby. You can\u2019t back out now.\u201d</p><p>The letter he had left that day was detailed in more than one regard. Submit now, submit for life. The ring that had accompanied it graced her finger, just where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lousy way of proposing, James. I\u2019m going to have to teach you better. Boy toys are supposed to be more romantic, especially married ones.\u201d Warmth filled her voice, a warmth that gave him hope. Then joy swelled in his chest when she whispered, \u201cEspecially the one I love.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, feeling freer, happier than he could ever remember feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, baby.\u201d He kissed her lips tenderly, feeling her smile, her exhausted response. \u201cSleep now. In my arms, Ella. The way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>And they both slept.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>He had sworn she would come to him. He wouldn\u2019t spend agonizing months trying to ease her into a relationship she had stated she would never tolerate. So he tried to seduce her into it instead.</p><p>After Thomas\u2019s death, he had made himself indispensable to her. He was at the house often, fixing this or that, just talking or watching movies late into the night. Despite appearances, Terrie was a wary person, well aware of how easily she could be hurt, how weak she was physically. From what he had gathered, his brother had been more of a bastard than he had ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cNow that was a beautiful wedding.\u201d Terrie stumbled against him a bit as he helped her into the house.</p><p>James and Ella\u2019s wedding ceremony had made her teary eyed, reflective. She had sat in the limo on the way home, quiet, a bit sad, staring out the window as her fingers stroked over the upper swell of one breast that her cream colored dress had revealed. The action had caused his cock to swell, to harden in agonized need.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a long one, anyway.\u201d Jesse pulled her to him, leading her to the living room, enjoying her soft weight against his side.</p><p>The soft silk of her dress slid against his hands, and when he sat her on the couch, the hem rode just below the crotch of her panties. Cream colored as well, silk. He was betting it was a thong.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed the bride.\u201d Her surprising comment had his brows lifting in surprise.</p><p>He had kissed the bride. Long and deep, to her complete surprise and shocked arousal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d He knelt at her feet, removing the high-heeled shoes from her small feet.</p><p>\u201cThat was so decadent,\u201d she bit out. \u201cKissing her that way, with your tongue. You made her horny.\u201d</p><p>He smothered his laughter. \u201cThat was the point,\u201d he whispered up at her as he caressed the slight welts on the side of her foot.</p><p>She pouted. She had such an intriguing pout, and used it on him often.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to kiss Ella again.\u201d His hand stroked her calf as he felt a small tremor work over her body.</p><p>\u201cSax fucked her. He was at the wedding, of course,\u201d she bit out. \u201cI knew she couldn\u2019t hold out. She gave in too easily.\u201d</p><p>She sounded angry with Ella, though Jesse knew she was more than happy that her friend had finally found some happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou, of course, would be much harder to convince?\u201d he asked her, careful to keep his voice even, his hand on her calf comforting rather than arousing.</p><p>She leveled a hard look at him. \u201cI am not so easy.\u201d</p><p>That was sure as hell the truth. He murmured consoling words, though, massaging her foot, well aware of how the heels made her feet ache.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sister.\u201d She jerked her foot from his grasp, staring down at him angrily. \u201cStop treating me like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up and I\u2019ll turn you over my knee and paddle your ass.\u201d He jerked her foot back. \u201cNow what has you so upset? I thought you were happy for Ella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She was pouting again, watching him darkly.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your problem?\u201d he asked her again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never kissed me like that,\u201d she finally bit out, her cheeks blooming with a flush. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. Her breasts were moving quickly beneath her dress, her nipples hard, poking impatiently at the light fabric. He allowed his hand to stroke higher along the inside of her leg.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can never decide where to put my tongue first.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, confusion filling her expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d Her question was almost a gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d His hand stroked to her thigh. \u201cDo I take your lips and plunge my tongue into your mouth, Terrie, or do I push it as deep and as hard up your pussy as I can, and suck all that sweet cream into my mouth? Deciding is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, her thighs tensed. He watched as she fought to breathe, to draw in air to counter the arousal he saw surging in her gaze. He parted her thighs then, his cock jerking at the sight of the damp spot on the silk of her panties. His gaze rose back to hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that, Terrie? My mouth buried in your cunt, my tongue fucking you to orgasm?\u201d Her thighs opened farther as a strangled moan whispered past her throat.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, and his cock surged in joy then throbbed in disappointment as he gently closed her thighs.</p><p>\u201cRemind me when you\u2019re sober, Terrie.\u201d He stood to his feet, staring down at her shocked expression. \u201cI won\u2019t fuck you drunk. Sober up, then call me. But don\u2019t be surprised if you find out exactly why Sax was at that wedding, and what he\u2019s most likely doing right now to your friend\u2019s climaxing body. You won\u2019t play with me, Terrie,\u201d he warned her softly.</p><p>He turned and left the room, then the house. If he didn\u2019t, he knew he would fuck her, knew he would drive his cock so deep and hard inside her she would scream for her orgasm. And he couldn\u2019t. Not yet. She hadn\u2019t seduced him; she didn\u2019t want it enough. When she did, well then, he grinned, then he would give her everything he had ever dreamed she could take. </p> </body></html>"]
