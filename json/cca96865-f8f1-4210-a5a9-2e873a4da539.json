Seeing as how the village was mostly women, certain commodities ran scarce.</p><p>Hairpins, for one. Ribbons, for another. Curling papers came at a premium.</p><p>And corners. Corners were the scarcest thing of all.</p> <p>Because there were only four in any given ballroom, and here in Spindle Cove, so many ladies were drawn to them.</p><p>As an experienced wallflower, Violet Winterbottom knew to stake her ground and guard it.</p><p>She\u2019d claimed her niche on arrival. A comfortable alcove of the Summerfield grand hall, lightly scented with a hanging bayberry wreath and conveniently situated near the bowl of mulled wine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hiding in the corner, Violet?\u201d Kate Taylor approached and took her by the arm. Lively and sensible, Kate was the Cove\u2019s resident music tutor. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. You should dance.\u201d</p><p>Violet resisted with a smile. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy here.\u201d</p> <p>Kate raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you really?\u201d</p><p>Violet shrugged. In superficial characteristics, she didn\u2019t fit the wallflower mold. She was a young lady of good family, possessed of a generous dowry, and she was\u2014if not a legendary beauty\u2014passably fair in candlelight. Her accomplishments in music and drawing didn\u2019t merit any boasting, but she did speak six modern languages and could read several dead ones. She wasn\u2019t clumsy or jaundiced or afflicted with a lisp.</p><p>And yet...she spent a great deal of time in the corner. More than ever, since The Disappointment.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find you a partner,\u201d Kate said, tugging at her wrist. \u201cThis gown of yours will look beautiful set off against a militiaman\u2019s red coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her be, Miss Taylor.\u201d Sally Bright joined them. \u201cYou know she\u2019s out of sorts. On account of she\u2019s leaving us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Kate squeezed her hand. \u201cDear Violet. We\u2019ll miss you terribly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll miss all of you.\u201d</p><p>Her parents had finally lost patience with Violet\u2019s extended absence. They wanted to see their youngest daughter settled, and they\u2019d determined that this coming Season would be the Season. The family carriage would come for her tomorrow, and Violet would have no choice but to pack all her belongings into it and return to London. To her family\u2019s town house. Which was so horribly, painfully situated right next door to his.</p><p>Please don\u2019t let him be home. Let him still be oceans away.</p><p>In a nervous gesture, Violet ran both gloved hands over her emerald silk. \u201cMy parents want me home with the family for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sally said. \u201cWe Brights always spend Christmas hoping our father don\u2019t turn up. That old blackguard\u2019s like the ague. He has a nasty way of coming \u2019round in winter.\u201d</p><p>The Bright family shared two qualities: they all had startling white-blond hair, and they all worked together to run the village\u2019s All Things shop. Sally tended the counter, cheerfully dealing both wares and gossip. The eldest, Errol, brought in goods from other towns. Twins Rufus and Finn stocked the place while their beleaguered mother looked after the youngest children. Their father was largely absent\u2014and, from what Violet had gathered\u2014not missed.</p><p>\u201cBut Violet, if you\u2019re leaving tomorrow, that\u2019s all the more reason you should dance tonight,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe should all be dancing. My goodness, look at them.\u201d</p><p>She gestured toward the far side of the hall. There, the assembled militiamen of Spindle Cove stood in single file, as though it were their solemn duty to buttress the wall. They wore lobster-red coats, snow-white breeches, gold braid, brass buttons, and matching expressions of unease.</p> <p>Kate shook her head. \u201cAfter all the months we\u2019ve waited for this ball, they mean to stand there like beanpoles and stare at us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting?\u201d Violet asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kate sighed. \u201cRomance, perhaps? Don\u2019t you ever dream that someday a dark, mysterious, handsome gentleman will suddenly notice you across a crowded ballroom? And he\u2019ll cross the room to you, and ask you to dance, and fall madly in love with you forever?\u201d</p><p>Sally shook her head. \u201cNever happens in real life. Just ask my mother.\u201d</p><p>Just ask me, Violet almost said aloud.</p><p>The dream Kate described had happened to her, once. In a setting much like this one, almost a year ago. A man she\u2019d adored for years had finally noticed her. Locked gazes with her across a crowded room, then carved his way through the throng to take her hand.</p><p>But in the end, he had proved to be a disappointment.</p><p>The Disappointment.</p><p>\u201cHappy endings do exist,\u201d Kate insisted. \u201cYou have only to look at Lord and Lady Rycliff for the proof.\u201d</p><p>They all turned to admire their hosts. Violet had to admit, they were a splendid couple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic, the way he keeps touching the small of her back. And the look in his eyes...\u201d Kate sighed wistfully. \u201cHe\u2019s devoted to her. And Susanna is the picture of bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s happy,\u201d Violet said. \u201cLord Rycliff is a very honorable, very decent man.\u201d Unlike some so-called gentlemen. \u201cWe all should be so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Kate said. \u201cBut what if luck has nothing to do with it? This is Spindle Cove. Who says we must stand about waiting on the men? Perhaps we should stop hoping to be noticed and do some noticing ourselves.\u201d</p><p>What Violet noticed was a shriek. The startled cry pierced the crowded ballroom, freezing them all in place.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>The other guests pressed to the edges of the ballroom, revealing what Violet could not see. A set of doors that opened onto the garden had been flung open.</p><p>A figure stood silhouetted in the entry. Tall. Dark. Menacing.</p><p>The militiamen reached for the sabers slung at their sides. Violet would have felt more reassured if she didn\u2019t know they were ornamental blades, better suited for slicing soft cheese than running an intruder through.</p><p>As the host, lord, and commanding officer, Lord Rycliff stepped forward. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>But one thing was obvious, immediately. The man was not from Spindle Cove. This was a small village, and all the residents knew one another\u2014by sight, if not by name. This intruder was a stranger to them all.</p><p>He was also large. Streaked with grime. Dripping wet.</p><p>And moving. Staggering, stumbling...directly toward her alcove.</p><p>The men drew those sabers now, and some of them rushed forward. Corporal Thorne looked fully prepared to skewer the man\u2014dull blade notwithstanding.</p><p>But the intruder did not pose a threat for long. Before any of the militiamen could reach him, he collapsed.</p><p>Right at Violet\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness.\u201d</p><p>As he slid to the floor, he clutched at her skirts, tangling with them. By the time the man\u2019s head met parquet with a heavy thud, a long streak of blood marred her watered silk.</p><p>Violet sank to her knees. She hadn\u2019t much choice. She pressed her gloved hand to the intruder\u2019s neck, searching for his pulse. Her satin-sheathed fingertips came away bright red. And trembling.</p><p>Kate and Sally crouched beside her.</p><p>\u201cDear heaven,\u201d Kate breathed. \u201cHe\u2019s just covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dirt,\u201d Sally said. \u201cBut cor, he\u2019s gorgeous anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally, only you could think of such a thing at a time like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t notice. Just look at those cheekbones. That strong jaw. Pity about the nose, but those lips are made for sin. He\u2019s like a fallen angel, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fallen,\u201d Kate said. \u201cSo much is certain.\u201d</p><p>Violet removed her soiled glove and pressed her bare hand to the man\u2019s chilled, dirt-streaked face. He moaned and tightened his grip on her skirts.</p><p>Sally gave her a sly look. \u201cWhoever he is, he seems to be rather taken with Miss Winterbottom.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s face heated. She never knew how to act at a ball, but this situation was entirely missing from the etiquette books. When a man lumbered across a ballroom and collapsed at a lady\u2019s feet, shouldn\u2019t the lady offer him some comfort? It seemed the only decent thing.</p><p>Then again, she\u2019d made that error in the past\u2014offering comfort to a wounded man, and letting him take too much. She\u2019d spent the past year paying for that very mistake.</p><p>\u201cPardon me. Let me through.\u201d Susanna, Lady Rycliff, pushed through the crowd and knelt at the man\u2019s side. \u201cI need to find the source of his bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Lord Rycliff joined her. \u201cLet me check him for weapons first. We don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s someone who needs help,\u201d Susanna answered. \u201cWithout delay. He\u2019s chilled through. And he has a nasty gash to his head, see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the man. How can he be a threat? He\u2019s barely conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift your hands from him,\u201d Lord Rycliff demanded in a low, stern voice. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>With a tiny huff of breath, Susanna raised both hands to shoulder height. \u201cFine. Do it quickly, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne, see to his boots. I\u2019ll take the pockets.\u201d Lord Rycliff patted the man\u2019s chest and waistband and riffled through the pockets of his simple dark-blue coat. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaught here, either.\u201d Thorne turned the man\u2019s weathered, hard-toed boots upside down and shook them.</p><p>\u201cNot even a bit of coin?\u201d asked Kate. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s the victim of a robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I do my work now?\u201d Susanna asked. At her husband\u2019s nod of consent, she motioned to a footman. \u201cBring blankets and bandages, immediately.\u201d She turned to the ladies. \u201cKate, can you fetch my kit from the stillroom? Sally, do bring a cup of mulled wine.\u201d After removing her gloves, she pressed her bare hands to the wounded man\u2019s feet. \u201cLike ice,\u201d she muttered, wincing. \u201cHot bricks, please,\u201d she called to the servants, lifting her head.</p><p>Thorne plucked a cluster of Irish moss from the man\u2019s boot. \u201cIt\u2019s seawater. He must have washed up in the Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. But if he washed up in the Cove, how did he make it all the way here?\u201d</p><p>Lord Rycliff\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cMore to the point, why?\u201d</p><p>The stranger began to tremble violently. Words spilled from his bluish lips. He muttered a steady stream of words in a foreign tongue.</p><p>Rycliff frowned. \u201cWhat language is that? Not English. Nor French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet will know,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cShe knows every language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Violet protested. \u201cOnly a dozen or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish. You once learned Romany in an hour, when that baby was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t learned Romany at all. She\u2019d learned, through trial and error, that one of the women spoke a bit of Italian, and they\u2019d translated back and forth\u2014with a great deal of hand gestures and pantomime added to the mix. It hadn\u2019t been elegant translation, but it had been effective in the end\u2014enough to help a frightened mother and her feverish babe.</p><p>Language was a vast, complicated tapestry. The key to communication was finding a common thread.</p><p>To that end, Violet pushed aside her emotions and concentrated on the man\u2019s words. \u201cIt\u2019s...some sort of Celtic dialect, from the sound of things. Not my particular area of expertise. Perhaps he\u2019s Welsh?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand to request silence. She willed even her heartbeat to stop its pounding, so she might better hear his words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Definitely a Celtic language of some sort. But on further listen, it didn\u2019t sound like Welsh after all. Much less Gaelic or Manx.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Sally returned with a steaming cup of mulled wine. \u201cHave him drink this.\u201d</p><p>With help, Violet lifted the man\u2019s head and put the cup to his lips. He sipped and coughed, then sipped again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she said in English, hoping the reassuring tone would translate even if the words did not. \u201cTell me how to help.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back and looked up at her.</p><p>Violet\u2019s breath caught. A jolt of recognition struck her so hard, it set the whole ballroom spinning.</p><p>His eyes. Good heavens, those eyes. They were the rich, layered brown of spice and tobacco. They held an intelligence that belied his coarse, simple garments. They conveyed desperation, a plea for help.</p><p>But most of all, those eyes looked...familiar.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be, she told herself. It made no rational sense. But the longer she stared into those spice-brown eyes, the stronger her sense of affinity grew. Violet felt as though she were gazing into a face she\u2019d seen before. A set of features more familiar than her own looking-glass reflection. The face that haunted her dreams.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His hand seized hers. She gasped at the sudden contact, and the painful chill of his flesh.</p><p>The flow of his words narrowed. He began to repeat one phrase. Just the same chain of syllables, over and over again. Violet listened hard. Once she caught the seam of the phrase and followed it a few times, she was able to unravel its meaning.</p><p>\u201cCan you understand him?\u201d Lord Rycliff asked.</p><p>\u201cA little. I think he\u2019s speaking in...\u201d She paused and listened again. \u201cWell, it\u2019s almost Cornish. But not quite. I think it\u2019s...Breton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBreton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never studied it, so I can\u2019t be sure. But I\u2019ve heard some Cornish, and I know Breton is its closest lingual relation. They\u2019re so close, you see\u2014Cornwall and Brittany. Only separated by a small stretch of sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittany,\u201d Rycliff echoed. \u201cAs in Brittany, France.\u201d</p><p>Violet nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe same France with which we are at war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the ballroom went on alert. Violet saw the alarm in their eyes as the uniformed men looked from one to another. A Frenchman, washed up on the beach in Spindle Cove? As a militia, they were organized to prevent this very occurrence.</p><p>\u201cAsk him where he\u2019s come from,\u201d Rycliff said. \u201cAre there others?\u201d</p> <p>A footman returned with blankets. But as he moved to heap them atop the shivering man, Lord Rycliff stayed him with an open hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it he\u2019s saying, Miss Winterbottom? We must know if the Cove is under attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only saying one thing that I can understand. It\u2019s the same phrase, over and over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She touched her fingertips to the man\u2019s cheek. \u201cNedeleg laouen,\u201d she repeated. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>She was an angel.</p><p>His very own angel.</p><p>He had thought he would die, staggering through the cold night. Blood trickling down his neck. Seawater trickling everywhere else, freezing his clothes to his body. As he\u2019d trudged over meadows and fields toward the bright, shining star of this place, he\u2019d been so certain he would perish.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen. He\u2019d despaired. But he\u2019d struggled to his feet and continued, because there was nothing else he could do. And when he\u2019d almost reached the doors of this glittering warmth, he\u2019d spied her\u2014a vision of emerald silk and golden hair. Standing in the corner, as though she were waiting there for him. She gave him strength to drag his numb limbs forward, telling himself... If he died tonight, he would die holding that beautiful girl.</p><p>Or, as it happened, he would die with the beautiful girl holding him.</p><p>\u201cNedeleg laouen,\u201d he stammered once more through frozen lips.</p><p>Her mouth curved in a little smile. Soft fingers caressed his cheek once more. \u201cNedeleg laouen.\u201d</p><p>Merciful God. A miracle. She understood him. She touched him. This was a gift he did not deserve.</p><p>Nothing had gone as it should. So many stupid mistakes. Fool. Jackass. Azen gomek. His superiors would be displeased. If he even survived to see them again, they might make him wish he\u2019d died.</p><p>But she was here. And she was dressed in green silk and touching his face. This was heaven, for the moment.</p><p>A red coat appeared in his vision. The one they called Rycliff. Clearly the lord, or the commander, or something of both. This Rycliff took him by the collar and barked questions. First in English, then in French.</p><p>He could only answer in Breton. \u201cCorentin Morvan eo ma anv. Me a zo un tamm peizant.\u201d My name is Corentin Morvan. I am a humble farmhand.</p><p>Rycliff released him, then traded remarks with the angel in green silk.</p><p>Another woman claimed his attention. This one had hair of flame, and freckles dusted like cinders across her cheeks. She didn\u2019t bother speaking in English or French, but instead pantomimed with expansive motions. He might have found this amusing, were he in less pain.</p><p>They were going to move him, he gathered. His head would be bandaged.</p><p>He nodded his understanding.</p><p>Good, good. Let it be so.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go anywhere in this condition. And she would save him the unpleasant task of doing it himself.</p><p>He clasped his angel\u2019s hand tight as the men carried him into another room. He found himself settled on a long, upholstered bench close to a fire. The sudden flare of warmth made him shiver harder.</p><p>He knew he ought to be planning. His mind should never be idle in such a situation. At the very least, he should be scanning the room for potential weapons and his fastest route of escape.</p><p>But he was too cold. Too gripped by pain. Too lost in the blue of her eyes. Too enslaved by the tenderness of her fingertips. This hour of his life must be lived in small increments. One tiny action after another.</p><p>His heart gave a soft thump in his chest.</p><p>His lungs drew a painful breath.</p><p>He gripped her pale, soft hand as if it were his only hold on consciousness. Perhaps it was. Enough pride remained to him that he did not want to faint in front of a pretty girl.</p><p>A blanket draped his body. Heavy. Warm. Hands turned him onto to his side. Somewhere beneath the upholstery, an unyielding spar of wood dug against his ribs.</p><p>Something sharp gouged his scalp. He winced and swore.</p><p>The flame-haired woman spoke words in English as she unstoppered a small glass vial. His heart rate quickened. He suspected he would not enjoy the contents of that vial.</p><p>He was right.</p><p>She turned his head. Liquid fire poured over his raw, open wound, and pain ripped through his pounding skull. The edges of his vision went black.</p><p>They meant to torture him, perhaps. But he would not break.</p><p>\u201cCorentin Morvan eo ma anv,\u201d he growled, beginning the standard litany. My name is Corentin Morvan. I am a humble farmhand. I know nothing. Nothing. I swear on the Virgin this is true. Pain wrenched the words from his throat and pushed them through the sieve of his clenched teeth.</p><p>When he\u2019d mastered his breath, he looked up at his angel in green silk. Worry drew fine lines across her brow. Her blue eyes were wells of concern.</p><p>But still she touched him, so softly. So gently.</p><p>A true mercy, after all he\u2019d done.</p><p>A needle tugged through his scalp. This time, he took no note of the pain. There would be time enough later for the pain. He concentrated on her sweet caress instead.</p><p>Leaning close, she whispered something in his ear. He could not respond, but he could enjoy the orange blossom fragrance of her hair. There was lace edging her dress. He counted its scallops and points, treasuring each one.</p><p>God, how he longed to touch her. She was so close, so lovely. It had been so long. He wanted to reach out and skim his chilled, callused fingertip over that lacy border and the creamy perfection of her collarbone.</p><p>A dozen armed soldiers hovered about, ready to gut him in moments, should he dare. Even so, the idea tempted. One stolen caress might have been worth his life.</p><p>But there were other lives at stake. Lives more important and worthy than the life of Corentin Morvan, a humble farmhand. So he closed his eyes and pushed temptation away.</p><p>When the stitching was finished, the flame-haired woman put away her vials and implements. She spoke with the officer. Plans were being made. Men were being dispatched.</p><p>The girl in emerald silk nodded as someone handed her a pair of gloves. Fine gloves of soft leather, lined with fur. Gloves meant for wearing in the cold.</p><p>Which meant she was leaving. They would part him from his angel.</p><p>No.</p><p>Mustering what remained of his strength, he threw an arm about her waist and flung his head in her lap. She startled and froze, but she did not recoil. Cool silk teased against his cheek, and beneath it he felt the warmth of her skin.</p><p>\u201cOnly her,\u201d he muttered in Breton. \u201cNo one but her. She alone understands. You cannot take her from me.\u201d</p><p>And then he made a true ass of himself.</p><p>He fainted dead away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s collapsed,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cFrom the pain, most likely.\u201d</p><p>Violet gulped, staring at the man so indecently sprawled face-down in her lap. She could view the stitches Susanna had used to mend his injury. They were neat work, but the wound was ugly. A ragged, red gash carved through his dark brown hair.</p><p>Lord Rycliff moved toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll get him off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Violet laid a tentative touch across the man\u2019s broad shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s wounded and confused. It\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d cling to the one person who understands him a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you understand him or not...\u201d Rycliff shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I do either, Violet thought. But she wasn\u2019t prepared to abandon him. Not until she learned more.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind him being in here, Papa?\u201d Susanna asked her father. They\u2019d all migrated to the library of Sir Lewis Finch. It had been the nearest room to the great hall with a fire in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d Sir Lewis answered. \u201cYou know I collect curiosities of all sorts. But we might send in some footmen with a tarpaulin.\u201d He cocked his head and surveyed the growing puddle beneath the dripping man.</p><p>\u201cAnd dry clothing,\u201d Susanna added. \u201cHe ought to fit something of Bram\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Rufus Bright and Aaron Dawes entered the room, breathing hard with exertion. When the stranger had disrupted the ball, Lord Rycliff had dispatched some militiamen to assess the situation in the cove.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything?\u201d Rycliff asked.</p><p>\u201cNo ships,\u201d Rufus answered, huffing for breath. \u201cAnd all\u2019s clear at the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when we took the path down to the cove, we found the remnants of a small boat,\u201d Dawes added. \u201cWrecked and washed ashore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bollocks.\u201d To the side of the room, Finn Bright spoke up. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you lot went down to the cove without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we did,\u201d his twin said, unapologetic. \u201cWe had to run.\u201d</p><p>Finn didn\u2019t argue. He just punched the floor with his crutch.</p><p>Violet hurt for the youth. Everyone did. Finn was fifteen years old, full of energy and cleverness. And since an accident a few months ago, the lad was missing a foot. For the most part, Finn masked his frustration with a brave face and his characteristic good humor. But the fact that he had an able-bodied twin in Rufus\u2014an exact copy of himself who could still run, march, climb, and dance with ease\u2014had to make it more difficult.</p><p>\u201cA boat, you say?\u201d Susanna peered at the man in Violet\u2019s lap, dabbing his scraped temple with a moistened cloth. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s a fisherman who drifted off course and met with an accident.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rycliff was clearly skeptical. \u201cA fisherman from Brittany, blown all the way off course to Sussex and washed up in our cove.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot impossible,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll admit, it seems rather unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a smuggler, I\u2019ll warrant.\u201d This declaration came from Finn. \u201cSeparated from his mates when the Excise come calling. My father consorted with enough of the rogues. I should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smuggler. Now that I\u2019d believe,\u201d Rycliff said. \u201cGood thinking, Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I\u2019m still good for something.\u201d Finn crutched his way over from the corner. He gave the intruder an assessing look. \u201cTake care with him, my lady. You\u2019d wake tomorrow to find him gone, and all Summerfield\u2019s silver with him.\u201d</p><p>Rycliff said, \u201cI\u2019ll send for a magistrate in the morning. But in the meantime, we can\u2019t rule out other possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other possibilities?\u201d Violet asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from France,\u201d Rycliff explained, as if it should be obvious. \u201cHe could be a soldier or a spy, scouting possible invasion sites.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cHe could be listening to us right now.\u201d</p><p>Was he listening? Violet looked down at the man in her lap, wondering if he truly were insensible. To test, she gave his earlobe a surreptitious pinch.</p><p>No reaction.</p><p>Well, that was reassuring.</p><p>Or was it suspicious?</p><p>Violet couldn\u2019t honestly say. She\u2019d never pinched an unconscious man\u2019s earlobe, and she had no idea what reaction to expect. Neither did she know the expected reaction of a man who was merely pretending to be unconscious. And if he were any good at pretending, he would do the exact opposite of the expected reaction. Whatever that was.</p><p>Lord, she was a ninny. An earlobe-pinching ninny. So much for her deductive powers on that score.</p><p>\u201cBram, you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d Susanna shook her head. \u201cNapoleon\u2019s certainly not invading here, if even one rowboat cannot land without splintering on our rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, we must be prepared.\u201d Lord Rycliff turned to Rufus Bright and Aaron Dawes. \u201cThe two of you will escort the ladies back to the rooming house. Then you\u2019ll patrol the village the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Once the two left, Rycliff addressed the remaining militiamen. \u201cThe rest of us will march to the castle. There\u2019s a reason the Normans set the heap up on those cliffs. They\u2019re the best place to be in case of attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Finn said.</p><p>Rycliff put a hand to the lad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot so fast. You\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying here?\u201d Finn\u2019s voice was edged with frustration. \u201cI\u2019m a militia volunteer. You can\u2019t just leave me behind, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assigning you to Summerfield. Fosbury will stay too. Next to Dawes, he\u2019s biggest, and a tavern-keeper\u2019s handy with unconscious men. This is an important duty, Finn. The two of you must guard the captive and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captive?\u201d Susanna laughed a little. \u201cYou make this all sound so melodramatic. Don\u2019t you mean the patient?\u201d</p> <p>Her husband gave her a dark look.</p><p>Susanna threw up her hands. \u201cFar be it from me to ruin your excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, Finn. You\u2019re to guard the captive and protect Miss Winterbottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect me?\u201d Violet asked. \u201cI\u2019m to stay too?\u201d</p><p>Lord Rycliff turned to her. \u201cI must ask it of you. Chances are, he\u2019ll wake. We\u2019ll need someone here who can talk to him. Try to ascertain who he is, where he came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how am I to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe creative.\u201d He cast a glance at the man slumped across her lap. \u201cHe likes you. Use that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat can you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re not suggesting Violet employ some sort of feminine wiles to earn his trust,\u201d Susanna said.</p><p>Rycliff shrugged. A clear admission that yes, that was exactly his suggestion.</p><p>Everyone in the room turned to Violet. And stared. She could easily imagine the thoughts running through their minds. Could Violet Winterbottom possibly possess a single feminine wile to employ?</p><p>Even if she did possess wiles, she wouldn\u2019t know how to use them. Her best stab at interrogation technique involved earlobe pinching, and look at how that had turned out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit up with you, Violet,\u201d Susanna said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Rycliff told his wife. \u201cThis day\u2019s been too much exertion already, what with the ball and this excitement. You need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Bram...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. I\u2019m not risking your health, much less...\u201d The look on his face was stern but loving, and the protective touch he laid to his wife\u2019s belly made his argument perfectly clear. Susanna needed to rest because...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with child,\u201d Violet whispered to herself.</p><p>As the couple shared a tender, knowing look, Violet swelled with happiness for her friend. She felt a touch of envy too. Susanna and Lord Rycliff had, in her observation, the ideal marriage. They understood one another, completely and implicitly. They disagreed and argued openly, demanded a great deal of each other and themselves, and they loved one another through it all. They were partners. Not just in love, but in life.</p><p>Violet\u2019s chances of finding that deep affinity looked slimmer than onionskin. There was only one man she\u2019d ever dreamed could know her so well, and respect her as his equal. But she\u2019d been so wrong about him. And ever since The Disappointment, she hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>The man in her lap stirred, mumbling and latching one arm about her waist.</p><p>Violet froze, stunned immobile by the wash of long-forgotten sensations. The sensation of being touched. Of being needed.</p><p>Don\u2019t be made a fool again.</p><p>\u201cWell, Violet?\u201d Susanna looked at her expectantly.</p><p>She shook herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you feel safe with him?\u201d Susanna indicated the sleeping man in her lap.</p><p>Beware, her heart pounded. Beware, beware.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI have Finn and Mr. Fosbury to sit up with me. And the whole house of servants, should we need them.\u201d</p><p>And that was how Miss Violet Winterbottom, habitual wallflower, found herself in Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s Egyptian-themed library, keeping vigil with a hobbled youth, a tavern keeper, and an unconscious man who just might be a spy.</p><p>A pair of footmen entered, bringing fresh blankets and dry garments. While they tended to the unconscious man, Violet busied herself studying the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Sir Lewis Finch was a celebrated inventor of weaponry and a noted collector of antiquities. His library held all sorts of treasures.</p><p>In the end, she selected an illustrated compendium, Birds of England\u2014for she reasoned that she wouldn\u2019t be able to actually read. If she was to sit beside the mysterious, handsome intruder all night, her concentration was bound to be compromised.</p><p>Hopefully, it would be the only thing compromised.</p><p>By the time the footmen left, the great house had gone quiet. Finn paced back and forth before the window, half-patrolling, half-pouting. Fosbury deposited himself in an armchair near the fire and set about paring his fingernails.</p><p>Violet took the chair nearest the sleeping stranger and placed her book on a reading stand. But instead of looking at it, she stared at him. His face had been wiped clean of grime and blood. At last, she could take a good, long look at the man and put her absurd suspicions to rest.</p><p>The linen shirt the footmen had given him draped crisply over his shoulders. The collar gaped, revealing his upper chest. She couldn\u2019t help but look. He was tanned and muscled there, as she supposed all farmhands must be. Violet had touched a man\u2019s bare chest, once. But that had been a lean, aristocratic torso\u2014not nearly so rugged and...firm.</p><p>Pity about the nose, Sally had opined earlier.</p><p>Pity indeed. The man\u2019s nose had clearly been broken, at least once. It had a rugged line to it, almost like a lightning bolt. A significant portion of his left temple and cheek were abraded and red.</p><p>Violet could not say that the scrapes and broken nose made him less handsome\u2014and even if they did make him a fraction less handsome, they made him ten times more virile and attractive. What was it about a visible, flesh-and-bone record of violence that made a man so alluring? She couldn\u2019t explain it, but she felt it.</p><p>Oh, she felt it.</p><p>She swallowed hard. No man had stirred her interest for quite some time. In fact, there was only one man who\u2019d ever made her feel like this\u2014and that man was half a world away.</p><p>Or was he?</p><p>Violet\u2019s pulse drummed. She dragged her gaze over every strand of his thick, dark hair and every facet of his exquisitely cut cheekbones. She recalled the warm, spice-brown hue of his eyes and the instant affinity she\u2019d felt when they\u2019d locked gazes in the ballroom.</p><p>If she looked beyond the injuries and dark scruff of his unshaven jaw, imagined him dressed in finely tailored wool rather than coarse homespun... Dear Lord, the resemblance would be uncanny.</p><p>It\u2019s him, her heart whispered.</p><p>But what did her heart know? It was a stupid thing, easily fooled.</p><p>Violet shook herself. She was imagining things, that was all. Yes, the two men shared dark hair, brown eyes, and fine cheekbones. But the similarities ended there. The differences were legion. One was Breton; the other, English. One was muscled and built for labor; the other, aristocratic and lean. One was sprawled unconscious on this divan, and the other was gallivanting about the West Indies, sparing nary a thought for her.</p><p>This man was not The Disappointment.</p><p>He was a mystery. And Violet had one night to solve him.</p><p>She cocked her head. Was that a scar, just under his jaw? Blade-thin and straight. As if someone had pressed a knife to his throat.</p><p>With a glance toward Finn and Fosbury, she moved her chair closer to the divan. Then she leaned in, angling her head for a better look.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she whispered, mostly to herself. \u201cWhat are you wanting here?\u201d</p><p>One hand shot out, catching her by the hair. Violet gasped at the sharp yank on a thousand nerve endings.</p><p>His eyes flew open, clear and intense. She read his answer in them.</p><p>You. I\u2019m wanting you.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>They flew at him in moments, the two guards. Shouting, tugging. Almost before he understood what was happening.</p><p>He was horizontal. He was half-dressed. Her sweet face hovered above him, and he had one hand firmly tangled in the golden silk of her hair. If not for the pair of red-coated dullards raging at him, this could have been just another dream.</p><p>Let her go, they gestured.</p><p>Let her go, he told himself.</p><p>And yet, somehow he couldn\u2019t. His fingers wouldn\u2019t obey. They were heeding instinct, not reason. And his body\u2019s every instinct was to hold her fast and tight.</p><p>\u201cTranquillez-vous,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cCalmez-vous.\u201d</p><p>Be still? Be calm? God above, he could not be calm. Not with her voice flowing over him like raw honey, her orange-blossom scent everywhere. His heart raced beneath the borrowed shirt he\u2019d been given. Some few feet lower, his cock stirred under the woolen blanket.</p><p>Well. Good to know the thing hadn\u2019t frozen off.</p><p>God\u2019s truth, man. You are an undeserving beast.</p><p>Let her go.</p><p>At last, his fingers went slack in her hair.</p><p>In a heartbeat, she\u2019d jumped back. Then the two redcoats jumped on him. They dealt him a few blows\u2014nothing he didn\u2019t deserve. When they wrestled him to the floor, he made only feeble resistance. If he fought them, he would have to leave them dead, and he didn\u2019t want to do that.</p><p>The big one held him down, pressing a knee into his kidneys and wrenching his arms behind his back. The young one lashed his wrists together with cord. Then, after a bit of conferring, they picked him up and slammed him into a heavy, straight-backed chair. They wound a rope around his chest four times, binding him to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He remained that way for several moments, struggling to master his breathing. Each time he gulped for air, the ropes took a sharper bite of his flesh.</p><p>He was aware of conversation on the other side of the room. They were debating what to do with him.</p><p>Eventually, his angel returned.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d like to beat you,\u201d she said in French, dropping into a chair some few feet distant. \u201cBut I\u2019ve convinced them to let me try conversation first.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, carefully keeping his expression blank. Revealing no hint of comprehension.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d she continued, anticipating his concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to speak this way. You can trust me. I won\u2019t tell a soul. My Breton is poor, but my French is quite good.\u201d</p><p>Her French was impeccable. He could have closed his eyes and imagined her to be a native speaker. But damned if he\u2019d close his eyes when she was so near. At last, he could openly gaze upon every feature of her sweet, lovely face. Whimsical rose-petal lips and china-blue eyes, balanced by a sensible nose and intelligent brow.</p><p>She slid a glance toward their guards. \u201cThey won\u2019t understand us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any French.\u201d</p><p>Still he hesitated. Perhaps the guards didn\u2019t speak French, but they might recognize the language when they heard it spoken. And if they knew he spoke French, they would inform Rycliff. He would be subjected to interrogation. He did not fear interrogation itself, but he could not afford further delays.</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cI know you can understand me. I see it in your eyes. I would like to understand you too.\u201d</p><p>God. She spoke to the fondest wish of his heart.</p><p>\u201cEt bien,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe will understand each other.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her chair a bit closer, partially blocking the militiamen\u2019s view of their conversation. Nevertheless, the guards remained too near. He would need to play this carefully. So long as they were being watched, he couldn\u2019t say anything\u2014in any language\u2014that might be overheard, remembered and deciphered later.</p><p>She asked in French, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me who you really are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Corentin Morvan,\u201d he answered. \u201cI am a humble Breton farmhand.\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow arched. She didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI walked across the fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the cove?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you come to be in the cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy way of a boat.\u201d</p> <p>Her breath released in a little sigh of frustration. \u201cYou are teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It is a great pleasure to tease a pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>A blush warmed her cheeks. The sudden desire to touch her was nigh on unbearable. It made his skin tight and his fingers restless. He chafed against his bindings.</p><p>Her voice became stern. \u201cIf you don\u2019t answer me honestly, I\u2019ll alert Lord Rycliff to the fact that you speak French. Then he could pummel the answers from you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo amount of pummeling could accomplish that. But for another sip of that wine and your slightest touch, mon ange? I fear I would betray my own mother.\u201d</p><p>She offered him the cup of wine, raising it to his lips. He curled his neck to drink from it, holding her gaze as he sipped.</p><p>As she lowered the cup, the smallest trickle of wine escaped. She reached out instinctively, dabbing the errant droplet with her thumb. Her touch grazed the corner of his mouth.</p><p>A cascade of pure bliss shimmered through him. Like stars swirling in the black of night. Windmilling through the dark places of his body, his heart, his soul.</p><p>\u201cYou are too kind, mademoiselle.\u201d He tilted his head and regarded her from a new angle. \u201cIt is \u2018mademoiselle\u2019? Not \u2018madame\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked. \u201cI am not married, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetrothed?\u201d</p><p>Again, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo you are particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not particular, I am almost a...\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know the word in French. I am unmarried because no one has asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has asked?\u201d He made a noise in his throat. \u201cEnglishmen are fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Breton farmhands,\u201d she said, \u201care apparently shameless flirts. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re hoping to distract me, change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Your marital status is a subject I greatly wish to discuss.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBe serious, I beg you. You must tell me the truth. Can\u2019t you see? Lord Rycliff will send for the magistrate in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagistrates do not frighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am frightened for you.\u201d</p><p>He looked into her blue eyes, and he could see it was true. She cared. Perhaps she cared no more for him than she would any other lost, benighted soul. But right now, it didn\u2019t matter. She cared, and he felt it to his bones.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to Spindle Cove tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI had an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn appointment? With whom?\u201d</p><p>He swept her with a warm, caressing gaze. \u201cWith an angel, apparently.\u201d</p><p>She clucked her tongue. \u201cMore teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo teasing. I am here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s not teasing, it\u2019s a flat-out lie.\u201d</p><p>He inched the chair forward, desperate to close the distance between them. He spoke to her quietly, honestly. From the depths of his cold, longsuffering heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you, mon ange. Violet. I would cross a world for you.\u201d</p><p>Violet went perfectly still.</p><p>When she could manage it, she whispered four words. In English. \u201cYou know my name.\u201d</p><p>His expression betrayed no understanding. He sat back in his chair and blinked.</p><p>She tried again. \u201cYou know me.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>In her lap, Violet\u2019s hands balled into fists. She didn\u2019t understand. If he knew her and needed her help, why didn\u2019t he just say so? But if he were truly a stranger, how had he learned her name?</p><p>Across the room, Mr. Fosbury looked up. \u201cAny progress, Miss Winterbottom?\u201d</p><p>Well. There was one question answered. Hadn\u2019t her friends been calling her by name all evening? Beginning with Kate and Susanna in the ballroom, and ending with Mr. Fosbury right now. The name Violet Winterbottom was hardly a secret.</p><p>Violet rose from her chair. \u201cI\u2019m having difficulty making him out,\u201d she told the tavern-keeper, giving him a self-conscious smile. \u201cPerhaps some tea will help me concentrate.\u201d</p><p>She rose and went to a table where the maids had laid out tea service. As she poured a fragrant, steaming cupful, her mind churned.</p><p>It was easy enough to explain how he\u2019d learned her name. But that didn\u2019t explain the intensity in his eyes. It didn\u2019t explain the way he affected her, deep inside.</p><p>It didn\u2019t explain the eerily familiar freckle beneath his left ear.</p><p>Violet. I would cross a world for you.</p><p>The memory sent a frisson chasing over her skin.</p><p>It was impossible, unthinkable. But the more she observed and spoke with the man, the more she felt certain he was The Disappointment.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Time to stop hiding from that name.</p><p>She felt certain he was Christian. There were differences, yes. But the similarities were so numerous, and her reaction to him so strong, she was starting to believe it must be him.</p><p>And yet\u2014if he were Christian, what was he doing here, and not in the West Indies? Why would he bother to row into the cove, trudge across fields, and claim to be a Breton farmhand? He could have simply pulled up in the drive, knocked at the door, and said, \u201cI\u2019m Lord Christian Pierce, third son of the Duke of Winford.\u201d It\u2019s not as though he would have difficulty speaking to Violet, if he wished to. And he hadn\u2019t wished to\u2014not in almost a year.</p><p>Christian would not have crossed a world for her. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to cross the square and bid her a proper farewell.</p><p>As she stirred sugar into her tea, she stole another look at the dark, intriguing man lashed to a chair. Perhaps even he didn\u2019t know who he was. Perhaps he was stark raving mad, or suffering from amnesia.</p><p>She let the spoon fall to the tray, exasperated with her mind\u2019s wild contortions. \u201cTruly, Violet,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cAmnesia?\u201d</p><p>She returned to her chair, not knowing what to think, nor even what to hope.</p><p>\u201cWill you take tea?\u201d she asked in French.</p><p>He made a face. \u201cWine is more to my taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She offered the wine to him, holding the cup to his lips. He took a languid draught, staring at her all the while. She watched his bared, unshaven throat working as he swallowed. The view felt sensual and intimate.</p><p>When she lowered the wine, his heated gaze roamed her body. \u201cI have come to a realization, mon ange. Englishmen are not merely fools. They are perfect idiots.\u201d</p><p>A blush burned its way up her chest.</p><p>Violet, concentrate.</p><p>\u201cWe seem to be at an impasse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou refuse to divulge your secrets. So I\u2019ve been thinking...perhaps I should first share mine.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow arched. \u201cYou? Have secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d She looked around them. \u201cThis place, Spindle Cove? It\u2019s a holiday locale for young ladies who are ill or awkward. Or unconventional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which kind of young lady are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fourth kind. Scandalous.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her tea, stalling. After a year of keeping quiet, was she truly going to tell this story, this way? But she could think of no better way to test him.</p><p>\u201cA year ago,\u201d she said, \u201cI surrendered my virtue. Easily. To a man who\u2019d made me no promise\u2014not so much as a hint\u2014of marriage. And when he left me, I fled here. Because I feared I might find myself with child, and I didn\u2019t want anyone to know what I\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>She watched his reaction carefully. But just like with the earlobe pinching, she was unsure what reaction to expect. The set of his jaw conveyed concern. His eyes widened with a hint of surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell your family?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI never spoke a word of it to anyone. Not until just now.\u201d</p><p>And the secret had never grown any easier to carry. Quite the reverse. Every time she\u2019d felt tempted to share the story with someone, it was as though she\u2019d lacquered it over with a new coat of resin. Adding layer after layer, sometimes daily, until the truth was a hard, heavy lump in her chest.</p><p>\u201cYour fears of a child...?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cCame to nothing. But clearly, I\u2019m not such an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d\u2014he leaned forward, such as his bindings allowed\u2014\u201dare an angel still. The one who did this to you? He is a devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cThe devil next door. I\u2019d known him all my life and adored him quietly for most of it. When we were younger, he teased me mercilessly. Then came several years where he was oblivious to my existence. He always seemed so far beyond my reach. But somehow, we became friends. We ran our dogs in the square nearly every day, and while they ran, we talked. He knew how I loved languages, you see. He had a gift for them too. He made a habit of collecting little phrases and testing me with them. \u2018Good day\u2019 in Latvian or \u2018thank you\u2019 in Javanese.\u201d</p><p>I have a new one for you, Violet. So obscure. You\u2019ll never guess this one.</p><p>And yet, she always did. Sometimes it took her several days of scouring her library, but she always found the translation.</p><p>Her companion snorted. \u201cThis? This was enough to make you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d discovered a common thread.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWell, and I can\u2019t claim it to be solely intellectual admiration. He was exceedingly handsome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow handsome?\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little. \u201cFar more handsome than you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. His nose was straight. His jaw was always smoothly shaven. Never a hair out of place. Never a care showing on his brow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make him sound like a peacock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt one time, I suppose he was. But he changed. His brother died in the war, and it affected the whole family. Over just a few months, I watched him go from a carefree young rake, to a man struggling under the burden of great sorrow.\u201d She fought the temptation to look away. \u201cIt hurt me to watch him hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so this devil took advantage of your kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>To this day, Violet remained unsure of his motives that night. Had he set out to seduce her, or had matters simply...progressed?</p><p>That night, there\u2019d been a party at his family\u2019s house. Just a small gathering of family and friends\u2014their first foray back into society after months of mourning. Violet had haunted the corner, as always. Watching him surreptitiously, as always.</p><p>And then he\u2019d looked up and seen her. Truly seen her. Just as she\u2019d always prayed he would. His brown gaze seemed to explore the depths of her soul, uncovering all her hopes, all her dreams, all her fears and cares and desires...and most of all, her love for him.</p><p>At least, she\u2019d wanted to believe he was looking straight into her soul. But in retrospect, perhaps he was just seeing through her, past her. As though she were some sort of gated entrance he must traverse, and the rest of his life lay on the other side.</p><p>As he\u2019d crossed the room to her, his demeanor had been so intent.</p><p>I have a book for you, Violet. Come, it\u2019s just upstairs.</p><p>So she\u2019d followed him. On the way up the stairs, she\u2019d made a little joke about the impropriety. But they were old friends, and no one would suspect more. She knew this house as well as she knew her own, and it seemed almost silly that she\u2019d never been inside his rooms. He didn\u2019t even reside in them anymore. For the past several years, he\u2019d kept a bachelor\u2019s apartment across the square.</p><p>He led her into a bedchamber and shut the door. A sudden wash of heat made her brain muddled, swampy.</p><p>Where\u2019s the book? she\u2019d asked.</p><p>There\u2019s no book, he\u2019d said.</p><p>And then he\u2019d taken her in his arms.</p><p>That kiss\u2014that first magical press of his lips to hers\u2014how she wished she could go back and relive it. She\u2019d been caught completely unawares, after a solid decade of yearning for just that moment. All those years of wishing and hoping and practicing on her hand...cast out the window, instantly. Because it was happening.</p><p>She felt her own life racing ahead of her, leaving her breathless in pursuit. Each step in the sensual progression took her by surprise. His hands on her breasts. Then his mouth on her breasts. The dizzy rush of inversion when he tipped her back onto the bed. His heavy weight, pressing her into the mattress.</p><p>Wait, she\u2019d wanted to plead. Give me a moment to catch up.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t said a word. Because she knew him too well. If she\u2019d expressed the slightest uncertainty, he would have ceased his attentions. And that would have been a tragedy.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted it too. Each kiss, each caress. She\u2019d wanted all of it.</p> <p>All of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d she asked. \u201cWas it a ruthless seduction or a simple mistake?\u201d</p><p>Her companion scowled. And unleashed a robust chain of what sounded like pure Breton blasphemy.</p><p>Violet glanced in Finn and Fosbury\u2019s direction, reassuring them with a mild smile.</p><p>When she spoke again, she kept her voice hushed and her manner calm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t unwilling, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. He was a devil to take advantage. And a fool to ever let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a disappointment, I\u2019ll say that much. That\u2019s how I came to call him in my mind, you see. The Disappointment. It pained me too much to think of him by name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Disappointment.\u201d He snorted. \u201cIt was that bad?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been led to understand, it was about as pleasant as any girl can expect, her first time. Some parts of it were wonderful. It might have improved on the second go, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>But then he\u2019d gone. He\u2019d left England the very next day.</p><p>Though almost a year had passed, her viscera helpfully reenacted all the shock and pain of that betrayal. Her stomach clenched, and her heartbeat took on the hollow thump of a kettledrum.</p><p>\u201cHis father had purchased some land in Antigua, and he went to survey the property. He didn\u2019t even come to tell me himself, just sent a note. I never saw him again. That was the disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGutless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was cowardly too.\u201d She studied her tea. \u201cI hadn\u2019t asked him for any promises. I never told him of my feelings. Maybe he didn\u2019t realize I would have liked more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew. He most certainly knew.\u201d He ducked his chin, seeking her gaze. \u201cYour heart is written on your face, mon ange. That\u2019s what makes your face so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse fluttered. What did he mean? What did any of this mean?</p><p>She wished she could collect all the warmth and compassion in his eyes and weigh it on some sort of scale. Did it add up to mere polite concern, or to something more? Guilt or apology, maybe. Perhaps even love?</p><p>She said, \u201cYou are remarkably well-spoken for a humble Breton farmhand.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her baiting remark. \u201cYou have been treated poorly and have suffered much. I\u2019m sorry for it. But I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You are here. But I don\u2019t know that you can be trusted. Until I\u2019m convinced otherwise, I must assume you are an enemy. A threat to my safety and my friends\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He cocked his head, urging her close.</p><p>With a cautious glance toward Finn and Fosbury, she leaned forward. Until the heat of his breath could be felt against the exposed, vulnerable curve of her neck. Her heart thundered in her chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you get us alone,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI will tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Alone?</p><p>Her pulse thumping, Violet sat back in her chair and regarded the bound man. His eyes glittered with challenge. He asked her to risk her own safety and that of her friends, even though he\u2019d given her no reason to trust him.</p><p>Well, then. If she could not trust him, Violet had no choice but to trust herself. She must follow her own instincts.</p><p>The decision made, she stood and turned. \u201cMr. Fosbury? Finn? I\u2019ve made an important discovery. Our man speaks French. Quite well, in fact.\u201d</p><p>She shot a glance at their captive. His eyes didn\u2019t glitter now. Did he feel betrayed, perhaps? Very well. It might do him good to learn that feeling.</p><p>\u201cCor,\u201d Finn made an ungainly slide from the windowsill. \u201cI knew it. Good for you, Miss Winterbottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d Violet said, \u201cthe man has expressed a wish to confess everything. But he\u2019ll only speak directly to the commander.\u201d</p><p>Finn straightened. \u201cWe must inform Lord Rycliff straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll send a pair of footmen to the castle,\u201d Fosbury said.</p><p>\u201cFootmen?\u201d Finn echoed. \u201cBollocks to that.\u201d Leaning on his crutch, the youth buttoned the front of his coat. \u201cI\u2019m going myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Finn,\u201d Violet said in a motherly tone, \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated with your limitations after your injury, but this isn\u2019t the job for you. You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. And I will. If you\u2019ll pardon me, Miss Winterbottom, the only thing frustrating me is the whole village treating me like a child.\u201d He lifted his crutch and pointed it at Sir Lewis\u2019s ornate clock. \u201cI\u2019ll be back here, Lord Rycliff in tow, in less than hour. You mark me.\u201d</p><p>And with a hasty bow, the youth was gone, leaving Violet and Mr. Fosbury to shrug at each other.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Miss Winterbottom,\u201d the tavern-keeper said. \u201cThe boy\u2019s got pluck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know he does.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the window, watching Finn\u2019s retreating form and hoping to conceal her satisfaction. That had gone even better than she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>One down. One to go.</p><p>She had an hour. During that time, she would do her best to contrive a few minutes alone with Christian, or Corentin, or whoever he was. She wanted to hear what he had to say. She needed to learn the truth. But she would not be his fool.</p><p>Now, what to do with Fosbury?</p><p>She turned to the tavern-keeper. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, Mr. Fosbury, but I could do with a bit of refreshment.\u201d</p><p>The big man stretched and rubbed his belly. \u201cNow that you mention it, I am rather hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to wake the maids at this hour. Why don\u2019t you fetch us something from the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Fosbury\u2019s hand ceased circling his gut. Violet stood very still and held her breath.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u201d\u2014Fosbury jerked his head at the bound man\u2014\u201dtries something while I\u2019m gone? I\u2019m charged with your protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s tied to the chair.\u201d</p><p>He considered, but ultimately shook his head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t leave you alone with him, Miss Winterbottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Violet muttered.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... Ham. I said ham. You know. I only mean, I keep thinking of all that food that must have been left after the ball, you see. The...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHam,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYes. The ham.\u201d Lord, she felt inexpressibly stupid. \u201cAnd the roasted beef. And goose. The glac\u00e9ed fruits, the freshly baked breads. All those lovely cakes you brought up from the tea shop, all iced and sugared...\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat a shame it is, to think of them going to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Fosbury regarded the bound man hunched in the chair. \u201cI reckon we could take him along.\u201d</p><p>The tavern-keeper unwound the rope lashing their captive to the chair. The man\u2019s hands remained tied tight behind his back.</p><p>Fosbury prodded him forward. \u201cGo on, you.\u201d</p><p>Violet lifted a candleholder and guided their way to the Summerfield kitchen. Just as she\u2019d suspected, the center worktable was laden with covered dishes of uneaten food, left over from the interrupted ball.</p><p>There were no proper chairs in the kitchen, only three-legged stools. Fosbury shoved the captive onto a stool near one end of the table and lashed his human calves to the stool\u2019s wooden legs. If the man leaned too far to the side, he\u2019d tip and crash to the floor. If he fell forward, he\u2019d drown in the bowl of mulled wine.</p><p>Violet said, \u201cPlease have a seat, Mr. Fosbury. You\u2019re always serving others at the Bull and Blossom. Tonight, I\u2019ll make you a plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, Miss Winterbottom. Don\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d The tavern-keeper plunked down on a stool toward the far end of the table.</p><p>Violet found a few plates and moved down the row of saved dishes, heaping the plates with lobster patties, sliced meats, and sugar-dusted cakes. When she\u2019d piled the delicacies high, she laid one plate before Mr. Fosbury. He muttered his thanks, reaching for a roll with one hand and spearing a lobster patty with the other.</p><p>She ladled two generous goblets of wine from the bowl and pushed one toward Fosbury. The tavern-keeper took a long draught.</p><p>At the opposite end of the table, she set the other plate and goblet before her companion. The mystery. Time to see which of them would unravel first.</p><p>Again, she spoke to him in French. \u201cYou must be hungry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at the plate, shrugging his shoulders to draw attention to the fact that his hands remained bound behind his back. \u201cAm I to eat like a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t release you. Much less let you anywhere near a fork and knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you\u2019d be so kind as to feed me.\u201d</p><p>The stark look of hunger crossed his face. Hunger for what, she didn\u2019t dare guess.</p> <p>She folded a thin slice of ham and, holding it by the slightest edge of her fingertips, offered it to him.</p><p>\u201cCloser,\u201d he urged.</p><p>With a sigh, she obeyed. She stretched her arm just an inch further.</p><p>He ducked his head and kissed the underside her wrist. A little spark of heat scalded the delicate flesh, and she pulled back as if burnt.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream,\u201d he murmured quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t cry out. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s done. I just couldn\u2019t resist. I\u2019m fair starving, mon ange. I\u2019ve scarcely tasted food in days. But still I couldn\u2019t resist you, just the once.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She extended her arm, but not quite as far. He didn\u2019t attempt any kissing or mischief this time, but caught the ham in his teeth and devoured it. She offered him a folded slice of beef, then a lobster patty\u2014both disappeared just as quickly. He hadn\u2019t stretched the truth on this account. He was starving\u2014perhaps literally. Her heart twisted with fresh concern.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d she asked, reaching for the goblet she\u2019d filled.</p><p>He shook his head, swallowing. \u201cJust bread, if you will.\u201d</p><p>As she reached for a roll, she glanced down the table. Fosbury had a fork in one hand, his wine in the other, and his full attention was alternating between the two.</p><p>This was her chance.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the closest to privacy I can manage. Rycliff will be returning in less than an hour. I would like to help you. But you must tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a cautious glance toward Fosbury. \u201cMy name is Corentin Morvan. I am a humble farmhand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it. She whispered, \u201cAren\u2019t you Christian?\u201d</p><p>A look of pure shock overtook his face. He swore. Then he bowed his head and muttered a steady stream of rushed words.</p><p>Violet held her breath and listened, frantic to make out his confession...until she recognized his speech. It was the standard grace Catholics recited before every meal.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am a Christian.\u201d With a sheepish smile, he raised his head. \u201cThank you, mon ange. To forget a blessing at Christmastide?\u201d He clucked his tongue. \u201cWhat will you think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat indeed.\u201d</p><p>Violet thought she would go mad, that\u2019s what. There was no way she could simply blurt out, \u201cPardon me, but aren\u2019t you Lord Christian Pierce, the man who grew up next door and took my virginity last winter?\u201d Aside from being utterly mortifying, to ask such a question would have been stupid. She could hand him every slice of ham on the table, but she couldn\u2019t feed him any more answers. Then she\u2019d never be sure he was telling the truth.</p> <p>She broke a small piece off a roll and offered it to him. \u201cYour French is remarkable. You speak it with no trace of a Breton accent. In all my life, I only knew one man with such a gift for accents.\u201d</p><p>No response. No word of confirmation, no knowing look. He just shrugged and chewed.</p><p>That was it, then. Violet gave up.</p><p>Once again, her trusting nature was making her a fool. Logic would argue that the simplest explanation was usually correct. In this case, the simplest explanation was that she possessed an overactive imagination. And this man was a stranger. Some sort of criminal, hoping to talk his way out of certain imprisonment by playing on a wallflower\u2019s na\u00efve hopes of romance.</p><p>Exasperated, she reached for the goblet of wine. If he didn\u2019t want it, she\u2019d drink it herself.</p><p>\u201cAttends,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the goblet. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. You should have a toast.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, she lifted her glass and said wryly, \u201cJoyeux noel.\u201d</p><p>The cup was halfway to her lips when he interrupted yet again.</p><p>\u201cGod jul.\u201d</p><p>She paused, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s...\u2019Merry Christmas\u2019 in Norwegian?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cKala Christouyenna.\u201d</p><p>Her heart drummed in her chest. \u201cThe same, in Greek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeliz Natal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch too easy. Portuguese.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling now. Foolishly, but she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>At last, he was admitting the truth of his identity, just as surely as if he\u2019d uttered his name. And now she understood, he\u2019d been telling her so ever since he\u2019d landed at her feet in the ballroom and whispered, \u201cNedeleg laouen.\u201d</p><p>I have a new one for you, Violet. So obscure. You\u2019ll never guess this one.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d She hastily set the wine aside. \u201cOh, I knew it had to be you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he was very close. \u201cMerry Christmas, Violet.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Brushed his lips over hers, in a caress every bit as sweet and intoxicating as the first kiss he\u2019d given her, almost a year ago. And just like the first time, she couldn\u2019t muster any will to resist.</p><p>\u201cOy. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Fosbury smacked the table with his drained wine goblet. He pushed back from the table and stood. \u201cGet away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Christian jumped to his feet. He slid one arm about Violet\u2019s waist. With his right hand, he drew a large knife. \u201cHold right there.\u201d</p><p>Violet gasped and stared at his fingers, curled around the knife\u2019s glittering handle. \u201cB-but you were tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut myself loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a kitchen. Knives abound.\u201d Christian never turned his gaze from Fosbury, just kept waving the knife slowly back and forth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t mean any harm. We\u2019re all just going to stand here for another minute or two, whilst your friend becomes very, very sleepy. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p><p>Violet saw what he meant.</p><p>As she watched, Fosbury raised his hand. Slowly, drunkenly.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He pointed a shaky finger at Christian. \u201cYou don\u2019 speak no...English.\u201d His slurred speech gave \u201cEnglish\u201d an extra syllable and an abundance of shh.</p><p>Christian smiled. \u201cI speak it better than you, at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer hand!\u201d Fosbury blurted out. Still standing in the same place, he flailed his arm back and forth. \u201cOff. Hands! Hands off Miss Win...\u201d He lumbered forward, one step. \u201cMiss Winterbrother.\u201d</p><p>Fosbury stopped speaking. He blinked at Violet a few times.</p><p>He said, \u201cMiss Window-bother?\u201d</p><p>Then he crumpled to the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Violet lunged for him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s well.\u201d Christian crouched next to her at Fosbury\u2019s side. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019ll wake up in the morning with a bit of a headache but no unpleasant memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you poisoned him?\u201d</p><p>From his pocket, he withdrew an empty brown-glass vial. \u201cJust laudanum. Nicked it from your friend\u2019s kit, thinking it might come in useful. Dumped it in the wine when you weren\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, Christian.\u201d She looked from the vial to him. \u201cChristian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling. It\u2019s me.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know me at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I thought I did. But then I wondered. And just when I thought I could be certain, you had me doubting again. You were so insistent about that farmhand nonsense, and it has been almost a year. You\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>And the changes weren\u2019t only physical. The alterations went deeper than a broken nose and a scar beneath his jaw. This new Christian was darker, stronger. Far more dangerous. The man she\u2019d once adored was devilish, yes\u2014but he would never have threatened a member of the British militia at knifepoint, much less drugged the man.</p><p>She\u2019d never feared the old Christian. But this man had the little hairs on the back of her neck standing tall. Even with his identity confirmed, she still couldn\u2019t fathom how he\u2019d arrived here, much less why.</p><p>And she still had no idea whether he deserved her trust.</p><p>\u201cYou must tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain soon enough.\u201d He moved behind Fosbury and lifted him by the arms, dragging his unconscious form. \u201cHelp me with this first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>He acted without her assistance, lugging the insensible militiaman to the larder and depositing him behind the carrot and turnip bins.</p><p>\u201cIs someone chasing you?\u201d Resigned to it now, she followed and tried to make the sleeping Fosbury comfortable with a flour-sack pillow. \u201cHave you done something you shouldn\u2019t have done? Seen something you shouldn\u2019t have seen? Did a tropical fever addle your brain?\u201d</p><p>He tugged her to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything I can, I swear it. But we haven\u2019t much time. I was never supposed to be seen, and now I must disappear entirely. But not before I have my chance at this.\u201d</p><p>He slid his arms around her, drawing her close. As their bodies met, a low moan of pleasure escaped him. He pressed little kisses to her brow, her cheek. \u201cGod, it\u2019s so good to hold you. You couldn\u2019t know how often I\u2019ve dreamed of this. Dreamed of you.\u201d</p><p>Violet couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d dreamed of her? And all those same nights she\u2019d lain awake, shedding bitter tears over him. Wondering why he\u2019d left so suddenly and whether she could have made him stay.</p><p>He\u2019d dreamed of her, he said. And yet he hadn\u2019t sent word in nearly a year. Instead he showed up drenched and bleeding in the middle of a Christmas ball, muttering in a foreign tongue.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. So deeply, the spicy taste of the wine quite mulled her wits. And for a moment, it was lovely. His tongue coaxed hers, drawing her into a rhythm. He took; she gave. He taunted; she teased in turn. As if this kiss were the waltz they\u2019d never danced. The courtship they\u2019d never embarked upon. The open discussion they\u2019d never shared.</p><p>\u201cViolet. Sweet, lovely Violet.\u201d</p><p>Tangling his grip in the back of her gown, he brought her body flush with his. His solid, muscled thigh pressed between her legs. Her breasts flattened against his chest. The heat of him seared her through the layers of linen and silk.</p><p>There he went, racing ahead of her again. And much as her body yearned to follow his lead...</p><p>\u201cNo, stop.\u201d Breathless, she worked a hand between them and levered herself away. His heartbeat thundered against her palm. \u201cI can\u2019t let you overwhelm me. I need answers.\u201d</p><p>His breathing was labored. Briefly closing his eyes, he nodded. \u201cI know. You shall have them.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere nearby, a door creaked open. Perhaps in the servants\u2019 corridor.</p><p>His head turned toward the noise, and his arm whipped around her middle. In a swift motion, he pulled her to the back of the larder. \u201cNot a move,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cNot a sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRycliff couldn\u2019t have returned. Not yet. It\u2019s likely just one of the serv\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand clapped over her mouth. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>She pulled against his grip and shouted objections into his callused palm...all to not avail. He had her trapped.</p><p>From the kitchen, they heard the sounds of someone shuffling about the room, whistling lightly. Crockery clinked against pewter. A cupboard door creaked open, then shut.</p><p>All the while, Christian kept her pinned to his body with one arm around her middle and the other hand clamped over her mouth. His heartbeat battered her spine as the dull, commonplace sounds of kitchen activity continued. His grip never eased, but his thumb began to move back and forth, stroking lightly over her rib cage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bent his head, pressing his cheek to her temple. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, in a barely audible whisper. Then he kissed her ear.</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t. Have mercy.</p><p>The slightest brush of his lips against her earlobe, and she felt it everywhere. Her knees went to blancmange. The soles of her feet tingled. Heat arrowed down the center of her corset. And her heart... Her heart threatened to burst from her chest. Her whole body\u2014her entire being\u2014was so acutely aware of his.</p><p>No one else could make her feel so exhilarated. No one else could cause her so much pain.</p><p>He was her present captor. Her one-time lover. Her future...God-knew-what.</p><p>At their feet, Fosbury groaned and shifted in his sleep. His boot knocked against an empty crate. A milk pail fell to the tiled floor with a loud, ringing clatter.</p><p>The kitchen went silent.</p><p>\u201cIs someone there?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>Violet knew that voice. It belonged to Sir Lewis Finch.</p><p>Christian kept one hand firmly clamped over her mouth, but his other arm slowly slid free of her waist. He reached for something.</p><p>The knife. As he lifted it in the dark, she saw its point gleam sharp and bright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019d die before I\u2019d see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no.</p><p>Now her heartbeat raced his, pounding frantically.</p><p>Susanna\u2019s father posed no more danger than a cabbage moth. But she couldn\u2019t tell Christian that while he had her muzzled. And she could not allow him to attack or threaten Sir Lewis.</p><p>Footsteps were already crossing toward the larder, heading for their hiding place. Violet had to act, soon.</p><p>When he\u2019d reached for the knife, he\u2019d left her arms unrestrained. She clasped her hands together and used all her strength to drive one elbow back and up, directly into Christian\u2019s sternum.</p><p>\u201cOof.\u201d He fell backward with an odd, gasping sound that told her she\u2019d succeeded in knocking the wind from his lungs.</p><p>She twisted free of his grip and made a lunge for the larder door.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Christian had no choice but to let her go.</p><p>Had he said enough to sway her? They\u2019d only had a few minutes alone. Damn it, he should have spent more of those minutes explaining himself and fewer of them kissing her. But he hadn\u2019t been able to help it.</p> <p>He held his breath, straining to hear. Did she mean to protect or betray him? Truthfully, he would have deserved the latter. He\u2019d betrayed her trust, nearly a year ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Sir Lewis,\u201d he heard her say lightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you awake.\u201d</p><p>Sir Lewis?</p><p>Sir Lewis. Christian\u2019s pulse tripped as he realized what he\u2019d almost done. Dear, sweet Violet. What did he not owe her? In the moment, his defensive instincts had trumped all sense or reason. Violet had saved him from stabbing Sir Lewis Finch\u2014one of England\u2019s most decorated civilian heroes\u2014with a carving knife.</p><p>As he silently set the weapon aside, he listened to Violet and the old man exchange a few words. Evidently, the aging inventor had been unable to sleep. He\u2019d stayed up late working in his laboratory.</p><p>\u201cAre you working on a new sort of gun?\u201d Violet asked. Christian recognized this as her mere-polite-interest voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not the prospect of battle keeping me awake. It\u2019s prospect of a grandchild.\u201d Papers rustled. \u201cI\u2019ve started making sketches for a cradle. One with a winding mechanism and a crank, you see. So it can be turned just a few times, then rock the babe for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very ingenious,\u201d Violet replied. \u201cYou must be so proud.\u201d</p><p>Christian smiled. He knew Violet referred to grandfatherly pride, but the distracted old man mistook her.</p><p>\u201cThe mechanics of the idea are sound,\u201d said Sir Lewis. \u201cLet\u2019s hope I can make it work. How is our guest, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched. Christian\u2019s every muscle drew taut.</p><p>\u201cSleeping soundly,\u201d she finally replied. \u201cI just came for a bit to eat.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. Thank you, Violet.</p><p>The two of them went about fixing plates and chatting. In the larder, Christian leaned his weight against a wooden shelf and set about re-learning how to breathe.</p><p>After some time, Sir Lewis took his leave. Christian waited until the old man\u2019s footsteps faded. Then he waited several seconds more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she informed him in a loud whisper.</p><p>As Christian emerged from the larder, Violet didn\u2019t turn to him. She kept her head down, carefully staring at her hands where they pressed flat against the tile countertop.</p><p>He moved silently to her side. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I did that to protect Sir Lewis.\u201d She lifted her chin and met his gaze. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet what to do with you. I\u2019m leaning toward exposing you completely, unless you tell me the whole truth. At once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been truthful. I did not go to the West Indies as everyone believes. For the better part of the last year, I\u2019ve been living as a Breton farmhand named Corentin Morvan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cYou\u2019re an intelligent girl. Surely I needn\u2019t spell it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lord Rycliff was right. You\u2019re a spy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cFor England, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even ask me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I to think of you? Why are you even here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you. For you, darling. That much was honest too.\u201d He cursed under his breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for the evening to go like this. Stupid mistake, wrecking in the cove. And worse, I\u2019ve been seen by too many people tonight. By the time I made it here, I was so cold and in so much pain, I hardly knew what I was doing. My only thought\u2014and for a while there, I suspected it would be my last thought\u2014was for you.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, but her sharp gaze had him pulling the gesture back. \u201cI came here just to see you. I hoped to find you alone, draw you aside for a few moments\u2019 conversation. Leave you a note, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She made an indignant noise. \u201cAnother note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA proper letter, more like.\u201d He pushed his hand through his hair. \u201cViolet, I just need a chance to explain myself. The way I should have done, before I left last year. And then I must be getting back to my ship. Somehow.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know where I could procure some kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Christian, if you are really working in service of the Crown, you needn\u2019t skulk around like this. No one is more loyal to England than Lord Rycliff. Why don\u2019t we go to him together and tell him the truth? He\u2019d be glad to help you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t risk it. Unless he\u2019s a fool, he\u2019d never believe me on the strength of my word alone. And if I miss the ship...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then? If you miss the ship, what would happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be disavowed, most certainly. Corentin Morvan would cease to exist. I\u2019m relatively unimportant, so my disappearance would be more of an inconvenience than anything. But all ties would be quietly severed. I\u2019d be forced to go home to London, and my career, such as it is, would be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like such a tragedy to me. A bit of disgrace would be no more you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. But a bit of disgrace is the best possible outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the worst?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and released a long, slow sigh. \u201cCharges of treason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Worry lines creased her fair brow. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. Your family has suffered too much already.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Christian thought. They certainly had suffered. And he adored her for understanding that. For thinking of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you for their sake. What is it you need?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands from her shoulders to her wrists. God, she was so soft. His voice went husky with emotion. \u201cI need you, Violet. Just a little time with you. I need to hold you in my arms again and kiss you and tell you how remarkably lovely you are in green. I need make you understand why I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She closed her eyes, then opened them again. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that. If you\u2019re going to meet up with your ship by morning, what are your immediate material needs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a rowboat. My coat and boots. And a gun, if it can be managed.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the last part first. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>A gun, if it can be managed.</p><p>Christian laughed at his own folly. Of course a gun could be managed. He was in the house of Sir Lewis Finch, England\u2019s most celebrated innovator of firearms. As Violet led him down the corridor, he saw weapons from the man\u2019s famed collection lining every wall. Spears, maces, rockets, swords, daggers...</p><p>And guns. Guns by the score.</p><p>Violet led him into a narrow, dark room toward the back of the house. The stone floor chilled the soles of his bare feet.</p><p>\u201cThis is the gun room,\u201d she whispered, handing him the candleholder.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d From floor to ceiling, racks held a variety of polished muskets, rifles, pistols and more. He reached for a gleaming, double-barreled Finch pistol. \u201cGood Lord. That\u2019s a thing of beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it. You can\u2019t take just anything. I won\u2019t allow you to steal from Sir Lewis.\u201d</p><p>He looked around them. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019d notice I\u2019ve stolen one.\u201d</p><p>One of her pale eyebrows rose. \u201cHe\u2019d notice. And I\u2019d notice.\u201d She went to a rack on the far side of the room and removed a small pistol. \u201cI won\u2019t let you steal, but you can have this one.\u201d</p><p>Christian peered at it. It was a single-barreled, rather basic weapon, but it looked to be in excellent working order. \u201cWhy that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m free to give it. This one\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, stunned. \u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mine.\u201d She reached for a powder horn and deftly measured out a charge. \u201cDuring fair weather seasons, we have a schedule here in Spindle Cove. Mondays, we have country walks. Tuesdays, sea bathing. We spend Wednesdays in the garden. And on Thursdays\u201d\u2014she jammed a lead ball into the barrel\u2014\u201dwe shoot.\u201d</p><p>He whistled faintly through his teeth. \u201cI thought Spinster Cove was a place for young ladies to come and...be spinsters. Read books. Do needlework. Wear scratchy stockings and unattractive frocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were wrong about this place. About us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently.\u201d He watched her with amazement as she turned the polished, well-oiled weapon over in her delicate hands. \u201cGod, Violet. I always knew you were the girl for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cYou knew nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I...\u201d At a sudden click, he jumped. \u201cHoly God.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d cocked the gun and pointed it directly at his heart.</p><p>\u201cViolet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try anything. I know how to use this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you do.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. Her hands didn\u2019t even tremble.</p><p>\u201cThe night of your sister\u2019s debut,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just a year out of the schoolroom, but my parents let me attend, so long as I didn\u2019t dance. You were dressed in a dark blue topcoat, buff breeches, and a gold-threaded waistcoat. And your new tasseled Hessians. You were so proud of those. You had a brocade pocket square, but you lost it sometime between the quadrille and midnight supper. Now, what about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked. She nudged the gun forward, and he raised his hands. \u201cYou want me to remember what you wore?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cWas I wearing my ivory crepe, or the blue percale?\u201d</p><p>Christian churned the air with his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know... The blue? No, the ivory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I was wearing my Indian yellow silk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you had an Indian yellow silk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. You wouldn\u2019t know. You never noticed me at all. I watched you chase after the fancy ladies during your breaks from Oxford. And I heard the scandalous rumors our sisters traded during their debut season.\u201d She steadied the gun and took a step toward him. \u201cSo don\u2019t lie to me now. You can\u2019t make me believe I\u2019m the only woman you ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t even try.\u201d Doing his best to ignore the pistol, he looked her in the eye. \u201cBut I can tell you\u2014in perfect honesty, Violet\u2014you\u2019re the only one I ever loved.\u201d</p><p>She remained absolutely still. \u201cLoved. You expect me to believe that you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know the precise moment it started, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it never truly started at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait. Give me this much. My uncertainty has the ring of honesty, doesn\u2019t it? If I were lying, I would take the trouble to invent a specific story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you exhausted your imagination with the Breton farmhand bit.\u201d She motioned with the pistol. \u201cTurn and walk. Down the corridor. I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>He threw a glance over his shoulder. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want answers from you, but I don\u2019t trust you in this room. Too many weapons.\u201d</p><p>As he turned, he muttered, \u201cClever girl.\u201d</p><p>She kept the gun pressed against his back as they marched down the corridor. With every step, he racked his brains for the right words to say.</p><p>Dash it, Christian couldn\u2019t recall precisely when he\u2019d begun to feel this deep affection for the quiet, unassuming girl next door. He could name the day he\u2019d grown aware of it, but he suspected that tale would have only increased her pique.</p><p>The story involved another woman.</p><p>And it took place in a ballroom, much like the one Violet marched him to right now. At one of his parents\u2019 more scandalous masquerades, he\u2019d been flirting with some demimonde\u2014for no particular reason. She was a painted bulls-eye, and all the young men took a shot at her. And she\u2019d said to Christian, with the smile of a practiced coquette, I shan\u2019t waste my time with you. You\u2019re a puppy. You\u2019ll pant and slaver over me for a while, but then you\u2019ll grow up and be faithful to a girl like her.</p><p>And she\u2019d tipped her fan toward the corner occupied by Violet Winterbottom.</p><p>Marry? Marry Violet Winterbottom?</p> <p>Christian had laughed long and loudly, dismissing the notion out of hand. But the notion, impertinent thing that it was, wouldn\u2019t be dismissed. It clung to him, hovered around him like a puff of cheroot smoke as he went about his nights of revelry with friends. Eventually, he\u2019d stopped staying out so late and started waking earlier to take the dogs for their morning run.</p><p>And to see Violet.</p><p>Because suddenly, he\u2019d begun to truly see Violet. To appreciate what a clever, thoughtful woman she\u2019d become. She had a real gift for languages\u2014which he recognized, being quite handy with them himself. And she liked a challenge.</p><p>Violet\u2019s company, he found, was a stimulating way to begin each morning. And one particular morning when her sister\u2019s terrier led them a merry chase through the bushes\u2014after which, he\u2019d admired Violet flushed and panting, eyes sparkling with good-natured laughter despite her ripped flounce and muddied hem... That was when he\u2019d begun to think Violet\u2019s company could be a stimulating way to end each night.</p><p>Soon, he could think of little else. Having her in his bed, and in his life. Not just the public portion of his life\u2014the life composed of dinner parties and social calls and walks in the sunlit square. But the hidden, quiet, darker parts of it, as well.</p><p>\u201cYour boots and coat are there.\u201d She waved the pistol toward the corner. \u201cGo ahead, put them on.\u201d</p><p>He complied. \u201cViolet, I did have intentions toward you. Good ones. I had plans of courting you properly, in time.\u201d He broke off momentarily as he wrestled with his boots. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to rush. But then...\u201d</p><p>He slowly lowered his booted foot to the floor.</p><p>\u201cFrederick?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFrederick.\u201d</p><p>Christian drew a steadying breath, remembering the day he\u2019d jostled for position before a brick wall and scanned a list of the fallen for his brother\u2019s name. There it had been, in black letters on white. Lord Captain Frederick St. John Pierce. Numbness had struck Christian like a mallet. In some ways, he was still reeling.</p><p>He swallowed a lump of emotion. \u201cYou were such a friend to us, when we lost him.\u201d</p><p>He recalled the way she\u2019d come by the house, slipping in like one of the family. She sat with his sisters in the drawing room, reading aloud from books or newspapers and helping them receive the many callers stopping by to pay condolences. And every morning, she took their dogs out for a run.</p><p>\u201cI tried to be a friend to the family.\u201d Her tone altered. She lowered the pistol. \u201cBut I was mostly worried for you, Christian. You changed, and I was so concerned.\u201d</p><p>He had changed. For the better, in most ways. His father had always emphasized the importance of service to Crown and country. George was the heir; Frederick had his commission. But Christian\u2019s facility with languages had lent itself to a particular form of service: espionage. Not much glamour or excitement in translating political pamphlets and the occasional intercepted letter, but Christian had been happy to do a small part in the background.</p><p>He worked his arms into the sleeves of his still-damp coat. \u201cI\u2019d been working for the Crown for some time. Mostly written translations, all conducted in Town. But after they got Frederick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he a spy, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Frederick was always just as he seemed. An honest, honorable fellow. He should not have been taken so young. When we received word of his death, I immediately began to press for a field assignment.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAnd they gave me one, quite literally. I\u2019m assigned to a field of wheat. The landowner is sympathetic to England, and I mostly do farm work. Now and then, I help parcels and papers pass from one point to the next. It\u2019s not much, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>He passed a hand over his face. \u201cAfter Frederick, I just couldn\u2019t sit on my arse in London anymore. I had to do something. Can you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened. \u201cI can understand. And I would have understood, if only you\u2019d told me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sworn to silence. Only my father knows the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have told a soul. I can keep secrets all too well. I never told a soul about... about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them and silently invited her to sit on the floor. There, in the center of the empty ballroom. She folded her emerald silk skirts beneath her legs and rested the pistol in her lap. He sat across from her, propping his arm on one bent knee.</p><p>\u201cViolet, the way I treated you was unforgivable. I\u2019ve lived with the guilt of it ever since. I knew I was leaving. I didn\u2019t feel I could make you any promises, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to depart without holding you, just once. I didn\u2019t intend for it to go that far, but in the moment...\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cHonestly, I suspect part of me wanted to ruin you. So you\u2019d still be there for me when I returned. It doesn\u2019t say much for my moral fibre, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He winced. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can ask you to forgive me. I really was a shameless devil. And of all the ways I failed you...it wasn\u2019t even good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Her mouth twisted at the corner. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little, just to mitigate the sting to his pride. And then the memories of her\u2014of that night\u2014surged to the forefront of his mind, chasing out every other emotion. How she\u2019d laid a hand to his cheek, just at the moment they\u2019d joined. The sweetest gesture, layered atop the purest bliss.</p><p>Nudging aside the silk of her hem, he slid a single fingertip along her stockinged ankle. Beneath his touch, she felt so sleek, so sweet. In his misspent youth, Christian had skimmed his fingertips over many a silk stocking, but now... Almost a year had passed since he\u2019d caressed anything this fine.</p><p>He was no confident seducer now. He was a coarse, humble farmhand with his hand under a well-bred lady\u2019s skirt. In a house full of sleeping people who might wake at any moment. The pleasure was deliciously forbidden. The potent rush of arousal was like life itself. And the crisp rustle of her petticoat was the most arousing sound he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>Unable to resist, he slipped his hand up her calf. He pressed two fingertips to the hollow of her knee. A warm pulse fluttered beneath his touch.</p><p>\u201cChristian...\u201d Her voice was breathy. Needy.</p><p>He ought to leave, he told himself. He must flee before the militia descended, or it would all be over. His career\u2014and perhaps his life, as well\u2014depended on his making a swift exit.</p><p>But his soul needed this.</p><p>He eased closer, resting his brow on her shoulder. \u201cGive me another chance, Violet. I have so little to offer you, and we have so little time. Let me give you pleasure, at least.\u201d He swept his hand farther up her leg. \u201cLet me show you how good it can be.\u201d</p><p>As he caressed her thigh, Violet\u2019s breath left her lungs in a long, languid sigh.</p><p>\u201cViolet.\u201d His lips grazed her throat.</p><p>Was this truly happening? Was she truly allowing it to happen, again?</p><p>As he kissed her neck, he nudged her chin upward. She let her head roll back in implicit surrender. While his hot tongue drew wicked patterns on her skin, she stared up at the ballroom\u2019s Christmas splendor. The unlit chandelier branched high above. Lush red and green swags festooned the columns, and gold-foiled cut stars dangled from the ceiling beams.</p><p>He bent his head to her d\u00e9colletage, nuzzling the exposed tops of her breasts. He trailed little kisses along her neckline. All the while, his questing fingertips climbed the slope of her inner thigh. His touch, while rougher than before, still left her damp and yearning. Just as it had that first night.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pleasure to be shared.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand between her legs.</p><p>Oh. Oh, so good.</p><p>Her nipples drew to tight points as he stroked her there. She twisted a little, letting the sensitive tips chafe against the restrictive boundary of her corset. He was teasing her, and she teased herself. Making the ache so sweet, so good. Making everything worse.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he moaned, pushing aside the folds of her drawers. \u201cThis time, I\u2019ll do right by you.\u201d</p><p>His words gave her the jolt of reality she needed. He\u2019d do right by her, he said. How, precisely? By using her body, then leaving in the morning?</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She clamped her thighs together, trapping his fingers. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He kept right on kissing her cleavage. \u201cDarling, I promise, this time I\u2019ll make it good. Better than good. We can make bliss, between us. Greater joy than you\u2019ve ever dreamed.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his trapped fingers, striving to reach her intimate flesh.</p><p>She tightened the vise of her thighs. \u201cTruly. Do you truly believe you can stumble in here tonight, rave nonsense in an obscure language, drug my protector, and\u2014despite the wrong you did me last time\u2014convince me to lie back and lift my skirts for you? Here on the floor, in the center of a ballroom? Do you really think I\u2019m that foolish?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I...\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cOf course you think I\u2019m that foolish. Why wouldn\u2019t you? After all, I am the same girl who followed you up to your bedchamber and surrendered her virtue whilst our parents played cards downstairs\u2014with no offer of marriage on the counterpane, much less declarations of tender love. It shouldn\u2019t be any great trick to seduce me tonight. Is that what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. No, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a fool.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cToo easily dazzled to resist. Too dimwitted to pause a moment and consider the consequences. Too stupid to know what an orgasm is. \u2018Oh, Violet,\u2019\u201d she mimicked. \u201c\u2018Let me show you how good it can be.\u2019 Well, allow me to show you something, Christian.\u201d</p><p>She raised the pistol and pressed the barrel to his temple.</p><p>He cringed. \u201cViolet, for the love of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemove your hand. Now.\u201d She relaxed her thigh muscles just enough that he could slide his hand free.</p><p>He wisely complied.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to listen to me for a minute.\u201d She drew a deep breath, inching backward on the waxed parquet until a yard or so separated them. With steady hands, she kept the pistol aimed at his chest. \u201cI adored you. All my life, I adored you. I asked nothing of you. No promises, no courtship. I surrendered my virtue. I gave you my trust. And you left me with a note.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted in an expression of regret. He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m so very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six words!\u201d she shot back, in the loudest whisper she could manage. \u201cI gave you my virginity, and you left me twenty-six scribbled words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be easier for you that way. So you could hate me and forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did hate you. I hated you for making me feel cheap and foolish. I hated you for making me feel so ashamed, and distanced from my own family. And I hated myself for allowing it all to happen. But forget? How could I ever forget?\u201d She blinked back tears. \u201cYou broke my heart into twenty-six pieces that day. But do you know something, Christian? Over the past several months here in Spindle Cove, I\u2019ve stitched those pieces back together.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke the words, Violet realized how true they were. She couldn\u2019t name the day she\u2019d set aside The Disappointment and begun to live again. The healing had been slow, gradual. Sometimes painful. But somehow, while she\u2019d been distracted with sea-bathing and country walks and shooting lessons\u2014and absolutely no embroidery\u2014the impossible had occurred.</p> <p>Her heart had mended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a different girl now,\u201d she told him, sitting tall. \u201cA stronger girl. Blast it, I\u2019m not a girl at all\u2014I\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a slight, appreciative smile. \u201cSo I can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should understand, and believe me when I say this: I won\u2019t let you hurt me again.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for several moments. When he spoke, he voice was even. \u201cI do understand, and I believe you. I have a great deal I\u2019d like to say to you, but I\u2019d rather not say it at gunpoint. If I give my word I\u2019ll not touch you, will you lower the pistol?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cViolet.\u201d His voice took on a darker edge. \u201cI could disarm you if I chose. But I might injure you in the process, and I\u2019d rather not hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled slowly. Then lowered the pistol to her lap. That was as much as she\u2019d give him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>He inched closer. \u201cThe way I treated you was inexcusable. I deserve your scorn. I can see how you\u2019ve changed, and it makes me so proud. You\u2019re braver and stronger and more lovely than ever. I want you to know I\u2019ve changed too, in our time apart. If not for the lovelier.\u201d Slowly reaching out, he lifted her free hand to his face and traced her fingertip down the rugged slope of his nose. \u201cFeel this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been broken.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTwice. Purposely. Part of my training. I had to practice being in pain, you see. So that I would respond only in Breton, never in English.\u201d He made her hand into a fist and bashed it playfully across his nose. \u201cCorentin Morvan eo ma anv. My name is Corentin Morvan.\u201d He sliced her finger across the scar on his throat. \u201cMe a zo un tamm peizant. I am a humble farmhand.\u201d He put her two fingers to his heart like a pistol. \u201cN\u2019ouzon netra. I know nothing. I swear on the Virgin this is the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, but it was necessary. For my own safety, and to guard the safety of others.\u201d He kissed her hand and kept it in both of his. \u201cThey thrashed that carefree, callow duke\u2019s son straight out of me and left a lowly farmhand in his place. But they never beat you out of my heart.\u201d He stared deeply into her eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Violet. I loved you then. I love you now. I don\u2019t expect to ever stop.\u201d</p><p>His words overwhelmed her to the point of mute paralysis. Oh, how she wanted to believe him. But it made no rational sense.</p><p>Finally, she managed a tiny shake of her head. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Believe me, love. I\u2019ve shoveled so much actual horseshit in the past year, I\u2019ve lost all patience with the figurative sort.\u201d He turned her hand palm-up and stared into it, as though he might read his fortune there. His thumb traced a circle in the center of her palm. \u201cI have been humbled, in many ways. I\u2019m but a tiny gear in a vast machine, expendable and unimportant. I\u2019ve learned what it is to labor hard, for long hours, on very little food.\u201d</p><p>She believed this part, without question. The evidence was written all over him. When she\u2019d been pressed against him in the larder, she\u2019d sensed how his body was leaner now, all muscle and sinew. His face was tanned and weathered from regular exposure to the sun. And his hands... She felt the calluses on his thumb as he caressed her palm.</p><p>\u201cMost of all,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been humbled by the comprehensive and inescapable quality of my own stupidity. My colossal arrogance. I thought that I could share that night with you and then go on to fulfill my mission, unaffected. I was wrong. So damnably wrong. Violet, I\u2019ve thought of you daily. Dreamt of you nightly. Longed for you in every private moment and scoured my letters from home for any word of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour letters from home? But you said your family didn\u2019t know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. They write to an address in Antigua, and the letters are diverted. Once every few months or so, I\u2019m given leave to \u2018visit my mother,\u2019 which means a trip to our regional base. There, I sit in a small room, read their letters and pen replies. It\u2019s the only chance I have to read or write English. For that matter, it\u2019s the only chance I have to read anything. I haven\u2019t read a book in a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Such deprivation.\u201d She spoke the words without any hint of irony. For her, going without books would be as great a trial as going without food.</p><p>\u201cIn one of her letters, my sister mentioned that you\u2019d come to Spinster\u2014\u201d He bit off the derisive moniker and began again. \u201cSpindle Cove.\u201d He released her hand and reached to stroke her cheek. \u201cI loved thinking that you were just across the Channel. Mostly, I loved knowing you weren\u2019t married to another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married yet, you mean. The family\u2019s lost patience with me now. My mother is adamant that I return to London and find a husband. The family carriage comes for me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He drew a raspy breath. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was determined to come tonight. I think I would have swum the Channel, if there\u2019d been no other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how on earth did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week, I had my regular day for correspondence. And there was this letter from my sister. She said you were coming back to London, and it was meant to be her grand project to marry you off this spring. When I read those words, my heart just sank like a stone. We had a small craft making the crossing to Hastings. I traded every favor I was owed, dropped my father\u2019s name several times. I did everything short of get down on my knees and beg. Finally I was given permission to make the journey, and when we reached spitting distance from Spindle Cove, I took the jollyboat to row in. That part didn\u2019t go as planned. Wrecked the cursed thing on a boulder. Somehow I must find a new boat in time to rendezvous with the departing ship at dawn. But before I go...\u201d</p><p>He moved close to where she sat cross-legged on the floor, wrapping his arms and legs around her. \u201cCan I convince you to wait for me? I\u2019m a third son, due to inherit nothing. My material prospects were always modest, and now I\u2019ve ruined my dashing good looks.\u201d</p><p>She started to speak, but he interrupted her with a swift bee-sting of a kiss. It left her stunned, throbbing. Just a little swollen in places.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a life without you, Violet. I won\u2019t press you for your hand just yet. But if you could tell me you\u2019ll wait\u2014just wait until this mad war is over\u2014and give me a chance to win you, I should consider it the best Christmas gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, trying to make him out. He\u2019d spun a pretty tale for her in this ballroom. A tale that made him out to be quite a hero\u2014serving the Crown to avenge his fallen brother, secretly loving her all the while. She wanted to trust him so badly. And it was precisely that desperate wish to believe that made her doubt her own judgment. He\u2019d done this all before\u2014made her feel cherished and adored one night, then left with barely a word the following day. It had taken her almost a year to recover.</p><p>Perhaps she wasn\u2019t the real reason he\u2019d come here. Perhaps he was just using her again, feeding her the words she wanted to hear, giving her the sensations she wanted to feel...all so he could get what he wanted and be off. With her own perception so clouded by years of infatuation, how could she be sure?</p><p>Above them, the chandelier shivered and swayed.</p><p>Christian\u2019s eyes grew wide.</p><p>Footsteps.</p><p>They pushed away from each other in silence. Christian extinguished the candle with his fingertips. The acrid scent of candle smoke filled the air.</p><p>The chandelier\u2019s tinkling rattle went quiet as the footsteps paused.</p><p>Violet held her breath, uncertain what to do.</p><p>She could scream for help. They\u2019d capture Christian, detain him, question him. She would have the truth.</p><p>Or she could trust him, against all previous evidence. She could trust him and help him escape.</p><p>\u201cSwear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSwear on Frederick\u2019s name you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, as sincere as the Sussex night was dark. \u201cI swear it. I swear it on my brother\u2019s grave. And on the life of our future son.\u201d When her jaw dropped, he shrugged. \u201cYou know we\u2019ll have to name our first boy Frederick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complicate matters,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI can\u2019t think when you speak like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that a lovely moment earlier, between Rycliff and his wife? I couldn\u2019t help but wish it was us.\u201d He touched her arm. \u201cSomeday.\u201d</p><p>Her heart blithely skipped about her chest. She put a hand to her breast, trying to calm it.</p><p>And then\u2014just when his words had made her forget them\u2014the footsteps resumed. Louder, and in a more deliberate rhythm. Someone was headed for the stairs.</p><p>Without discussion and in perfect unison, they shot to their feet.</p><p>He beckoned for Violet to pass him the gun. \u201cThat\u2019s my signal to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her grip on the pistol and grabbed for his wrist with her other hand, tugging him toward the same set of garden doors he\u2019d burst through some hours ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis time, you\u2019re not leaving without me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>As they raced through the night, headed for the small village of Spindle Cove, Christian worried. He worried that they would soon be missed. He worried that Violet didn\u2019t have her cloak, and those impractical silk slippers couldn\u2019t possibly guard her toes against the hoarfrost coating the ground. He worried that she\u2019d never forgive him, and that he didn\u2019t deserve her forgiveness anyway.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t worry about allowing her to lead.</p><p>Violet knew exactly where she was taking him. She knew how to avoid barking dogs and ice-crusted puddles as they made their way. She didn\u2019t stumble or cringe or pull up breathless, clutching her side and begging for a rest. She moved swiftly and surely through the night. Relentless.</p><p>Somewhere an owl called, \u201cWho?\u201d and Christian echoed the sentiment.</p><p>Who? Who was this fearless, pistol-wielding woman, and what had she done with sweet, quiet, next-door Violet?</p><p>She\u2019d changed, she said. Of course she had. Hadn\u2019t he been altered in the past year? It had been stupid of him to dream otherwise. He\u2019d stuck a pin in her memory, put it under glass to treasure and admire it, as though she were some desiccated specimen. But Violet was a live creature. Changing, growing, adapting. And beautiful in motion, with that emerald silk flowing in the night.</p> <p>Christian had to face facts. He didn\u2019t want Violet the same way he once had.</p><p>He wanted her more. Much, much more.</p><p>When they reached the village, they slowed down. They kept their steps quiet as they moved from shadow to shadow.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff sent Rufus and Dawes to guard the rooming house,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch out for them.\u201d</p><p>She directed him to slink around a corner near the village square, and together they huddled in the doorway of a shop. Brights\u2019 All Things, the lettering on the door read.</p><p>Christian hoped the promised \u201cAll Things\u201d included small boats.</p> <p>Violet tried the door latch. Locked, of course. Wordlessly, she pulled a hairpin from her wind-mussed chignon and handed it to him.</p><p>He stared at it. \u201cWhat makes you think I know how to pick locks?\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust because I\u2019m a spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because you were forever stealing pocket money from your father\u2019s top desk drawer.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. She truly had been paying attention.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done that in a decade.\u201d Nevertheless, he took the hairpin. After a few minutes\u2019 gentle exploration and some overt persuasion, the lock responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he murmured, turning the door latch and swinging the door open on its thankfully well-oiled hinges.</p><p>They entered the shop. Moonlight washed the room with a milky glow. Peering at the shelves, Christian spied bolts of fabric piled ceiling high. Ink bottles lined neatly as soldiers. Rows up on rows of ribbon spools.</p><p>No boat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it we\u2019re here to get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lamp,\u201d she said, setting the pistol aside. \u201cOf sorts. Sally Bright showed it to me one afternoon. Said it once belonged to her ne\u2019er-do-well father.\u201d</p><p>Hiking her skirts to her knees, Violet scrambled up a small ladder and reached for an object on the top shelf.</p><p>\u201cAlmost have it...\u201d she muttered. Then she announced triumphantly, \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She climbed down and laid the lamp on the counter between them. Christian recognized it at once. It was a small cylinder fashioned from hammered tin, tightly capped by a pleated metal disc and fitted with a long, tapered spout that stuck straight out. It looked like a rather like the head of a mismatched snowman. Smallish face, round hat, enormous carrot nose.</p><p>\u201cA smuggler\u2019s lantern,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to use it to guide you out of the cove. We\u2019ll work out a system of signals. Otherwise, you\u2019ll only wreck and founder again.\u201d</p><p>Christian considered. That cove had more boulders than a shark had teeth. He had to acknowledge the cleverness of Violet\u2019s idea, but... \u201cI can\u2019t let you take that risk. If we\u2019re seen from the castle, the men might shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe light won\u2019t be seen from the castle bluffs. That\u2019s the entire point of a smuggler\u2019s lantern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He picked the thing up and turned it round in his hands. The device was designed to throw a narrow, pinpoint beam of light out to sea. A signal someone on a passing ship might view, if he were looking for it\u2014but one that couldn\u2019t be seen by others on the shore. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t like the idea of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian, if I\u2019m helping you escape, I\u2019m going to truly help you. Not just bid you farewell and send you to your watery doom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He put his hand over hers. \u201cFor not wishing me a watery doom. That alone is more than I deserve.\u201d</p><p>In a brisk motion, she pulled her hand away. \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind on the rest of it yet.\u201d</p><p>In the stillness, he gave voice to his worst fears. \u201cYou can\u2019t forgive me. You won\u2019t have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t refute it, either. She simply went about filling the lantern\u2019s small reservoir with fuel and preparing a wick.</p><p>In his chest, desperation tangled with despair.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cWhy on earth would you have me? Just look at tonight. Once again, you\u2019re risking your health and reputation for me, when I should be the one championing you. Fighting a duel to preserve your honor. Pulling you from a burning house. Rescuing your kitten. Something, anything, to prove myself. Instead, I\u2019ve given you nothing but pain.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cWell. You did save me from a fire once.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI did? When was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eight. That would have made you...fourteen? It was an autumn night near All Hallows, and we girls tromped up to the garret with the idea to play fortuneteller. Surely you recall it?\u201d</p><p>He did recall it, now that she painted the picture. The game had been the girls\u2019 idea. His sister Annabel had always been close with Poppy Winterbottom, and the two of them let Violet join sometimes. Christian, as always, had been glad for the chance to make mischief. He and Frederick hid in the dormer window, laughing into their sleeves while the girls solemnly lit tapers and invoked the spirits of the beyond.</p><p>\u201cI was already terrified just being there,\u201d Violet said. \u201cMy nursemaid had told me so many dreadful stories about ghouls and beasties lurking in the attic. To warn me off exploring, I\u2019m sure. And then Frederick, bless him, jumped out from behind that curtain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, little Violet had shrieked and turned\u2014and in so doing, whipped the fringe of her shawl straight through the candle flame. In a matter of moments, the cheap printed fabric had come ablaze. Fortunately, Christian had been in just the right position to yank loose the dormer draperies and smother the flames.</p><p>\u201cIf not for you, I could have been badly burnt,\u201d she said. \u201cAs it was, I lost a good six inches off my braid. The house smelled of burnt hair for days. Oh, my parents were furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents were furious?\u201d Christian chuckled, recalling his blistered arse. \u201cI ate all my meals standing for the following week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her voice turned pensive. \u201cI know. And that\u2019s what I never understood. It wasn\u2019t your fault. You saved me, but you caught all the blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took it readily.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt truly was my fault. Everyone knew I was the mischief-maker. Frederick would have never been in that dormer at all, if not for me. And besides, I held up under a thrashing much better than he did.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke of his brother, Christian\u2019s throat swelled uncomfortably. His eyes began to itch. \u201cNot that Frederick was weak, mind you. Not at all. He was brave and decent and...\u201d He pounded the counter with the flat of his fist. \u201cAnd so dashed good. It wasn\u2019t the thrashing that hurt him so. He couldn\u2019t abide having Father angry with him. I, on the other hand, was well accustomed to the feeling.\u201d He gave her an ironic half-smile. \u201cYou know me, Violet. I\u2019ve always been The Disappointment.\u201d</p><p>She ceased fiddling with the lamp. \u201cChristian...\u201d</p><p>He waved off the pity in her tone. \u201cThat\u2019s why I signed on for this, you know. The fieldwork. When we lost him, my parents lost the pride of the family. I\u2019m always just scraping by, and George is... Well, he\u2019s George. He was born fifty-eight years old, I think. But they were so damned proud of Frederick, and I wanted to give them that feeling back. I wanted to be a son they could take pride in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christian.\u201d She was rounding the counter now. \u201cYou always have been.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cHardly. Just look at what I did to you. On the eve of my own supposed redemption, I pulled my worst trick yet. If someone had treated my own sister that way... If some other blackguard had touched you, Violet...\u201d He swore, pushing back from the counter. \u201cI\u2019d kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>He paced away from her. Damn, this was just intolerable. Whatever course he took, he failed someone. If he went home to marry Violet, he\u2019d be abandoning his duty. Drawing dishonor to the very name he hoped she would take as her own. But if he let her go back to London without him, he risked losing her forever\u2014and losing any chance to right his misdeeds.</p><p>Add to all this, the knowledge that nothing\u2014nothing he did, on this side of the Channel or the other\u2014would ever balance Frederick\u2019s loss. Not in the smallest portion.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt more worthless, or less worthy of her.</p><p>\u201cShould we go for the boat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>What did it matter? What did any of it matter?</p><p>\u201cDamn the boat.\u201d</p><p>Violet cringed, watching him pace the shop from one end to the other, then back. His agitation was plain. She had to calm him somehow, or he\u2019d draw attention to their presence. Aaron Dawes and Rufus Bright were somewhere all too near, keeping watch over the Queen\u2019s Ruby and the rest of the sleeping village.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry that Frederick was killed. It\u2019s perfectly natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect bollocks, is what it is.\u201d He covered the length of the room in three long, tense strides, then turned on his heel. \u201cIt should not have been him. It should have been me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Christian, please don\u2019t talk that way. You could not have saved him, and you can\u2019t bring him back. But we will love him, and honor his memory. And miss him. Dearly.\u201d</p><p>He pulled to a halt. \u201cI have missed him.\u201d His head swiveled abruptly, and his gaze snared hers. \u201cBut not as much as I\u2019ve missed you, which makes me feel even worse.\u201d</p><p>As he stared at her, his chest rose and fell. \u201cEvery morning, Violet. Every morning, I should have awoken thinking of Frederick. Thanking God for any small part I could play in avenging his death. Instead, every morning I woke wanting you. Wishing I could stroll outside to the square, find you there waiting with the dogs. Looking lovely as the dawn. A little smile on your face, because you\u2019d just untangled a new translation.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cLike this one. Tumi amar jeeboner dhruvotara.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, puzzling over the phrase. \u201cThat\u2019s not Hindustani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBengali. It means \u2018You are my life\u2019s bright star\u2019 in Bengali.\u201d The sweet words were edged with frustration, not tenderness. His knuckles cracked. \u201cObviously, I was saving that one. For the right morning.\u201d</p><p>A forceful pang in her heart left her breathless.</p><p>He loved her. He truly did love her.</p><p>Christian cursed and resumed his pacing, hands clenched into fists at his sides. \u201cBut now, it will never be the \u2018right morning\u2019 for us. So yes, I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m goddamned furious with myself for somehow losing both you and Frederick forever. And I very, very, very much want to hit something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled up short, eyeing a row of crockery, and she panicked. If he crashed a fist through that shelf, the noise would be frightful.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She darted out from behind the counter. \u201cHit this.\u201d</p><p>In the corner of the shop sat a padded dress form, wearing a dotted muslin frock and a wide-brimmed straw bonnet. The Brights used it to display the newest wares.</p><p>Violet grabbed the mannequin by the waist and swiveled it on its casters. \u201cGo on,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d</p><p>For a tense moment, he stared down the dress form. Violet edged to the side, her neck prickling with apprehension. His rage was palpable, even from the other side of the shop.</p><p>At last, he raised his fist and made a fierce, lunging attack\u2014</p><p>Only to pull up short at the last moment.</p><p>And let his fist drop.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, grimacing. \u201cI can\u2019t hit a woman.\u201d</p><p>Violet laughed. \u201cNellie\u2019s not a real woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a name?\u201d Turning way from the dress form, he threw up his hands. \u201cThat seals it. So much for throwing punches.\u201d</p><p>He braced both fists on the sales counter and bent over them, lowering his brow to the polished wood. A sound of raw anguish wrenched from his chest.</p><p>Violet couldn\u2019t stand to watch him suffer this way. Tears welled in her eyes as she approached and laid a hand to his shoulder. \u201cChristian, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so very, very sorry. I know how much you loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told him.\u201d</p><p>She stroked the tense muscles of his neck, ran her fingers through the heavy locks of hair at his nape. \u201cHe knew. Of course he knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cI should have told you, Violet. I should have told the both of you, every day.\u201d</p><p>A single tear spilled down her cheek. \u201cI know now.\u201d</p><p>He seized her in his arms. In the faint light, his eyes were wild with emotion. \u201cDo you, truly?\u201d</p><p>In answer, she kissed him. Curled both hands around his neck and pulled his head down so she could kiss his jawline, his cheekbone, the razor-thin scar along his throat. She even kissed the rugged slope of his twice-broken nose.</p><p>And then his lips found hers. Hot, desperate. His arms lashed around her middle as they kissed, his big hands clutching fistfuls of her gown. Her breasts flattened and ached against his hard chest. She wanted him to hold her like this forever\u2014so tightly, there could be no room for secrets.</p><p>His kiss was fierce, intense, imbued with all the passion with which he\u2019d always lived his life. He kissed her as though this were life itself\u2014the only time they might have together. And she kissed him the same way, holding nothing back. There would be no shyness for Violet tonight. She would leave no emotion unexpressed, no desire unfulfilled. She wanted to caress and explore and possess every part of him, body and soul.</p><p>A beam of light swept them, originating from outside the shop.</p> <p>Christian froze. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cDawes and Rufus,\u201d she breathed. \u201cQuickly, hide.\u201d</p><p>She prodded Christian toward the storeroom at the back of the shop. Inside the closet, they waited breathless in the dark. Listening.</p><p>Please, Violet prayed. Please, just let them go past.</p><p>The front door of the shop creaked open. \u201cHullo?\u201d</p><p>Blast.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here,\u201d she whispered sternly to Christian. \u201cI\u2019ll go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go out there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the two militiamen Lord Rycliff assigned to stand watch in the village. The others couldn\u2019t have found us yet. These men know me. I\u2019ll talk my way out of this, just like I did in the kitchen at Summerfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were supposed to be at Summerfield. There\u2019s no reason for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll invent one.\u201d She searched her brain for an idea. \u201cI...I\u2019ll tell them I needed female necessities because I\u2019m on my courses. Believe me, that will quash all inquiry. Men never press for details.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her arm. \u201cBut Violet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Not a sound.\u201d She eased the door open, calling out as she emerged, \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, sirs. There\u2019s no intruder. It\u2019s only me.\u201d</p><p>She shut the storeroom door and turned.</p><p>\u201cAnd who the devil are you?\u201d A man raised a lamp, momentarily blinding her.</p><p>Even though she could barely make him out, Violet instantly knew two things.</p><p>First, this man was neither Aaron Dawes nor Rufus Bright. He was a man she\u2019d never met before, but she knew him well by his reputation. His very bad reputation.</p><p>Second, she knew she must keep Christian hidden at all costs. After tonight, she understood why he\u2019d begged for his assignment in Brittany. And she knew it would destroy him, if that mission were compromised.</p><p>With trembling fingers, she slid the latch on the storeroom door, barring Christian inside. Using the toe of her slipper, she nudged Nellie the dress form in front of the door to obscure any movement or noise.</p><p>And then she turned to face the intruder, Mr. Roland Bright. Sally, Finn, and Rufus\u2019s wayward father. She\u2019d never laid eyes on the man before, but his shock of white-blond hair marked him at once.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, girl.\u201d He waved the lamp in her face. \u201cWho are you? And what do you think you\u2019re doing in my shop?\u201d</p><p>Violet swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m Miss Violet Winterbottom. And I didn\u2019t mean any harm, sir. I woke in the night with a...\u201d She crossed her arm over her belly. \u201cWith a female complaint. I didn\u2019t want to disturb Sally, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came to steal from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, sir.\u201d She gulped.</p><p>His upper lip curled as he dragged a cold look from her toes to her crown. \u201cYou woke in the night wearing a silk gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so tired earlier, I fell asleep without undressing. Silly me.\u201d Violet edged away from the storeroom, back toward the counter where she\u2019d left the pistol. She didn\u2019t want to have to use the gun, but she was very glad she knew how.</p><p>But she had to reach it first.</p><p>Just a few steps to the side...</p><p>He chuckled, and she caught the odor of rum rolling off his breath. \u201cA female complaint, you say? I\u2019m willing to bet I know it. Your little cunny was complaining it\u2019s hungry for cock.\u201d</p><p>Violet froze. No one had ever spoken to her that way. The crude words had just the effect he likely meant them to have. She felt small and nauseated. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do, you ruttish little baggage.\u201d His boot made a heavy thunk as he stepped toward her. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t what kind of soiled doves make their way to this village lately? Sent down here by the high and mighty families that can\u2019t stand to look at their slatternly faces no more. That rooming house...\u201d He turned his head and spat. \u201cNothin\u2019 but a high-class whorehouse with lacy drapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>She took another step backward. The counter\u2019s edge bumped her spine.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Violet willed herself not to glance toward the pistol. She needed the advantage of surprise. Instead, she kept her eyes fixed on his ugly, leering face.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies at the Queen\u2019s Ruby are quite virtuous.\u201d Mostly.</p><p>\u201cExcepting you, it would seem. Off to meet someone tonight, I\u2019d wager. Come to pocket a few French letters from my top shelf first? A bit of vinegar and a sponge, before you go slumming with a farmhand? The high-class miss can\u2019t risk getting a lowborn brat.\u201d He sneered, revealing a grayed front tooth. \u201cCunning little whore, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She clutched the edge of the countertop as his words backed her into a dark, shameful corner. Cunning little whore.</p><p>This was why Violet had never confided in anyone about her night with Christian. How could she admit to giving up her virtue so easily? Everyone knew well-bred young ladies didn\u2019t do such things. She\u2019d feared they\u2019d mark her as loose, wanton. A cunning little whore.</p><p>And some part of her had feared they might be right.</p><p>But no. It wasn\u2019t right. There\u2019d been nothing salacious or tawdry about what she and Christian had shared. Nothing wrong about what they felt for each other, then or now. He loved her, and she loved him.</p><p>She loved him. Always had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a...\u201d She straightened her spine. \u201cI\u2019m not a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d The black pupils of his eyes glittered. With ominous deliberation, he set aside the lamp. \u201cMayhap I\u2019ll make you one.\u201d</p><p>The brute reached for her.</p><p>Violet turned and made a wild grab for the pistol.</p><p>Oh, God. It wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>The latch on the storeroom door began to rattle. Christian was trying to force his way out.</p><p>With a grunt, Roland Bright turned toward the noise. A menacing chuckle lifted his chest. \u201cThat your sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>He released Violet and went to investigate the source of the noise. But not before drawing a knife from his belt.</p><p>Oh, Lord. Christian.</p><p>Violet hoisted herself onto the countertop and slid across to the business side. She yanked open drawer after drawer.</p><p>Shears. There were shears here, for cutting the fabric and ribbons. Somewhere. She would find them, and she would use them. To save Christian, she would stab that disgusting lout in the kidneys and not spare him a moment\u2019s remorse.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>She whipped her head up\u2014just in time to watch the room explode. Bits of white flew in every direction.</p><p>Nellie the dress form, propelled with bullet force, reeled away from the storeroom and tackled Roland Bright to the ground. Like an outraged, headless woman charging under her own power. Bright\u2019s head made a sharp crack as it connected with the floor.</p><p>When the dust\u2014or lint\u2014settled, Violet saw Christian, pistol in hand, kicking his way through the storeroom door\u2019s bullet-shredded latch.</p><p>She pressed a hand to her chest, overwhelmed. In firing that shot, he\u2019d risked everything. His life, his mission, his family name. But his only thought was for Violet.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He stood over Roland Bright and nudged the man\u2019s shoulder with his boot.</p><p>\u201cWas he shot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so, unfortunately. He\u2019s just stunned.\u201d</p><p>Christian hauled on the man\u2019s collar and slammed the pistol butt across the back of his head. Then he released his grip on Bright\u2019s shirt, letting his ugly face fall back to the floor with a thunk.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He panted for breath. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p><p>A nervous giggle bubbled in Violet\u2019s throat as she surveyed the scene. The unconscious Roland Bright sprawled limp, pinned to the floor by a disemboweled dress form wearing dotted muslin. Bits of cotton batting littered the ground like new-fallen snow.</p><p>There was no covering up this clamor. Already, Violet heard shouts, footsteps. Forget their lead on Rycliff and the militiamen. The entire village was coming awake. At any moment, they\u2019d be discovered.</p><p>She reached for the smuggler\u2019s lantern. Then she locked eyes with Christian, and they came to an immediate, silent agreement.</p><p>Run.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>They dashed out of the shop, hand-in-hand. Violet had meant to lead him round the corner, so they could duck down one of the village\u2019s smaller, darkened streets. But she spied torchlight coming from the lane.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Changing course mid-step, she led him on a mad dash across the lane, onto the village green. They darted from tree to tree. Behind them, curious Spindle Cove denizens shrugged into outerwear and took to the streets. Violet prayed their attention would be drawn to the shop, and not to a pair of shadow-cloaked lovers charging toward St. Ursula\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d She pulled him into the alcove of the gothic cathedral\u2019s side door. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait here until it\u2019s safe to continue.\u201d</p><p>From behind a stone column, she peered across the green. She saw Aaron Dawes and Rufus in their militia uniforms. She hated that poor Rufus would find his father that way\u2014but from what she knew of the Bright family history, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Villagers trickled out from their homes, to see what had caused the commotion.</p><p>\u201cOnce everyone\u2019s attention is focused on the All Things,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll make a run for it.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced toward Christian and found him gazing at her.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Violet. Look at you. You\u2019re remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed with a blush. After all this time, it was nice to be noticed.</p><p>He took her by the shoulders and swiveled her to face him. \u201cBy now, you must know how sorry I am, and how much I care. I want to make it up to you, and I will. If only you\u2019ll wait. Can you find it your heart to do that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian...even as a girl, I found it in my heart to wait. I waited all those years you never noticed me. And that was when you were an undeserving, callow youth. We\u2019re grown now, and both much improved in character this past year, I daresay. I can find it in my heart to do a great deal more than wait. I can find it in my heart to lie for you, steal for you, take your secrets to my grave. I was...\u201d Her voice failed her for a moment. \u201cI was willing to kill for you just now.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed her arms and swore. \u201cI hate that I put you in such a position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand. I\u2019m not asking you take pity on me. I\u2019m saying, trust in me. Ask more of me.\u201d She took his hand and pressed it to her chest. \u201cThis heart can do more than wait. This heart could love you so strongly, so fiercely\u2014you\u2019d feel the force of it all the way in Brittany. Or in Bali, for that matter. But you must give me something more than vague notions of a future courtship. My parents are determined to see me married. Your own sister has appointed herself my matchmaker. Am I supposed to resist them all, for heaven knows how long, simply on the promise of a few apricot ices in the park and a night or two at Vauxhall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can offer you,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless I abandon my assignment, end my career, and heap shame on my entire family. I just can\u2019t do that to them, Violet. Not after everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask that. I don\u2019t want to ask you for anything, can\u2019t you understand? There\u2019s a question I\u2019m wanting to be asked.\u201d</p><p>His expression changed. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rather important question.\u201d</p> <p>He blinked. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Did he? If he\u2019d caught the hint, he showed no intention to act on it. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t prepared to go that far. But now that she\u2019d said this much, Violet simply couldn\u2019t back down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent so much of my life in the corners. Watching you live life to the fullest and patiently hoping to catch your attention someday. I can\u2019t keep waiting like that anymore.\u201d His gaze fell, and she dipped her head to catch it. \u201cEverything would be different, if... If I weren\u2019t waiting on a someday fantasy, but acting true to my betrothed.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened, binding her to his chest. \u201cViolet. I hadn\u2019t even dared to dream you might accept me this soon. You deserve a great more groveling and atonement first. But if you\u2019re sure you want this here, now...\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Actually, she\u2019d wanted it in London, a year ago. But here and now would suffice. \u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p>A bewildered, ecstatic smile lit his face. He had it quickly mastered, shoved back under the manful composure. But not before she\u2019d seen that flash of emotion. It was like a blink of pure joy. She loved that she\u2019d caused it.</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d He stepped back. He pulled on the lapels of his coat to straighten it, then pushed both hands through his hair to calm the ruffled waves. She loved him for the small endearing gesture of vanity. Even with the wild hair, coarse attire, and the twice-broken nose, he was the still the most handsome man she\u2019d ever known.</p> <p>He turned back to face her and took her hands in his. \u201cViolet. Dear, sweet Violet.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt. Even though she knew full well it was coming, her heart insisted on that joyful bounce. At last, it beat. At last, at last.</p><p>\u201cViolet, I...\u201d He stopped, frowning.</p><p>Now her heart pinched. No, don\u2019t stop. Why are you stopping?</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. You\u2019re shivering like a leaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she forced through chattering teeth. A freezing gust of wind stung her cheeks. Her nose must have been bright red. \u201cC-carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s truth.\u201d He wrapped her tight in his arms, enveloping her in delicious masculine warmth. \u201cDarling, you know I would fall to my knees, beg your forgiveness, extol your virtues, and plead for your hand. But it\u2019s too damn cold for speeches. Just know that I love you, to the very center of your brave, beautiful, generous soul. And if you\u2019ll have me, I won\u2019t ask you to wait another day. I\u2019ll marry you right here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here and now?\u201d Surely she\u2019d heard him wrong. \u201cIf only it were possible.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, Violet. Anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the church looming over them. \u201cI know we\u2019ll have to do it again someday. Inside one of these, rather than huddled outside the door. With our families and friends and a clergyman and a license, and every lavish bit of froth you ever dreamed. You\u2019ll be so beautiful, and I\u2019ll be so proud.\u201d He touched her face. \u201cBut I will make my vow to you right now, on this doorstep, with God and all these carved saints looking on. And if you\u2019ll have me...from this night forward, you will be Lady Christian Pierce in my heart.\u201d</p><p>His thumb caressed her cheek. His eyes held her, warm and strong. \u201cI, Christian James, take you, Violet Mary, to be my wife. To have, to hold. To love, honor, and cherish. To amuse, to pleasure, to make smile and laugh. To dance with, at every opportunity. To respect always, and tease on occasion. To confide in, whenever need be. To treasure, protect, admire\u2014\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but give a nervous laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think these words are in the vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in my vows,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cBut in the interests of time, I shall to return to form. All that richer-poorer, sickness-health business goes without saying. And I will gladly forsake all others, so long as we both shall live.\u201d His hand slid back into her hair, grasping tight. Raw emotion roughened his voice. \u201cI need a lifetime with you.\u201d</p><p>She began to tremble, and not from the cold.</p><p>\u201cI, Christian,\u201d he whispered, \u201ctake you, Violet. And I pray to God you\u2019ll see fit to take me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled. She loved this man so much it hurt.</p><p>\u201cChristian.\u201d She took his hand in both of hers. And whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s time to run.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>There was simply no time to waste.</p><p>Now that everyone had assembled before the All Things Shop, Violet knew they had a clear path round the church and the remainder of the green. To the Queen\u2019s Ruby rooming house, where Violet and all the other visiting ladies stayed.</p><p>She led him around the back of the building, through a little-used entrance. As she\u2019d suspected from the lights warming the parlor windows, it seemed all the ladies had gathered in the large front room.</p><p>Violet made her way down the corridor and put her ear to the wall.</p><p>\u201cLadies, ladies.\u201d Through the jumble of conversation, she made out Diana Highwood\u2019s voice. As always, the voice of calm and reason. \u201cLadies, please. I know the news from Summerfield is alarming, but I have faith everything will be fine. Mr. Dawes has instructed us to remain gathered in the parlor until he returns. The militiamen are searching the village.\u201d</p><p>Violet bit her lip. If the militiamen were searching the rest of the village, that meant the safest place for her and Christian was here. For the moment, anyhow.</p><p>Another chorus of replies rose up from the ladies, and Violet took advantage of the noise. She grabbed Christian\u2019s sleeve and pulled him up the back stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d he whispered, as they made their way down the deserted corridor.</p><p>Lifting a finger to her lips for silence, she opened the door to her chamber and pulled him inside.</p><p>What supreme patience it cost her, not to slam the door shut. But Violet forced herself to guide it by slow degrees. Inch by torturous inch. By the moment the latch finally turned with a gentle click, her heart must have beat a hundred times.</p><p>At last, she turned to him in the darkened room. \u201cI\u2019m not taking you anywhere. I\u2019m just...taking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Placing her hands to his chest, she backed him toward the bed. When the mattress hit him in the back of the knees, he sat down on the coverlet. Fabric rustled as she hiked her skirts a bit. Just enough to sit on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI, Violet Mary, take you, Christian James.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cTo be my husband. To have, to hold. To love and honor. All that sickness-health, richer-poorer business too. Forsaking all others, so long as we both shall live.\u201c</p><p>His hand found hers. \u201cYou didn\u2019t promise to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d She kissed his jaw. \u201cWhat if I substitute, \u2018To make wild, passionate love to at every possible opportunity\u2019 instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it and gladly, so long as...\u201d He sucked in his breath as her lips grazed his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo long as what?\u201d She kissed his ear.</p><p>\u201cSo long as this counts as an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s all the honeymoon we\u2019re likely to get.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her, and together they fell back onto the bed. Kissing, caressing, clutching at each other. Pulling futilely at one another\u2019s clothes.</p><p>With one swift, arousing flex of his arms, Christian flipped her onto her stomach. His strong, rough fingers tore at the closures of her gown and the tapes of her corset. As the garments came loose, she could hear his breath grow increasingly ragged. His desire increased hers. Dampness surged between her legs.</p><p>He tossed her skirts to her waist. His weight covered her as he positioned himself between her sprawled legs. Violet was shocked. What did he mean to do?</p><p>She felt the moist heat of his tongue against her nape. He bit her exposed shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he growled against her ear, \u201cI\u2019ll take you like this.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, he pulled her hips up and back, bringing her swollen sex flush with the hard ridge of his arousal. He thrust against her a few times, rubbing her through the layers of his trousers and her petticoats. Her aching breasts rubbed against the counterpane. She found herself riding his movements, craving yet more friction. It was wild and animal, and it felt so very, very good.</p><p>Then he stopped, rolling his weight to the side and lifting her by the waist. He repositioned them so that she sat on her knees, straddling him face-to-face. He kissed her neck and shoulders, wrenching the loosened fabric down.</p><p>\u201cAnd someday,\u201d he breathed, \u201cyou\u2019ll take me like this. Slowly, sweetly. As we kiss for hours.\u201d</p><p>Holding her hips in his hands, he rolled her pelvis. A moan of pure pleasure eased past her lips.</p><p>More. She needed more.</p><p>As he pushed the gown and chemise lower, sliding her arms free and then baring her to the waist, she rocked against him in an instinctive motion.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned, taking her bared breasts in his hands and thumbing her hard nipples. \u201cYou\u2019re so lovely. So beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t stop to argue that it was too dark to see a thing. She felt lovely and beautiful in his hands. And most of all, powerful. She set her own rhythm, sliding over his unyielding length again and again. Pushing herself closer and closer to release.</p><p>But in the next moment, he stripped all power from her. With a muttered curse, he flipped her onto her back and divested her of the green silk gown.</p><p>\u201cBy God, Violet. When I come back, I\u2019ll make love to you forty different ways. But tonight, I think we\u2019d best keep it simple.\u201d</p> <p>He moved between her legs. As she stared up at him, he pulled his shirt over his head and cast it aside. Only the faintest glimmer of light penetrated the small room. With his white shirt discarded, he was a lover formed of shadows and smoke. She reached for him, sliding her hands up his arms, needing to reassure herself that he was real. Loving the feel of his strong, sculpted muscles beneath her palms. She writhed her hips, desperate for more contact.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she begged. \u201cJust make love to me now. Any way you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He bent to nuzzle her breasts. She gasped as his tongue swirled over her nipple, teasing it to a firm peak before drawing it deep into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you too. I need to feel you come for me. And considering how long it\u2019s been, I don\u2019t trust myself to last.\u201d After giving her other breast a thorough mouthing, he kissed his way down her belly. \u201cThis way first.\u201d</p> <p>He parted her sex with his rough, callused fingers. And then he touched her\u2014there\u2014with the wicked, velvet heat of his tongue.</p><p>For better or worse, she\u2019d always been a quiet girl. But for the first time in her life, Violet wanted to be loud. She wanted to shout and scream and call on God in twenty different languages.</p><p>Instead, she covered her mouth with her forearm and moaned into her own feverish skin. Thrashing as he pleasured her with his skillful tongue and lips. With her free hand, she reached overhead, gripping the bedpost tight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t pause a moment in his sweet, flicking, suckling attention.</p><p>Yes. Yes.</p> <p>When the climax took her, she bit her wrist to keep from crying out. The little burst of pain only heightened the pleasure. Bliss racked her in wave after pulsing wave.</p><p>As she lay limp in the aftermath, he kissed his way back up her belly and returned to suckling her breasts. His erection nudged her thigh\u2014a reminder that that while she felt thoroughly sated, his need had not been slaked.</p><p>But as she opened her eyes, Violet noted another call for urgency. He pulled away from her taut nipple, and the faintest wash of light from the east-facing window illumined the glistening tip.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t here yet. But it was coming.</p><p>She clutched his shoulders, tugging at him. \u201cChristian. Christian, it\u2019s starting to get light. We have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>No.</p> <p>Not this time. They\u2019d been interrupted again and again over the course of this wild, wonderful night. Christian didn\u2019t care if the Prince Regent himself was at the door. This was going to happen, and it was going to happen now.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d he whispered, burying his face between her breasts. He nuzzled close to her rapidly pounding heart. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019ll hang for it. I need to be inside you. Don\u2019t tell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you to stop.\u201d He could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cJust to hurry.\u201d</p><p>Very well. That he could do.</p><p>Christian reached for the closures of his trousers, tugging the falls open and pushing the waistband down to his knees. His eager cock sprang forth, jutting toward her in an expression of pure, carnal need.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She reached for him, sliding her fingertips up his arms. His cock brushed her thigh. A jolt of desire shot through him, melting to a fierce tingle at the base of his spine.</p><p>He took himself in hand and positioned his hardness at the center of her soft, wet heat.</p><p>Sweet mercy.</p><p>It went easier than the first time, but she was still just the palest shade beyond innocence. So very, very tight.</p><p>He forced himself to pause, allowing her body a few moments to adjust. It was so dark. He couldn\u2019t scan her eyes for cues to her emotions. Was she frightened? Regretful? In pain?</p><p>\u201cChristian,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Her voice held only desire. Trust. Love.</p><p>\u201cViolet.\u201d</p><p>Shifting his weight to the other elbow, he slid an inch deeper. He panted for breath and prayed for restraint.</p><p>\u201cThis was it, Violet. This was when I truly knew. The moment we joined, it felt so right. I felt as though I\u2019d...\u201d He nudged all the way in, sighing deep. \u201cAs though I\u2019d found the other half of myself.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers soothed his back. \u201cI never once regretted making love to you. I felt I should regret it, but I couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I kept the secret all this time. Because I feared others would label me weak or wanton...but I wasn\u2019t either of those things. I was just in love.\u201d</p><p>And at that moment, Christian knew he was the most fortunate bastard in England. Scratch that. Most fortunate bastard in the world.</p><p>Stretching her neck, she pressed kisses all along his throat. \u201cLove me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLove me now.\u201d</p><p>At first he set a slow rhythm, taking care to be as quiet as possible. But the way she undulated beneath him, sighing lustily with his every stroke, had him abandoning the slow, steady course. His hips bucked faster, until the slap of their bodies meeting resounded through the small room. The bite of her fingernails on his back urged him faster still. One of her slender legs wrapped over his, adding yet another source of sleek, feminine friction to drive him wild.</p><p>\u201cViolet. Oh, God. Violet.\u201d</p><p>He rose up on his knees for better leverage, lifting her hips. She arched against him greedily, rolling her head to one side. Could she possibly...?</p><p>He pressed his thumb to her pearl, working it feverishly. \u201cYes, darling. Again.\u201d</p><p>Her body clenched around him as she found her pleasure a second time.</p><p>God in heaven.</p><p>Her body stroked his cock in pulsing waves, dragging him perilously close to the edge. He hated the thought of withdrawing, but he knew he must. He\u2019d used up all their contraceptive luck the first time, and he couldn\u2019t risk leaving her pregnant.</p><p>But God, he loved the thought of her pregnant. He went a bit wild at the image of her swollen with his child. Nursing his babe with those soft, perfect, bouncing breasts...</p><p>With a muttered oath, he pulled free and took himself in hand, spending over her taut belly.</p><p>Then he slumped atop her, burying his face in her neck. She folded her arms around his torso. His seed glued them together at the middle. Someday it would fuse the two of them into in one new, unique soul.</p><p>Someday soon, God and Wellington willing.</p><p>He felt a small tremor quake through her, and pushed up on his elbow, concerned. \u201cAre you well? You\u2019re not weeping, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>She convulsed again\u2014but in muffled laughter, not tears. The smile on her face could have lit the whole room. It certainly kindled a blaze in his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that I shall have to rename you.\u201d She pushed the hair back from his brow. \u201cOh, Christian. That was anything but a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Oddly enough, procuring the boat was the easiest part of all.</p><p>So much easier than leaving the bed.</p><p>Violet wished they could just fall asleep together and lay tangled there until dawn. Who cared if they were discovered? Let them be found. Christian would marry her, and they would go home together. Their families would be so pleased. There would only be the small matters of his crushing guilt and the potential charges of treason.</p><p>She sighed. She could let him go. Just this once, for God and country. But she could not have parted with him for anything less.</p><p>As he stretched and dressed, she rose from bed. She slipped back into the green silk and tied a dark, nondescript woolen cloak over it.</p><p>From one of her packed trunks, she withdrew a pair of nubby, hand-knit gloves and a small folding knife. \u201cI\u2019d been saving these as Christmas presents for someone. Now I know they were for you.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the small gifts with a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure them always.\u201d</p><p>Once they\u2019d dressed, she led him down the back stairs and out to a storage lean-to attached to the back of the building. There was a lock, but Christian made short work of it. Together, they wrenched opened the door, waved away a cloud of dust, and shone the smuggler\u2019s lantern on a small rowboat.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies use it in the summertime,\u201d she said. \u201cFor pleasure jaunts around the cove, or up the canal. No one will notice it\u2019s missing for months.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian, this is hardly the time to complain about color schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I just would rather it be blue or brown or black. Some darker color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate for you to take a fisherman\u2019s craft, just to abandon it. The fishermen need their livelihood.\u201d</p><p>He scouted the small shed. \u201cFound some pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll blacken the thing. Give me the lamp, and I\u2019ll warm it.\u201d</p><p>They worked together, daubing the boat\u2019s exterior with a hasty layer of dark, sticky pitch. Then they hoisted the inverted craft between them, carrying its weight on their shoulders and rigging the smugglers lantern to hang in the center.</p><p>All too soon, they were in the cove, making their farewells. A thin layer of clouds had covered the moon, diffusing its light to a warm, creamy glow. Scattered snowflakes began to fall.</p><p>Forcing down the sadness in her chest, Violet went about lighting the lantern. \u201cRemember the signals?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI know this cove in the dark. Just keep your eyes on me. I won\u2019t steer you wrong.\u201d</p><p>With his fingertips, Christian turned her face to his. \u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Christian held her there, allowing himself this one last, lingering minute to memorize her every feature. To simply behold his love. His lady.</p><p>And what a lady she was. Pride swelled his heart. Violet was his ideal partner. Brave, clever, discreet, swift with a gun, possessed of an extraordinary facility with languages...</p><p>And she was so beautiful. Her skin glowed in the first, faintly yearning hint of dawn. Her eyes were big and blue enough to hold the entirety of this magical night. God, how he wished he didn\u2019t have to leave her behind. If only he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cTake me with you.\u201d Her whispered plea wrenched at his heart. She held on to his coat with both hands and pulled up on her toes. \u201cPlease, Christian. Take me with you. I can help you. I know I can do it. You know my French is impeccable, and I\u2019ll perfect the Breton. I\u2019ll blend right in as your wi\u2014\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and lowered herself to the ground. \u201cThat is...unless the humble farmhand already has a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he assured her, smiling a little. \u201cNo, Violet. The humble farmhand does not have a wife. Nor a sweetheart, nor a lover.\u201d He pulled the folding knife from his coat and severed a stray lock of her hair, then pocketed it. \u201cThe humble farmhand has a braided lock of golden hair. He keeps it stashed behind a loose board, and sometimes he foolishly kisses it in the dark. He is alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>A snowflake dipped and swirled and clung to her cheek, instantly melting into a teardrop. He kissed it away, then hugged her close. \u201cI wish I could. I wish I could take you with me as my wife. But it wouldn\u2019t be safe. Not now, not like this. I\u2019d be putting lives other than my own at risk. And imagine, if you disappeared so suddenly...by all appearances, abducted by a raving Frenchman...? Your family would suffer so much worry and pain. Spindle Cove would cease to be a haven for the ladies who need it. No reasonable families would send their daughters or sisters to such a place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She buried her face in his neck. \u201cI know you\u2019re right, on every score. I only wish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my love.\u201d He cinched his arms around her waist. \u201cI wish it too.\u201d</p><p>He held and kissed her just as long as he safely could. And then he held and kissed her for several seconds longer. But he knew it must end.</p> <p>Even a love this true, this strong had no chance to stave off daybreak.</p><p>He pulled away. \u201cYou do this for me, Violet. You must go back to Town and go on living your life, and you must do it all without breathing a word of this night. Not to anyone, not even our families. My own father does not know the particulars of my assignment, nor should he. It\u2019s for my safety. Do you understand? Beneath everything, you are my lady. But to the world, you must behave as if this night never occurred.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI promise. And you must do the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Or ya.\u201d He swore. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken a dangerous amount of English tonight.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and looked at him, her gaze sharpening in the night.</p><p>\u201cViolet? What is it?\u201d</p><p>She released her grip on his lapel. Before he could spend a split heartbeat to wonder what she was on about, her palm connected with his cheek.</p><p>Lord above. She\u2019d struck him. Square across the face, and hard enough to force his head to the right.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>When he hesitated, another blow whipped his head left. In his vision, a chorus of dancing snowflakes wished him a very merry Christmas.</p><p>He blinked the pain away, whispering, \u201cCorentin Morvan eo ma anv.\u201d My name is Corentin Morvan.</p><p>\u201cLouder.\u201d Her fist drove into his gut. \u201cWho are you? Where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe a zo un tamm peizant.\u201d He groaned the words. I am a humble farmhand.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d She reached into his breast pocket and withdrew the folding knife. In less than a second, she had the blade snapped open. Its edge gleamed white under the moon.</p><p>With one hand, she caught him by the collar. With the other, she held the knife to his throat. Cold steel caught him just below the jaw, threatening the soft, vulnerable place where his pulse raced.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTell the truth.\u201d</p><p>The Breton spouted from his lips. Like blood spurting from some vital wound. \u201cMy name is Corentin Morvan. I am a humble farmhand. I sleep in the barn loft. I know nothing. By the Virgin and all her saints, I swear this to be true.\u201d</p> <p>Pulling at his collar, she lowered the knife to his exposed chest. There, she applied pressure to the blade, scoring his skin. Once, and then again. Two neat, fiery lines of pain etched just beneath his collarbone. His eyes watered as he suppressed the urge to lash out or curse. Wincing, he looked down.</p><p>Thin red slashes made the shape of a tiny V.</p><p>She\u2019d marked him. The act was shocking. Barbaric. Wildly arousing.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine.\u201d She tugged his collar and pulled his face down to hers. \u201cYou are mine. Do not forget it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips claimed his. The ferocity and passion in her kiss set his mind spinning. His body responded with raw, visceral need.</p><p>The knife slipped from her grip, clattering to the shingle beach. She slid both hands into his hair, gathering fistfuls of his overgrown locks to pull him closer. Hold him tighter. Kiss him harder. Until she possessed him so completely, he forgot his own name.</p><p>He only knew he was hers. She\u2019d marked him and claimed him, and he was hers. Flesh and blood, heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cMe da gar,\u201d he murmured, clutching her tight. He dropped his head to brand her throat with hot kisses, then nipped at her bottom lip. \u201cMe da gar, me da gar.\u201d</p><p>I love you.</p><p>They broke apart just as swiftly as they\u2019d united. Little clouds of breath filled the space between them.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cGo now, or I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he moved in silence to the boat. As he pushed the small craft into the black water, she readied the signal lamp. When the water was knee deep, he steadied the rowboat and entered it with the assistance of a helpful boulder.</p><p>\u201cOnce I am clear, you must dash back to Summerfield. Remember, you have no idea what became of me. No notion of my identity or origins. And you will never breathe a word of this, to anyone. All must be as you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be as I promised.\u201d As he gathered the oars, she repeated the instructions. \u201cOne long flash for east. Three short flashes mean veer west.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his understanding. He braced his feet on the baseboard and gave a full-strength pull on both oars. The boat skimmed through the water in response, doubling the space between them.</p><p>As quiet strokes of the oars carried him away, he gazed at her. His fierce angel, guiding his way through the darkness.</p><p>You are my life\u2019s bright star.</p><p>No matter what occurred, he would make his way back to her. Always.</p><p>\u201cI will return to you,\u201d he vowed, pulling on the oars. \u201cI swear it. And when I come for you, Violet...don\u2019t let me find you hiding in the corner.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Violet kept all the promises she made to him that night.</p><p>All her promises, that was, except one.</p><p>As soon as Christian\u2019s rowboat safely cleared the cove, she stashed the lamp behind a boulder and hastened up the beach path. She took the long way around the village, racing the dawn over pastures and fallow fields. With a pang of regret, she dropped her woolen cloak into a stream. She wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it later.</p><p>As she neared the back garden of Summerfield, raised voices reached her ears. No doubt they were turning the manor inside-out, searching for her and the mysterious stranger.</p><p>How was she going to slip back inside unnoticed? What possible excuse could she invent?</p><p>If she\u2019d had days or weeks or even a few hours, she might have been able to formulate a plan. But she didn\u2019t even have seconds. A rear door swung open with a bone-chilling whoosh.</p><p>Two militiamen. Any moment, they would see her.</p><p>Violet made her body go limp. She dropped flat to the snow-dusted ground.</p><p>And there she remained for an agonizingly cold quarter-hour or more, until the men found her. If only she\u2019d collapsed a little closer to the house!</p><p>But find her they did. Eventually. She allowed herself to be carried inside. She looked her best friends right in the eye and merrily dished them up falsehoods for breakfast.</p><p>She\u2019d been drugged, she told them. Just like Mr. Fosbury. Only she\u2019d managed to stay conscious long enough to follow the stranger outside. She\u2019d tracked him as far as the back garden, and there she\u2019d collapsed.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t gained any clues to his identity.</p><p>No, she had no idea what he might have wanted or where he might have gone.</p><p>Yes, it was a remarkable thing that she wasn\u2019t a human icicle, after lying in the frost all those hours. She might have frozen to death. A Christmas miracle, she supposed.</p><p>Lord Rycliff was most displeased with Fosbury, and rather harshly berated the tavern-keeper for his lapse in vigilance. Violet felt a slight twinge of guilt on his account.</p><p>Still, she did not breathe a word.</p><p>The militiamen searched the coastline and countryside, but never found any trace of the mysterious intruder\u2014nothing but a smugglers\u2019 lamp stashed behind a boulder, down in the cove. That seemed an explanation in and of itself. Clearly, the mysterious stranger had been some associate of Bright\u2019s. Or an enemy. Either way, it was a matter for the Excise.</p><p>As he was hauled off, Bright did some wild raving about a slatternly girl breaking into his shop. But considering how he\u2019d been discovered\u2014reeking of spirits and tangled in a compromising position with a dress form\u2014most were inclined to believe he\u2019d mistaken Nellie. The poor, stuffed dear had been ruined in more ways than one.</p><p>The militia handed Bright to the magistrate, Violet went home to London, and that was the end of the excitement.</p><p>Violet carried on with her life. On Twelfth Night, they dined with the Pierce family next door. She inquired politely after Christian\u2019s health and listened to the duke describe his youngest son\u2019s adventures in the West Indies. She spent much of February shopping with Christian\u2019s sister for a whole new wardrobe, patiently listening to all her advice on attracting eligible beaux. Just as she\u2019d vowed, Violet never spoke of that night to anyone in her family, or his.</p><p>She kept all her promises. Save one.</p><p>Try as she might, Violet could not behave as if the night had never occurred. The effects of it shivered through her life in a dozen small, barely perceptible ways.</p><p>She spoke her mind a bit more often. Her tastes ran to daring styles and colors when she visited the modiste. She was bolder, more confident.</p><p>How could she not be? Others looked at her and saw Miss Violet Winterbottom, late-blooming wallflower. But beneath the disguise, she knew herself to be Lady Christian Pierce, seductress and secret agent.</p><p>From the first ball of the Season, her increased confidence drew interested gazes from gentlemen and several complimentary remarks from her mother\u2019s friends. Her mother credited the healthful atmosphere of Spindle Cove, and both Lady Melforth and Mrs. Busk expressed a particular wish to send their own patience-trying daughters on holiday.</p><p>Good, Violet thought, smiling to herself. Very good. She didn\u2019t know that the girls would find husbands there, but they just might find themselves.</p><p>Before she knew it, it was April. When word reached England of Napoleon\u2019s surrender at Versailles, all London rejoiced. And from that day forward, Violet\u2019s nerves were strung tight as bowstrings. She spent far too much time sitting in the front parlor, gazing out at the square. By night, she watched for any light in his darkened chambers.</p><p>At the Beaufetheringstone ball, Violet even found herself scanning the crowd for his dark, wavy hair and roguish smile.</p><p>She told herself not to look for him. It might be weeks or even months before he could return, and when he did, he\u2019d turn up at home. But Christian would come for her. Eventually.</p><p>\u201cMiss Winterbottom?\u201d Mr. Gerald Jemison stood at her elbow, holding a brimming cup of ratafia in either hand. \u201cCare for refreshment?\u201d</p><p>Violet wanted to make some polite, solicitous reply, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Because suddenly, he was there.</p><p>He was there.</p><p>Christian.</p><p>It was as though her heart sensed him, even before she spied him all the way at the other end of the ballroom. Yes, it was he. His hair was still overlong, and that roguish nose of his would never be straight again. But he wore a crisp white cravat, a silk brocade waistcoat, and a black topcoat that clung and gleamed like sealskin. The attire of a duke\u2019s son, not a farmhand. He looked magnificent.</p><p>And he was headed straight for her.</p><p>It took everything Violet had not to pick up her skirts and race to meet him. But until he told her otherwise, she would continue to play the part he\u2019d assigned her. She must act as if that night never happened.</p><p>As though that weren\u2019t her love, her lover, the lord of her heart striding purposely across the waxed parquet.</p><p>If she could pretend indifference to this, Violet knew she could feign anything.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Pierce?\u201d Mr. Jemison greeted him, inclining his head in lieu of a bow. \u201cWhat a surprise. I had no idea you\u2019d returned from the West Indies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as of this afternoon. But I\u2019m only in London temporarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemporarily?\u201d Violet\u2019s stomach knotted.</p><p>A little smile played about the corners of his lips. \u201cYou see, my father wishes me to inspect some land prospects in Guiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuiana.\u201d Mr. Jemison still balanced two cups of ratafia. \u201cMy word. Is that in Africa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth America,\u201d Violet murmured. She stared at the floor, quietly reeling. Christian must have been reassigned. Perhaps not to Guiana, but somewhere else, hopelessly far away.</p><p>He\u2019d be leaving her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wonder that you took the trouble to come all this way back to England,\u201d Jemison said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been simpler to catch a ship from Antigua to Guiana instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d Christian agreed. \u201cBut I had an important errand to see to here in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn errand?\u201d Jemison chuckled. \u201cImportant enough for you to cross an ocean?\u201d</p> <p>Christian\u2019s warm, spice-brown eyes caught Violet\u2019s gaze. \u201cImportant enough for me to cross a world. On hands and knees. And then double-back to cross it again.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s heart melted. Her knees tended toward a liquid state too.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d he went on, \u201cI came back all this way for one reason only. To ask Miss Winterbottom to dance.\u201d His gloved hand reached for hers, and he whispered tenderly, \u201cWill you, Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>They moved to the dance floor, leaving Mr. Jemison with two cups of ratafia and an expression of abject confusion. Violet felt a twinge of remorse, but she forgot it soon enough when they reached the dance floor.</p> <p>As Christian\u2019s hand slid between her shoulder blades, his sharp intake of breath was audible. Tears pressed to her eyes.</p><p>To be so near to him, after so many months... She could barely abide having a foot of space between their bodies. She wanted to throw herself against his strong chest, feel the tight embrace of his arms, inhale deeply of his unique scent. Her body warmed, and her sense of rhythm deserted her. They weren\u2019t moving in time with the music at all, but neither of them cared.</p><p>\u201cFrom the shock in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he murmured, \u201cit would seem you kept your end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve amassed quite a cadre of suitors, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t claim to be surprised.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cBut I will admit to being jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be. In all these months, I\u2019ve scarcely thought of anything but you. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d As she squeezed his arm tight, emotion swelled in her breast. \u201cHow long before you must leave again? Please tell me we have more than just one night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Only a few weeks?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make the most of them,\u201d she said, trying to be strong. This was Christian\u2019s career, his tribute to Frederick, his solemn duty in the service of the Crown. If he could bear the separation, so could she. \u201cI assume you aren\u2019t really going to Guiana?\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and whispered in her ear. \u201cNo, my love. We are going to the south of France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Her heart leapt. Oh, the stab of pure hope\u2014it was sharp and sweet. \u201cDid you say we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming you agree, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d follow you anywhere. But France? The war is over. Napoleon is to be exiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany of his supporters remain. Vigilance is necessary, particularly to the south. So I have a new appointment. I\u2019m to be an itinerant professor, of all things. God knows I\u2019ll need your help to manage that. The living won\u2019t be much, but I\u2019ve been promised a cottage near some vineyards. The countryside is beautiful, I hear.\u201d</p> <p>Violet had no doubt of it. A picture appeared in her mind\u2019s eye. Rolling hills scored with rows of grapevines. An ancient cottage with green shutters, nestled on a south-facing slope. White, freshly laundered linens hanging from a line and billowing like sails in the lavender-scented breeze. Dogs. Chickens.</p><p>Christian.</p><p>Excitement buoyed her next twirl in the dance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI know I promised you a lavish affair. But can you make do with a simple wedding? They\u2019d want us settled by late summer, and you\u2019ll have training to complete. I\u2019d like a proper honeymoon before we depart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that too. Where shall we honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere.\u201d He pulled her indecently close, and his hand slid down her spine until his fingertips grazed her backside. Heat flared between their bodies. \u201cSo long as I have you and a warm, soft bed, we don\u2019t need exotic scenery. We don\u2019t even need clothing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed to herself. Oh, what a wonderful, thrilling, passionate, love-filled life they were going to share.</p><p>\u201cFrom tonight on, we should speak French whenever we\u2019re alone. They will give us new names, but I shall make a habit of calling you mon ange, to make it easier. Have you come up with a new pet name for me?\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cI hope I\u2019m no longer The Disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not.\u201d Tilting her head to give him an assessing look, she ran through possible endearments in her mind... mon coeur, mon amour, mon cher.</p><p>\u201cMa moiti\u00e9,\u201d she decided. \u201cMy half. Because when you left, my heart was ripped right down the middle. And when you came back, you made my joy complete.\u201d Her voice broke a little, and her gaze fell to the snowy drifts of his cravat. \u201cChristian, I... I wouldn\u2019t know how to live without you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped dancing and slid both hands to her face, tilting her gaze to his. His eyes were solemn and ardent. \u201cYou will never need to learn.\u201d</p><p>All onlookers were forgotten. The ballroom ceased to exist. They closed the distance between them, each leaning forward by slow degrees...until their lips met in the middle.</p><p>Two halves of one perfect, passionate kiss. </p> </body></html>"]
