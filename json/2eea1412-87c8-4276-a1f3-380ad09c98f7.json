His fingers pressed into her cheeks.</p><p>\"Hey, watch that.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Satoshi said without embarrassment. \"The opportunity presented itself.\"</p> <p>He is such a leach. Cristal continued to climb the wall, glad she had opted for boots instead of heels when she'd dressed the previous evening. Takumijo grabbed her hand and pulled her over the wall. He stood on a ladder they had used to make their escape. Cristal put her feet on the rungs and climbed down behind Takumijo, thankful that she had worn pants, or both men would have gotten quite an eyeful.</p><p>Takumijo climbed back up and tossed the rope back down to Satoshi while she waited at the bottom and acted as a lookout. Satoshi climbed over, and both men grabbed the ladder and stashed it back amongst the cherry trees.</p><p>\"We'd better get back inside the house,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Masaaki will kill us if he finds out we snuck out without the bodyguards.\"</p><p>Cristal had only been working with them for nearly two months, and even she knew that Aomori's manager would have a fit if he found out they'd left the compound without their bodyguards. Satoshi and Takumijo were two of Japan's hottest J-pop artists, and fans mobbed them wherever they went - except for last night, because they wore disguises so they wouldn't be recognized. Of course they did draw a lot of attention from the ladies in the club, since they were both over six feet tall. Being best friends with them did have its disadvantages, especially for these two, who had a penchant for breaking rules and getting into trouble. There were two other members in the J-pop group, Ichiro Yoshida and Yori Morioka, both newlyweds and out of the country with their brides. Both couples would be returning soon for a meeting with Mr. Niigata and Aomori's manager Masaaki.</p> <p>They entered the farmhouse quietly through the side entrance. Takumijo flipped on the light and gasped. \"Shit, we're busted.\"</p><p>Cristal peeped around him and then hid behind him again.</p><p>Masaaki Fugimoto and her boss, Goro Niigata, sat in the living room waiting for them.</p><p>\"Do come in and sit down,\" Goro said to the three of them as he rose.</p><p>Mr. Niigata never raised his voice. He didn't need to in order to get his point across. Masaaki, on the other hand, yelled at them a lot.</p><p>\"You are so grounded,\" Masaaki said to them as if they were a bunch of kids.</p> <p>Satoshi and Takumijo left her and sat down on the sofa like two obedient babies. Cristal sat on one of the leather armchairs, wanting to slap the shit out of them for acting so docile.</p><p>\"Where the hell have you three been?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Clubbing,\" Satoshi volunteered.</p><p>Cristal scowled. He didn't even try to lie. Big baby.</p><p>Mr. Niigata glared at him. \"Without your bodyguards?\"</p><p>Satoshi picked at an imaginary piece of lint from his pant leg. She was surprised he could still see after all the Shochu and beer he had consumed earlier. Hell, she was surprised that any of them had made it home. \"Yes, it was just a spur of the moment thing. We were just sitting around bored, and Takumijo suggested that we get out of the house for a spell.\"</p><p>\"And you listened to him?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"Never again,\" Satoshi said. \"I knew it wasn't the smart thing to do.\"</p> <p>Oh, please, Cristal thought. Satoshi was the one who dragged both of them out of the house.</p><p>Mr. Niigata turned toward Takumijo, who just sat there looking innocent. \"I figured you were the ringleader in all of this, but did you have to drag Ms. Gentry with you?\"</p><p>Takumijo shrugged. \"Well, we couldn't very well leave her in this big house by herself. What if someone would have gotten in?\"</p><p>\"That's what the guards at the front gate are for,\" Masaaki answered.</p><p>\"Didn't stop us from getting out,\" Takumijo reasoned.</p><p>Masaaki stared daggers at Takumijo. \"Didn't you two idiots learn anything from the Shaundra Morrison incident?\"</p><p>\"What Shaundra Morrison incident?\" Cristal asked. She slapped her hand over her mouth, regretting opening it.</p><p>Mr. Niigata turned to face her. \"Shaundra Morrison is Ichiro's wife.\"</p><p>She knew that much.</p><p>\"Because of her affiliation with Aomori, Ms. Morrison experienced the wrath of the fan girls.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Let me rephrase it. Aomori's fan club members do not like other women socializing with Aomori. Some of them can get pretty nasty, if you know what I mean?\"</p><p>She wasn't a complete idiot. \"What does that have to do with me?\"</p><p>\"Is clubbing not socializing?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"Oh, so you seem to think they will come after me?\"</p><p>Goro nodded. \"Yes.\"</p><p>Cristal laughed. \"I'm not afraid of a bunch of silly little girls.\"</p><p>\"You should be,\" Masaaki replied. \"Ms. Morrison was nearly killed when one of her own fan club members blew up her house.\"</p><p>Cristal gasped. \"Just for socializing with Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"No, for messing around with Yori,\" Takumijo let slip.</p><p>\"Huh? Why was she messing around with Yori?\"</p><p>\"Long story,\" Satoshi replied. \"You'll learn all our dirty little secrets soon enough.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about me, Mr. Niigata. I can take care of myself.\"</p><p>\"That's beside the point, Ms. Gentry. If you expect to stay in my employ, you are expected to follow the same rules as Aomori. From now on, I expect you not to go anywhere without taking a guard with you.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. \"What? I don't want some big doofus bodyguard tailing me. I have a life.\"</p><p>\"Not for long, if you don't listen to Mr. Niigata. Or a job either,\" Masaaki told her.</p><p>Crystal frowned. Why did Masaaki have to go and add that last sentence? Japanese businessmen are so...men.</p><p>\"You don't know how many people recognized these two while you were out clubbing. For all you know, right now someone may be posting your pictures on YouTube or spreading rumors about you having an affair with both Satoshi and Takumijo.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. She hadn't thought of that.</p><p>\"You are now a part of Aomori's life, which means you are privy to information that people would kill to get.\"</p><p>\"I think you should have told me that during my employment interview. I thought I just had to write copy for their speeches and feed the media tidbits on the group's activities. I didn't think it came with strings.\"</p><p>\"There are no strings, Ms. Gentry,\" Goro told her. \"Do you have any idea what it's like to be these guys?\"</p><p>\"Well, no.\" She wasn't big or a doofus.</p><p>\"They can't do things normal people take for granted, like going out clubbing, or taking a walk in the park.\"</p><p>\"Or going out on a date,\" Takumijo said grudgingly.</p><p>\"I think I understand.\" Cristal rose and bowed low to Masaaki and Goro. \"I am deeply sorry for my part in tonight's little adventure. I assure you that it will never happen again.\"</p><p>She sat down.</p><p>Satoshi looked over at her and raised an eyebrow like he didn't believe her. She would have poked her tongue at him if she didn't think it was a childish thing to do.</p><p>\"Make sure that it doesn't,\" Goro replied. \"We're not in Osaka right now, and we have to be careful. Your father would be very upset if I let something happen to you.\"</p><p>So true. Her father was very protective of her and even balked when he'd found out she would be working for a J-Pop group. Aomori's reputation for causing trouble preceded them. Cristal rubbed her temple. The Shochu and beer had snuck up on her.</p><p>\"Maybe the three of you should get some rest,\" Goro suggested.</p><p>\"That sounds like a very good idea,\" Satoshi replied. \"I think I'm still drunk.\"</p><p>Mr. Niigata rolled his eyes at the ceiling. \"Maybe you should find a nice girl and settle down like Ichiro and Yori did.</p><p>Marriage seems to agree with both of them.\"</p><p>Satoshi's shoulders tightened. \"Never.\" He rose and headed toward the stairwell that led to the upstairs bedrooms of their rented Korean mansion. \"I love my freedom.\"</p><p>\"And Shaundra Morrison,\" Takumijo teased. \"Besides, who would marry him?\" He's too stuck on himself.\"</p><p>\"Bite me,\" Satoshi replied before disappearing upstairs.</p><p>Shaundra Morrison? Cristal asked in her head.</p><p>\"It is very unwise to tease a scorpion,\" Masaaki told Takumijo. \"See Ms. Gentry to her room. Mr. Niigata and I have some important business to discuss.\"</p><p>Takumijo rose, towering over both men. \"Come on, princess. Time for nighty-night.\"</p><p>Cristal rose. If those words came out of Satoshi's mouth, she was be hightailing it in the opposite direction, but coming from Takumijo it sounded like something a brother would say to her. She walked with him to the stairwell, leaving Masaaki and Mr. Niigata alone. He took her hand and pulled her up the steps.</p><p>\"Masaaki isn't serious when he says we're grounded, is he?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo replied. \"Masaaki is always serious when he says things. We can't leave this place without security.\"</p><p>\"And you're comfortable with being grounded at your age.\"</p><p>\"No, but what else can I do? It is for my own good. I am such a troublemaker.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"Well, I guess it could have been worse.\"</p><p>Takumijo stopped outside her bedroom door. \"You're going to wish for death once this is over. Mr. Niigata is deadly serious. Don't fall for that innocent fatherly act. He plans to get back at us for disobeying him, and he's going to get you too.\"</p><p>\"I hope you're joking,\" she said, putting her hand on the doorknob of the bedroom assigned to her for their two-week stay in Korea.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, no,\" Takumijo said as he continued down the hallway to his room next to Satoshi's.</p><p>Cristal went into her room, closed the door and turned on the light. \"He'd better be joking,\" she mumbled as she walked into the room and sat down on the bed. \"I am a grown woman and not a child who needs to be punished just because I want to go out and have fun with my friends.\" She leaned back on the bed, suddenly exhausted from too much partying and clubbing. Her eyes closed slowly.</p><p>It was close to noon when Cristal's eyes opened up again, and she felt like crap. She hadn't done any binge drinking since college, and she had given all that kind of crap up and become a responsible adult. She sighed. Why did she let those two pretty-face goobers get her into trouble with her boss? \"Never again,\" she moaned as she slid from the bed still dressed in her clubbing clothes. Both of the young men should be out of the house by now, she reasoned as she headed for the bathroom. Takumijo had a commercial to do, and Satoshi was supposed to be at Mr. Niigata's Korean office posing for a magazine cover. That just left her alone to do some girl things, like read a book.</p><p>After her shower Cristal went downstairs to scrounge up something to eat. She found Mr. Niigata and Masaaki seated at the table talking and drinking tea. \"Sorry,\" she said when they looked up and saw her. \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\"</p><p>\"No, come on in,\" Masaaki replied. \"We were just talking about you. There's fresh coffee in the pot and a plate of food in the oven. Satoshi told me to make sure you ate something when you got up.\"</p><p>\"That was very sweet of him.\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Masaaki replied. \"He's just trying to get on your good side.\"</p><p>Cristal heated her food, poured herself a cup of coffee and joined the men at the table. Her meal consisted of rice, fruit, and vegetables. Her body wanted meat, but she took what she could get. The men continued to talk, which gave her time to study them closer.</p><p>Masaaki was in his early thirties, not very tall, but he looked good in the suits he always wore. He wore his dark black hair short and well groomed. He talked in a very educated manner, and she understood why Mr. Niigata had assigned him as manager over Aomori.</p><p>Goro Niigata was in his early fifties, and taller than Masaaki. If she didn't know better, she would swear that the two of them were father and son. Like Masaaki, she'd never seen him in anything but a business suit. His wore his hair short, and it had just started to gray a little at the temple.</p><p>She couldn't say he was the best boss she'd ever had since she'd only had one other job in her life, but she could definitely say he was the meanest. Well, not exactly mean - more like the business-before-pleasure type of person.</p><p>Masaaki pushed a stack of papers toward her.</p><p>\"What's this?\" Cristal asked, swallowing a mouthful of hot coffee.</p><p>\"An assignment,\" Mr. Niigata answered.</p><p>Cristal reached for the papers. \"For Aomori.\"</p><p>\"No, for my entertainment magazine.\"</p><p>Cristal looked down at the crisp Japanese writing and began reading. \"You want me to conduct an interview?\" She'd been hoping he'd use her talents for something more than writing speeches for Aomori.</p><p>\"Yes, I thought it would be nice to do one on a local celebrity while we're here in town.\"</p><p>Cristal continued to read. \"Yi-jun Lee. Who is he?\"</p><p>They both looked at her oddly.</p><p>\"He's a famous movie star,\" Masaaki answered like that was supposed to help.</p><p>Cristal groaned inside. She didn't want to do tabloid reporting. \"I don't watch many movies,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>\"Should I know him?\"</p><p>\"Everyone in Korea knows him.\"</p><p>She shrugged. \"Still never heard of him.\"</p><p>\"Well, that's okay. He's filming in town, and we thought you might like to get an interview for us. There might even be a promotion in it for you if you do a good job.\"</p><p>Okay, she knew a setup when she heard one. \"What happens if I fail?\"</p><p>Mr. Niigata chuckled. \"I'll fire you. We don't have room on the payroll for failures.\"</p><p>Ooh, hadn't expected that.</p><p>\"You won't fail,\" Masaaki assured her. \"You graduated the top of your class in journalism.\"</p><p>Cristal raised her cup to the two snakes. \"When and where?\"</p><p>\"This afternoon. He's filming a new movie not too far away from here. I'll send Hyun-woo with you as cameraman. All you have to do is get Yi-jun to agree to do an interview.\"</p><p>\"That's all?\"</p><p>\"That is it,\" Masaaki answered.</p><p>How come she didn't believe him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Why the hell am I here?\" Cristal asked as she stood among all the reporters from the rival television stations and magazine media. Every Korean reporter in town was trying to get an interview with the illusive movie actor Yi-jun Lee. The last thing she wanted was to try to get dirt on some spoiled and pampered pretty boy.</p><p>She'd been waiting for two hours for him to exit the sound lot where he was filming his latest movie...some type of martial arts film, and she could think of several things she'd rather be doing, including soaking in a tub of hot water.</p><p>Hyun-woo Kim, her cameraman, fiddled with some of his equipment. Hyun-woo had worked for Mr. Niigata longer than she had, and was very experienced in what he did. He was cute for twenty-seven, and had a sweet smile. \"He shouldn't be much longer, Ms. Gentry,\" he said.</p><p>\"How do you know that?\"</p> <p>\"My friend just texted me from the inside. He said they were just about to wrap up taping.\"</p><p>\"You have a friend on the inside? Why didn't ask him to sneak us in or to arrange a private interview?\"</p><p>Hyun-woo shook his head, sending black bangs spilling in front of his eyes. He used his fingers to brush the hair back.</p><p>\"It doesn't work that way with these celebrity types, especially this one. He never gives private interviews.\"</p><p>\"Never gives interviews? Then why am I here?\" She mumbled something under her breath. \"What's so special about him anyway?\"</p> <p>Hyun-woo looked at her like she'd lost her mind. \"What planet have you been on? Yi-jun Lee is one of the biggest stars in Korea, if not in all Asia. He's only twenty-six years old and he's wanted by every film studio in Asia.\"</p><p>Cristal scratched the back of her head...a habit she'd had since childhood. \"Never heard of him.\" She'd been in Osaka trying to have a life. Running behind some movie star never crossed her mind. She had better things to do, like keep her ass out of trouble with Goro Niigata. It was bad enough she had to deal with all the K and J-pop groups he managed. He'd hired her as a publicist for all his groups, but his trophy group Aomori took up most of her time. They thought they owned her just because they ruled the Asian recording market.</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo were lucky they were cute.</p><p>The doors to a big white warehouse inside a high guarded gate opened, and a bunch of people exited.</p><p>\"Someone is coming out,\" Hyun-woo announced.</p><p>Cristal turned to see and caught her heel on the curb of the sidewalk, breaking it. \"Damn,\" she said sitting down on the curve to remove her shoe just as the crowd of reporters moved forward. \"Ooh,\" she said, scooting out of their path so she wouldn't be trampled.</p> <p>\"Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee. What's the movie about?\" she heard a reporter ask in Korean. Unlike Japanese, Korean words flowed smoothly from the mouth. She, fortunately, was fluent in both, thanks to living in Japan most of her life. Being an army brat did have some privileges, which included dual citizenship in Asia and the United States, where her parents were from.</p><p>\"I don't do interviews,\" she heard a deep, sexy voice reply as she struggled to take off both her shoes. The ground cut into her feet, but it was a lot easier than hobbling along on one shoe.</p><p>\"Ah, come on, Mr. Lee. We've been out here waiting a long time. The least you can do is answer a few questions.\"</p><p>Cristal couldn't see a thing from her position on the curb.</p><p>She hoped Hyun-woo had better luck that she did.</p><p>\"No, the least I can do is ignore you.\"</p><p>The crowd started moving again, indicating that the movie star was walking away from them.</p><p>\"The Korean public is curious about you,\" another reporter said. That voice belonged to a female. \"Please say something to all your adoring fans.\"</p> <p>\"No comment.\"</p><p>\"What a jerk,\" Cristal shouted loudly.</p><p>There was a hush in the crowd, and then sea of people parted.</p><p>\"Who are you calling a jerk?\" someone asked her in English.</p><p>Cristal looked up. A very handsome Korean man stood staring down on her. \"Are you speaking to me?\"</p><p>He sighed as if he had expended too much effort acknowledging her presence. \"Yes.\" His English was superb with just a hint of an accent.</p><p>\"No, I wasn't referring to you. I was referring to Yi-jun Lee. Who does he think he is anyway? These reporters are only doing their jobs. He should be honored someone wants to do a story on him when there are so many other important things to write about.\"</p><p>The crowd cheered around her.</p><p>\"Is that so?\" the man asked, peering down on her with dark chocolate-colored eyes. \"What else is more important than him?\"</p><p>\"Plenty of stuff,\" Cristal replied. \"War, poverty, this year's spring fashion collection in Paris.\"</p><p>The man kept looking down on her, which she found a delight since he was taller than she was. She liked tall men.</p><p>He also had an alluring smile. \"True, those things are important, especially the spring fashions, but you can't compare them to the magnificent of Yi-jun Lee.\"</p><p>Oh, oh, obviously a fan of the actor. Her gay-dar hadn't gone off, but he was definitely enamored with the movie star.</p><p>\"Are you serious? Basil Degare's new line of fancy and formal clothes are said to be the best he's ever designed.\"</p><p>The man chuckled. \"But not as impressive as Cerise Augustine's line. The woman has an eye for fashion.\"</p><p>Cristal raised one leg and swept a rock from under her foot. The man lent her a hand and helped her to her feet. He had some serious muscles under his suit jacket. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>She lowered her foot. \"Are you a fan of Yi-jun?' she asked him as he continued to watch her.</p><p>\"One of the biggest. The man is a god.\"</p><p>\"The only gods in this generation are in Tohoshinki, and you can't compare him to them. Besides, he doesn't sound like a god to me. He sounds like he's got a serious case of too much ego.\"</p><p>\"Obviously you aren't a fan. What are you doing here then?\"</p><p>\"My boss sent me here to get an interview for his magazine company. I think he has it out for me, though.</p><p>Apparently he knew it wouldn't be easy. He could have told me that Yi-jun Lee was too stuck on himself to grant interviews.\"</p><p>Laughter resounded through the crowd that she had forgotten was there. Talking to handsome men usually did that to her. \"What's their problem?\" she asked Hyun-woo, who suddenly appeared before her holding his video camera in her face. \"What's so funny?\"</p><p>Hyun-woo lowered the camera. \"You are,\" he answered.</p><p>He raised the camera and pointed it at her.</p><p>Cristal shoved it out of her way. \"You know I don't like to be photographed.\"</p><p>\"Why not?' the handsome man at her side asked. \"You're very photogenic, isn't she, everyone?\"</p><p>Some of the men in the crowd whistled, while others held their cameras in her face.</p><p>\"I already know what I look like. I'm nothing newsworthy.</p><p>I prefer to be on the other side of the camera, thank you.\"</p><p>\"Ah, but you're wrong. Can I see the camera?\" he asked Hyun-woo.</p><p>Hyun-woo handed the very expensive piece of equipment over to a complete stranger. The man put it to his eye and then aimed it at her. \"Smile,\" he said. \"Let all of Asia see you.\"</p><p>\"Don't you have something better to do, like try to catch up with Yi-jun Lee?\" she asked, shying away from the camera. \"Why would I want all of Asia to know me?\"</p><p>\"Why not?' he asked. \"You're beautiful, have a great body, a great sense of fashion and ten perfect toes.\" He lowered the camera to her feet, and the crowd laughed.</p><p>Cristal moved her toes around, thankful that she had gotten a pedicure earlier.</p><p>The man raised the camera. \"What is your name?\"</p><p>\"Cristal Gentry of Niigata Enterprises and KiNii Publishing,\"</p><p>she replied.</p><p>\"Cristal, like the champagne?\"</p><p>\"No, like me. I think I was created first.\" All the attention was beginning to annoy her. Mr. Niigata was going to have a fit when he saw the footage.</p><p>\"Now tell us, Cristal Gentry, what is a beautiful African- American woman like you doing in Korea when obviously you should be gracing the catwalks of Paris?\"</p><p>\"Trying to stay employed, \"she replied. \"Which I probably won't be when my boss finds out about this and that I let Mr.</p><p>Lee get away.\"</p><p>The crowd laughed again. What was their problem?</p><p>\"What if I told you I could get you a personal interview with him?\"</p><p>\"I'd say you're off your rocker. I heard him say that he doesn't give interviews.\"</p><p>\"Oh, he'd do it for me. All I have to do is call him and ask.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, right,\" Cristal replied. \"Nothing is that easy.\"</p><p>The man handed the camera back to Hyun-woo. \"Do you have a cell phone I can use?\"</p><p>Cristal dug into her pocket, pulled out her pink cell phone and handed it over to him to call his bluff. The man accepted the phone and punched in some numbers. Another phone rang nearby. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a black cell phone and answered it. \"Hello,\" he said into the other phone. \"This is Yi-jun Lee calling for Yi-jun Lee. I would like to ask you to do me a favor and grant one interview to this fantastic-looking reporter I just met.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he said in the other phone. \"But only if she agrees to have dinner with me tomorrow night.\" He disconnected both phones and handed hers back over to her.</p><p>Cristal frowned at him. \"You could have at least told me that I was making a fool out of myself in front of all these people and the Asian public. Reporters and cameramen have been recording the entire conversation between us.\"</p><p>Yi-jun smiled innocently. \"But you were so cute. I didn't have the heart to stop you.\"</p><p>\"Bite me,\" she said to Yi-jun as she walked away from him.</p><p>He caught up to her and took her arm, stopping her in her tracks. \"What about the interview?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No thanks.\"</p><p>\"What about dinner?\"</p><p>\"No thanks.\"</p><p>\"What about an adventure of a lifetime?\"</p><p>\"You have a date with Yi-jun Lee?\" Takumijo asked her as she prepared another speech for him. The tall, gorgeous Japanese not only was a spectacular singer but also choreographed all the dances for the group. He fiddled with one of her curls, and she slapped his fingers away. \"I am so jealous.\"</p><p>\"You are not. You're about to star in a drama with Osamu Nakaumura. You have nothing to be jealous of.\"</p><p>Osamu Nakaumura was Japan's hottest movie hunk and a personal friend of Takumijo. The two of them met during another drama shortly after Takumijo made his debut. They had been partnered in several dramas before, and rumor had it that Osamu wanted him for a full-length movie.</p><p>\"But Yin-jun is something special. You'll be the envy of every teenaged girl in Korea.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, right. The only thing I'm thankful for is that Mr.</p><p>Niigata didn't fire me after he saw that footage Hyun-woo brought to him.\"</p><p>\"But you we so cute standing there in your bare feet, holding your broken shoe and fussing with him.\"</p><p>\"Well, he should have told me who he was from the beginning.\"</p><p>\"No, you should have done some research on him before you left to try to get an interview,\" Takumijo replied, sitting down in a chair next to her at the table in the conference room where they often worked together.</p><p>\"Usually I do, but Mr. Niigata didn't give me time to prepare.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"The man does have a way of putting business before pleasure.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Kehoe's the same way when he's in town.\" Harper Kehoe was Mr. Niigata's business partner from America.</p><p>\"And he's great at buying ladies underwear, or so I've heard.\"</p><p>Cristal looked at him oddly.</p><p>\"A long story involving Shaundra Morrison.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro's wife?\" She hadn't met Ichiro or Yori yet but had heard a lot of talk about them.</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"He likes her too. It really messed him up when she married Ich.\"</p><p>\"I just bet it did. How are they doing anyway?\"</p><p>\"They're fine. Ichiro has never been happier. I think Shaundra is the best thing that happened to him.\"</p><p>\"She's much older than him, isn't she?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Twenty-five years older, but they love each other dearly.\"</p><p>\"Now that's newsworthy. Not some story on a conceited actor.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed. \"Yi-jun's not bad.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he is.\"</p><p>\"Then why did you agree to have dinner with him tonight?\"</p><p>\"To get that interview for Mr. Niigata.\"</p><p>\"Good answer,\" Takumijo replied. \"Wear a dress. Men like legs. Makes them talkative.\"</p><p>Cristal stopped writing. \"It does?\" No wonder she hadn't been on a date in years. Japanese men were shyer than American men, and an African-American male was a rarity in Asia.</p><p>\"Yes, and some makeup wouldn't hurt either.\"</p><p>Cristal rolled her eyes at him. \"It's too early in the morning for makeup, and I certainly don't need any to impress you.\"</p><p>Satoshi entered the room wearing a pair of sinfully tight blue jeans that rode low on his narrow waist and slim hips.</p><p>The sleeveless blue shirt gave her a rare glimpse at his muscular arms. He was twenty-six years old and notorious for flirting.</p><p>\"Cristal has a date tonight,\" Takumijo announced as Satoshi poured himself a cup of tea and joined them at the table.</p><p>\"With whom?\"</p><p>\"Yi-jun Lee,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>Satoshi hesitated for a moment and then whistled. \"I'm impressed.\"</p><p>\"Don't be,\" Cristal said, watching him add lemon and sugar to his tea like the Americans. \"I'm just doing it so I can get an interview for Mr. Niigata.\"</p><p>\"Ah, business before pleasure. Wear a dress. Men like legs.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed. \"I told her the same thing.\"</p><p>She supposed she had something appropriate in her closet.</p><p>\"I'll think about it.\"</p><p>\"What's to think about? Show some legs. Maybe you'll get lucky,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"What do I need to get lucky for? I don't even like the man, so I doubt there'll be any hanky-panky going on.\"</p><p>\"You never know,\" Satoshi replied. \"I heard that he's quite charming.\"</p><p>\"Then apparently you've never met him. He's very arrogant.\"</p><p>\"I've lived with Takumijo and Yori. Who are more arrogant than they are?\" Satoshi sipped his tea and eyed her at the same time. \"A little makeup won't hurt to play up those big brown eyes and creamy brown complexion.\"</p><p>\"You guys are ridiculous. I know how to dress on a date. If I doll up too much he might get the wrong idea.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"So what? Flatter the man's ego and get the interview.\"</p><p>\"Why do I hang around with you guys?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Because we are cute and taller than you are?\" Takumijo answered, getting up to fix himself a cup of tea. \"And because it is obvious that you need someone to watch over you while we're in Korea.\"</p><p>She could think of worse situations to be in. \"Thanks. I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedules to work with me.\" She pushed the copy over to Takumijo once he sat back down. \"Memorize this.\"</p><p>Takumijo picked up the paper and read over it. \"It's in Korean.\"</p><p>\"You're in Korea and will be speaking to the Korean public.\" She turned to Satoshi. \"Now for you. Mr. Niigata says that you'll be doing a publicity speech for Aomori's new television special.\"</p><p>\"It's our sixth anniversary,\" Satoshi told her.</p><p>\"Then I'd better do some research to make sure I get the dates down correctly.\"</p><p>\"No need for research,\" Satoshi said, pointing to his bangs- covered forehead. \"I have all the dates buried in here. I can fill you in over lunch.\"</p><p>\"We're doing lunch?\" Cristal asked. She'd planned to do her hair.</p><p>\"Yes, and anything else you want to do.\"</p><p>\"Don't flatter yourself. I don't do J-pop guys.\"</p><p>Satoshi put his hand against his chest. \"You wound me.</p><p>What's wrong with singers?\"</p><p>\"They all want to get into my panties, even those young ones Mr. Niigata has just recruited.\"</p><p>\"Can't beat a man for trying,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"You couldn't handle me,\" Cristal bragged to put his skirt- chasing butt in his place. His sexual exploits were legendary.</p><p>The woman who snagged him would have a lot of work to do to make him monogamous.</p><p>Satoshi eyed her curiously. \"How do you know this, little Cristal? I can make the earth revolve for you if you give me the chance.\"</p><p>\"No thanks,\" Cristal replied. \"I'll take my chances with the arrogant actor.\"</p><p>Satoshi went back to his tea, seemingly not offended. \"And wear good underwear tonight. You'll never know what situation you might find yourself in.\"</p><p>\"No one will be seeing my underwear tonight. We're just going out to dinner and maybe a few drinks in town while I conduct the interview. Nothing else.\"</p><p>\"Wear the lacy stuff,\" Satoshi insisted. \"And don't forget to shave down there.\"</p><p>Cristal wadded up a piece of paper and threw it at him.</p><p>Satoshi caught it and chuckled. \"Brazilian cut preferred.\"</p><p>\"You are so nasty,\" Cristal told him. \"I wonder why we're still friends.\"</p><p>\"Because I add excitement to your life.\"</p><p>\"Don't you guys have a television show to practice for?\"</p><p>she asked.</p><p>\"No, that's not for another four months. We're just here making arrangements. But we do plan to do a bit of practicing when Ichiro arrives from the United States.\"</p><p>\"Pretty little blue-eyed soul,\" she said of Ichiro.</p><p>\"He's married,\" Satoshi reminded her.</p><p>\"Yes, I know, but I heard he's so cute.\"</p><p>\"Not especially,\" Satoshi replied. \"But he does have nice hair.\"</p><p>Cristal stared at him. \"Really, how nice?\"</p><p>\"The last time I saw him it came down to his butt, and it's so soft.\" Satoshi sighed contently.</p><p>\"That is so gay on so many levels,\" Takumijo teased.</p><p>Cristal nodded in agreement. \"I can't wait to meet him.\"</p><p>\"I'll tell him that tonight when I see him,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"After we have lunch and I take you shopping for some decent underwear.\" He rose from the chair and helped her out of hers.</p><p>\"What about Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"What about him?\" Satoshi asked, smiling at his best friend.</p><p>\"Isn't he joining us for lunch?\"</p><p>\"Can't,\" Takumijo replied. \"I have a date with my hairstylist.\"</p><p>\"You guys are so vain,\" Cristal stated as Satoshi dragged her out of the conference room. \"Men aren't supposed to be so pretty.\"</p><p>The limousine arriving at the mansion precisely at seven that evening scored major brownie points for Yi-jun Lee. He stepped out dressed in a formal black tuxedo with his hair slicked back like a gangster, and showing off his impressive brow and masculine features. She was so glad that she had listened to Satoshi and splurged on her new dress and shoes that showed off her legs.</p><p>Yi-jun looked her over from head to toe. \"Perfect. I like a lady who wears dresses. How did you know that red is my favorite color?\" He turned her around to get the full view. \"We have just enough time to make it to the airport,\" he said as he helped her into the limousine and got in beside her.</p><p>\"Why are we going to the airport?\" Cristal asked as she fastened her seat belt.</p><p>\"To catch a plane,\" he told her as the driver pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\"A plane? Where are we going?\"</p><p>\"Paris,\" he announced.</p><p>\"I can't go to Paris. What about my job? And I didn't pack anything?\"</p><p>\"I have arranged everything with Mr. Niigata. He said for you to use your company card to purchase everything you need once you get to Paris.\"</p><p>\"What? When did you speak to Mr. Niigata?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"This morning. He said to take your time and do a good interview for KiNii. Oh yeah, he said enjoy Paris.\"</p><p>Cristal moved around in her seat. She could not believe they were speaking of the same man. The Mr. Niigata she knew wasn't that nice.</p><p>\"Relax. I thought you wanted to see spring fashions, which by the way you're supposed to do a story on while you're there for a week.\"</p><p>She knew it. That was the Mr. Niigata she knew. He expected her to work. \"Why does he assume that I can be gone for a week? I do have a life.\" Well, not really, but she wasn't going to admit it to him.</p><p>\"Relax. You're going to love Paris. The food is great, the people are quaint and the nightlife is spectacular.\"</p><p>Nightlife? What is that?</p><p>The limousine rolled through the streets at an alarming rate. The next thing she knew they had arrived at the airport and were on the landing strip.</p><p>Yi-jun grabbed her hand and helped her out of the car, and then literally dragged her across the field to the waiting jet that had his name embossed on its side.</p><p>An American stewardess greeted them. \"You're right on time, Mr. Lee. The pilot is ready to take off.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Becky. I had to make a little stop first.\"</p><p>The blonde-haired, blue-eyed stewardess looked her over.</p><p>\"Very nice. Killer legs.\"</p><p>\"So I've noticed,\" Yi-jun said, pulling her past Becky and depositing her into a seat next to the window. He scooted in next to her. \"Buckle up.\" He fastened his seat belt.</p><p>The wheels of the plane began to roll, and then it took off.</p><p>The nerves in the pit of her stomach clenched.</p><p>\"You're not afraid to fly, are you?\" he asked, casting a glance her way.</p><p>\"It's a fine time to ask,\" Cristal said sarcastically. Lucky for him she wasn't.</p><p>\"Good evening,\" the pilot said through the intercom system. \"We should be arriving in Paris tomorrow. Please enjoy your ride, and please don't do anything I wouldn't do.\"</p><p>\"What does he mean by that?\" Cristal asked, undoing her seat belt and getting comfortable.</p><p>\"That is Frederick. He has a weird sense of humor.\"</p><p>\"And you trust him to fly us to Paris. What does he think we'll be doing back here?\"</p><p>Becky wheeled out a cart bearing champagne, caviar, fluted glasses and an assortment of food, including chocolate- dipped strawberries.</p><p>\"Anything we desire,\" Yi-jun replied. \"We are the only passengers, and the sky is the limit.\"</p><p>Okay, maybe she shouldn't have drunk so much champagne, Cristal thought after returning from the restroom. She found Yi-jun busy on a laptop computer. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Arranging lunch for us tomorrow before we attend the fashion show,\" Yi-jun answered.</p><p>Cristal passed him and sat down. \"You aren't serious? How did you arrange an invitation to a private event?\"</p><p>\"I know the designer,\" he replied as he shut the laptop down. \"We're old friends.\"</p><p>\"How old?' Cristal asked. \"What are you, twenty-one?\"</p><p>\"Twenty-six,\" he corrected. \"We met right after I completed my military duty.\"</p><p>Young Asian men were required to complete two years of military duty before they turned thirty.</p><p>\"You've done your military duty already?\"</p><p>\"I volunteered shortly after my eighteenth birthday. I wanted an acting career, so I got it out of the way. It doesn't make sense to start a career and then put it on hold for two years.\"</p><p>\"Smart.\"</p><p>\"Another fine quality about me,\" Yi-jun bragged.</p><p>\"There are others?\"</p><p>\"You should be writing this down.\"</p><p>Cristal reached into her purse and pulled out a pad and pen. \"I'm ready.\"</p><p>\"I'm kind, generous, and devoted to my country. I am an excellent son, I give to charities and I'm a sensational lover.\"</p><p>Cristal's head popped up. Yi-jun stared into her eyes. Why hadn't she noticed how hot he was before? \"You are?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he bragged. \"Care to find out?\"</p><p>Cristal yawned. \"Not especially.\"</p><p>\"Are you tired?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"Sort of? It's been a long day.\"</p><p>He put the laptop aside, took her hand and led her to a door at the back of the plane.</p><p>\"What's this?\"</p><p>Yi-jun opened the door. Inside was a complete bedroom suite. She stepped inside. A beautiful white negligee lay across the black satin comforter. \"It should fit,\" he informed her. \"Satoshi told me your size.\"</p><p>\"When did you speak to him?\"</p><p>\"While the two of you were out shopping. He texted me.\"</p><p>Why didn't she suspect the two Romeos were friends?</p><p>\"Remind me to kill him when we return to Korea.\"</p><p>Yi-jun smiled. \"He is right. You do have stars in your eyes.</p><p>Pleasant dreams,\" he told her as he stepped outside the room and closed the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yi-jun looked down on the sleeping journalist, trying to figure out why he had gone to such lengths to impress her.</p><p>Normally women didn't have a problem following his lead, but he suspected that this one would not be submissive.</p><p>She was beautiful even in slumber. His trained eyes took in every detail. The almond-shaped eyes, the slender nose, the tantalizing full lips and skin the color of cappuccino. Part African-American and part Caucasian. What lovely babies they would make. His gaze traveled lower. Satoshi was right. The white negligee suited her more than the black one he'd originally suggested. It molded to her nubile young body, emphasizing her magnificent curves that he'd automatically noticed on the first day they met, even though she'd tried to conceal such perfection beneath a pair of baggy slacks and a cotton shirt. He made a face...so not flattering. A woman such as this should be covered in only the best clothes.</p><p>Tempted as he was to discover if the rest of her was natural, he nixed the idea, fearing the way she might react.</p> <p>He opted for brushing his finger along her cheek to gently wake her.</p><p>The lids slid back slowly, revealing two brown irises. They focused on his face. Yi-jun braced himself and waited to be smacked by the feisty temptress for his forwardness, but all she did was blink and stare back at him as if accustomed to waking up each morning with a man staring down on her, checking her out. She was an anomaly...a challenge, and he liked a good challenge.</p><p>Yi-jun moved aside so she could push the covers away from those long coltish legs. She had to lift the hem of the gown to step down on the floor. He looked down at those exquisite red-painted toe nails, and her eyes met his when he raised them again.</p><p>\"Do you see something you like?\" she asked once she decided to speak.</p><p>\"Very much so,\" he replied as she swept past him to retrieve her clothes from a nearby chair. She had to bend over to retrieve them and her shoes, and he took the liberty of gazing at her scrumptious behind. That little sight simply took his breath away. Up until now he had been a breast man, but his tastes were changing. Cristal Gentry's derriere ranked supreme, with those cute little toes coming in a close second.</p> <p>\"Excuse me,\" Cristal said as she brushed past him to leave the bedroom.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"To get dressed in the restroom,\" she replied. \"You've had enough of a peepshow this morning.\" She slipped out of the door, leaving him charmed and taking his heart with her.</p><p>\"Right this way, Mr. Lee,\" a very tall French female chauffeur said to Yi-jun after they made it through customs and out of the airport. Yi-jun escorted Cristal over to a stretch white limousine and past the stunning brunette driver with legs that just went on forever as she held the door open for them.</p><p>\"Thank you, Beatrice,\" Yi-jun said to the young woman.</p><p>\"Take us to Hotel Ritz.\"</p> <p>\"Oui,\" Beatrice replied.</p><p>He said something else to her in French that made Beatrice chuckle and close the door. She walked around and climbed into the front seat. \"Take the scenic route.\" He lifted the partition and snuggled back into the seat.</p><p>Cristal secured the seat belt across her shoulder and waist.</p><p>If he was trying to impress her, he'd done that by not attacking her while she slept aboard the plane. Anything else would just be a waste of time. She was only there for the interview and to cover the fashion show...nothing else.</p><p>Yi-jun reached over and touched a couple of buttons.</p><p>Soulful French music filtered out through the speakers, and an ice bucket containing a frosty bottle of wine and two glasses appeared between their seats. He handed her one of the glasses, popped the cork and filled her glass before filling his.</p><p>\"Isn't it a bit early for wine?' she asked as he made a toast.</p><p>\"Not in Paris,\" he responded, pronouncing it like the natives with a hint of Korean accent.</p> <p>Cristal sipped. It was the good stuff. He was using the big artillery. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"You're welcome.\" He sipped from his glass.</p><p>\"So is this what movie stars do on a regular basis?\"</p><p>\"I don't know about anyone else, but yes, I do like to travel in style.\" He paused. \"You don't like it?\"</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong. It's nice, but I try not to get accustomed to things I won't be doing often.\"</p><p>\"Can you at least give me a smile?\"</p><p>Oh, well, she guessed she could do that. Cheese, she thought, giving it her best effort. Did his eyes flicker when she smiled? It made him look wicked sexy.</p><p>\"Beautiful,\" he said, not taking his eyes away from hers.</p><p>Cristal blushed and looked away.</p><p>\"What's wrong, don't you like me?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"That's not it. I'm just not used to all this attention.\"</p><p>Yi-jun refilled her glass. \"I can't believe that your boyfriend does not spoil you.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"What boyfriend?\"</p><p>\"You're kidding, right?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not joking, and it's a question you should have asked me before you whisked me away for a week. If I had one, he'd be pretty pissed off by now.\"</p><p>\"Probably,\" Yi-jun agreed. \"But at the moment I wasn't thinking about anyone else but me and you. Sometimes I like to seize the moment. It's one of my weaknesses.\"</p><p>Cristal bit her bottom lip to keep from smiling. The great Yi-jun was admitting that he wasn't perfect. \"Do you have any other weaknesses?\"</p><p>\"Yes, pretty female journalists with red painted toes.\"</p><p>\"A foot freak. Groovy.\" He tried to refill her glass a third time, but she stopped him. \"Two is my limit before breakfast.\"</p><p>\"A wise decision. I will stop too to save room for the scrumptious breakfast awaiting us after we cheek into our hotel room.\"</p><p>Cristal raised an eyebrow. \"I hope you just omitted the 's' of that last word by accident.\"</p><p>He smiled smugly. \"Just checking to see if you were awake. Yes, we have two rooms.\" He chuckled. \"You can't blame a man for trying.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I can.\" She emptied her glass and put it back into the compartment. \"Do you always take women on fancy trips?\"</p><p>Yi-jun put his empty glass back next to hers. \"No, you're the first.\"</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously. \"How come I don't believe you?\"</p><p>\"I can't answer that. For some reason you have this preconceived idea of what my life is like.\"</p><p>\"Let me see, if I have it down. You're a young, gorgeous movie star with enough money to do anything you choose to do with it. You're rich, spoiled and surround yourself with beautiful and expensive toys. You date one specific type of woman, big-boobed and empty-headed ones who look good on your arm walking down the red carpet, but who aren't smart enough to know they're only there to make you look good.\"</p><p>Yi-jun stared at her, guarding his emotions. \"True,\" he replied.</p><p>\"So why am I here with you? I'm not big-boobed or empty-headed.\"</p><p>\"Because I got an erection the moment you called me a jerk. I knew right at that moment that I had to find out everything I could about you.\"</p><p>Cristal smirked. \"So you orchestrated all of this just because you got a hard-on?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"Not just any hard-on, the mother of all hard-ons. END EXCERPT It took several hours for it to go down.\" He smiled.</p><p>\"You are so crazy,\" Cristal said with a chuckle. \"It would have been much easier just to pick yourself up a groupie.</p><p>There have to be millions of women who would die just to spend a night in your bed.\"</p><p>Yi-jun stopped smiling. \"I didn't want a groupie in my bed.</p><p>I wanted you.\"</p><p>Cristal stopped laughing. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because you are the last woman on earth who would sleep with me willingly. You aren't impressed with my money, my job or my extremely good looks. In fact, you despise everything about me.\"</p><p>\"So you kidnapped me for revenge?\"</p><p>Yi-jun shook his head, sending a spray of black hair across his forehead. \"No, I arranged all of this because you're the woman I plan to spend the rest of my life with.\"</p><p>\"How are you enjoying Paris?\" Satoshi asked Cristal when she had the chance to call Osaka after getting into her room.</p><p>\"Remind me to kill you when I get back.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. It sounded deep and sexy. She had to remember that they were just friends. \"Why? What did I do?\"</p><p>\"You know very well what you did. Why didn't you tell me that you and Yi-jun are good friends?\"</p><p>\"You never asked. What difference does it make? Mr.</p><p>Niigata asked you to get the interview.\"</p><p>\"But you could have done it.\"</p><p>\"I am not a journalist. If I was any good at writing I wouldn't need you as a publicist.\"</p><p>\"Ooh, I don't know why I put up with you.\"</p><p>\"Because I'm so incredibly sexy.\"</p><p>That was so true. He was one of the sexiest men she'd ever met, but also a hell of a lot of trouble. If she didn't have a good head on her shoulders, she wouldn't have hesitated to be in his bed. But she'd made it a point never to date anyone she worked with.</p><p>\"Have fun,\" he told her. \"And try not to get Yi-jun killed.\"</p><p>\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Satoshi didn't answer. He just disconnected the call. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You can open your eyes now,\" Ichiro Yoshida told his wife Shaundra as the plane came to a safe landing in Korea.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes opened slowly.</p><p>Ichiro studied her to make sure she was okay. He didn't like the fact that she had to be drugged the entire flight, and he worried she might become addicted if he insisted that she accompany him on his China tour. Maybe he should take Masaaki's advice and have her hypnotized. But that was like kicking the wheelchair from under her and handing her a set of crutches. What she needed was a strong dose of reality...people died every day, and when her number was up, it was up.</p><p>\"Where are we?\" she asked, removing her seat belt and stretching that shapely Nubian body.</p> <p>\"Korea,\" Ichiro replied, removing his seatbelt. \"Don't you remember?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Shaundra replied with a yawn. \"I remember leaving New York, but everything else is pretty much a blur.\"</p><p>The fact that they'd have to fly to their home in Osaka in another two weeks and then on to China frightened him.</p><p>What if she didn't wake up one of these times? He didn't think he could bear to live without her. \"Do you need to use the restroom?\"</p><p>\"Yes, daddy,\" she replied sheepishly as her eyes finally focused on his face.</p> <p>Ichiro rose and allowed her to pass him. He watched her walk unsteadily toward the restroom and enter. He didn't like it, but he'd find a shrink tomorrow for her. He gathered all of their things and met her once she came out. She needed some fresh air, and that's what she was going to get once they got through customs.</p><p>Their bodyguards followed them off the plane. He didn't expect any trouble like the last time she'd entered Osaka when some of Aomori's fan girls had tried to grab her, but it was best to be prepared and on his toes.</p><p>He had done the best he could hiding his hair and donning sunglasses, but he could only do so much. He'd even offered to cut his locks, but Shaundra nearly had a fit. He smiled thinking how the sight of his hair turned her on. Images of their wedding night flashed in his conscious as they went through customs. Damn, Shaundra was lethal in the bedroom. She took his virginity so skillfully he nearly cried.</p><p>Well, he did cry as he experienced his very first orgasm. He had been blessed to find a wife with both a healthy sexual appetite and a great body. Who the hell cared if she was twenty-five years older than he was? He loved her and worshipped the ground she walked on.</p><p>The waiting area was crowded with teenaged girls and young women who had found out about his arrival. They held signs with his name and posters of him and Aomori. Others took out their cameras and brazenly took his picture. He didn't stop to acknowledge them. His main criterion was to get Shaundra out of the airport without incident. They all hurried out the door, where they found more fans waiting.</p><p>Ichiro helped Shaundra into the limousine while Kenshin, their driver, loaded their luggage. It took nearly twenty minutes for them to drive from the pickup spot to the airport exit gates.</p> <p>\"Darn fan girls,\" Ichiro muttered.</p><p>\"You're very popular wherever you go,\" Shaundra said, snuggling up against him. \"It makes me so happy that you are so loved and admired.\"</p><p>\"It wouldn't be so bad if they admired from afar, but they want to touch.\" He wasn't a complete germaphobic. He just didn't like to be touched by strangers, and he had this thing about personal space.</p><p>\"I like touching you,\" Shaundra cooed. \"Your skin is so soft.\"</p><p>\"You, I don't mind. Your touch is divine, and it makes me horny.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled huskily. \"I'd give you a little sample, but I don't want to embarrass Kenshin.\"</p><p>\"Won't embarrass me,\" Kenshin replied. \"Go right ahead and have your way with him.\"</p><p>\"Drive,\" Ichiro ordered playfully. \"This ain't no peep show.\"</p> <p>He chuckled. \"Now I know I'm back home. Big brothers are all up in my business.\"</p><p>\"You're a big boy now,\" Shaundra assured him. \"I've got the marriage license and the sore...\"</p><p>Ichiro pressed his finger against his wife's lips. No one else needed to know about their sexcapades. He smirked.</p><p>Shaundra was very creative and wasn't afraid to experiment.</p><p>They'd be sharing a house with the rest of Aomori, so they would have to play it down a bit. \"Don't you want to see what Korea looks like?\" he asked, trying to distract her.</p><p>\"No, I'd rather see what you look like in a Korean bed.\"</p><p>Kenshin laughed from the front seat.</p><p>Ichiro wondered how he could close the partition without seeming rude. \"You're still loopy. I'd better get you sobered up before I bring you around Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"Sexy Satoshi,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Yeah, he's a real sexy guy, but he's off limits to you.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat up. \"You don't have to worry about him. One pretty baby in my life is enough.\"</p><p>Don't forget about Yori, he wanted to say. Had she gotten over her feelings for him? He'd find out soon enough. Yori and Amaya were due in shortly from their honeymoon in Hawaii.</p><p>\"Wow, look at that,\" Shaundra said as Kenshin turned the limousine down a driveway.</p><p>\"If you'd been looking out the window instead of feeling me up, you would have seen miles of spectacular houses just like this.\"</p><p>\"Are we going to be staying here?\" Shaundra asked excitedly.</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Niigata rented it for two weeks while we're here.\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"It's a palace.\"</p><p>Nope, she is still loopy. He'd have to keep an eye on her for a while.</p><p>Kenshin brought the car to rest at the curb outside the house. He got out and opened the door for Shaundra. Ichiro opened his own door and went around to Shaundra's side, while Kenshin got the luggage out of the back and brought it inside.</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\" Ichiro asked Shaundra.</p><p>\"I'm fine. I think I'm coming down.\"</p><p>Ichiro stared deep into her eyes. \"Are you sure?\"</p><p>She put her arms around his waist and rubbed her body up against his. \"Don't worry about me. I'm okay.\"</p><p>Now he wasn't. The little vixen had aroused him just that fast. Lucky for him his jacket was long enough to hide the evidence. Ichiro took his bride's hand and walked toward the steps. The door opened before they made it to the top.</p><p>Takumijo stood, looking quite menacing and sporting some powerful new muscles.</p><p>Shaundra noticed them too. \"Damn, Takumijo, you look good.\"</p><p>Takumijo cracked a smile and flexed for her. \"Been working out at the gym.\"</p><p>\"It's working.\"</p><p>He turned to Ichiro. \"What's wrong with her? Do I have to show you how to please your lady?\"</p><p>\"She's still flying from the anti-anxiety medicine.\"</p><p>\"Shoot, I thought she'd come to her senses and wanted a real man.\"</p><p>\"I am a real man,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>Takumijo walked down the stairs and swiped the hat from his head. Ichiro's hair floated down to his butt.</p><p>Ichiro removed his glasses, exposing his bright blue eyes to Takumijo and Shaundra.</p><p>\"You still have the best hair in the world, pretty little blue- eyed soul. You're going to be beating Satoshi off you.\"</p><p>\"Mine,\" Shaundra said, reaching out and touching her husband's hair.</p><p>Ichiro felt his body harden. \"I think I'd better take her up to our room for a nap.\" He followed Takumijo into the house.</p><p>\"Seems to me she needs a cold shower. Your room is upstairs. The third door on the right at the end of the hall.\"</p><p>Ichiro eased his hair out of Shaundra's hands. \"Come, wife. You need a nap.\"</p><p>\"No, I don't,\" Shaundra replied, following him. \"I just need you.\"</p><p>The last thing he heard was Takumijo's deep chuckle as he took Shaundra up to their room.</p><p>\"Did Mr. Niigata have to rent a house so far out in nowhere?\" Amaya asked Yori as Kenshin parked the limousine in front of the house. \"It's like a million miles away from the nearest mall.\"</p><p>Yori rubbed his temple. The headache began the moment his bride woke up at the airport, and it had intensified with each word she spoke. \"I'm sure it wasn't easy to find a place large enough to house all of us for two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we should think about renting something closer to town. After all, we're still on our honeymoon.\"</p><p>Yori rolled his eyes as Kenshin got out and opened Amaya's door. The honeymoon had been over the moment her parents started interfering in their lives. Yori stepped out.</p><p>His new bride was impossible when it came to spending money. Why waste money when they had a perfectly good room inside the mansion? Yori walked her up the stairs after Kenshin took their luggage inside.</p><p>Takumijo appeared, and Yori gasped at the sight of him.</p><p>\"Dude, look at you. What have you been eating?\"</p><p>\"You're all muscle,\" Amaya said, admiring and latching on to him.</p><p>\"I had plenty of free time on my hands since we left Japan.</p><p>So I've been spending time at the gym.\"</p><p>\"It looks good on you,\" Amaya replied. \"Maybe you should take Yori with you. He's too thin.\"</p><p>Yori ignored her. He'd been the same size since he was sixteen years old, and the only time he lost weight was when he trained for concerts. \"Where's Satoshi?\"</p><p>\"In the recording studio,\" Takumijo answered. \"He's been holed up inside there working on some music.\"</p><p>\"Has Ichiro arrived?\"</p><p>\"Yes. He and Shaundra are upstairs napping. You should see him. He looks great.\"</p><p>\"How's Shaundra?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Jet-lagged.\"</p><p>\"She's a wuss,\" Amaya replied. \"Flying is easy.\"</p><p>Yori rubbed his temple again. \"It's not nice to talk about others that way. I'm sure you have a fear or two.\"</p><p>\"No I don't,\" Amaya bragged.</p><p>Yori turned his attention back to Takumijo. \"Where is our room?\"</p><p>\"Second door on the right at the end of the hall.\"</p><p>Yori unglued his wife from his friend's bicep and took her upstairs.</p><p>Takumijo walked down the hall and to the back of the recording studio. He opened the door and entered quietly, hoping not to disturb Satoshi. To his surprise, he found Satoshi staring out of the window. He turned when he heard him.</p><p>\"Is she still as pretty as a picture?\"</p><p>\"Lovely,\" Takumijo replied. \"And still reeling from the anti- anxiety medicine. You should have seen her. She was all over Ichiro. He took her upstairs for a nap.\"</p><p>\"That's one lucky little pretty bastard.\"</p><p>\"You should see his hair. It's nearly down past his butt, and he's put on some weight. It's looks good on him.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat back down at the piano. \"Never in a million years did I think he'd beat us to the altar.\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"It took a good woman to bring out the man in him.\"</p><p>Someone cleared his throat behind them. Both Takumijo and Satoshi looked toward the door. It was Yori.</p><p>Satoshi waved at him. \"Where's Amaya?\"</p><p>Yori entered the room. \"I left her upstairs talking to her parents on the phone. She won't miss me for at least an hour.\" He walked over to the piano. \"What are you working on?\"</p><p>\"I'm trying to compose music to the song Ichiro sent me.</p><p>It's for our next album.\" He played a couple of bars.</p><p>\"I like that,\" Yori replied. \"Let me see the words.\"</p><p>Satoshi handed each of them a copy, and they began to harmonize to the music. They sounded good as a trio, but they were missing their tenor. Ichiro appeared in the door like magic. He was dressed in a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt, and his hair was braided in a long tail down his back. Through the T-shirt Takumijo could see Ichiro's muscles. Huh - the geisha had also been training.</p><p>\"Ich,\" Satoshi said, winking at him. \"Come join us, my princess. We're missing that sweet voice.\"</p><p>Ichiro entered, and Satoshi handed him the words. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Hey, what's that under that T-shirt? Are those muscles?</p><p>And you've put on some weight.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra and her family tried to feed me to death. She's a real good cook, and so is her baby girl Tricia.\"</p><p>\"How is she?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Tricia's fine. She's away at college. She told me to tell you, hey.\"</p><p>Of course Takumijo knew that Satoshi was not asking about Tricia, even though the two of them had dated awhile when they were in New York. Casanova was asking about Shaundra. Time apparently had not healed all wounds.</p><p>Satoshi began to play again, this time with Ichiro singing the high parts that they could not reach. It felt like the old days before their debut. Takumijo liked ballads, and Ichiro had composed a beauty. It was the type of song that only being in love could inspire. He hadn't thought Shaundra Morrison was a good match for Ichiro in the beginning, but time had proven him wrong. Those two fools were deeply in love.</p><p>\"I predict that will be a million seller,\" Masaaki said as he entered the room. \"I heard you singing when I entered the house. It sounded like old times.\"</p><p>\"I was just thinking the same thing,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"Who wrote those words?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Ichiro,\" Satoshi answered. \"But I composed the music.\"</p><p>\"The two of you should work together more. We need a CD where every song is a number one. We need to rock China off its axis.\"</p><p>\"I have several more songs in my briefcase,\" Ichiro replied. \"I worked on them while Shaundra wrote her novel.\"</p><p>Masaaki clapped his hands together. \"Mr. Niigata will be so pleased.\"</p><p>\"Where is he?' Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"I left him in town. He was on a conference call to China making arrangements for your tours. You guys have sold out every stadium, arena and dome he's booked you at.\"</p><p>\"Wow,\" Takumijo replied, quite pleased.</p><p>\"Wow is not the word,\" Masaaki told him. \"You need to brush up on your Chinese.\"</p><p>\"Jian dao ni wo hen gao xing. I am glad to meet you,\"</p><p>Ichiro said, showing off. \"But I don't plan to say much while I'm there.\"</p><p>\"Ah, ah, none of that. We like to hear you,\" Masaaki warned. \"None of that silent treatment. I thought you'd gotten over your shyness.\"</p><p>\"Why would you think a thing like that?\" Ichiro asked. \"The fans still terrify me.\"</p><p>\"You didn't look that shy around Shaundra when the two of you went upstairs,\" Takumijo teased.</p><p>Ichiro blushed. \"She's not my fan. She's my wife. I can't let her see me like that.\"</p><p>\"Damn right you can't,\" Satoshi agreed.</p><p>\"People down south, as she called it, make you talk. They also like to hug and kiss. I didn't like that custom. I didn't have time to be shy, though. All they wanted to do was squeeze my cheeks and feed me pecan pie and something called gumbo.\"</p><p>\"Gumbo,\" Takumijo repeated. \"What is gumbo?\"</p><p>\"It's some kind of thick soup with shrimp and crabs.\"</p><p>\"Enough,\" Takumijo said. \"Just tell me that you learned how to make it.\"</p><p>\"Got Shaundra's mother's recipe. She told me to use it in my restaurant. I'll fix us some tomorrow after I go shopping.\"</p><p>\"What was it like around her folks?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Strange, but they're nice people.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra and Cristal should get along just fine,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Who is Cristal?\" Ichiro asked. \"You have a new girlfriend?\"</p><p>\"No, she's our new publicist,\" Satoshi answered. \"Mr.</p><p>Niigata hired her right after we returned to Osaka. Apparently the old one quit when she found out that Yori was getting married.\"</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Yori with an accusing glance.</p><p>\"What? It's not my fault.\"</p><p>\"It never is,\" Takumijo replied. \"What did you promise her if she slept with you?\"</p><p>\"Who said I slept with her?\" Yori asked in his defense.</p><p>They continued to look at him.</p><p>\"That's old water under the bridge. Tell me about Cristal.\"</p><p>\"She's a beautiful young American woman,\" Satoshi replied. \"She's staying with us here and will be coming with us to China.\"</p><p>\"Where is she?\" Yori asked. \"I'd like to meet her.\"</p><p>\"France,\" Masaaki answered.</p><p>\"What's she doing there?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata sent her there to get an interview with Yi-jun Lee.\"</p><p>\"But Yi-jun doesn't give interviews,\" Yori said matter-of- factly.</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Apparently he's agreed to give one to Cristal.\"</p><p>Yori whistled. \"I'm impressed. She must be something special.\"</p><p>\"That she is,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"Apparently Yi-jun took one look at her and fell in love.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed.</p><p>\"You had a beautiful woman in this house, and you sent her to Yi-jun?\" Ichiro asked. \"Whose bright idea was that?\"</p><p>Satoshi raised his hand. \"Mine. Cristal's a swell girl and can hold her own drinking beer, but she was sorely lacking in the socializing department. She seemed kind of bored and needed a little excitement in her life.\"</p><p>\"But to pair her up with Yi-jun. No offense, bro, but your friend is crazy,\" Yori replied.</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"Yes, well, you haven't met Cristal yet.</p><p>She's gorgeous and a lot of fun when she lets all that reddish- blonde hair down.\"</p><p>Yori looked at him oddly. \"And you sent a gorgeous reddish-blonde-haired American to Yi-jun? Are you crazy?</p><p>Why didn't you keep her for yourself? She sounds perfect for you.\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"No, she and I are just friends.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with her?\" Yori asked like he didn't believe what he'd just heard.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with her,\" Masaaki answered.</p><p>\"Except she lacks discipline. I had to ground her along with these two idiots. Mr. Niigata and I caught them sneaking back into the house after leaving here without security to go clubbing.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled but did not comment.</p><p>\"She went clubbing with you two?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo answered.</p><p>\"How did you get out? This place is like a fortress.\"</p><p>\"They hopped the back fence,\" Masaaki answered again.</p><p>\"And Ms. Gentry went right along with them. I swear you guys are a handful.\"</p><p>\"She sounds like Satoshi's kind of girl,\" Ichiro said after listening to the conversation.</p><p>\"Not really,\" Satoshi said. \"You're my kind of girl.\"</p><p>\"Bite me,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Where are your brides?\" Masaaki asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\"Shaundra is in our room sleeping,\" Ichiro replied. \"I will wake her when dinner is ready.\"</p><p>Masaaki turned to Yori.</p><p>\"Amaya's on the phone. She'll probably be joining us for dinner if I can pry it away from her ear.\"</p><p>Masaaki laughed. \"I see some things never change. So is marriage everything it's cracked up to be?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Yori answered. \"It's nothing like the manual.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breakfast and lunch in Paris were unbelievably beautiful, and very expensive, Cristal reasoned as she dressed for the fashion show. Yi-jun had taken care of everything, including what she would wear. And the man had excellent taste.</p><p>She turned, admiring the chic two-pieced black suit with a leopard collar. The hem of the skirt landed at her knees, and the jacket came down to her thighs. The pretty seamed stockings felt like silk against her legs, and the black shoes with the moderate heel were comfortable to walk in. She placed the matching black hat with the leopard band on her head and grabbed her black clutch. Yi-jun hadn't been stingy with the jewelry and lingerie either. So far her company charge card had not made it out of her wallet. She didn't feel comfortable with a man buying her clothes, but she didn't feel like having another argument with him over pampering her.</p><p>Cristal grabbed her camera bag and left her room. \"Well, what do you think?\" she asked Yi-jun, who waited for her in the lobby. He was dressed in a black suit, with all that thick black hair combed back gangster style.</p><p>\"You look beautiful,\" he replied with a smile. \"They'll be watching you more than the models on the runway.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, right,\" Cristal said sarcastically as he walked her out of the door and past the doorman.</p><p>Beatrice waited outside the limousine with the door open.</p><p>Cristal climbed inside, and Yi-jun scooted in behind her. Easy listening music filtered out of the car's speakers.</p><p>They talked civilly as Beatrice drove the car through the traffic. Yi-jun's voice was soothing, and he articulated his words perfectly.</p><p>\"Where did you learn English?\"</p> <p>\"From several good teachers in the United States.\"</p><p>Cristal raised an eyebrow. \"You grew up in the United States?\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"You sound surprised. My father was an ambassador. I spent a lot of time in Washington.\"</p><p>\"So that's how you met Satoshi?\"</p><p>He nodded. \"Yes, we were the only two Asian kids in school, so naturally we sought out each other's company. We had a problem understanding each other at first, but kids adapt. He taught me Japanese and I taught him Korean.\"</p><p>\"What was he like back then?\"</p> <p>\"A handful. He used to get me in all sorts of trouble. I was kind of a geek and he was definitely a hellion.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"He still is.\"</p><p>\"He'd die if he heard you say that. He thinks the world of you.\"</p><p>\"He got me grounded.\"</p><p>\"Masaaki?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded.</p><p>\"For what?\"</p><p>\"For sneaking off the compound. Satoshi suggested that we go out drinking and of course I didn't want to be stuck up so I agreed to go with him and Takumijo, who assured me we wouldn't get caught.\"</p> <p>\"I've been grounded a time or two by Masaaki when I came to Osaka but they I grew taller than him and he kind of left me alone.\"</p><p>\"I can't believe all of you kept in touch all these years with your busy schedules.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi's my best friend.\"</p><p>\"You two aren't anything alike.\"</p><p>\"Oh, no?\"</p><p>\"No, he's likes to go clubbing, he's into music and he thinks he's God's greatest gift to women.\"</p><p>Yi-jun laughed. \"And I'm not the same way?\"</p><p>Cristal shook her head. \"No, from what I can tell, you do visit the barber occasionally and you look damn good in a suit. I don't think I've ever seen him in a suit.\"</p><p>\"Don't tell me you've never seen him in concert.\"</p><p>\"No. I haven't had the privilege, but Mr. Niigata is allowing me to see the one in China.\"</p><p>\"Then you're in for a treat. You won't believe how different they are on stage.\"</p><p>\"You're champagne and caviar, and he's Shochu and top ramen.\"</p><p>\"He's also one of the most loyal people I know.\"</p><p>\"He's so out there, but you are very mysterious.\"</p><p>Now it was Yi-jun's turn to raise an eyebrow. \"You think I'm mysterious?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"But I'm trying to figure out why.\"</p><p>\"What you see is all there is.\"</p><p>\"Then why don't you give interviews?\"</p><p>\"Because it gets tiring after several hundred reporters asking me the same boring questions. Sometimes I don't want the world to know my every step.\"</p><p>There was a softening to his face when he said it. For a brief moment she saw a different side of him...husband material. She shook her head to clear the crazy thought from her mind. Yi-jun was taboo, a womanizer and everything she hated in a man.</p><p>Cristal looked out of the window to get that thought out of her mind.</p><p>\"This is Faubourg Saint-Honore,\" Yi-jun explained. \"It's one of Paris' high-fashion districts and home to such labels as Hermes and Christian Lacroix. Cerise has her place nearby.\"</p><p>Cristal straightened up in her seat. \"Why are you so knowledgeable on this subject?\"</p><p>\"Call it a hobby or a passing fancy. I've always loved fine clothing, and the moment I became known, designers swooped in on me for endorsements. I think it mainly had to do with the fact I'm over six feet tall.\"</p><p>\"That does have its benefits,\" Cristal replied. And you're gorgeous. Of course she would never say that aloud and foster his already enormous ego. \"So if you were average height, they wouldn't have looked at you twice?\"</p><p>\"Yes, the fashion world is fickle when it comes to such things. They equate tall and slender with perfect when most of the people in the world have average builds. Their perception is screwed, but the point is they will sell more clothes if the consumer sees a beautiful package rather than the same clothes modeled by average Joe.\"</p><p>\"So it all boils down to what the consumer considers beautiful,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"I try not to be swayed by the opinion of others. If I see something I like, I try it on. If it fits, I take it home,\" Yi-jun explained.</p><p>\"Is that the way you decide on relationships?\"</p><p>\"I thought we were discussing fashions.\"</p><p>\"I've decided to change the subject. Humor me,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"No, relationships take more work. What about you?\"</p><p>\"If I fall for a man, it has nothing to do with the fact that he's a pretty package. I like a man with substance. One who thinks more of the world than he does himself. If he just happens to be good looking and rich, then it's a win-win situation in my favor.\"</p><p>\"I'll try to remember that,\" Yi-jun said with a shy smile.</p><p>\"Save the world and win the girl.\"</p><p>Beatrice drove the car into a spot behind a long line of limos and fancy cars, and then she got out with the motor still running and opened the doors for them to exit. Yi-jun scooted out first and she followed, hoping her hips wouldn't pull up her skirt and flash Yi-jun. Beatrice closed the doors, climbed back in and drove the limousine away.</p><p>Yi-jun took her arm, put it into the crook of his and walked her up to a throng of people already assembled outside the famed Hotel de Crillon.</p><p>\"There's Yi-jun,\" a female shouted.</p><p>It felt like a million pairs of eyes darted into their direction, which made her very uncomfortable and self-conscious.</p><p>Yi-jun waved to them like a trooper while telling her to relax and enjoy it. \"They are just people.\"</p><p>That was easy for him to say. His face graced magazine covers and the silver screen around the country, and he had to be used to the reaction of the crowd by now. Someone took their picture. Drat, Mr. Niigata is going to have a fit if this made some sleazy tabloid.</p><p>\"Who is that with him?\" someone asked.</p><p>\"Probably some model. She's tall and beautiful,\" someone else answered in the crowd.</p><p>Cristal prayed not to trip.</p><p>Yi-jun hurried her up the walk and into a building before anything could happen.</p><p>The sight as she stepped inside literally blew her mind.</p><p>Rich people meandered around dressed in stunning fashions, taking pictures and allowing others to take pictures of them.</p><p>Their clothing tastes ran from the very chic to new-wave fancy. Yi-jun escorted her up to the press section, where they both took center stage. Waiting photographers began taking their pictures and asking all sorts of outlandish questions about their relationship. She was thankful that Yi-jun just smiled sweetly and kept mum.</p><p>Music came from hidden speakers, and the photographers left them alone as the show began. Cerise Augustine stepped out from behind the curtain and welcomed everyone. She gave a tiny spiel about her company and then acknowledged a few people for coming. Yi-jun was one of the chosen, and it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the two of them were or had been more than friends by the way Cerise smiled at him.</p><p>Cristal glanced over at Yi-jun and caught him smiling back at Cerise. He didn't even have the decency to try to hide it from her or the photographers who took advantage of the situation and snapped their photos. Next a bevy of long- legged male and female models strutted the catwalk. Cristal pulled out her camera and notepad and got down to business.</p><p>She moved in place with the other photographers when she got comfortable enough in what she was doing, grimacing behind the camera at some of the outfits that she knew she would never be caught dead in. Cerise apparently was trying to capture a younger audience this time with her spring line of punk fashions, because older people just couldn't pull off the look. Cristal thought Cerise had made a serious mistake by doing so but she kept her opinion to herself until the show was over and she and Yi-jun were safely out of earshot.</p><p>\"Well, what did you think?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"Not exactly her best,\" Cristal replied honestly. \"It only reaches one class of people...a young generation that doesn't have their own money to afford these fashions. And quite frankly, the grunge look is dead.\"</p><p>Yi-jun smiled at his fans as they left the building. \"Yes, I'll admit I expected more from Cerise. She must be having an off year. Hopefully Basil Degare will have something better to show tomorrow.\"</p><p>It was late in the afternoon when they climbed into the limousine, and Cristal couldn't wait to get back to her room to type up her notes and check out the pictures she'd taken. Mr.</p><p>Niigata would want to publish them anyway, no matter how unflattering they were. Beatrice drove them back to the hotel.</p><p>\"What time should I return, Mr. Lee?\" she asked as Yi-jun helped Cristal out and stepped onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\"Around eight,\" Yi-jun replied. \"We should be ready to go around then.\"</p><p>\"Ready for what?\" Cristal asked as he led her toward the hotel.</p><p>\"Dinner and dancing,\" Yi-jun answered.</p><p>\"I don't dance,\" Crystal lied to get his reaction.</p><p>\"Satoshi said you're a natural-born dancer.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi has a very big mouth for someone who's only known me for a couple of months.\"</p><p>The doorman opened the door for them, and they stepped inside the luxurious hotel. The lobby was alive with people checking in and out. Bellboys pushed carts to and from the three gold-door elevators while well-dressed patrons settled up their bills or sat in the plush upholstered chairs, talking with business clients or family members. Huge crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling gave bright light and illuminated the huge room.</p><p>\"Be ready by seven,\" Yi-jun told her as they stepped inside one of the elevators that had arrived.</p><p>\"What if I have plans?\"</p><p>\"Break them,\" he replied. \"I've made reservations.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. \"One, I don't take orders from anyone unless they pay my salary, and two, I came here to work, not to go dancing.\"</p><p>The elevator door opened. \"What's wrong with both? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" Yi-jun argued. \"Why not make the most of it?\"</p><p>Of course she knew he was right. Opportunities like this didn't come around that often, but she still didn't like to be ordered, even if it was to have fun. \"Well, just this one time.\"</p><p>\"I knew you'd agree,\" Yi-jun said as they stepped out of the elevator and walked down the hall toward their rooms on the penthouse floor. \"Benoit, in Marais, has the finest food in all of Paris.\"</p><p>It wasn't the food part she worried about but the dancing part. She loved to dance, but she had the feeling that Yi-jun wouldn't be much fun in a club atmosphere. \"Okay.\"</p><p>\"And wear a dress.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" she muttered as she entered her room.</p><p>\"Men...shit.\"</p><p>Yi-jun removed his suit and carefully put it inside one of the zippered hanging bags in his closet, and then he scanned through his clean clothes to find something for wining and dining the most difficult Cristal around Paris. He'd never met anyone who didn't love to have fun sometimes. Work was important, but a person had to have a life too.</p><p>He supposed a suit and tie would be in order for dining but not for dancing. He wondered if there would be time to come back to the room to change. He shook his head, hoping to figure it out later. He walked around in his briefs, socks, and T-shirt. Maybe he'd better call his agent to see if anything was happening back in Korea and let him know where he was.</p><p>Dong Kobayashi was probably having hysterics by now, since he'd neglected to tell anyone but a select few what he was up to. He also needed to see if he'd received the contract for his next movie or any news from a movie he wanted to do in the United States. He wasn't holding his breath on the latter, because it was hard for Asian actors to break into the Hollywood scene. That was the one goal he had set for himself...to become a star in the United States.</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"This is Yi-jun.\"</p><p>\"Where are you?\" Dong asked.</p><p>\"Paris.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Checking out the spring fashions,\" Yi-jun replied like it was a common thing to do.</p><p>\"Who is the chick?\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"Why do you always assume that a young lady is involved?\"</p><p>\"Because one always is. I can't recall a time when you didn't have some star-struck beauty on your arm or in your bed.\"</p><p>\"I've slept alone a couple of times,\" Yi-jun replied in defense of his personal life.</p><p>\"When?\" Dong asked. \"I've been your agent and friend for many years.\"</p><p>\"Last night and the night before.\"</p><p>Dong laughed. \"You know I don't believe you. Women gravitate toward you like planets to the sun.\"</p><p>\"Not this time. The one I'm with is strictly business.\"</p><p>\"See, I knew you weren't alone.\"</p><p>\"True, we flew here together, but she's here to get a story for the magazine she works for on the spring fashion week in Paris and to get me to give her an interview.\"</p><p>\"But you don't give interviews,\" Dong replied.</p><p>\"I've made an exception,\" Yi-jun confessed.</p><p>Dong whistled. \"She really must be something special. And you haven't slept with her yet?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm afraid not. Cristal is different.\"</p><p>\"Does she have a penis?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Then she's not different. I predict you'll win her over somewhere around two in the morning.\"</p><p>\"Why at such an odd hour?\"</p><p>\"Fits your mode of operations...dinner, dancing and then sex.\"</p><p>Yi-jun sighed. Was he that predictable?</p><p>\"Am I right?\"</p><p>\"Not this time,\" he lied. \"Dinner, yes; dancing, maybe; sex, non-negotiable. She's not that kind of girl.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with her? Is she married or homely?\"</p><p>\"Neither,\" Yi-jun told Dong. \"She's single, gorgeous, has big brown eyes and a killer body.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like your type.\"</p><p>\"That's where you're wrong. Cristal is intelligent, funny and...\"</p><p>\"And what?\" Dong asked.</p><p>\"Wife material.\"</p><p>Dong laughed. \"You have got to be kidding. You're Yi-jun Lee, debonair actor and playboy. Don't you dare fall in love.</p><p>What will your fans think?\"</p><p>\"That I'm human, but anyway that's not why I called. Did you get that contract from Mr. Wang?\"</p><p>\"Got it. When are you coming back?\"</p><p>\"At the end of the week, and then it's off to China to film.\"</p><p>\"You've a very busy man and one of my best clients. As long as you don't do something foolish like run off and get married, I stand to make enough money to retire with.\"</p><p>\"I'm so pleased that my happiness comes second in your life, Dong.\"</p><p>Dong laughed again. \"You're the biggest star in Asia.</p><p>You're happy.\"</p><p>No, he really wasn't, but even he was smart enough not to mention that fact to his agent. \"Well, I have to get ready for dinner.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah. Bring plenty of condoms and get that love thing out of your system tonight. It will all look different in the morning when she wakes up and doesn't look the same without her makeup as she did the night before.\" Dong hung up.</p><p>That's where Dong was wrong. Cristal looked absolutely fabulous when she woke. Yi-jun put his cell-phone on the dresser and headed toward the bathroom to shower. He didn't want to be late after bullying Cristal to accept his dinner invitation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yori nearly fell from his seat when Shaundra stepped into the dining room. What had she done to her hair? It was now auburn with reddish-brown streaks, and looked most becoming. It had grown some and now came down to her shoulders. Damn, she also looked hot in her tight blue jeans and blue T-shirt with an anime character embossed across her chest. Sometimes it was even hard for him to believe that she was actually fifty years old, because at the moment she could pass for a young woman in her twenties. She also wore sandals, and he could just make out that fresh pedicure and the ten red toenails. His body hardened and an erection sprouted. Damn, why did this only happen when she was near?</p><p>\"Good evening,\" she said in perfect Japanese.</p><p>\"Good evening,\" everyone present replied.</p><p>Satoshi jumped out of his seat and hurried over to her.</p> <p>\"You look great,\" he said tenderly, kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>\"How was your flight?\"</p><p>\"I have no clue,\" she said with a deep chuckle. \"I slept all the way here.\"</p><p>\"Wow,\" Amaya said from her seat next to him and before she could stop her. \"You are such a wuss.\" Amaya wore a red and yellow flowered skirt and a red blouse, which made her look much older than Shaundra at the moment.</p><p>\"There's no shame in my game, Amaya. Glad to see that married life hasn't changed you a bit.\"</p> <p>Yori felt his wife bristle at his side. Amaya had a flip mouth, but in a fight his money was on Shaundra.</p><p>Satoshi sat Shaundra at his right and not in the customary spot between him and Ichiro, as they'd always sat whenever they ate together. This way Yori had no choice but to look at Shaundra from across the table. He glanced over at Satoshi, who smiled at him as if reading his mind. Damn, meddlesome brat knew how much this would torture him.</p><p>Masaaki came through the door next, looked questioningly at the seating arrangement but didn't reply as he took his seat next to Takumijo, who sat there smiling like a Cheshire cat. He bet those two idiots had planned this to get back at him for something he probably did to them years ago.</p><p>Kenshin came next, helping Ichiro with the dinner carts.</p><p>Ichiro had changed into black jeans and a black T-shirt, displaying his new muscles and heavier frame. Yori had expected to see him in an apron and wearing oven mitts, but no, he looked very masculine without makeup and he was even trying to grow a tiny mustache. Yori sighed. Things were changing, and he didn't know if it was for the better.</p><p>\"Ich, is that you?\" Amaya asked once she finally stopped sulking from the Shaundra incident. \"Look at you. I swear you and Takumijo have really been hitting the gym hard.\"</p> <p>Ichiro blushed, nodded but didn't comment. He just began serving the food so he wouldn't have to talk. Yori smirked.</p><p>Well, some things hadn't changed. Ichiro was still shy, except when it came to Shaundra.</p><p>\"Why are you not at my right?\" Ichiro asked Shaundra once the food had been placed on the table and he could sit down to join them.</p><p>Shaundra shrugged.</p><p>\"I thought it would be nice to have a pretty woman next to me while I ate,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Ichiro shook his head. \"Your pretty lady is in Paris, you foolish boy.\"</p><p>\"Bite me, Ich.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"Okay, this one time, but she's my right- hand girl, and don't try to touch her during dinner.\"</p> <p>Satoshi feigned hurt. \"Now would I do something like that?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Ichiro, Yori, Masaaki, Takumijo and Kenshin answered simultaneously.</p><p>Shaundra laughed. It sounded so pleasing to Yori's ears and just egged on the rising erection between his legs. He was so glad Amaya couldn't see under the tablecloth.</p><p>\"Look how well your friends know you,\" Shaundra teased Satoshi.</p><p>Satoshi smiled sheepishly at Shaundra. \"A little too well, I'm afraid.\"</p><p>\"You're so bad,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>Satoshi agreed. \"Please stay next to me during dinner. I promise I won't bite.\"</p><p>Shaundra pretended to think about it. \"Okay, but we have to get together after dinner to talk. We have a lot to catch up on. It's been months since we've chatted.\"</p><p>\"You'll have my undivided attention,\" Satoshi promised. \"If I can steal you away from Ichiro for a couple of minutes.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"I trust you will be a gentleman. I am not so insecure in my marriage that I can't allow my wife to talk with other men.\"</p><p>\"You should watch your back,\" Takumijo said. \"He hasn't changed much.\"</p><p>\"Not you too, Takumijo,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Did I mention your name?\"</p><p>\"Well, no, but...\" Satoshi stared across the table. \"Oh!\"</p><p>Ichiro shook his head and began passing the food. \"Don't worry, wifey. I'll protect you from the vultures.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked entertained. \"You have nothing to worry about. They will be good.\" She winked at Ichiro and Ichiro blushed.</p><p>\"Man, don't tell me that you still can't take a compliment,\"</p><p>Yori replied as he broke his chopsticks apart.</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra answered from him. \"But it's cute. Makes me feel all warm inside.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Satoshi said, adding a bit of levity to the situation. \"Especially since he's grown his hair all the way down to that sexy little butt of his.\"</p><p>\"That's it,\" Ichiro replied. \"I'm going to the barber before Satoshi can have his way with me.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"I sure miss you guys. It's nice to see that some things haven't changed.\"</p><p>\"He just insulted your husband,\" Amaya replied. \"I don't see anything nice about it.\"</p><p>\"It is just a joke, Amaya,\" Shaundra replied. \"If you can get that stick out of your butt you'll see that these guys are only teasing him. My husband is gorgeous, and if straight men find him kawaii, the more power to them. I am quite satisfied with him in that area. Ich performs like a trooper beneath the sheets.\"</p><p>\"Oh, my gosh.\" Ichiro said, turning beet red. \"American women always speak what's on their mind.\"</p><p>\"It's part of my charm. We're not ashamed to express our feelings.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"Yes, I am well aware of that.\"</p><p>Yori frowned as he went back to his meal. If he could turn back time, a lot of things would change, and one thing for sure, Ichiro would not have snuck into Shaundra's heart and replaced him.</p><p>Masaaki took over the conversation. \"Mr. Niigata called earlier. He said everything is in order for China, and he told me to tell you guys that he'll meet you there at the end of these two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Where is he?' Yori asked. \"I thought he'd be staying here with us.\"</p><p>\"He's on his way to China. He persuaded his wife to join him there on a little vacation.\"</p><p>\"But I thought she was afraid to fly?\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"She was, but she's been seeing a hypnotist.\"</p><p>\"A hypnotist?\"</p><p>Masaaki nodded. \"Apparently it worked because she's on a plane headed to China.\"</p><p>Shaundra put down her bowl of rice. \"No drugs?\"</p><p>\"None,\" Masaaki replied.</p><p>\"Damn, that must be nice. She can travel with him on the tours now.\"</p><p>\"I'll find one for you tomorrow,\" Ichiro told her. \"I want you with me on tour.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>\"Even though I'm going to miss your loopiness when you're coming down from the anti-anxiety medication. When you're like that, sex between us is powerful.\"</p><p>Satoshi spat tea from his mouth as he choked on Ichiro's admission. \"Really.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but not as powerful as when she's not loopy. She's one hot mama.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"You're so silly.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"And you're never going to hear me complain.\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't,\" Yori said before he could stop it.</p><p>Takumijo and Kenshin laughed from the other end of the table. \"What did I tell you, Kenny? Things are going to get more bizarre now that they're married.\"</p><p>Kenshin nodded his head in agreement. \"But Ichiro speaks the truth. I thought I would have to pull the limousine over on the side of the highway on the way here. Mrs. Yoshida wanted him so badly. They were steaming up the windows.\"</p><p>\"Remind me to always close the partition in the limousine,\"</p><p>Ichiro told Kenshin.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled good-heartedly. \"I don't need Valiums to make a pass at Ichiro. He's one hot little J-poper.\"</p><p>Takumijo nearly fell off his seat laughing. \"You are all crazy. I never in a million years thought out little geisha boy would turn into a stud.\"</p><p>The blush on Ichiro's cheeks spoke volumes. Damn, he was so lucky, Yori thought.</p><p>\"I can't wait for you to meet Cristal,\" Takumijo continued.</p><p>\"Who is Cristal?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Our new public relations person. She'll be back next week. She's in Paris doing a story for Mr. Niigata. The two of you are going to become good friends.\"</p><p>\"Does she speak English?\"</p><p>\"Yes, she's American.\"</p><p>\"Good. No offense, but Japanese women don't seem to like me.\"</p><p>\"I wonder why?\" Amaya replied sarcastically.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled, unaffected by Amaya's cattiness. She raised an eyebrow at him, knowing he wanted to comment but wouldn't.</p><p>\"I can't wait to meet her. We'll go shopping for some things I need before we leave for China.\"</p><p>\"But you don't like to shop,\" Ichiro said innocently.</p><p>Amaya gasped. \"What in the hell is the matter with you?</p><p>Women are born to shop.\"</p><p>\"Not this woman,\" Shaundra replied. \"I have better things to do with my time.\"</p><p>\"Like what?\"</p><p>\"Like write, keep house and please my husband. When I'm ready I just whip out my black charge card and order from Victoria's Secret over the Internet. I just push a button and all the work is done.\"</p><p>\"What is Victoria's Secret?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Amaya whispered it to him and he squirmed in his seat, much to the delight of everyone in the room, including Masaaki. Yori went back to his food. The images conjured up in his head would start a world war at the table.</p><p>The women were simply undressing Yi-jun with their eyes as they entered the nightclub. Not that she could blame them. He had changed clothes in the restroom once they arrived at the club and had given his suit to Beatrice to put in the limo. He now wore a pair of skintight jeans that rode seriously low on his hips and a tight T-shirt that showed off his muscles and killer frame. If she'd known he'd look that good in club clothes, she would have accompanied him sooner. A few of the women were actually drooling as she led him to the dance floor. Once the music began, it only took her a few minutes to figure out that he knew how to dance.</p><p>Maybe she should have suspected as much, since he did hang around with Satoshi, who could be considered one of the best dancers she knew, besides Takumijo. The music changed to a slow tune, and he pulled her into his arms and slow-dragged with her. Now where had he learned that? Slow-dragging was something she learned in New Orleans when she visited her cousin on summer break as a teen. Asian guys should not know how to slow-drag, her mind told her body. If they were naked, what they were doing could actually have been considered screwing. The dance was cute for teenagers but took on a whole new meaning for adults. Thankfully the song ended, but not before she noticed how their togetherness had turned him on. There was no way he could hide it in those jeans. Hmm, very impressive, she thought has he led her back to the table. \"Where did you learn that dance?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Where did you learn that dance?\" Yi-jun asked, teasing her as they sat down. He signaled for a waiter.</p><p>\"My cousin from New Orleans taught it to me when I visited her when I was about fifteen.\"</p><p>\"Ditto,\" Yi-jun replied. \"But I picked it up when Satoshi and I went there for Mardi Gras.\"</p><p>\"You and Satoshi went down to Mardi Gras. How old were you then?\"</p><p>\"About sixteen. Satoshi talked me into it.\"</p><p>\"Why am I not surprised? How did two sixteen-year-olds get to New Orleans?\"</p><p>\"We snuck away and got into a lot of trouble. We got drunk and rowdy and got into a bar fight. The police had to call our parents.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"Figures. Did you get grounded?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"Yes, and I couldn't see him for a week. All I could do was stay at home and study.\"</p><p>\"Yet the two of you are still best friends after that.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi is great. I don't know what I would have done in Washington all that time if I hadn't met him.\"</p><p>\"He does have his moments.\"</p><p>The waiter arrived. \"What would you like?\" he asked, \"Red wine,\" Cristal answered.</p><p>\"Bring me a bottle of your best,\" Yi-jun replied to the waiter.</p><p>The waiter nodded and walked away.</p><p>\"A whole bottle?\" Cristal asked questionably.</p><p>\"We're in Paris, remember?\"</p><p>\"I do have to wake up tomorrow,\" Cristal replied sarcastically.</p><p>\"Yeah, I know you have a two drink minimum.\"</p><p>\"Just so you know it, I can count that high.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"I see why Satoshi and Takumijo like you.</p><p>The three of you could be triplets with your witticisms.\"</p><p>\"So what do you think of Aomori?\"</p><p>\"Four idiots,\" Yi-jun replied. \"And four of the best guys to have at your back if you ever get into trouble.\"</p><p>\"Have you guys been in fights before?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"Too many times to admit, but it usually involves someone making a stupid comment about how they look. I don't know how many times they have been mistaken for girls.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Well, they're not exactly very masculine looking, except for Takumijo, and that's only because of the muscles.\"</p><p>\"I think Satoshi and Takumijo are both very handsome, but I haven't met the other two yet. They are supposed to be in Korea now. What are they like?\"</p><p>The waiter returned with the wine, and Yi-jun paid him and sent him on his way while he filled their glasses. \"Let me see.</p><p>Yori is the leader. He's tall and good looking but a little too stiff in the sense of humor department. He has been mistaken for a girl many times because of his pretty face, but he does have a masculine physique.\"</p><p>\"So that just leaves Ichiro.\"</p><p>Yi-jun sighed contently. \"Ichiro you have to see to believe.</p><p>He defies explanation.\"</p><p>\"Meaning?\" Cristal asked now that Yi-jun had piqued her curiosity.</p><p>\"He has some quirks.\"</p><p>\"Quirks?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"Imagine a six-foot geisha with long, flowing black hair and blue eyes.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I've heard about those eyes. Geisha? Do you mean he looks like a transvestite and you're too embarrassed to say?\"</p><p>\"No, it's more like he has delicate features. He's too beautiful to be masculine, and he wears kimonos most of the time and hides his face behind fans.\"</p><p>\"Wait, isn't he married?\"</p><p>\"So I've heard, though it threw me for a loop since he's so shy and hardly speaks.\"</p><p>\"Then what's the attraction? Why would a woman marry a man who looks like a woman?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. Maybe she a closet lesbian and with this she can have the best of both worlds. But you'll find out when you return. Don't be too quick to judge. Ichiro is the best songwriter in the country and a master chef too.\"</p><p>\"He cooks?\" Cristal asked as she sipped her wine.</p><p>\"And keeps house. It's his contribution to the group.\"</p><p>\"Ah, the group thing. Strange custom. So he's the mother?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"He's also a martial arts expert and can kick some serious ass in a fight.\"</p><p>Cristal laughed. \"You make me want to hurry back just to meet him.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, but you're stuck with me for another couple of days. But I guess I can dress up like a geisha if that's what you like.\"</p><p>\"Don't you dare,\" Cristal replied. \"I prefer manly men.\"</p><p>\"You might change your mind once you meet the other two.\"</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Cristal said.</p><p>Yi-jun just picked up his glass and chuckled.</p><p>Paris by moonlight was something that had to be experienced and seen for oneself. Cristal sat back in the carriage seat, huddling beneath a thick blue blanket with Yi- jun as the driver described each building, nook and crevice they passed. Picture books did not do justice to the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre. The two historical buildings cast huge shadows against the starry night sky.</p><p>\"Isn't it magnificent?\" Yi-jun asked with a contented sigh.</p><p>\"It certainly is. It's almost better than seeing the cherry blossoms in the spring.\"</p><p>\"See - and you didn't think you'd have any fun.\"</p><p>Cristal lifted her Styrofoam cup of hot chocolate to her lips and sipped. \"No, I said I didn't come here to have fun. But alas, things like this just break down my work ethic.\" She sighed. \"This is so relaxing.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"It's the ninety proof rum that's mixed with your chocolate.\"</p><p>\"I just let the man add a little to help ward off the chill,\"</p><p>Cristal confessed.</p><p>He nuzzled closer to her. \"That's what I'm here for. You are welcome to share my body heat all night if you want to.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"No thank you...not that the offer isn't tempting. But I don't think you'd respect me in the morning if we shared body heat all night long.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I would,\" Yi-jun answered quickly. \"But we might not make it to Basil Degare's fashion show tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Then I won't be able to return to Korea. I bet Mr. Niigata will have someone waiting for me at the airport on the day we return to either take the article from me or give me a pink slip if I don't deliver.\"</p><p>\"Why would you want to work for someone like that?\"</p><p>\"Because he pays a damn good salary.\"</p><p>\"Money isn't everything, Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Says the man who has it all.\" Cristal shifted in her seat again.</p><p>\"I do not have it all,\" Yi-jun said in his own defense.</p><p>\"Oh, no. When was the last time you missed a meal because you couldn't afford to pay for food, or had your lights disconnected by the power company, or bought a suit off the rack?\"</p><p>\"Okay, but should I feel guilty because I make a lot of money?\"</p><p>\"No, but...\"</p><p>\"But nothing. I might have a lot of money, but it can't buy me true love.\"</p><p>She turned her head to face him. \"Is that what you truly seek?\"</p><p>\"Oh yes,\" Yi-jun replied just as he lowered his lips onto hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Foolish, foolish, foolish girl, Cristal thought as the clock in Yi-jun's bedroom struck two. Maybe she should stop everything right now and just go back to her own room. The answer came when Yi-jun removed his shirt and T-shirt and stood before with his chest exposed for her perusal. How many times was she going to let a handsome set of pecs led her astray?</p><p>He reached for her hand, helped her to her feet and spun her around so he had access to the zipper on the back of her dress. Yi-jun eased it down, and the cool air met with her bare flesh. His warm lips kissed a path along the nape of her neck, sending tiny thrills throughout her body. The top of the dress slid down her arms and rested at her wrists. Cristal eased them out of the sleeve holes, wiggled out of the rest of the dress and watched it puddle at her feet. Then she lifted her feet and stepped out of it.</p><p>Yi-jun spun her around, which made her dizzy. Maybe she should have listened to him and not added the rum to her hot chocolate.</p><p>\"Are you okay with this?\" he asked, pressing kisses against her forehead.</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Yi-jun unsnapped her strapless bra without moving behind her. Talk about expertise. This time he did move to gaze at her heaving chest. The next thing she knew he covered both of her breasts with his big manicured hands, squeezing gently before advancing down to her nipples.</p><p>\"You are simply lovely,\" he said to her as he lowered his head and eased a nipple between his lips.</p><p>Cristal's head went back, and she felt her hair release from the pins and glide down her back as he suckled at both breasts. His hot breath warmed her skin as she buried her fingers into his hair.</p><p>Needing no other encouragement, Yi-jun scooped her up into his arms, carried her over to his bed and laid her down upon it. He slid her panties down her hips and off her body and buried his face between her legs without missing a beat.</p> <p>The stars shone down through the ceiling skylight, and Cristal concentrated on finding the constellations while Yi- jun's mouth and tongue did wonderful things to her. Her back arched just as she found the brightest star in the sky. Wave after wave of an orgasm temporarily paralyzed her from the waist down. \"Ah!\" she moaned loudly, hoping that the people in the room next door were very hard sleepers.</p><p>Yi-jun raised his head and ran his tongue across his lips.</p><p>\"Tasty.\"</p><p>Cristal sat up finally and rolled her eyes at him but then lay back down, too exhausted to give a damn about his witticism. Her euphoria was distracted by the sound of a lowering zipper...his. She gulped, especially when she heard the jeans hit the floor and get kicked aside. She forced her body to a seated position just in time to see the briefs follow the same trail as the pants.</p><p>Yi-jun stood in front of her totally nude and very erect.</p><p>Cristal gulped. No rum ever again, she mused as she reached for him and he willingly joined her on the bed.</p> <p>With one suave move, he parted her thighs and entered her.</p><p>Cristal gasped and then bit her bottom lip to keep from crying out from pleasure. Yi-jun filled her totally and completely. Her nails raked his back as he moved his hips slowly, teasing her.</p><p>\"You are so warm,\" he said as he continued to move above her.</p><p>And he was so... Oh! That hit the spot. Cristal wrapped her legs around his waist to give him better access to her core.</p><p>Yi-jun rose slightly and peered down on her with those sleepy bedroom brown eyes. \"Let's make this moment a memory,\" he said to her in English. He withdrew, raised her hips and buried himself to the hilt.</p><p>Cristal's eyes widened in surprise when suddenly, without warning, she climaxed. It rippled through her body like molten lava. \"Oh my gawd,\" she said in her best valley girl voice. This man is phenomenal. \"Ooh!\" Shit, and he's only twenty-six.</p><p>Yi-jun covered her mouth with his and kissed her passionately. His tongue dipped inside and met with hers.</p><p>Cristal gently sucked on it. His breath was minty fresh, masking the alcohol he had consumed earlier. He moved in closer, slowing withdrawing and then smoothly sliding back inside of her on the juices that still flowed from her. He had her spread wide and hot, ready to accept anything he had to offer.</p> <p>\"Why have you shielded this side of you?\" Yi-jun asked as he wrapped his arms around her waist and rolled her over so that she now lay atop him.</p><p>Cristal sank down on his shaft. Her back arched and her hair tickled her spine.</p><p>Yi-jun's hands slid down to her hips, and he used them to move her body up and down in a very sexy motion.</p><p>Cristal bit her bottom lip again, probably drawing blood as he plunged so deep she feared he'd hit an ovary. Her flesh sizzled where he touched. His hands moved up toward her breasts, cupping them and kneading them tenderly with his thumbs.</p><p>Cristal continued to ride him, trying to ignore the childlike look on Yi-jun's face as he toyed with her nipples. They more he touched the bigger they grew.</p><p>Yi-jun lifted his upper body slightly and captured one of her nipples in his mouth, and he sucked hard and then moved it around between his lips.</p><p>Cristal gasped. Each tug awakened something in the pit of her uterus and just made her wetter between the legs.</p><p>Yi-jun made a strained sound beneath her, released her breast and returned his hands to her hips to slow her down.</p><p>\"I nearly popped, beautiful one, but I'm not ready to end this just yet.\" He eased her off of his wet member and positioned her on her hands and knees, tucking a pillow beneath her for support. He reentered her and nearly knocked her flat. He positioned her again, put his hands on her sides and slowly moved in and out of her, making her knees shake. \"Are you enjoying this as much as I am?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"Mm-hmm,\" Cristal replied with a nod of her head.</p><p>\"Probably more since you're doing all the work.\"</p><p>He slapped her playfully on one of her butt cheeks.</p><p>\"Ouch,\" she said with a giggle. \"It's the truth.\"</p><p>\"Your pleasure is my pleasure,\" he said in a deep, sexy voice. He slowly pulled out of her again and then sank back in. His body shook, and he gasped as he struggled to stay in control. \"Your backside is fantastic,\" he teased. \"You should see it. There's hardly any fat, and it fits securely in the palms of my hand.\" He demonstrated by cupping her cheeks. \"We should have your buns cast in plaster by an artist while we're here in France. Oh!\"</p><p>He was being silly. She liked that side of him. Cristal reared back on his length, taking him deeply inside of her and moving forward to make her shudder. She repeated the action a couple of times, and Yi-jun moaned blissfully behind her.</p><p>\"Are you still with me?\" Cristal asked, knowing that Yi-jun was struggling to keep control.</p><p>\"Barely,\" he replied. \"I won't be if I remain in this position.\" He slapped her soundly on the behind, withdrew, flipped her over on her back and then mounted her. \"I'm going back in,\" he warned.</p><p>Cristal came the moment he sank down inside of her.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" she moaned. Her teeth rattled together. \"This is so not fair.\" Little erotic spasms rolled through her stomach and worked their way down through her vagina.</p><p>\"Oh, oh, oh!\" Yi-jun shouted suddenly. He began to work his hips faster and faster as the orgasm he so desperately tried to stave off erupted. His body shook, and then he collapsed on top of her, drenching her with sweat. Yi-jun remained there for a couple of minutes until he stopped ejaculating, and then he rolled off of her.</p><p>Cristal lay flat on her back. Her heart beat rapidly in her chest as she continued to orgasm.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" he asked her.</p><p>\"I will be in a few minutes. My body is still having the time of its life.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled sexily. \"Stick with me, kid, and I'll have that gorgeous body feeling like that all the time.\"</p><p>She so wanted to believe him, but she knew neither one of them would remember any promises they had made tomorrow. \"No promises, Yi-jun. I'm the kind of girl who takes things to heart.\"</p><p>He pulled her over to him and kissed the side of his head.</p><p>\"I'm not the type of guy who makes promises I can't keep.\"</p><p>Cristal snuggled in his arms, hoping he was the type of guy who told the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaundra rolled over on her side. Ichiro slept peacefully beside her clad only in...hair. She reached over and gently ran her finger along his cheek. His skin felt like silky new baby skin and was as perfect as porcelain.</p><p>Ichiro opened one sleepy lid and then the other, revealing baby blue eyes.</p><p>Shaundra shuddered, and a pulse beat deep between her legs. He's so gorgeous, and he's all mine.</p><p>\"Good morning,\" he said to her in Korean and then rewarded her with a little grin.</p> <p>\"Good morning,\" Shaundra repeated in Korean, still not taking her gaze away from those eyes and enjoying the way her body reacted to them.</p><p>\"What are you up to?\"</p><p>He amazed her every day with his mastery of the English language while she was still flubbing her way through his.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" she lied, reaching out and fingering the hair on his forehead. \"Why do you always assume that I'm up to something?\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed peacefully. \"Because you usually are.\"</p> <p>Shaundra trailed the finger down his face, over his full pink lips and then down to his chin. \"Your skin is so soft this morning.\"</p><p>Ichiro eyed her suspiciously. \"It's the same skin I've always had.\"</p><p>The finger continued down to his chest, encircling one nipple and then the other. His chest muscles strained as her finger moved down to the sternum, the abs, and then around the navel. \"Why are you so jumpy?\" Shaundra asked him as she moved over to him and licked at one of the nipples with her tongue.</p><p>\"I'm not jumpy,\" Ichiro said. \"Just preparing myself.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. Sometimes he could be so silly.</p><p>\"Preparing yourself for what?\" She rolled on him and began licking the other nipple and then down the same path her finger had traveled until she reached his navel.</p> <p>\"Full-frontal attack,\" Ichiro moaned as Shaundra lowered her head and took him with her mouth. \"Good gracious.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled huskily but did not release his penis as it grew thick and veiny between her lips.</p><p>Ichiro's legs relaxed, allowing her more room to maneuver.</p><p>A strong hand settled on the top of her head and moved around as she sucked. Ichiro rolled his hips slowly, pushing his length deeper into her mouth. He had the most unusual scent, like a mixture of cotton candy and caramel. Shaundra gobbled him up hungrily, showing him no mercy.</p><p>Ichiro forced his fingers into her hair and tugged gently to get her to lighten up. \"You know what that does to me, Shaundra.\"</p><p>Ooh, he said my name, Shaundra mused with girlish delight. She did so love when he did it. He had the cutest little tenor voice and sexy accent. It made her just want to eat him up. Instead she added a little pressure around the head of his penis and felt him buck, raising his buttocks up from the mattress and sending it deeper down her throat.</p><p>\"Your mouth is lethal.\"</p><p>Shaundra released him long enough to let him recover, and then she went down on him again, this time concentrating on the thick veins on the side and the scrotum.</p> <p>Poor Ichiro couldn't do anything but succumb to the onslaught.</p><p>\"Don't make it go off,\" he begged.</p><p>He didn't have to worry, because she had other plans for him. Shaundra released him, crawled aboard and mounted him.</p><p>Ichiro moaned again, but this time very loudly.</p><p>\"Shush,\" Shaundra told him with a giggle. \"You're going to wake up everyone in the house.\" She moved her body up and down slowly with her thighs locked tightly around his legs so he couldn't move.</p><p>\"I can't help it,\" Ichiro tried to whisper. \"Your stuff is too good.\"</p><p>Shaundra giggled loudly. And he was so good for her ego.</p><p>Ichiro's hands cupped her waist to help steady her and to gain some control of the situation. \"I bet no other man in the world wakes up to a fully aroused and sexy wife like I do,\" he said as one hand crept up to her breast. Ichiro gently squeezed the nipple.</p><p>\"Harder,\" Shaundra ordered him. He should know by now that he couldn't break her. Shaundra smirked. There was one good thing about being married to a twenty-five-year- old...they were so willing to learn and to please.</p><p>Ichiro rolled her off of him and onto her back. \"My turn to be the man,\" he said, tossing all that long, luxurious black hair away from his face. It flipped across those masculine shoulders and down his back as he captured one of her nipples and began to suck. It was the same feeling as nursing a baby, only with added benefits.</p><p>Shaundra put her fingers into Ichiro's hair. Damn if that didn't make her wetter between the legs. Freaking Satoshi was right. Ichiro's hair did turn her on.</p><p>\"You have to be the sexiest man in the world,\" Shaundra said as he moved over her and parted her thighs.</p><p>The feel of his fingers against her flesh as he parted the lips jumpstarted her adrenalin. Her hubby always hit the mark on the first attempt and never needed her assistance. \"Oh!\"</p><p>Shaundra moaned. \"Oh shit. You are the sexiest man in the universe.\" She panted as he thrust deeper. \"And the longest.\"</p><p>The blush that rose on Ichiro's cheeks could light up all of Seoul. But what she had just told him was true. Ichiro was a magnificent lover and eager to please. He moved his slim hips, burrowing deeper. Shaundra sighed. He filled her so completely, touching her walls and making her soaking wet on the inside.</p><p>Shaundra wrapped her legs around his waist and rolled her hips in sync with his.</p><p>\"You're so wet,\" he stated as he pumped and moved in and out of her.</p><p>\"Whoa,\" Shaundra moaned. Ichiro hit the G-spot instantly.</p><p>\"Ah! I'm coming,\" she told him as the orgasm budded, peaked and then exploded. \"Oh, Ich.\"</p><p>He rode her roughly, knowing that was what it took to satisfy her. He didn't stop as she came, and she didn't want him to.</p><p>\"Flip over,\" he said forcefully. Ichiro pulled out of her and turned her over onto her stomach before she had a chance to respond. His hands cupped and kneaded her butt cheeks as she recovered. \"You have the best ass in the universe.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled at the compliment. I love him so much.</p><p>Ichiro positioned her on her knees. \"Ready or not.\" He entered her again.</p><p>Shaundra grunted loudly, followed by an even louder, \"Shit. Ich, you're freaking magnificent.\"</p><p>Ichiro grasped the back of her hair with his fingers and tugged. Her back arched and he buried in deeper, pumping his hips and encouraging yet another orgasm from her.</p><p>Shaundra smiled. It was so freaking good to be multi- orgasmic. Her entire body shuddered as the wave built up from her uterus. Her Kegel muscles tightened around his phallus.</p><p>\"Oh wifey,\" Ichiro said as he realized that he couldn't defeat her. He lifted her bottom and shoved in to the hilt. His hips bucked uncontrollably behind her, and Ichiro came right along with her, knocking them flat against the mattress. They lay there in a mess of arms, legs and sweat until the world stopped spinning on its axis.</p><p>Ichiro rolled off of her, pulled her into his arms and kissed her passionately. \"How did I get so lucky?\" he asked as he held her tightly.</p><p>\"I'm the lucky one,\" she admitted honestly. \"I thank God every day for you.\" She put her head against his chest. His heart beat rapidly.</p><p>\"Really?\" he asked like he didn't believe it.</p><p>\"Mm-hmm,\" she mumbled against his skin. \"You didn't know that?\" She moved off of him and sat up. The look on his face said he did not. \"Don't you know how much I love you?\"</p><p>Ichiro sat up. \"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"I am so young and inexperienced. Sometimes I wonder if you think you've made a mistake by marrying me.\"</p><p>Shaundra reached out and tenderly touched his face. \"Rest assured, sweet Ichiro, that I do love you and I don't regret marrying you. I have never been happier. You make me complete.\" She leaned forward and kissed him on the lips and let her hand wander down his body.</p><p>Ichiro jumped and giggled against her lips. \"You are terrible. Give me a moment to recuperate. I may be young, but I'm not made of steel.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled. He is so freaking hot. And the bad part about it was...he didn't even know it.</p><p>Yori lay in bed flabbergasted by how thin the walls in the house were. The last thing he expected to wake him out of his slumber was the sound of Shaundra and Ichiro making love.</p><p>He peeped over at Amaya snoring at his side. She can sleep through a world war. This was one time he was glad she did.</p><p>He didn't want her to wake up and hear how happy or how sexy Ichiro and Shaundra sounded as they coupled or to discover what the sound did to him. What he had heard made him horny, angry and confused.</p><p>Yori crawled off the bed and walked into the bathroom to urinate. Even that did not put an end to his erection. Having no other choice, he turned on the water in the shower and stepped under the icy cold spray. Yori grimaced as he bathed.</p><p>Maybe he should have woken his wife to attend to his needs, but she was by no means a morning person. But he couldn't complain. Amaya wasn't a cold fish in bed, just a little inexperienced.</p><p>The cold water stung against skin and rendered his cock flaccid. Yori completed his shower and stepped out of the tub and dried off. All he had to do was just get through breakfast with Ichiro and Shaundra and the rest of the day, and then he didn't have to face them any more until tomorrow. Ichiro was taking Shaundra to see a psychiatrist to see if he could cure her of her fear of flying, and later he was taking her on a date. \"Shit,\" Yori said as he tiptoed back into the bedroom to dress. The two of them were already married. Why did they have to go out on a date? He found Amaya in the same position he had left her, flat on her back and snoring. He was fully dressed by the time she opened her eyes.</p><p>\"What time is it?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Six,\" Yori told her.</p><p>\"In the morning? What sane person gets up at six?\"</p><p>\"A responsible person,\" Yori answered.</p><p>Amaya pulled the covers up to her chin. \"Wake me at ten.\"</p><p>By ten he planned to be at the television studio with the rest of the group, giving an interview for the noon news. He walked toward the door, turned out the light and left the room. The smell of breakfast filtered all through the house as he walked down the stairs and headed toward the kitchen, which meant Ichiro was up and busy resuming his duties as housekeeper and resident chef. Yori entered the dining room area surprised to find only Satoshi and Takumijo present. He bowed when he entered and said good morning to them.</p><p>\"Good morning,\" they mumbled back.</p><p>\"Where's Amaya?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Still asleep,\" Yori answered. \"She's not a morning person.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked down at his watch. \"It's nearly seven. How did she manage to make it to her college classes on time when she was in school?\"</p><p>Yori shrugged his shoulders. She would be working for her parents when they returned to Osaka, and he bet they didn't care what time she made it to work.</p><p>\"Where are Shaundra and Masaaki?\"</p><p>\"Masaaki already left,\" Takumijo answered. \"He's going to meet us at the studio.\"</p><p>\"What about Shaundra?\"</p><p>Satoshi looked at Takumijo, and then Takumijo kind of smiled and avoided Satoshi's glance.</p><p>\"What?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"She's sleeping too,\" Satoshi answered. \"She's had a very busy morning.\"</p><p>Yori wondered what Shaundra had been doing to tire herself out. \"Oh!\" he said, suddenly remembering. \"You heard?\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Kind of hard not to.\" He tried to gain his composure but was doing a bad job of it. \"Woke me up out of a sound sleep.\"</p><p>Yori agreed. He knew exactly what Takumijo meant.</p><p>\"I found it quite stimulating,\" Satoshi said as he rose and got the teapot from a nearby cart and began filling their cups.</p><p>\"You would,\" Yori replied. Sex could be Satoshi's middle name.</p><p>Satoshi sat back down in his chair. \"I never thought I'd be envious of the little geisha, but this morning I was wishing to be in his shoes.\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"He must be pretty impressed with himself.\"</p><p>\"Apparently he has skills. I heard her pop about three times.\"</p><p>Yori palmed his face with his hand, embarrassed. Satoshi had no shame. Talking about such personal things should be taboo at the dining table.</p><p>\"Pretty impressive,\" Takumijo agreed. \"I wonder where he learned it from. We couldn't even get him to watch a porno flick before he met Shaundra.\"</p><p>That was true. Puberty came as a shock to poor Ichiro.</p><p>While the rest of them took delight in their voices changing and deepening and hair growing in manly places, Ichiro kind of seemed frightened by the entire experience and closed himself off, reading or cleaning the house in silence.</p><p>Ichiro entered the dining room dressed in a pair of brown slacks and a tan shirt, covered by an apron with the words \"Kiss the Chef\" embossed across his chest. That magnificent hair of his was braided in a long plait. \"Breakfast is ready,\" he announced as he stopped the cart near the table and began unloading what looked to be a traditional American meal.</p><p>\"What is this?\" Takumijo asked as Ichiro placed a platter of bacon and ham in front of him.</p><p>\"I thought you guys might like to try something different for a change.\"</p><p>Yori's stomach growled. He didn't normally eat meat for breakfast, but it did look tempting. There were scrambled eggs, toast, fresh fruit, and something white that resembled rice but coarser. He pointed to the bowl \"What is that?\"</p><p>\"Grits,\" Ichiro said in English. \"A southern American breakfast staple. Shaundra just loves it.\"</p><p>The mention of the woman's name sent a thrill through his body.</p><p>\"I bet she doesn't love it as much as she loves you,\"</p><p>Satoshi said as he dished some of the hot cereal onto his plate.</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" Ichiro asked, sitting down to his meal.</p><p>\"Man, the two of you woke us up with your little bedroom escapade this morning,\" Takumijo replied before Satoshi answered.</p><p>Yori shook his head. Takumijo had no sense of decency. He always said the first thing that entered his head.</p><p>Ichiro blushed slightly but didn't seem too embarrassed as he used to when they topic of sex came up. \"Oh that,\" he replied as he heaped fresh fruit on his plate. \"Wifey woke up a bit friendly this morning.\"</p><p>\"I'll say,\" Satoshi replied as he tore his piece of toast in half and smeared it with plum jam.</p><p>Ichiro said a blessing over his food and ignored Satoshi's comment.</p><p>\"Does she wake up friendly like that every morning?\"</p><p>Satoshi asked. \"Because I might have to sleep down here tonight.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled.</p><p>\"Smart guy,\" Ichiro replied. \"You're just jealous.\" He speared a piece of fruit with his chopstick and put it into his mouth and chewed.</p><p>Yori nodded. So was he, but he wouldn't dare admit it.</p><p>\"You're damn right I'm jealous. It's been a long time since a woman came screaming my name.\"</p><p>Yori spat tea from his mouth. He reached for a napkin and wiped his mouth and then the table where it landed. \"You're such an ass, Satoshi. You nearly choked me half to death.</p><p>Don't say things like that while I'm eating.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Satoshi asked, feigning innocent. \"I'm just paying him a compliment. Frankly I'm surprised that he knows what to do.\"</p><p>Oh, oh, Yori thought. The look on Ichiro's face meant that Satoshi had definitely crossed the line with his insensitivity.</p><p>\"What do you mean by that? It's not hard to figure out, and Wifey is the best teacher in the world. She knows what she likes and she's not afraid to take it.\"</p><p>The look on Satoshi's face was priceless. He bet Satoshi never thought that Ichiro could be so frank. The old Ichiro wouldn't have been. He'd be hiding from embarrassment behind his hands or one of his numerous fans.</p><p>\"Enough said,\" Satoshi replied. \"I think I just died a little inside.\" He faked a sniffle and a sigh. \"You can fill me in on the sordid details later.\"</p><p>\"In your dreams,\" Ichiro replied as he went back to eating.</p><p>\"Details are on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled from his side of the table, obviously amused by the conversation. \"Give up, Satoshi. Our maknae is now a man.\"</p><p>\"I've always been a man, you big lummox,\" Ichiro said to Takumijo. \"Just because I don't strut around like a peacock showing off my muscles does not make me a woman.\"</p><p>\"Ouch,\" Takumijo replied. \"I stepped on the wrong toes this morning.\" He stood and bowed deeply to Ichiro. \"Forgive me, Mr. Yoshida. I bow to you and your manliness.\" He straightened up. \"But in the future, control your passion in the morning. What if Amaya would have heard the two of you?\" He sat back down.</p><p>\"Then Yori would still be upstairs easing that stick out of her butt.\"</p><p>Yori nearly choked again on Ichiro's comment. \"What do you mean by that, you little geisha?\" He knew Ichiro hated to be called that, but he said it anyway just to get at him.</p><p>\"Exactly what I said. She's still the same little stuck-up girl she was when I first met her. I have enough problems with Shaundra not being able to fly without the assistance of drugs without her making such rude comments about it.\"</p><p>Yori stopped eating. So Ichiro's feelings were hurt - tough.</p><p>\"Amaya's right. Shaundra should be used to flying.\"</p><p>\"It is a fear. Everyone has them,\" Ichiro replied. \"Amaya probably has some too, but it's rude of her to say what she said.\"</p><p>Of course he knew Ich was right, but as a man he had to defend his wife even though she was wrong. \"Amaya has a right to speak whatever is on her mind.\"</p><p>Ichiro agreed. \"Yes she does, but I don't want to hear it when Shaundra retaliates.\"</p><p>What did he mean by that? The Shaundra he knew never got angry.</p><p>Shaundra entered the dining room, said good morning to everyone in Korean, kissed Ichiro on the head and then sat down next to him.</p><p>Both Satoshi and Takumijo stopped eating to reply and to stare at her.</p><p>She looked unbelievably beautiful in a nice black pantsuit and red blouse that bought out the rosiness of her cheeks.</p><p>Her hair was pulled up to her top of her head with curls coming down on both sides. A pair of reading glasses rode low on the bridge of her nose, making her look like a teacher.</p><p>A very hot teacher. \"Please tell me there is some hot coffee made,\" she said. \"I need a power boost. I feel so drained.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Takumijo asked. \"Didn't you sleep well?\"</p><p>Ichiro threw him a murderous look.</p><p>\"I slept quite well,\" Shaundra replied. \"I can't start my day without coffee.\"</p><p>\"I have a fresh pot brewing in the kitchen,\" Ichiro said, rising. \"I'll pour you a cup.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled at him and winked.</p><p>Lucky bastard, Yori thought.</p><p>Ichiro left quickly only to return a few minutes later with the coffee, a bagel and what appeared to be chocolate. He placed it before his wife.</p><p>Yori watched Shaundra as she ate the bagel and followed it up with a piece of chocolate. Was it some kind of female thing to eat sweets in the morning? Was she pregnant and craving dessert? He shook his head. No, she couldn't have kids anymore. Where is my mind this morning? \"Is that some type of American thing?\" he finally asked her.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Coffee and chocolate.\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No, it's a Shaundra thing. The chocolate/coffee mix has a calming effect on me. Plus I love the way it feels when it melts on my tongue.\" She demonstrated, much to the delight of every man at the table.</p><p>Yori watched, fascinated by the way her mouth moved. He concentrated on her plum-painted lips. Oh, oh, bad move.</p><p>Just the sight instantly turned him on.</p><p>Shaundra closed her eyes, obviously enjoying the flavor.</p><p>\"Please stop.\"</p><p>Yori looked across the table to find Satoshi watching Shaundra with interest. \"One cold shower this morning is enough, thank you.\" He rose and walked out of the room.</p><p>\"What's wrong with him?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>Ichiro leaned over and whispered something into her ear.</p><p>\"Oh!\" Shaundra said with a little gasp. \"I didn't think anything got to him. I'll try to keep the moaning down to a minimum.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"Satoshi is more fragile than he looks.</p><p>He'll be okay once his evil little brain stops conjuring up scenarios of you and Ichiro in bed.\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"You guys are too much. Have you been discussing this all morning? No wonder you all looked shocked when I walked in. So, we have an active sex life. It's no big deal.\"</p><p>\"It's a big deal if you're sleeping in the next room,\" Yori replied.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Shaundra replied. She turned to her husband. \"I will not be coupling with you in the morning anymore during the duration of our stay.\"</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at Yori. \"Screw them. Why should I suffer?\"</p><p>Shaundra gently stoked his face with her finger. \"Okay, but we have to be quieter. We don't want to offend.\"</p><p>\"Screw them,\" Ichiro said again. He looked down at his watch. \"We need to hurry. We have an eight o'clock appointment, and then I need to get to the television station for an interview.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked down at her watch. \"Oh, that's right.\"</p><p>She rose first and then Ichiro followed, removing his apron.</p><p>\"I'll clean all this up when we return,\" he told Yori and Takumijo. \"I'll see you guys later.\" He followed Shaundra out of the room like an obedient puppy.</p><p>\"Do you think a psychiatrist can help her?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Yori shrugged his shoulders. \"Who knows? But one thing I am sure of is that she won't ever need a sex therapist or a marriage counselor.\"</p><p>\"So true,\" Takumijo agreed. \"But I'm more worried about Satoshi. He might have you guys fooled with his acting, but not me. She's still gets to him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe she should not have sent this Cristal person to Yi- jun.\"</p><p>Takumijo rose and started stacking their dirty dishes on a cart. \"I never said Satoshi was bright when it comes to women.\"</p><p>Yori agreed. \"Maybe I should have a little heart-to-heart talk with Satoshi before Ichiro kicks his ass.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Now this is what I call fashion,\" Cristal exclaimed as she watched Basil Degare's showing with Yi-jun. Today they were wearing matching navy blue and white military-type outfits.</p><p>Hers came with a smart little navy blue pillbox hat with a white bow that made her feel like the first lady of the country...stylish and classy right down to her conservative navy blue pumps.</p><p>His had a dashing white captain's cap with a navy blue band and a little golden anchor pin in the center.</p><p>On the catwalk models paraded in sexy and form-fitting fall fashions that didn't fail to impress her. Basil had decided to make his fashions fun, contemporary and affordable, yet he also threw in a couple of outfits on the higher end that a person on her income would have to save for. One of them was a snappy little black long-sleeve dress that plunged ridiculously low in the back. It also came with matching black scarf that the model wore around her shoulders like a drape.</p> <p>Only someone with breasts that didn't sag could pull that look off, because there was no way to wear a bra in it. Cristal sighed. But it was oh, so chic. She could just see herself wearing it to some fancy event with a pair of black stilettos and carrying a tiny black clutch. Cristal chuckled to herself.</p><p>Where was she going to wear something like that in Osaka?</p><p>Yi-jun had disappeared during the intermission and had not returned, leaving her time to take good notes that would hopefully enable her to write a good article and satisfy Mr.</p><p>Niigata.</p><p>Yi-jun returned after the show had ended without a reason for his disappearance, and she wasn't about to ask. \"Did you miss me?\"</p> <p>Cristal rolled her eyes at him. \"I've been a little busy,\" she replied as she put down her tablet and followed it up by storing her cameras and equipment back in their cases.</p><p>Yi-jun rested his hand atop hers. It was the first showing of intimacy toward her since he'd left her bed earlier that morning.</p><p>Cristal quickly snatched her hand away. \"We need to get out of here. I have to type up my notes and finish my article.\"</p><p>\"How long is that going to take?\" Yi-jun asked. \"It's our last night in France.\" He sounded a bit disappointed.</p><p>\"A couple of hours, maybe,\" Cristal answered. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"I thought you might like to go out with me to see some more of France, and then maybe a candlelight dinner, and then...\"</p> <p>\"Forget it,\" Cristal replied. \"The last time we went out we ended up...\"</p><p>\"What?\" Yi-jun asked, looking at her with those intense eyes.</p><p>\"You know.\" It wasn't like her to be embarrassed about such things like sex.</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled weakly. \"You can't beat a man for trying.</p><p>Listen, about last night...\"</p><p>Cristal put her finger to his lips. \"I know. It didn't mean a thing to you. Don't worry - I won't get all emotional and clingy just because you are the best lover ever. I'm a big girl. I know it was a spur-of-the-moment thing and I was handy.\"</p><p>She rose and walked down the aisle of the empty room before he could see the shame she felt.</p><p>Yi-jun caught with her outside, touching her elbow. \"You have it all wrong.\"</p> <p>Why is he being like this?</p><p>\"Let's not argue on our last day here. Tomorrow we'll be on our way back to Korea and we won't have a lot of time to be together.\"</p><p>He would be working on another movie, and she would be preparing to go off to China with Aomori. Maybe it would be for the best to end it now before anything started...before she lost her heart to him. \"Okay, I'll try to finish this up quickly.</p><p>But just a tour of the town,\" she told him. There was no way he could be interested in her romantically with all the beautiful women he came in contact with on a daily basis.</p><p>Beatrice arrived with the limousine, and Yi-jun helped her in and then climbed in behind her. He didn't say too much, just fiddled with his laptop that he had retrieved from under the seat in the limousine as they headed back to the hotel.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Cristal asked after watching him for several minutes.</p><p>\"Making arrangements for this evening and for our return trip back home,\" he answered, closing the laptop and pushing it back under his seat. \"The plane will be ready to leave around eight in the morning.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Cristal replied. \"I'll be ready. I plan to be in bed early.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Yi-jun replied, setting back in his seat. \"I won't keep you out late.\"</p><p>Cristal sat back in her seat. She guessed he was pissed off at her now. She sighed. It was all his fault anyway for taking her out of Korea. She bet he was wishing now that he'd taken someone who was a lot more fun.</p><p>\"She is the most exasperating woman I know,\" Yi-jun said to Dong Kobayashi, his agent, once he was back in his room after seeing Cristal to hers.</p><p>\"Whom are we discussing?\" Dong asked. \"You've been through so many women I can't keep track of their names.\"</p><p>Yi-jun frowned at the phone. He didn't have time for Dong's sarcastic wit. \"Cristal Gentry.\"</p><p>\"Oh, the one you flew off to France with? How is that working out?\"</p><p>\"Things were going along smoothly until last night,\" Yi-jun stated absently as he paced the floor in his room.</p><p>\"Oh? What happened last night?\"</p><p>\"We went for a moonlight carriage ride, and then we went to dinner and then...\"</p><p>\"Let me guess? You slept with her.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Yi-jun admitted. \"I didn't plan to, and now I think I've messed everything up.\"</p><p>Dong chuckled. \"What do you mean? She's not expecting you to marry her, is she?\"</p><p>\"No, it's nothing like that,\" Yi-jun replied. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean she isn't looking at you all dreamy-eyed after getting with the rich and fabulously handsome Yi-jun Lee?\"</p><p>\"No, she acts like it was some kind of one-night affair that I orchestrated. She doesn't think I really care for her.\"</p><p>\"Do you?\" Dong asked like that was such a big surprise.</p><p>\"Of course I do. I wouldn't have gone through all of this if I didn't. Cristal is special. She's more than a fling.\"</p><p>\"Oh, there you go with all that serious mushy stuff,\" Dong replied. \"Forget about her.\" He paused. \"Anyway, you'll be too busy to get serious. Have you forgotten about your career?</p><p>The shooting on your next action flick starts in a few days.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know all about it,\" Yi-jun said, flopping down on the bed. \"It's just that I want to continue seeing her exclusively, but she's going to be pretty busy herself. Did I tell you that she's a publicist for Aomori?\"</p><p>\"The singing group?\" Dong asked.</p><p>\"Yes, Satoshi Hayashi introduced us.\"</p><p>\"Isn't he your friend from Japan? The one who dates just as many women as you do?\"</p><p>Yi-jun cracked a grin. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"If she's so special, why didn't he keep her for himself?\"</p><p>\"I have no idea,\" Yi-jun replied. \"But he is a good friend.</p><p>Maybe he is involved with someone else and thought I might like her. Friends do that for friends.\"</p><p>\"I don't remember him being that nice and generous,\"</p><p>Dong replied.</p><p>Come to think of it, neither had he. \"Anyway, that's not why I called. I'll be back in Korea the day after tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Good, I'll be around,\" Dong replied. \"What are you doing the rest of the day?\"</p><p>\"Taking Cristal to see some more of Paris, and then we have plans to retire early. Our plane is scheduled to leave very early tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"How early?\" Dong asked.</p><p>\"Eight.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"Then you'll have her in your bed by two, which gives you only a couple of hours to win her over with your love before you the plane takes off.\"</p><p>\"Not funny,\" Yi-jun told him.</p><p>\"Yes it is. But don't worry. Your ego can occasionally take a rejection. See you in two days.\" He disconnected the call.</p><p>\"No, my ego can't,\" Yi-jun said to the dead phone line. He put the phone on the nightstand and walked into the bathroom to shower and shave.</p><p>\"I just heard from Cristal,\" Satoshi told Takumijo as he entered the dance studio where Takumijo was busy practicing some new dance moves.</p><p>Takumijo sat down on the floor and began to stretch out his muscles. \"What did she say?\"</p><p>Satoshi sat down on the floor next to him. \"That she'll be returning the day after tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Is she having fun with Yi-jun?\"</p><p>\"She didn't say. I asked about him, but I couldn't get a decent answer out of her.\"</p><p>Takumijo stopped stretching. \"That only means that she's swept away by all his magnificence or she hates him.\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"With Cristal one can never be sure.\"</p><p>\"You don't suppose Yi-jun tried anything with her? You know, try to get her in his bed?\"</p><p>\"Would you be upset if he did?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I don't know. Cristal is like an annoying little sister. I would hate to think that she would succumb to Yi-jun charms and then he'd dump her. Life is going to be quite unbearable around here if this is true. It's bad enough that pretty boy and the geisha are having marital problems.\"</p><p>Satoshi scooted forward. \"What kind of marital problems?\"</p><p>How was it that Takumijo always seemed to know all the good gossip?</p><p>\"You know, Shaundra and her fear of flying thing, and Amaya with her nagging. I swear Yori looks no miserable.\"</p><p>\"Well, that's his own fault,\" Satoshi replied. \"No one told him to marry her. He knew what he was getting into.\"</p><p>\"And he's not over Shaundra yet either. I can see it in his eyes. It's just eating away at his gut.\"</p><p>Poor Yori,\" Satoshi mused. That served him right. \"That was his fault too. He should have told Shaundra how he felt about her. Instead he just backed up, and Ich stepped in and stole her.\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"But maybe he thought he was doing the right thing by stepping back, Kind of like you did with Cristal.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what you mean.\"</p><p>\"Cristal is perfect for you,\" Takumijo explained. \"But you sent her to Yi-jun, your best friend. Sometimes friends do foolish things in the best interest of their friends and sacrificing their own happiness.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose quickly. \"That's not exactly how it happened.</p><p>Cristal needs someone who is kind and fun and who can offer her a good life.\"</p><p>Takumijo looked at him oddly. \"And you think you can't give her that?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi replied. \"I'm not right for her. I have done too many bad things and hurt so many women. Yi-jun has been with a lot of women too, but he has a squeaky clean reputation. Her father will like him.\"</p><p>Takumijo rose and walked over to him. \"He would like you too. It's not like you've committed a crime. So what if you've sown more than your share of oats. What a man does in his past should stay in his past.\"</p><p>Why was Takumijo the only one who truly knew him? \"I'm not quite over Shaundra either,\" he admitted. \"But I'm trying.</p><p>I would never purposely do anything to interfere with her and Ichiro. It's just that I was so glad to see her when she arrived and a bit jealous of how happy the two of them are.\"</p><p>\"You'll find someone who will make you that happy one day,\" Takumijo assured him as he picked up a towel and wiped the sweat from his brow.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Satoshi said, not so convinced. \"What about you?\"</p><p>\"You're not my type,\" Takumijo joked.</p><p>\"No, I mean, how are things going?\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" he said. \"You don't have to worry about me.\"</p><p>\"But I do worry. I don't want you to get hurt.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" Takumijo replied. \"I've been very careful.\"</p><p>He would just have to take Takumijo's word for it. \"So how's the dance steps coming?\"</p><p>\"I think we're going to wow them for the anniversary show. We can go over them when Ichiro and Yori get down here.\"</p><p>Both couples were out doing their own things, as they had been for the last week and a half, taking in the sights of Korea when the group wasn't performing. Shaundra had been going to the psychiatrist every day for treatment but wouldn't know if it worked for another couple of days when they flew back to Osaka.</p><p>The door to the studio opened, and Ichiro walked in dressed in workout clothes and ready to dance. \"Let's get this party started,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're still missing a set of feet,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"He's changing,\" Ichiro told them. \"I ran into him a few minutes ago. He said he'll be down shortly.\"</p><p>The feud between the guys was just stupid. Shaundra was well aware of the tension in the mansion since their arrival, and hopefully they could put all this animosity toward each other aside until after the tour.</p><p>\"Doctor Wong will see you now, Mrs. Yoshida.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose and followed the receptionist down a long hallway that led to the psychiatrist's office. The young woman bowed and left her at the door. Shaundra knocked.</p><p>\"Come in,\" a kindly voice said from inside, and in English.</p><p>Shaundra sighed, gathering her courage and entering.</p><p>\"Good morning,\" she said, bowing to the grandfatherly man she found. He wore a black business suit and had a pair of glasses perched on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Doctor Wong bowed back. He pointed to a chair. \"Please be seated.\"</p><p>An English-speaking doctor was going to cost Ichiro a fortune, she mused as she sat down.</p><p>\"How can I help you today, Mrs. Yoshida?\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid to fly.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong sat down behind his desk, opened a tablet and wrote something down. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Why what?\" Shaundra asked as she nervously looked around the office. The man had a lot of important-looking credentials, which was comforting.</p><p>\"Why are you afraid to fly?\"</p><p>\"If I knew the answer to that I wouldn't be here.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong chuckled. \"True. Most people come here already self-diagnosed.\" He sighed. \"Fear of the unknown, fear of crashing, fear of height. There are numerous reasons people don't like to fly. It can be quite frightening to some, while others don't have a problem hopping on a big metal contraption and putting their lives in someone else's hands.\"</p><p>He made her feel comfortable. \"I think I'm more afraid of going down quickly and slamming into the ground.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong smirked but did not comment. He just kept jotting on the table. \"Perfectly understandable but not untreatable. Tell me, when was the last time you flew?\"</p><p>\"A couple of days ago from the United States to here.\"</p><p>\"And what happened during the flight? Did you experience any kind of discomfort or anxiety?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"I was drugged.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong raised an eyebrow. \"Drugged?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Valium, prescribed by a physician.\"</p><p>\"Drugging is an effective method, but it can also be dangerous and addicting.\"</p><p>The addiction was the reason she was there. Ich didn't have to tell her that he was worried about her. She saw it in his eyes every time she came down off the drug. \"My husband is a pop idol, and he wants me to accompany him on his tours. We're supposed to leave next week for Japan and then off to China. Personally, I don't think I'm going to make it.\"</p><p>\"Then we'd better get started. I think you are a good candidate for hypnosis.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"Do you really think you can help me?\"</p><p>Doctor Wong nodded. \"I think I can, but it all depends on you. It won't work if you fight it.\" He paused. \"Now tell me what you experienced when you flew without medication.\"</p><p>\"My heart starts to beat rapidly as soon as I find out I have to fly. And then I get the sweats and I hear my heart pounding in my ears. I get nervous to the point that my body shakes and my thoughts are confused and my speech is slurred. I feel that I'm a threat to everyone aboard the plane...like I might start screaming from fright and terrify the pilot to the point that he might lose control of the plane.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong wrote it all down. \"Let us begin,\" he replied, looking at her with a tender, fatherly expression in his eyes.</p><p>\"That is no way to live.\"</p><p>Satoshi left the television station and entered the limousine door that Kenshin held open for him. He slid into the back while Kenshin walked around and got into the driver's seat. Everything was ready for their performance tomorrow, and he hoped Cristal would get back in time to be with them. He'd spoken to Li-jun earlier, and the actor said their flight was scheduled to leave shortly.</p><p>\"We have to swing over and pick up Mrs. Yoshida from the doctor,\" Kenshin told him as they pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\"Her appointment should be over shortly.\"</p><p>\"Where is Ich?\"</p><p>\"He's scoping out some property for a new restaurant.\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked. The little geisha was turning into a true businessman. Sooner or later he would be too big for Aomori.</p><p>The opening of his restaurant in Tokyo was met with rave reviews from the food critics, and the plans for a second restaurant in Osaka were underway. \"I think I can keep her entertained on the ride back to the mansion.\"</p><p>\"Ich said he would kick your ass if you are anything less than a gentleman with his wife.\"</p><p>Another smirk. \"I wonder what he means by that.\"</p><p>Kenshin chuckled knowingly.</p><p>Satoshi feinted innocence. \"I cannot help it if women find me charming.\"</p><p>\"Just try to be nice.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat back in the seat. He could do that, but what would be the point?</p><p>Kenshin brought the limousine to a halt after a few minutes of maneuvering through traffic. Satoshi looked out of the window. They were parked outside a huge office building in central Seoul. Kenshin got out and went inside, leaving him on his own, which could prove quite disastrous because it gave him time to plot and fantasize. He opened his iPad and began strumming through his appointments and schedules.</p><p>Masaaki had set him up with a few more personal appearances, but other than that he was pretty much free to work on their upcoming album. Ich had written some kick-ass lyrics, and he couldn't wait to get back to Osaka to work on the music. Hopefully he'd have a couple of songs perfected for the China tour.</p><p>The limousine door opened a few minutes later, and a pair of long, shapely legs caught his attention as Shaundra slid into the seat across from him. He liked a woman who wore hosiery. He found it feminine and quite sexy.</p><p>\"Satoshi,\" she said with an easy smile and a bow of her head. \"What a pleasant surprise.\"</p><p>She had no idea how true the statement was. Just seeing her made his day.</p><p>Shaundra secured her seat belt, and Kenshin got into the driver's seat and drove away from the curb.</p><p>\"How did your visit go with the doctor?\"</p><p>\"Very well. Thank you for asking. These visits seem to be helping. \"</p><p>Maybe he should schedule an appointment to see if the doctor could help him with getting over his fascination with her. Right now his mind undressed her out of the dark business suit she wore. Try as he might he could not put his feelings aside, and he felt terrible because Ich was his best friend. \"That's good. We need you on the tour.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"To keep Ich happy and productive. It's amazing how he has come out of his shell since he met you.\"</p><p>\"I don't think I have anything to do with that. Ich is just a little shy. I find it adorable.\"</p><p>\"I am so jealous,\" Satoshi confessed.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. The huskiness of the sound made something deep inside him stir.</p><p>\"Don't tease.\"</p><p>He smiled at her discomfort. \"I can still kick myself for not making a move on you the first time we met.\"</p><p>\"Then I would not have had a chance to get to know my wonderful husband.\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. Maybe she thought reminding him she was married would stop him. He wasn't proud of it, but he'd crossed that boundary before. He studied her face, trying to find that little imperfection he could use to reject her from his heart. Shit. Nothing. \"Or wallow in all that hair.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded enthusiastically. \"I do a lot of wallowing and a lot of touching.\"</p><p>Satoshi tried to hide his chagrin. If she had chosen Ich over him because of his hair, he was going to be pissed. \"I know you're only saying this to make me jealous, and it's working.\"</p><p>\"You're so strange.\"</p><p>Other than Cristal, he could never have this type of conversation with another woman. For some reason he felt comfortable in Shaundra's company. \"Yes, I know. I still have a few issues to work out. Now tell me, what has that adorable daughter of yours been up to?\" He hadn't thought much of Tricia since he'd returned to Asia. She was nice, but she needed to finish her education. And he knew that long- distance relationships never worked.</p><p>\"She's fine and very busy with her schooling. I feel bad that I'm not there in the U.S. for her at this time.\"</p><p>\"Reconsidering your decision to move to Japan?\"</p><p>\"Not really. I know some things may prove difficult for me.</p><p>I'm still trying to learn the language and get my stomach adjusted to the food. I really have to watch what I eat.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked over her petite figure. \"Are you afraid to gain weight?\"</p><p>She shook her head. \"No, afraid of the salt. Lucky for me I married a chef. Ich prepares most of my meals and helps me control my salt intake.\"</p><p>That was true. She had high blood pressure. \"But he can't control it when you go out to eat.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded in agreement. \"That's when I have to be selective. I can't afford to become ill before I find a permanent doctor.\"</p><p>Such things were a mystery to him. He never had to watch what he ate. His metabolism and the vigorous training burned the weight off.</p><p>\"Now tell me about Cristal.\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked. He knew it wouldn't take her long to get to that subject. \"What do you want to know?\"</p><p>\"Where did she come from, and what happened to the other public relations person you had managing your promotions? Spill it. I'm just dying for some juicy gossip.\"</p><p>\"She came highly recommended by her father. He's an American general who happens to be a friend of Mr. Niigata's.</p><p>As for her predecessor, well, let's just say she didn't take it so well when Yori got married.\"</p><p>Shaundra arched a delicate brown eyebrow at him.</p><p>\"Meaning?\"</p><p>\"How can I put this delicately? She had delusions that Yori would marry her.\"</p><p>\"You mean she was a fan?\"</p><p>\"No, I mean he was screwing her.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at the ceiling. \"Boy did I make the right decision.\"</p><p>Satoshi leaned forward in his seat. \"Is that the true reason you chose Ich over him?\" He had always wanted to know how she made that decision. He would have bet his last dollar that Shaundra would have chosen Yori.</p><p>\"No, but I had my suspicions. No. I chose Ichiro because he's honest and his innocence swept me off my feet.\"</p><p>\"I can be honest and innocent,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Shaundra smirked at him. \"No. That's not in your character. You might be able to pull off the honest thing, but innocent, no. Both you and Yori emit sexuality out of your pores like blood.\" She paused. \"Since we're putting this all out on the table, I must confess that and say that I was tempted by your charms. Hell, a couple of times I thought about giving you the thrill of your life.\"</p><p>Satoshi bit his bottom lip, intrigued by what she'd confessed. \"What stopped you?\"</p><p>Shaundra settled back in her seat. \"I have no idea. Now it's not an option.\"</p><p>Drat, what is this? She liked me too. Satoshi sat back in his seat. Did that mean he still had a chance? Hmm, now that he knew this, what was he going to do? \"Tell me honestly. Do you regret marrying Ich?\"</p><p>Shaundra looked him directly in the eyes. \"Yes,\" she replied. \"But not for the reasons you think. I did a lot of soul searching before I accepted his proposal. Ich is so young, and he deserves someone who is going to be around when he get old. And he needs children...something I can no longer produce.\"</p><p>\"But there are other ways.\"</p><p>\"I know, but to tell you the truth I don't know if I can physically or mentally raise a baby at my age. It wasn't easy raising my brood...the sleepless nights, the arguments, not knowing if I could financially support them and keep a roof over their heads.\"</p><p>\"They seem to have turned out all right,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>Shaundra smiled weakly. \"That's because you didn't have to live with them. Don't get me wrong, I love all four of them dearly, but they can work a nerve.\"</p><p>Satoshi smiled. Shaundra was really something special, but he could tell that she still had a lot of emotional baggage about the decisions she had recently made. \"Have you ever stopped to consider that maybe Ichiro doesn't want kids? Not everyone is cut out to be a parent.\"</p><p>\"What about you? Do you want kids?\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"To tell you the truth, I never gave it much thought. You might not be aware of this, but I'm a very selfish person. When I find the woman I want to share my life with, I expect to dedicate my every waking moment to loving her and trying to make her feel like a queen. Kids would only complicate things.\"</p><p>Shaundra fanned herself with her hand. \"I don't think that's selfish. Darn. Who would have thought you were such a romantic?\"</p><p>\"I would have cherished you,\" Satoshi confessed.</p><p>Shaundra stopped fanning and gazed at him with those smoky brown eyes that created a warm feeling in his heart and a slow rise in his trousers. \"Don't,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Don't what?\" he asked, noticing the sudden curiosity in her eyes.</p><p>\"Don't tempt me.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The jet landed at the Incheon airport and Cristal removed her seat belt and casually peeped out of the window, expecting to find Masaaki standing on the airfield waiting for her to turn over her interview to him.</p><p>\"Are you glad to be back?\" Yi-jun asked her as he stepped out into the aisle.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Cristal replied. \"Not that I didn't have the time of my life in Paris.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad,\" he said, loaning a hand to assist her out of the tight area. \"I had the time of my life too.\"</p> <p>Cristal pretended not to see the lusty look in his eyes.</p><p>Maybe he meant what he said, but as far as she was concerned it was over. She walked down the aisle and then exited the plane with Yi-jun close on her heels. The next thing she knew they were back in the limousine, headed off the airstrip.</p><p>Yi-jun pulled out his laptop and began typing. \"I know Satoshi can't wait to see you. He misses you.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. Why was he bringing up Satoshi? \"Yeah, I miss him too. I'm glad we made it back in time to see their interview.\"</p><p>Yi-jun suddenly went silent and powered down his laptop.</p> <p>\"About that. I might not be able to make it. Something has come up. I have to get back to work.\"</p><p>\"Aw, can't you just put it off for one or two more days?\"</p><p>Yi-jun shook his head. \"I'm afraid not. A lot of people are depending on me. It's bad enough that I've shirked those responsibilities for a week to fly to Paris on a whim.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. It wasn't like she'd dragged him there.</p><p>Stupid, infuriating man. If he was busy he should have just said something. \"When will I see you again?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"I'll be very busy for a while. I'll call you.\"</p> <p>Their conversation ended at that very moment. \"I'll call you\" was the ultimate kiss-off. A few minutes later, Beatrice turned onto the roadway leading to the mansion rented by Mr. Niigata, and then she waited at the gates until the guards allowed her to continue down the main path that led to the door. Five minutes later she stopped the limousine and got out.</p><p>Cristal stepped out through the door, looking at the mansion and its surrounding property. She finally had her feet on solid ground, and she only wanted to go inside and escape to the privacy of her room.</p><p>Beatrice opened the trunk and started pulling out Cristal's luggage and loading it on a cart. She wheeled it up the sidewalk.</p><p>Yi-jun opened and stepped out of his door and stopped her before she followed Beatrice. \"Have fun for me tomorrow night,\" he told her. Then he kissed her on the forehead and stepped back inside the limo, leaving her alone.</p><p>\"Stupid man,\" she muttered as she walked up the sidewalk to the stairs. He could go straight to Hell for all she cared.</p><p>The door to the mansion swung open and Satoshi appeared, dressed casually in a denim jacket, jeans and an Aomori T-shirt with the band's picture blazed across his chest.</p><p>He opened his arms and Cristal flew into them. \"Welcome home, Cristal,\" he said.</p><p>Cristal hugged him tightly. \"I'm so glad to be back,\" she replied, trying to hold back the tears. \"It's been a long week.\"</p> <p>He took the luggage from Beatrice once she released him and realized that the chauffeur was staring at them. \"Thank you, Beatrice. You're looking as scrumptious as ever.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Satoshi,\" the chauffeur said, bowing. \"It's a pleasure to see you as always.\" She bowed again and then walked down the stairs.</p><p>Cristal punched him playfully on the arm. \"Don't tell me that you've done her.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Why do women assume that I'm like that?\"</p><p>They watched the limousine drive off.</p><p>\"Why didn't Yi-jun get out?\" Satoshi asked as he closed the door.</p><p>\"Because he's a moron,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"Don't tell me the two of you have had a lover's quarrel. I thought you were getting along in Paris.\"</p><p>\"We were,\" Cristal replied. \"But I think it's all over now. He had to get back to work, and he told me he would be very busy and would call me.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\" Satoshi replied. \"Not good.\"</p><p>\"Same thing I thought,\" Cristal said, heading for the staircase. \"I know a brush-off when I hear one.\"</p><p>\"Maybe the man is just busy,\" Satoshi said, following her up the stairs struggling with her luggage. \"How much shopping did you do? Did you leave anything in Paris?\"</p><p>\"Yes, mister smart guy. Yi-jun insisted that he buy me an outfit for every day we were there. I swear I don't know any man who has more fascination with clothes than that one.\"</p><p>\"Then you really don't know your boss, Harper Kehoe.</p><p>Maybe I should introduce the two of them.\"</p><p>\"Don't bother,\" Cristal replied as they finally made it to her room. \"I don't think I'll ever see Yi-jun again. It was nice but it's over. I have work to do getting you clowns to China.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of clowns, the others have arrived.\"</p><p>Cristal opened the door to her room, and Satoshi rolled the luggage cart in and put it next to her closet door. He flopped down in a chair while she sat on her bed. \"They're here?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"You'll get to meet them tonight at dinner.\"</p><p>Cristal looked over at the clock. It was three o'clock in the afternoon, and her body was suffering from a severe case of jet lag.</p><p>\"Dinner is at six. Ichiro likes everyone to be on time.\"</p><p>Six? Maybe she could get in a few hours of sleep before meeting the rest of the family. \"I need a nap,\" Cristal confessed.</p><p>\"What's stopping you?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I have a strange man in my room.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose and walked over to her. \"Does that scare you?\"</p><p>Cristal rose, aware of the heat from his body. \"No.\"</p><p>Satoshi pulled her into his arms and kissed her. \"Try to get some rest,\" he told her. \"We can discuss Yi-jun's stupidity later.\" He broke the embrace and left her standing alone in her room, breathless and out of words.</p><p>Cristal's alarm went off at five. She opened her eyes, reached over and turned the alarm off before it could disturb anyone else in the mansion. Satoshi said that dinner would be served at six, so she rolled out of bed and headed for the bathroom. The nap had reinvigorated her, and she was anxious to meet the others.</p><p>After her shower she rooted through her closet for something to wear, wanting to make a good impression. She chose a casual but cute pantsuit and pulled her hair back in a ponytail. She'd had enough of being the glamorous date of a hot movie actor for one week, and she just wanted to feel like herself. Cristal checked her cell phone for messages before heading downstairs. Damn, no messages from Yi-jun. She slipped the phone into her pocket and left the room.</p><p>Cristal heard voices coming from the dining room as she walked down the stairs. Satoshi waited for her in the hall.</p><p>\"Don't be nervous,\" he told her, taking her hand into his.</p><p>\"They're going to love you.\"</p><p>Cristal eyed him suspiciously. He was being especially nice to her for some reason. Maybe he was still feeling sorry for her because Yi-jun had given her the brush-off. Satoshi opened the door for her, and she entered. All conversation ceased. Satoshi slipped in behind her.</p><p>\"Everyone, this is Cristal Gentry, Aomori's new public relation person.\" He led her around the room still holding her hand. \"Cristal, this is Shaundra, Ichiro's wife.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose. Cristal didn't expect to meet a gorgeous African-American woman who looked closer to her age rather than fifty. And she certainly didn't expect the big welcoming hug.</p><p>\"Nice to finally meet you,\" Shaundra said. She had a cute Southern accent and an easy smile. \"Satoshi has told me so many lovely things about you, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your trip to France.\"</p><p>\"It was wonderful,\" Cristal replied. \"Well, most of the time.</p><p>I'll show you the pictures later.\"</p><p>Satoshi walked over to an Asian female in her early twenties. \"This is Yori's wife, Amaya.\"</p><p>Cristal bowed to Amaya.</p><p>Amaya didn't rise. She just nodded politely. \"Nice to meet you too, Ms. Gentry.\"</p><p>Okay, is it my imagination or is this one a snob? Cristal bowed again and then smiled. She planned to stay as far away from Amaya as possible. She'd met others like her, spoiled, pampered and rude.</p><p>Satoshi turned her. \"And this is the leader of Aomori, Yori Morika.\"</p><p>Yori stood.</p><p>Ooh, Cristal thought. Drop dead gorgeous.</p><p>\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Gentry.\"</p><p>\"The pleasure is all mine,\" Cristal replied, still transfixed by those dark eyes and sensual lips. \"I am looking forward to working with you.\" He was so poised and mannerly and nothing like Satoshi and Takumijo.</p><p>Yori sat down next to his wife, and Satoshi shoved her over by Takumijo and Kenshin. \"Play nice,\" he told her.</p><p>Kenshin just bowed and smiled, but Takumijo picked her up in a bear hug and kissed her affectionately on the cheek.</p><p>\"I'm so glad you're back. Poor Satoshi has been going crazy since you left.\"</p><p>\"I'll just bet he has,\" Cristal said once Takumijo put her back on solid ground. \"Did he tell you that he was the one who arranged my little excommunication out of Korea?\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"I tried to stop him, but he insisted you needed to have a little fun and adventure.\"</p><p>\"You are such a liar,\" Satoshi said in his own defense.</p><p>\"It would have been nice if you two guys would have let me in on my exile.\"</p><p>\"I told you that Mr. Niigata would retaliate for you leading us astray,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>Cristal rolled her eyes at him. \"You two guys are horrible.\"</p><p>\"Did you get the interview?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes, she did,\" Masaaki said, entering the dining room. \"Yi- jun faxed an advance copy earlier.\"</p><p>So that was why he asked for a copy. Fresh guy. It was nice of him, but it still didn't change anything between them.</p><p>\"You did an excellent job on the interview, Ms. McIntire, and I can't wait to see the pictures and articles from the fashion shows.\"</p><p>Cristal bowed to him. \"Thanks for the opportunity. I hope you won't be disappointed.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure I won't be,\" he said, sitting down at the table. \"I heard that you and Mr. Lee took Paris by storm. Everyone wants to know who you are and how you managed to capture the heart of Korea's most eligible bachelor.\"</p><p>Satoshi's leg stiffened against hers.</p><p>\"There's nothing between us. Yi-jun opened a couple of doors for me and introduced me to a lot of nice people. He is a very nice man.\"</p><p>Masaaki looked at her like he didn't believe her. \"Kind? Are we speaking of the same Yi-jun Lee?\"</p><p>Cristal smirked. \"Yes.\"</p><p>The door off the dining room opened, and Cristal forgot all about her conversation with Masaaki. She stared at the man who entered the room.</p><p>Satoshi nudged her knee. The man rolling the cart of food could be none other than Ichiro.</p><p>Ichiro looked up, saw her and then looked away shyly.</p><p>\"Come over here, Ich,\" Satoshi told him like a father speaking to a child.</p><p>Ichiro straightened up and gave her the full effect. Six feet of gorgeous young man. Her gaze traveled up to his hair, and she trembled. Look at that hair.</p><p>\"Ich, this is our new PR person, Cristal Gentry.\"</p><p>Ichiro bowed. \"It is very nice to meet you, Ms. Gentry,\" he said in English. \"Please sit down and share a meal with us.\"</p><p>The pit of her stomach jiggled with delight.</p><p>\"Stop gawking,\" Satoshi told her. \"Ich has that effect on everyone the first time they meet him.\"</p><p>A rosy blush stained Ichiro's cheeks, which she found endearing. She caught Shaundra's attention. \"He's gorgeous.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded her head enthusiastically. \"And mine.\"</p><p>Cristal and Shaundra laughed, ignoring the looks Amaya gave them. Cristal looked the four guys over. Boy, I'm looking forward to see them perform.</p><p>Ichiro culinary skills were superb, she noted when they finally got down to the business of eating. Everyone except Ichiro and Amaya talked candidly about the upcoming tour, and she couldn't help but notice the way Satoshi and Yori kept sneaking peeks at Shaundra. She sighed. The next couple of months were going to be anything but boring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Welcome aboard Flight 1256 heading for Tokyo.\"</p><p>Shaundra fastened her seat belt and sat back. Her very nervous husband fidgeted in a seat next to her.</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\" he asked, looking into her eyes with concern.</p><p>\"So far so good,\" Shaundra replied, hoping all the hypnosis was going to work. So far she didn't feel jittery or like she was about to hyperventilate. Moments later the plane taxied down the airfield and took off. Her ears clogged, but she breathed easily. If she made it to Tokyo without a panic attack it would be a miracle.</p> <p>Shaundra put the ear buds of her MP3 player into her ears and opened a book she'd brought along to pass away the time. Ichiro sat, composing songs in a notebook while looking over at her every now and then. Both of them turned down the drinks offered by the stewardess.</p><p>Shaundra started getting sleepy after reading a few chapters. She closed the book and her eyes and then drifted off to sleep. And she continued to sleep until Ichiro shook her awake after they landed.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes flittered open to find not only Ichiro but Satoshi and Yori hovering over her. \"You can relax, fellows,\"</p><p>she said. \"I'm fine and drug free.\" The look in all their eyes spoke volumes. They were excited that the hypnosis had worked.</p><p>Ichiro leaned over and kissed her affectionately on the cheek. \"Congratulations - we're home.\"</p> <p>Shaundra did not fail to notice the look of sadness in both Yori and Satoshi's eyes after they witnessed Ichiro's kiss.</p><p>She'd have to do something to mend the rift between the two guys. \"Let's get off this tuna can,\" she said.</p><p>Satoshi and Yori moved so that she and Ichiro could get out of their seats. Fifteen minutes later, they stood in the terminal, overwhelmed by a mob of fan girls.</p><p>\"What is this?\" Cristal asked her as they walked.</p><p>\"Your worst nightmare. Be careful and stay as close to the security personnel as possible. The fans love Aomori, but they hate us.\"</p><p>\"How come this didn't happen when we flew into Korea?\"</p> <p>Shaundra shrugged her shoulders. \"This happens all the time when I fly with them.\"</p><p>Satoshi walked up and took Cristal's hand. \"Come on. I'll get you out safely.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Say what he wanted, Satoshi cared about Cristal.</p><p>Kenshin and some of the roadies moved ahead to get their luggage, and their entourage moved forward toward the exit.</p><p>Girls screamed the member's names at the top of their lungs and took pictures with their cameras and cell phones.</p><p>\"Yori,\" one overzealous teen screamed. \"I love you.\"</p><p>Yori ignored the shout and walked holding his wife's hand.</p><p>Amaya didn't seem affected by any of this, probably because nothing worried her.</p> <p>\"I can't wait to get home,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>Shaundra agreed. Most of her stuff from the United States should have arrived by now and would be in storage until after the China tour. Hopefully by then the others would find permanent housing and move out of the farmhouse which she and Ichiro were supposed to occupy alone. From what she gathered, Satoshi and Takumijo hadn't even tried to find their bachelor's apartment, and Yori refused to move back into Amaya's parents' home and had plans to buy a home for him and Amaya after the tour.</p><p>Call it selfish on her part, but she did not want to share a house with the others any longer than she had to. The sooner the nest emptied, the sooner she and Ich could go on with their lives.</p><p>\"It's her, Yi-jun Lee's girlfriend,\" someone shouted. \"Can I have an autograph?\"</p><p>Cristal nearly jumped into Satoshi's arms.</p><p>\"Let's get them out of here,\" he told Ichiro.</p><p>Ichiro nodded, grabbed Shaundra's hand and literally pulled her through the rest of the terminal while Takumijo stopped to sign autographs and have his photo taken. Luckily for him, he didn't have a woman to protect.</p><p>Aomori and the guards got them safely out of the terminal and into the vans. Fans lined the streets with banners welcoming the pop group back to Japan.</p><p>Kenshin turned on the radio, and music filled the van. The intro to Big Time Rush's \"Boyfriend\" played and to her surprise and everyone's in the van, both she and Cristal started singing and moving to the beat.</p><p>\"What the heck are you two singing?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"That's an American song.\"</p><p>\"And we're Americans,\" Cristal answered.</p><p>\"You're in Japan. That is very disrespectful.\"</p><p>She and Cristal disrespected Amaya a little bit more as they song along with En Vogue's sultry \"Never Gonna Git It.\"</p><p>\"We need to put you two on the stage,\" Masaaki said. \"We can name you Red Hot Mamas.\"</p><p>\"No thanks,\" both she and Cristal said in unison.</p><p>\"One idol in the family is enough.\"</p><p>\"Same here,\" Cristal said. \"I like being behind the camera and not in front of one.\"</p><p>\"You're both too old anyway,\" Amaya added. \"Idols debut in their teens.\"</p><p>The look on Yori's face was priceless. He truly had his hands full with that one.</p><p>\"We're not old,\" Cristal said in defense. \"I bet we can out- party you.\"</p><p>Amaya didn't seem offended. \"I know better than to embarrass myself in public. I'm a wife now.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Yeah, while you're scrubbing floors and cleaning noses and behinds, Cristal and I will be tearing up the dance floors around the world.\"</p><p>\"I hear you, girlfriend,\" Cristal said, reaching over the seat and giving her a high-five. \"Just because we live across the sea now doesn't mean we've forgotten our roots.\"</p><p>Shaundra agreed. \"I grew up dancing and singing in New Orleans. I learned to second line before I could walk.\"</p><p>\"What's a second line?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"I'll show you when we get home,\" Shaundra told him.</p><p>\"And then I'll take you back down south for Mardi Gras next year if you're not on tour.\"</p><p>\"Count me in,\" Cristal said. \"I want to go next year too.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you'll be too busy taking care of Yi-jun's babies by then,\" Amaya said to her.</p><p>Cristal stopped laughing. \"I doubt that very much, thank you. Regardless of what you think of me, I prefer a man who is more dedicated to me than to his career. Mr. Niigata sent me to France to get an interview, and I got the interview.</p><p>Nothing else.\"</p><p>Shaundra wasn't a fool. She could hear the sorrow in her voice every time she mentioned Yi-jun's name. Cristal was hurting, and Amaya knew it and knew how to push the wrong buttons.</p><p>\"Now I'm in Japan ready for my next assignment, which is getting promotion ready for Aomori's China Tour. I don't have time for birthing no babies.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled, knowing Amaya didn't know the old line from Gone with the Wind. Being married to Yori did nothing to alter Amaya's personality and the way she saw things. Cristal, unfortunately, would have to learn that the best way to get along with her was just to ignore her and to stay out of her company as much as possible.</p><p>\"We're almost home,\" Kenshin announced.</p><p>\"Good,\" Yori replied. \"This has been a very long adventure.\"</p><p>\"It's about time you got here,\" Dong told Yi-jun when he walked into his office.</p><p>\"I had some things to take care of first,\" Yi-jun said, trying to ignore his manager's hysterics.</p><p>\"Mr. Smith has been trying to get in touch with you. You got the part.\"</p><p>Yi-jun slid down into a chair. \"In the American movie?\"</p><p>Dong nodded. \"Yes. You beat out all those other guys.\"</p><p>\"How soon before the shooting starts?\" There was so much to do, plans to make, and what about his relationship with Cristal?</p><p>\"Not for another couple of months,\" Dong replied. \"You'll have plenty of time to take care of your obligations here and in China before you leave.\"</p><p>He'd promised Satoshi he'd put in an appearance at Aomori's China tour. He hadn't seen his old friend in a long time and was dying to see him perform.</p><p>Dong sat back down behind his desk, dialed a number and then handed the phone over to Yi-jun.</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Smith,\" Yi-jun said, bowing even though he knew the American director could not see him. \"I will see you in a couple of months.\"</p><p>The director hung up, and Yi-jun handed the phone back to Dong.</p><p>\"I'm just waiting for them to send your contract.\"</p><p>Yi-jun breathed a sigh of relief. \"I am so glad. I can't wait to tell Cristal the good news.\"</p><p>\"Cristal?\" Dong asked.</p><p>\"Yes, Cristal Gentry, the young woman who accompanied me to France a couple of weeks ago.\"</p><p>\"Oh, her,\" Dong said. \"She's still around?\"</p><p>Yi-jun frowned at him. \"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"They don't usually be around the morning after.\"</p><p>His agent made him sound like such a cad.</p><p>\"I told you this one is a keeper.\"</p><p>\"Uh huh,\" Dong said, not believing him. \"What's she got on you?\"</p><p>\"Nothing. I happen to like her very much.\"</p><p>\"Well, just don't go do anything foolish like proposing.\"</p><p>Yi-jun attempted some smart comeback, and then he stopped. Now was not the time to discuss his personal life.</p><p>Instead he stretched and yawned. \"I'm really looking forward to going to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Aren't you tired of traveling? You just got back home.</p><p>Rest awhile and then we're off to China.\"</p><p>He didn't know about rest. He never was the type to just hang around doing nothing. He'd thought about flying over to Japan and surprising Cristal. Of course she did seem a tad bit upset when he dropped her off at the mansion weeks ago.</p><p>She was probably nervous about getting the interview to Mr.</p><p>Niigata, but he'd taken care of that for her. \"What else is on my calendar for the rest of the week?\"</p><p>\"Nothing much,\" Dong replied, flipping through a calendar.</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Yi-jun said. Maybe Dong is right. Maybe I should rest. He'd call Cristal later and tell her the good news.</p><p>The phone rang and Dong answered it. \"Yes, he's back.</p><p>What time?\" Dong looked up at the clock on the wall. \"He'll be there.\" Dong hung up the phone.</p><p>\"What have you signed me up for this time?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"A photo shoot for Belle Magazine,\" Dong replied.</p><p>\"No interview,\" Yi-jun said, rising.</p><p>\"No interview,\" Dong assured him. \"Just that pretty face and your gorgeous body.\"</p><p>Yi-jun looked at his manager suspiciously. \"It's not a nude spread, is it?\"</p><p>Dong chuckled. \"No, this is still Korea, remember?\"</p><p>Having three women in the farmhouse was more than poor Yori could bear. Their constant prattle and bickering was enough to drive a man insane. To tell the truth, Amaya started most of the arguments, which ended with both the American women ganging up on her. There was no way in the world this could be a permanent arrangement. He had to find a new home, pronto.</p><p>\"What's going on, bro?\" Takumijo asked him as he joined him in the dance studio.</p><p>\"Just thinking about how crowded this place is now.\"</p><p>\"Very much so,\" Takumijo said, taking off his warm-up jacket and placing it on the desk. \"Before long we will be knee deep in babies and dirty diapers.\"</p><p>Yori snorted. \"I doubt that. Unless you and Satoshi find women who just want to stay home and be housewives.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed. \"Don't hold your breath on that.\" He bellied up to the exercise bar and stretched one of his long legs over the top.</p><p>Yori agreed. He didn't think either of those two would be procreating any time soon. \"I think I'll check the newspaper later to see if anything is available in the area. It doesn't have to be as large as this place, but something nice.\" He joined Takumijo on the bar and stretched out one of his legs.</p><p>\"Are you sure you want to live close to Ichiro and Shaundra?\"</p><p>Takumijo was wise beyond his years sometimes. \"Not really, but I hate the idea of driving clear across town every day just to come to rehearsal.\"</p><p>\"That's true,\" Takumijo replied. \"But won't you get tired of seeing them sucking face and acting all lovey-dovey walking down the streets or in the grocery store when you run into them?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but I won't have to see it every day. Shaundra's hardly ever around when we rehearse. She's usually writing or visiting her publisher. I probably won't see much of her at the market either, since Ichiro does all of the shopping.\" He paused. \"And I'll only have to see Ichiro during rehearsal.\"</p><p>Takumijo brought his leg down and raised the other one.</p><p>\"The two of you really need to kiss and make up. I can't believe you let a woman come between you.\"</p><p>Yori stopped stretching. \"A woman did not come between us. Ich crossed a boundary and broke a trust.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, I heard it all before. You really should get over it. He's married to her now.\" Takumijo walked away from the bar, sat down on the floor and stretched out both legs and the rest of his body.</p><p>Yori joined him on the floor. \"I hope he enjoys it for as long as it lasts.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" Takumijo asked as he came up for air after doing a sit-up.</p><p>\"He's going to leave her as soon as someone younger comes along.\"</p><p>Takumijo went back down and pulled back up again using his abs. \"You really think that will happen?\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"Yes. Shaundra's his first love, so he's all excited right now. But sooner or later he's going to notice someone with spunkier breasts and a bouncier behind.\"</p><p>Takumijo came up quicker this time. \"I hope not to be around at that time. Shaundra will be devastated.\"</p><p>Yori didn't know when Takumijo and Shaundra got to be so chummy. \"Yes, she will be.\" And he'd be waiting in the wings to pick up the broken pieces.</p><p>\"But she gave up everything back home to follow him here. That has to count for something.\"</p><p>\"You really think Ich has taken any of that into consideration?\" Yori asked. \"No, because he is selfish. Luckily Shaundra still has family in the United States to go back home to once he breaks her heart.\"</p><p>Takumijo sat up again. \"Let's just hope for Shaundra's sake this does not happen. If a younger, prettier woman comes anywhere near Ichiro, I'm going to send her packing.\"</p><p>\"Oh, no, you can't interfere,\" Yori told him. \"That would make him want her more.\"</p><p>Takumijo seemed to think about what he'd just said.</p><p>\"Maybe you're right. I shouldn't interfere.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. He knew he could count on Takumijo to be on his side. Now all he had to do was bring Satoshi over to his way of thinking.</p><p>\"What do you think about Cristal Gentry?\"</p><p>\"She seems like a nice girl,\" Yori said, turning over and doing a couple of pushups. \"Masaaki says she's a very good public relations person.\"</p><p>\"One of the best,\" Takumijo replied. \"I just wish Satoshi would ask her out on a date. I think she is perfect for him.\"</p><p>\"And that's exactly why he won't date her,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"Satoshi doesn't want a female copy of himself. He wants a challenge.\"</p><p>\"No, he wants Shaundra.\"</p><p>Yori sank down on his stomach. \"You're kidding, right? It's just a crush.\"</p><p>\"No, he's madly in love with her,\" Takumijo told him.</p><p>\"Shit,\" Yori said. He hadn't expected that. \"But she's not interested in him, right? Maybe we should try to get him and Cristal together.\" That would keep him away from Shaundra.</p><p>\"I thought you just told me not to interfere,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"I told you not to interfere in Ichiro's life. Satoshi is a different case. We should most certainly interfere.\"</p><p>\"What about Yi-jun?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"What about him?\"</p><p>\"Aren't he and Cristal dating?\"</p><p>Yori laughed. \"You know Yi-jun. He dates anything in a skirt. The man has never been in a serious relationship in his life.\"</p><p>\"I suppose you're right about that too. I'll just ask Cristal if they're dating. If she says no, then I'll go out of my way to make sure that she and Satoshi get together.\"</p><p>\"Why are you being so helpful?\" Yori asked once he was sure he had Takumijo right where he wanted him to help do the dirty work.</p><p>A few minutes later, Satoshi and Ichiro joined them to practice their dance routine for their China tour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Where are you taking me?\" Shaundra asked Ichiro as they zoomed down the highway with the wind blowing in their hair.</p><p>\"It's a secret,\" he told her.</p><p>\"Ah, come on. You can tell me. I won't tell anyone.\"</p><p>Shaundra hid those beautiful brown eyes behind a pair of white sunglasses. Her reddish-brown curls spilled onto her face, and she brushed at them every now and then.</p> <p>\"Kyoto,\" he said.</p><p>\"Kyoto,\" Shaundra repeated. \"What's so special about Kyoto?\"</p><p>\"It's a wonderful place to relax with my best girl.\"</p><p>Shaundra blushed. \"True reason?\"</p><p>\"I'm thinking about opening another restaurant. There's a plot of land available right by the seaside.\"</p> <p>\"Sounds romantic.\"</p><p>He smiled. \"I thought so too. I've always wanted to retire to a little place by the sea. You know, away from everything.\"</p><p>\"Sounds perfect. Mind if I join you in your retirement?\"</p><p>\"I couldn't retire with anybody else but you,\" Ichiro confessed. He sighed contently. If anyone had told him he would find such a truly remarkable woman, he wouldn't have believed them. He wished his parents were still alive. His mother and grandmother would have loved her. She was funny, beautiful and a good mother to her kids. \"I can just picture it now, just you and me with a little farm with a swing on the porch where we'd sit in the summer and watch the sun go down.\"</p><p>\"And then we could have a little fireplace where we can cuddle together in the winter and drink ...\"</p><p>\"Sake,\" Ichiro answered.</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" Shaundra said. \"Tom Collins.\"</p><p>\"What is a Tom Collins?\"</p><p>\"A Tom Collins is gin, lemon juice, sugar and carbonated water.\"</p><p>\"Sounds tasty,\" Ichiro said, mimicking the way she answered using short sentences.</p><p>\"And probably fattening, But we won't care about that part. We'll just grow roly-poly together.\"</p><p>\"You have to drink an awful lot of those drinks to get roly- poly as you said. But since you don't drink alcohol anyway, I don't see that happening.\"</p><p>\"Okay, hot chocolate,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>Ichiro made a face. \"I'll drink sake and you can drink hot chocolate. And on the weekend we'll go fishing or maybe have the grandchildren over.\"</p> <p>Shaundra grimaced. \"You really have this thought out, don't you? Let me see, the twins are two now and I have fourteen years before I can retire, which will make them sixteen...just that perfect age, and I won't have to change a diaper.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"Was motherhood that awful?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No, in fact it was the best time of my life watching my belly grown big with child. My breasts were humongous and my hair grew down my back with each child except Juanda. It fell out then, and now she has me pulling it out. And babies smell so good when you first take them home that you want to kiss them and sniff them all the time. Juanda was a really beautiful baby with big button brown eyes and chubby cheeks, and then she learned how to talk.\"</p><p>\"What happened next?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Then she wouldn't shut up.\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Yes, she is quite a character. What about Tricia?\" He enjoyed hearing her talk about her children. She complained and fussed about them, but he knew that she loved them.</p><p>\"She was a tiny little thing, barely five pounds, but so good natured. She hardly ever cried, and she came home sleeping through the night. The boys, on the other hand, were big bruisers, and I had a pretty rough time with them being so big and me so small.\"</p><p>\"You poor thing, and you had them all natural.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded and pinched him on the jaw. \"Look at you knowing your prenatal terminology. Yes, I had all four naturally. But all that's over now. I only wish the little bleeding would go away soon.\"</p><p>\"Little bleeding?\"</p><p>\"It's nothing.\"</p><p>Ichiro shrugged and put his gaze back on the road. She wore a skirt just for him...denim with a white long-sleeved shirt and a pair of black moderate-heeled shoes. He liked when she wore relaxing clothes instead of those power suits.</p><p>He didn't mind a mini-dress every now and then because she had great legs, but it liked it when she was natural, with her hair loose and her glasses perched on her cute nose.</p><p>Ichiro turned off the highway, veered to the right and headed for Kyoto. Then he met with the first real traffic. It was a beautiful day for the end of winter. They'd left home in coats, but Shaundra got out of hers the minute the sun came out.</p><p>\"Look at all the fishermen,\" Shaundra said, looking out of the window, \"and seaside fish markets.\" She stopped talking for a moment and just concentrated on the scenery.</p><p>Ichiro left the road, drove into an empty lot and turned the car off. He got out and walked around to her side of the car.</p><p>\"This is the spot,\" he said. \"Let me help you out.\" He took her hand.</p><p>\"You weren't kidding when you said this place was by the water.\" Shaundra sighed. \"What a view.\"</p><p>Birds flew in the air and then dived into the water, trying to catch the fish.</p><p>\"I was thinking about opening a seafood restaurant that served your mother's gumbo as a specialty to draw the customers in.\"</p><p>\"Sounds great,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>He let go of her hand and put his arm around her shoulders. The clouds were especially fluffy in the blue sky.</p><p>\"Do you think you could be happy writing here in this town?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"I can be happy anywhere you are. I don't need a big fancy office to write. I can do that just sitting on the porch. But I do insist that we have electricity and the Internet. \"</p><p>Ichiro hugged her tighter.</p><p>\"What time are you meeting with the property owner?\"</p><p>\"Next week,\" he told her.</p><p>Shaundra looked at him oddly. \"Then why are we here this week?\"</p><p>\"I just wanted you to see it and get your opinion. After all, you are my wife. What I do now effects your life too.\"</p><p>\"Will you name it after me?\"</p><p>\"Sure. How's Shaundra's Seafood?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"Uh-uh,\" she said. \"I like Mrs.</p><p>Yoshida's Seafood better.\"</p><p>\"You are so silly,\" Ichiro teased. \"Are you hungry?\"</p><p>\"A little,\" she said. \"We left pretty early.\"</p><p>\"I know the perfect place.\" They walked back to the car and got in. Ichiro drove to a little seaside cafe closer to town.</p><p>Next to it were some fancy new bungalows. He drove into the parking lot of the bungalows and parked the car. \"Wait here a minute,\" he told her. He went inside the office, filled out the form and paid for one of the bungalows. The elderly woman behind the desk handed him a key, and he got back into the car and drove to the last bungalow before stopping and turning the car off again. \"Come on,\" he told Shaundra, opening the car door.</p><p>Shaundra got out and followed him to the back of the car.</p><p>Ichiro opened the trunk and pulled out two suitcases.</p><p>\"What's this?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"It's my surprise.\"</p><p>\"I thought the trip out here and the new restaurant was the surprise.\"</p><p>\"Is there a limit on surprises?\" he asked with a little smile.</p><p>He carried the suitcases to the bungalow door, and Shaundra followed him.</p><p>\"What are you up to?\"</p><p>He opened the door, stepped inside and turned on the lights. Then he put down the suitcases and pulled his inquisitive wife inside and locked the door. \"I thought you might like to spend one night away from your new family.\"</p><p>\"Are you kidding?\" she asked with a squeal. She wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him tightly. She looked up at him, and Ichiro lowered his face and kissed her. The scent of her cologne tickled his nose, and he enjoyed the feel of her body as it mashed into his.</p><p>\"Damn vixen,\" he said, knowing full well where this type of smooching could lead. \"We have things to do and places to see.\"</p><p>Shaundra unwound her arms from around his waist.</p><p>\"Okay, but later you're mine.\"</p><p>Ichiro smirked, knowing exactly what that meant. \"Let's go get something to eat and we'll do a little sightseeing before it gets too late. We might as well get to know the area, since we might be spending a lot of time here in the future.\" He took her hand and led her back out of the bungalow. Cars and trucks started to pile into the parking lot of the little restaurant. \"This will give me time to check out the competition.\"</p><p>The restaurant's atmosphere was light, and the clientele consisted of fishermen who worked the nearby waters.</p><p>Service could have been better and quicker, and the menu consisted of a few classic selections.</p><p>Shaundra, still having to watch what she ate, settled for Sukiyaki, thinly sliced meats, vegetables, mushrooms, tofu and kayak noodles. He chose Shabu-Shabu, a meat fondue, made with thinly sliced meats, vegetables, and mushrooms, dipped in a hot soup and then into ponzu vinegar. There was no way Shaundra could eat that, even though she kept eyeing it. \"Don't even think about it,\" he told her. They had bottled water to wash the food down.</p><p>Afterwards they walked around the area, checking out the seaside before moving on to some historical sites. The evening ended with him taking her to another restaurant, this one a bit fancier, before retiring to the privacy of their bungalow.</p><p>\"This sunken tub is so nice,\" he told her. \"And big enough to accommodate me comfortably.\"</p><p>Shaundra teased his legs underwater with her toes. She was up to her cleavage in bubbles with her hair pulled high atop her head in a crown of curls. \"I love it,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Mood setting.\"</p><p>He knew she only teased. Shaundra didn't need any lagniappe to get turned on. Were all women like this? he wondered. He doubted it, trying to imagine Amaya sexing up Yori at the drop of a dime.</p><p>Shaundra lifted her toes higher.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" Ichiro replied. \"Your toes are very presumptuous.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"I'm not doing it. They have a mind of their own.\" She moved them away. \"Would you scrub my back for me, please?\" She stood up in the tub before giving him a chance to reply. Bubbles and water droplets clung to her.</p><p>Ichiro gulped. Except for a few light-colored stretch marks from childbirth, Wifey had a gorgeous body. Full breasts with dusky brown nipples, flat abs, rounded hips and a bouncy firm butt. She sat down again with her back to him. Ichiro picked up the sponge and began soaping it. She had the sexiest neck. He rubbed his way down, well aware of the closeness of their bodies. He rinsed the soap off her and then pulled her closer and kissed her neck between her shoulder blades.</p><p>Shaundra giggled.</p><p>Ichiro lifted his hands and began messaging the tension away in the neck and back area.</p><p>\"Your hands are so strong,\" she told him.</p><p>He pressed into the groove of the clavicle.</p><p>\"Oh yeah, right there.\"</p><p>His body responded to the sound of her sultry voice, and his manhood rose and touched her just above the swell of her behind.</p><p>Shaundra let out a little moan.</p><p>Ichiro massaged her right side. Her body felt tense, probably from all that sitting and writing. After they returned from the tour, he would try to get her to go for walks or running in the evening for exercise. And he'd make an appointment for her at the massage parlor, complete with facial and pedicure. He might even make one for Cristal to accompany her, since they seemed to like each other.</p><p>Nothing was too good for his baby girl.</p><p>He didn't remember when the massage stopped and the seduction started. Shaundra's game was that good. He barely remembered getting out of the tub and drying off. But the next thing he knew they were in the bedroom and he was applying kisses all over her body. He kept expecting her to take control, but this was one of those rare occasions when she allowed him to have his way with her.</p><p>Ichiro took his time sampling each and every inch, imagining the sight of a baby sucking at her breasts as his lips captured one of her nipples. His tongue later slid down the dark hairline on her abdomen and along the little stretch marks, which made Shaundra moan with pleasure. He released his hair, letting it glide against her skin. Her body arched and her legs spread. He could take a hint. He moved lower.</p><p>Shaundra tasted delicious, freshly washed and femininely scented. After a few times with her like this in the past, he knew what she wanted him to do. His tongue traveled deeper, and Shaundra squeezed and locked her knees against his ears. He smirked. He'd found the right spot. He continued working on her until he felt her butt lift from the mattress.</p><p>Shaundra exploded, drowning him with her warm flow. Finally he came up for air, licking his lips triumphantly.</p><p>Ichiro looked down on his wife as she lay awash in the afterglow with her eyes closed, her lips slightly parted and her breasts heaving. What a delightful sight. He gave her a few minutes to recuperate before flipping her onto her stomach. Ichiro ran his hand over her buttocks. They were simply beautiful, like two brown balls. He ran his finger around them before pinching each cheek tenderly. Then, when he couldn't take the pressure between his legs any longer, he put her on her knees, pried her legs apart and moved between them.</p><p>Shaundra whimpered as he entered her and he sank into her damp, tight warmth. His hands found their place on each hip and he pulled her toward him, slowly imbedding himself deeply, moving her forward until she got comfortable. She opened a little more as she moved back in. Her body shuddered, and he fought off his own mounting desire to give her pleasure.</p><p>Shaundra seemed to wake up and began moving with him, sliding her body back with great muscle control. Their rhythm increased, and before he knew it she moaned loudly and rode him without embarrassment, giving as well as receiving until they both exploded. Their bodies shook and quivered, and their love juices mingled. He pulled her into his arms after the tides and waves subsided inside them. And for the first time since their wedding night, Ichiro drifted off into a contented, restful sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Let's go out and paint the town red,\" Satoshi suggested to Cristal early one Friday morning.</p><p>Cristal looked up from her paperwork. \"You're kidding, right?\"</p><p>Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing and eavesdropped on their conversation.</p><p>\"The last time I went out with you I ended up in France.\"</p> <p>Takumijo chuckled.</p><p>Satoshi ignored his band mate. \"I promise you nothing like that will ever happen again.\"</p><p>Cristal didn't believe him. Satoshi was the devil exemplified.</p><p>\"Ah, come on. I feel like going out dancing.\" He did a little dance step to impress her.</p><p>\"I don't know.\"</p> <p>\"What if everyone else agrees to go?\"</p><p>Cristal looked around. Heads bobbed up and down in agreement. She sighed. \"Okay, but not too late. Masaaki will kill us.\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"No, he won't. We're going out in a group, and we'll take security this time.\"</p><p>\"Why are you being so nice to me?\"</p><p>Satoshi smiled. \"I'm always nice to you, Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Then why'd you send me off with Yi-jun?\" She wished he'd stop smiling at her. It made her knees weak.</p> <p>The smile left his face briefly. \"Because he needed you?\"</p><p>He walked away. \"Be ready by eight and wear a dress.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. \"Arrogant dude.\"</p><p>\"Ah, come on,\" Takumijo said, moving into the spot Satoshi had deserted. \"It's going to be fun.\"</p><p>If Satoshi was the devil, Takumijo was one of his evil henchmen...a big fallen angel.</p><p>\"Okay. You don't have to talk me into it. I said I'd go.\"</p><p>Takumijo ruffled her hair like she was a puppy, and then he rose. \"And put on some makeup.\"</p><p>\"You guys are worse than my father,\" she said as Takumijo walked away. She got up, gathered her paperwork for the upcoming China promotion she'd been working on and headed out of the room.</p> <p>Shaundra stopped her. \"It's going to be fun. These guys know how to dance.\"</p><p>\"And drink,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>\"Come on, we'll get all dressed up and show these locals how to party.\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. She did feel a bit stressed and down since she hadn't heard from Yi-jun. \"Okay. I think I can dig up a suitable outfit and shoes. We'll do it up right.\"</p><p>\"You'll do what up right?\" Masaaki asked, entering the room.</p><p>\"We're going out on the town tonight,\" Yori answered for her. \"Satoshi's idea.\"</p><p>Masaaki stopped in his tracks. \"And you didn't try to talk him out of it?\"</p><p>\"No. Apparently we're bringing security, and I can't talk Satoshi out of anything when he sets his mind on something.\"</p><p>Masaaki shook his finger in Yori's face. \"Well, I'm counting on you as the leader to see that he stays out of trouble.\"</p><p>Yori bowed. \"Yes, Masaaki.\"</p><p>Cristal smirked. Masaaki even had Yori in check.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"This is going to be fun, watch. Why don't you come with us, Masaaki?\"</p><p>Takumijo made a face.</p><p>\"I have plans,\" Masaaki announced.</p><p>\"Okay, maybe next time.\"</p><p>Masaaki nodded briskly.</p><p>Cristal smiled. Shaundra had Masaaki in check. Cristal high-fived her. \"I'll see you guys tonight. I have some more work to do on this promotion. I got to make them impress the hell of the Chinese and the Taiwanese.\"</p><p>Shaundra just shrugged, not having a clue what she was getting so worked up about. Her job was on the line if she couldn't make Aomori a household name in China before their tour. She sighed. Why did she get all the difficult jobs?</p><p>By six o'clock Cristal had pretty much decided what she was going to wear...an outfit Yi-jun had purchased for her just before they left Paris. Even though she'd asked him not to, the big lug went and did it anyway. She'd wear it and look good just to spite him for not calling her.</p><p>Everyone met downstairs in the foyer, except Ichiro, who had just returned home from an out-of-town business meeting. The expression on his face said he was tired, but he took one look at his wife's excited face and changed his mind and told her he'd meet her there later, after he had a nap.</p><p>Now that was love. Yi-jun probably would have sent her on her way, stayed home and got his beauty sleep.</p><p>Kenshin had the limousine gassed up and waiting when they exited. They piled in, and about fifteen or twenty minutes later Kenshin parked and assisted all of them out.</p><p>There was no way they all could enter inconspicuous, especially with another van load of security accompanying them.</p><p>\"Come on, let's do this,\" Satoshi said, taking her hand and leading the way in.</p><p>The rest of their group followed them in two by two and met inside. Takumijo entered alone because Takumijo liked to make an entrance. Shaundra entered with Kenshin.</p><p>The place was jumping, Cristal discovered after they managed to regroup. Satoshi led her to the dance floor, where they danced to a couple of fast tunes before returning to the table to join the others for drinks.</p><p>Takumijo took the liberty of ordering: Shochu, Tanqueray, Patrone, champagne, beer and a soda for Shaundra.</p><p>\"Let me guess, you don't drink alcohol,\" Cristal said to her.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"It makes me a bit wild.\"</p><p>Yori cleared his throat.</p><p>Shaundra ignored him. \"Plus, I don't know if all that medication I took before I was hypnotized is out of my system yet.\"</p><p>Kenshin, being the youngest, poured drinks for his elder.</p><p>Yori poured champagne for Amaya and offered some to Cristal.</p><p>\"She doesn't drink that sissy stuff,\" Takumijo said. He poured her some Patrone.</p><p>Yori lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>Cristal bowed, picked up her glass and tossed the liquid to the back of her throat, then swallowed and burped, quite unladylike.</p><p>Takumijo refilled her glass. This time she sipped it. \"See, she can hold her own. If she didn't have breasts and could sing, we'd make her a member of Aomori.\"</p><p>Shaundra and Cristal laughed at his joke. Amaya did not.</p><p>\"Should I be honored?\" Cristal asked, pushing away Satoshi's hand as he messed with her hair.</p><p>\"Yes, you should,\" Satoshi agreed. \"Takumijo doesn't offer positions of greatness to just anyone. It is an honor to be considered.\"</p><p>\"You guys are so silly,\" she said as he continued to play with her hair. \"Did you miss me while I was gone?\"</p><p>Both Satoshi and Takumijo nodded.</p><p>\"We were bored out of our minds being the only two unmarried men in the mansion,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"I'm glad they don't let you handle Aomori's books,\"</p><p>Kenshin replied, sipping on a beer he got from the bar on the way back from the men's room. \"I'm single, and so is Masaaki.\"</p><p>Takumijo filled his and Satoshi's glasses again. Yori continued to nurse his champagne and just listened to their conversation.</p><p>\"Oh, yeah,\" Satoshi replied. \"But at least the two of you are dating.\"</p><p>Yori's head moved in Satoshi's direction. \"Who are they dating? And please don't say each other.\"</p><p>Amaya cracked a smile. She'd been seated at her husband's side, staring daggers at Shaundra all evening.</p><p>Apparently she had a big old chip on her shoulders and used every opportunity she had to take a jab at Shaundra. And if everything she heard about Yori's and Shaundra's past was true, it was probably his fault. He and Ichiro still weren't speaking, and they were only in each other's company for Aomori-type stuff.</p><p>The music started to play again, and Takumijo invited Shaundra to dance.</p><p>\"Ich won't mind,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't need my husband's permission to dance with anyone,\" she replied, accepting his hand.</p><p>Cristal got all misty-eyed. She wanted to be just like Shaundra when she grew up.</p><p>Satoshi grabbed her hand and pulled her back on the floor, leaving Kenshin at the table with his beer and Yori and Amaya.</p><p>\"Why isn't your date here?\" Yori asked Kenshin.</p><p>\"She's working. I have to pick her up when she gets off.\"</p><p>\"What does she do for a living?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"She's a nurse,\" Kenshin answered proudly.</p><p>\"Please tell me that she is Japanese.\"</p><p>Kenshin nodded. \"One hundred percent.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" Amaya replied. \"At least I'll have someone to talk to this evening.\"</p><p>\"You mean another female?\"</p><p>Amaya nodded.</p><p>\"What about those two?\" He pointed to Cristal and Shaundra.</p><p>\"They do not like me,\" she said with a flip of her hair.</p><p>\"I wonder why?\" Yori asked sarcastically. He reached for his glass and glanced over at Shaundra.</p><p>\"Because I'm Japanese,\" Amaya replied.</p><p>\"If that was the case, why did Shaundra marry Ichiro?\"</p><p>Yori asked.</p><p>\"How the hell should I know?\" Amaya replied. \"I'm still trying to figure that out. He could have chosen any woman in the world. Why her?\"</p><p>If his wife was any more jealous she would turn green with envy.</p><p>\"Because he loves her,\" Kenshin replied.</p><p>\"No, because he's weird,\" Amaya insisted.</p><p>Yori chuckled. That he would have to agree with on both counts.</p><p>Amaya finished her drink and Yori refilled it. \"I need to go use the ladies' room,\" she announced.</p><p>\"Have fun,\" Yori told her as she walked away from the table.</p><p>\"Why?\" Kenshin asked Yori once they were alone.</p><p>\"She's kind of cute,\" Yori replied. \"And she does have her moments when she's not being a bitch.\"</p><p>Everyone returned to their seats when the music ended.</p><p>Shaundra sat down, sipped her Coke and fanned herself.</p><p>The disc jockey decided to play some old-school American music. The intro to Silk's \"Freak Me Baby\" blared from the speakers. Yori slid his seat back, walked around to Shaundra and took her hand.</p><p>Shaundra looked up, surprised to see him.</p><p>Yori smiled down at her.</p><p>Shaundra smiled back, blushed and then followed him to the dance floor.</p><p>\"Why do I get the feeling Masaaki is going to punish us all for a good long time?\" Takumijo asked as he watched Yori and Shaundra bumping and grinding to the slow, sexy song.</p><p>\"I'm beginning to like the decor of my room,\" Satoshi replied, taking a big swig of his drink.</p><p>Cristal looked over to the dance floor. \"Shit, I just got home and now I'm going to be grounded again.\" She turned to Satoshi. \"You promised me that there would be no trouble this time. I was thinking about going shopping tomorrow.\"</p><p>Satoshi's eyes landed on Shaundra's butt as it rocked side to side under the tight dress that fit her like a glove. He sighed. A work of art.</p><p>\"If they get any closer they'd be screwing,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>\"Damn,\" Takumijo said. \"Yori is all up in that.\"</p><p>Kenshin nodded his head. \"Yori is always causing trouble.\"</p><p>\"Code blue,\" Satoshi announced as he watched Amaya come out of the ladies' room and head over to her husband and Shaundra. \"This is going to be good.\"</p><p>It all happened in slow motion. Amaya broke in between them. She loudly called Shaundra a bad name. Then Amaya slapped Shaundra across the face. Shaundra balled up a fist and punched Amaya in the gut. Amaya went down on her knees, and then Yori grabbed Shaundra and pulled her away from Amaya. Then things sped up again. Shaundra broke away from Yori, and the two women resorted to fist-fighting and hair pulling. The disc jockey stopped spinning records, while the crowd, including the security guards, moved to give the two women room. Chairs scraped the floor, and everything was unbelievably loud.</p><p>\"Aren't you guys going to stop them?\" Cristal asked one of the guards as she sipped her Patrone.</p><p>The guard shook his head.</p><p>She turned to them.</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi and Takumijo said simultaneously.</p><p>\"Yori will do it,\" Kenshin said, continuing to watch the two women destroy the place.</p><p>\"What do you have guards for?\"</p><p>\"To protect Aomori,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>Yori pulled Shaundra off of Amaya again. Amaya tried to grab Shaundra's leg, but Shaundra kicked at her, knocking Amaya back down on her butt.</p><p>\"Let me go, Yori,\" Shaundra shouted.</p><p>Amaya got up and pulled Shaundra's hair.</p><p>\"Ouch,\" Shaundra shouted.</p><p>Takumijo reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet and handed Satoshi money.</p><p>Satoshi shoved the money into his pocket. \"Told you she didn't wear a weave.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned at him.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>She just shook her head.</p><p>Amaya slapped Shaundra across the face again. It sounded throughout the bar. This never would have happened if Yori hadn't continued to hold on to Shaundra.</p><p>\"Code Blue,\" Kenshin said, pointing toward the door.</p><p>\"Shit,\" Takumijo said. \"Ichiro.\"</p><p>Yori never saw the six-foot geisha-boy coming. The next thing Satoshi saw was Yori flying across a row of tables.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" Takumijo exclaimed. \"That is going to hurt tomorrow.\"</p><p>Ichiro grabbed his battling wife, tossed her across his shoulder and walked out of the bar, moments before the police arrived and hauled Yori and Amaya off to jail.</p><p>\"Are you going to call Masaaki to bail them out or will I?\"</p><p>Takumijo asked Satoshi as the rest of them crawled into the limousine. The security climbed back into their van too.</p><p>\"Let's just decide when we get home,\" Satoshi said. \"Yori and Amaya aren't going anywhere.\"</p><p>\"You guys are horrible,\" Cristal said, trying not to laugh.</p><p>Satoshi sat back in his seat. \"Yeah, but we're entertaining.\"</p><p>Shaundra had never seen Ichiro so angry. She flinched as each curse left his lips.</p><p>\"I am going to break Yori in two,\" Ichiro said as he paced up and down the kitchen floor while she held a frozen steak to her eye.</p><p>\"Ouch,\" Shaundra replied when she put the steak on her jaw where Amaya had continuously slapped her.</p><p>Ichiro flew over to her to see what was wrong.</p><p>\"I'm okay,\" she assured him. \"Amaya just got in a few lucky slaps.\"</p><p>\"What happened? Did they both attack you?\"</p><p>\"No.\" How could she put this without him becoming more upset? \"Yori and I were just dancing, and Amaya went berserk.\"</p><p>\"You were dancing with Yori?\"</p><p>Shaundra flinched and then nodded. \"And the next thing I knew she slapped the heck out of me.\"</p><p>Ichiro stood away from her, looking at her with those cool blue eyes. \"What type of dancing were you doing?\"</p><p>\"Slow dragging to 'Freak Me Baby.'\"</p><p>His fists clenched and then he relaxed them. \"The baby- making song?\"</p><p>Shaundra's head bobbed up and down quickly. \"You know I like Silk.\"</p><p>\"But that's our song.\"</p><p>\"What was I supposed to do when he asked me to dance?\"</p><p>\"Tell his ass no,\" he shouted. \"You know he's still not over you.\"</p><p>Of course she knew it, but she wasn't about to speak the words.</p><p>Ichiro walked over and touched her eye.</p><p>\"Ouch.\"</p><p>\"You bruise so easily.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Remember that just in case you ever get angry with me.\"</p><p>\"I'm angry at you now,\" he told her, stroking her face gently. \"But I would never strike a woman, especially not you.</p><p>But do me a favor: never dance with Yori again.\"</p><p>\"I promise,\" she said, finally getting a look at how good her husband looked in his denim and leather outfit.</p><p>\"Why are you looking at me that way?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>Shaundra ran her tongue over her bottom lip.</p><p>Ichiro blushed. He touched her cheek again.</p><p>\"Ouch.\"</p><p>\"See, you are in no shape for the mattress mambo.\"</p><p>\"Just try not to touch my face. I'm good.\" The more he blushed the more she wanted him.</p><p>\"Come on,\" he said, leading her out of the kitchen. \"This is no place for romance. People eat their meals on this table.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm, kitchen table sex,\"</p><p>\"I'm just kidding, Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"I'm not,\" Shaundra replied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cristal's phone rang. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Yi-jun?\"</p><p>\"Yes.

What's up?\"</p><p>\"Why don't you sound like you're happy I called?\"</p><p>\"I'm just surprised since I haven't heard from you since you dropped me off in Korea a couple of weeks ago.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" he replied. \"I've been very busy.\"</p> <p>\"Too busy to call?\" Rat fink. Probably been romancing some hot Asian actress.</p><p>\"I'm afraid so. I've been in contract negotiations with an American producer.\"</p><p>\"You got the part?\" she squealed.</p><p>\"Yes. Filming begins in a couple of months.\"</p><p>\"I'm so glad for you. I know how badly you wanted the role.\"</p><p>\"I've missed you,\" he said.</p> <p>The pit of her stomach clenched. \"I missed you too.\"</p><p>Damn, why did I admit that to him?</p><p>\"How's Satoshi?\"</p><p>Back to reality. \"He's fine.\"</p><p>\"So what did you think of Yori and Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro is adorable, and, well, Yori's in jail.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Yi-jun asked. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"He and his wife got arrested a couple of hours ago for fighting in a club.\"</p> <p>\"He and Amaya got into a fight in a club?\"</p><p>\"No, Amaya and Shaundra were fighting because Shaundra was dancing with Yori at a club we were at.\"</p><p>\"You went clubbing?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Satoshi wanted to go.\"</p><p>\"You went clubbing with Satoshi? As in a date?\"</p><p>Why did she get the impression that he was upset? \"No, we all went out. Well, everyone except Masaaki, who's at the police station with his worthless guards trying to bail Yori and Amaya out. And I'm trying to get some copy ready to smooth things out with the media before the story goes public.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"Sounds like you guys are having a ball.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"It was quite entertaining, especially when Ichiro arrived and kicked Yori clean across some tables.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"You should have seen it. Yori was trying to separate Yori and Amaya when Ichiro arrived. It looked like Yori was holding Shaundra so Amaya could whip up on her. Ichiro misunderstood and kicked Yori with this high-flying drop move. Talk about superhero action.\"</p><p>\"I told you you'd like them.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but Masaaki's probably going to ground all of us.\"</p><p>\"Why you?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"Guilty by association.\"</p><p>\"Well, I hope you're not grounded tomorrow night.\"</p><p>\"What's happening tomorrow night?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I'm coming to Osaka.\"</p><p>Everything below her waist sizzled. \"You're coming here?\"</p><p>\"I miss you, so try to stay away from Masaaki.\"</p><p>\"I'll sneak out if I have to,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>\"I plan to take you to dinner, dancing and whatever.\"</p><p>\"Whatever?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, did I fail to mention that I really missed you?\"</p><p>\"I really missed you too.\" Oh boy, she was going to see Yi- jun again.</p><p>\"Don't tell Satoshi I'm coming. I want to surprise him.\"</p><p>\"I won't.\"</p><p>\"See you tomorrow. I should arrive about eight at night.\"</p><p>\"See you,\" Cristal said as he pressed the button on her phone and disconnected them. \"Tomorrow? I have to get my hair done.\" She looked at the time. Damn, it was too late to make an appointment. She'd have to call as soon as the beauty parlor opened tomorrow morning. \"And I need something to wear. He's seen me in everything else.\"</p><p>\"You guys are so grounded,\" Masaaki told Yori and Amaya as they rode to the mansion in the limousine. \"You too, Kenny.\"</p><p>Kenshin sighed. \"I knew going out with those guys was a bad idea.\" He raised the partition between the front of the limousine and the back where the three others sat.</p><p>\"I'm too old to be grounded,\" Amaya argued. \"I am not a child.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. She was so grounded, especially since she'd started the fight.</p><p>\"You are a part of this family now, so if I say you're grounded, you're grounded.\"</p><p>Amaya flipped her hair angrily and sat back in her seat.</p><p>\"And no lip. Do you know how much damage you caused?</p><p>Mr. Niigata is going to be quite upset when he has to write that check to the owner of that club.\"</p><p>Yori flinched. It would probably come out of his account.</p><p>Once again his new wife was costing him a fortune.</p><p>\"And you'll be lucky if Shaundra doesn't press charges against you.\"</p><p>\"For what?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"For assault and battery. Everyone said you slapped her first.\"</p><p>\"She was rolling on my husband on the dance floor.\"</p><p>Masaaki looked over at him. \"You were dancing with Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"It was one dance. Amaya had gone to the ladies' room, and I knew it was Shaundra's favorite song. I was just being...\"</p><p>\"You,\" Masaaki finished. \"You are a married man now.</p><p>You're lucky Ichiro wasn't there.\"</p><p>\"He showed up toward the end right before the police came,\" Yori admitted. He rubbed his aching back. \"He came for his wife.\"</p><p>\"Poor Shaundra. What she must think of you guys. She's probably regretting moving here from the United States. And what a mess if Harper Kehoe finds out. This can cause trouble for NiiKi.\"</p><p>To be fair, Shaundra literally beat the hell out of Amaya.</p><p>Except for a few well-placed slaps, Amaya didn't stand a chance against the feisty writer.</p><p>\"Why do you say 'poor Shaundra'? What part of 'she was belly rolling with my husband' don't you understand, Masaaki?\"</p><p>\"Did Yori complain?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>Yori shook his head.</p><p>\"See, you jumped an innocent woman for nothing. If he didn't complain, that means he enjoyed it.\"</p><p>Amaya rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>Yori shrugged at her. So sue me. He didn't regret dancing with Shaundra. She felt good in his arms again.</p><p>\"She'd better not try to press charges,\" Amaya threatened as Kenshin drove the limousine onto their street.</p><p>\"My advice to you is to find a house soon and move into it.</p><p>Yori has a China tour coming up shortly, and I can't be bothered with the four of you fighting like a bunch of kids.\"</p><p>\"Why do we have to move?\" Amaya asked. \"Why can't they move?\"</p><p>\"I'm sure Ichiro would, but everyone agreed that he and Shaundra could have the farmhouse since he's been taking care of it since he was a teenager.\"</p><p>Masaaki was right. He'd look for a place on Monday after he took care of Ichiro.</p><p>Kenshin pulled up at the front door and Masaaki got out first, followed by Yori and Amaya. Kenshin drove the car around to the garage to park it.</p><p>Yori rubbed his back again. Ichiro's kicks were getting super powerful. He hadn't won one fight against him in years, so maybe he should give up, because technically he did mess with Shaundra. No, he was so going to pay that little geisha back.</p><p>Masaaki opened the door, and they followed him inside. \"I don't want to hear another peep out of you two, and stay as far away from Shaundra and Ichiro as possible.\"</p><p>Ichiro slipped out of his bed and got into the shower while Shaundra snored peacefully in their bed. His entire body ached. Wifey turned into a nymphomaniac when she got really aroused. Not that he was complaining much, but men could not recuperate as fast as women. Shaundra, he'd discovered on their wedding night, was multi-orgasmic.</p><p>After showering and dressing, Ichiro tiptoed out of their bedroom and headed downstairs to the kitchen, looking for something to replenish the nourishment Shaundra had drained from his body like a vampire.</p><p>Satoshi entered the kitchen for a glass of water right behind him.</p><p>\"Damn, Ich, you look terrible.\"</p><p>\"I'm a bit tired, after the long drive back to Osaka and fighting with Yori.\" He pulled out the blender and emptied soymilk, two eggs, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and some hot sauce into it and turned the blender on. Once it finished, he poured it into a big glass and drank it down.</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Shaundra tired you out, didn't she?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded.</p><p>\"I should have your problems.\"</p><p>Ichiro ran water in the sink and washed the glass and blender. \"No problem,\" he replied. Satoshi was such an ass.</p><p>\"I'd be glad to rent myself out to you for a reasonable stud fee.\"</p><p>\"You go anywhere near my wife and I'll kick your ass.\"</p><p>\"Whoa, I'm just kidding.\"</p><p>\"No, you're not,\" Ichiro said. \"But I can handle you. Yori is the real problem.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra was Yori's woman first.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but she is now my wife, which means she is off-limits for randy pretty boys.\"</p><p>\"Ouch,\" Satoshi said, clutching his heart. \"I'm not randy.\"</p><p>Ichiro sat down at the table. \"All the muscles in my thighs hurt. I do not understand why Yori just doesn't give up. He has a beautiful wife who loves him.\"</p><p>Satoshi put his glass in the sink and joined him at the table. \"You know Yori. He doesn't like to lose.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. That was what frightened him. Yori was also very vindictive. \"But we are not kids anymore. We should act like responsible adults, especially Yori since he is the eldest.\"</p><p>\"He loves Shaundra. Even you should know what that feels like. You were so depressed when you thought she loved Yori instead of you. She chose you. That should count for something.\"</p><p>\"And what is wrong with Amaya? I know she doesn't like Shaundra, but to start a fight at the club like...\"</p><p>\"Us,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Yes. I thought she was a traditional Japanese bride, not some street brawler.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"If it makes you feel any better, Shaundra whipped her good.\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled. \"Really?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"She can take care of herself. I bet Amaya won't try anything like that with her again.\"</p><p>\"She needs to slow down,\" Ichiro said. \"I plan to grow old with her, but I won't be able to if she dies from a stroke or a heart attack. She's not twenty anymore, and no matter how young she looks her heart is fifty years old.\"</p><p>\"You'd better not let her hear that,\" Satoshi warned.</p><p>\"I love my wife, and I knew about the big age difference when I proposed to her. I don't care about her age, except I want her to take better care of herself. She had me worried before she got hypnotized.\"</p><p>\"The Valium?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"That stuff is addictive. I was so afraid she couldn't kick it.\"</p><p>\"But she did, so stop worrying. Maybe she needs something else to fill her days with.\"</p><p>\"Like what?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"A baby,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"She can't have kids.\"</p><p>\"Not the traditional way, but have the two of you considered adoption?\"</p><p>\"I mentioned it to her before we were married, but we've both been so busy.\"</p><p>\"Try mentioning it to her again. Maybe she'll change her mind.\"</p><p>\"Or kill me,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"You have a black belt in several martial arts. You can handle her.\"</p><p>Ichiro rubbed his back. \"I should have gotten one in bedroom aerobics.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked at him and started laughing. \"Is she really insatiable?\"</p><p>Ichiro bobbed his head up and down quickly, sending his hair in his face.</p><p>Satoshi reached over and brushed it out of his face.</p><p>\"Stupid Yori. He missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime.\"</p><p>\"Don't mention any of this to him. I heard them arrive a few minutes ago with Masaaki. Let's just hope they find a house soon. I won't be responsible if Shaundra wants a rematch.\"</p><p>\"Let's try not to leave the two of them alone,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"You're lucky Cristal is a nice young lady. I don't think you have to worry about her bar-brawling.\"</p><p>\"Cristal's just a friend,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, I heard that before. If she's just a friend, Yori is a virgin.\"</p><p>Satoshi could only laugh. \"I don't think Yori's ever been a virgin. Maybe he and Amaya should consider having a baby.</p><p>That should slow his libido.\"</p><p>Ichiro certainly hoped the two of them didn't procreate.</p><p>The world wasn't ready for such a baby. \"Where's Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"Sleeping, I hope. He wants to come up with some new dance steps tomorrow for our China tour.\"</p><p>\"If there is a China tour,\" Ichiro said. \"With me and Yori at each other's throats, and when word gets out about his arrest, how many fans will show up?\"</p><p>\"You'd be surprised,\" Satoshi told him. \"Everyone likes drama, especially when it happens to idols.\"</p><p>Takumijo had just finished stretching when his cell phone rang. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hi, Tak.\"</p><p>He'd know that voice anywhere. \"How are you?\"</p><p>\"In fine. I just finished up with my latest drama and was thinking it would be nice to go out and have a couple of drinks.\"</p><p>\"When did you get back in Osaka?\" Takumijo asked his friend.</p><p>\"This morning. Can you get away?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo replied. \"I'll meet you at the usual place in an hour.\" He disconnected the call, grabbed his things and left the dance studio.</p><p>Half an hour later he was dressed and headed downstairs.</p><p>Unfortunately he ran into Masaaki.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Out,\" Takumijo answered. He put on his sunglasses and slid them down the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\"Alone?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I'll be back in a couple of hours. I'm meeting a friend.\"</p><p>\"Osamu Nakaumura?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Yes. He just flew in this morning. We're meeting for drinks.\"</p><p>Masaaki shook his head. \"I thought Mr. Niigata asked you to stay away from him.\"</p><p>\"No, he told me to stay away from him. There's a difference.\" He walked past Masaaki.</p><p>\"He is going to ruin your career.\"</p><p>Takumijo spun around. \"That's not what you're afraid of.</p><p>You think he's going to talk me into leaving Aomori and becoming an actor. Don't worry about that. I'm not interested in changing my profession. I have too many years invested in this group.\" He walked out of the house. Kenshin had brought his Lexus to the curb and then snuck off to pick his girlfriend up from work.</p><p>Takumijo climbed into his car, started the engine and drove toward town. It galled him that Masaaki and Mr. Niigata still treated them like kids. He was twenty-six years old and capable of making his own decisions when it came to his life.</p><p>Takumijo maneuvered his way through the traffic until he arrived at the club. He found a parking spot and turned the car off, then walked up to the door and rang the buzzer of the exclusive club. Someone looked at him through a small sliding door. He showed his membership card and gained entrance.</p><p>Takumijo entered. For the next couple of hours, what he did behind closed doors was nobody's business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You look fantastic,\" Shaundra told Cristal once Shaundra finished styling Cristal's hair. \"You must be very excited seeing him after such a long time.\"</p><p>\"I didn't think I would be, but yes. I am. I can't wait for you to meet him.\"</p><p>\"I've heard a lot about him. I hear he's gorgeous.\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"Of course not as gorgeous as Ichiro, but he runs a close second.\"</p> <p>Shaundra chuckled. \"I still want to meet him. If he's a friend of Satoshi's he must be great.\"</p><p>\"You mind if I ask you something?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Have you ever been in love with two men at the same time?\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down on Cristal's bed. \"Yes. Why?\"</p> <p>\"How did you decide which one of them was the right one?\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"I just followed my heart. I took a long look at both of them to figure out which one would be there for me in the long haul, and which one would be least and most affected by my decision. So, I ask you again, why?\"</p><p>\"I suddenly find myself in that position.\"</p><p>\"Ah, Yi-jun and Satoshi?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded.</p><p>\"I thought so. You're the only woman I ever saw Satoshi look twice at who wasn't me.\" Shaundra smirked.</p> <p>Cristal gasped. \"So, it's all true. I mean, what I heard about you guys?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"But I made the right choice, and you will too.\"</p><p>\"But how do I choose? They both have so much to offer.\"</p><p>\"Ask yourself which one of them would lay down his life for you, choose you over his job, will be by your side and cry for you when you die, or would move Heaven and earth to get to you when obstacles block your way. That is the one to choose.\"</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>\"Show's on,\" Shaundra said. \"Lucky bachelor number two has arrived.\"</p><p>Cristal rose. \"Do I really look okay?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Girl, you're rocking that dress. If you don't believe me, watch Yi-jun's eyes when he sees you.\"</p> <p>Shaundra rose from the bed. \"I'm going downstairs to meet him so you can make a grand entrance.\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"I'll be down in a minute.\"</p><p>Shaundra left.</p><p>Cristal took one last look at herself in the mirror and waited patiently for time to pass.</p><p>\"When did you get in town?\" Satoshi asked Yi-jun as they high-fived each other.</p><p>\"A couple of hours ago. I wanted to surprise you.\"</p><p>\"Come on in,\" Satoshi said. \"I thought I wouldn't see you again until we arrived in China.\"</p><p>\"I finished up with some of my commitments, so I figured I'd take a little trip.\"</p><p>\"Korea to Japan is not a little trip.\" He led Yi-jun into the den. Yori and Amaya were seated, listening to music.</p><p>\"Yi-jun!\" Amaya screamed, hopping up from her seat and throwing herself into his arms like a star-struck fan. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>Yi-jun hugged Amaya. \"I came to see you guys.\"</p><p>Yori rose and pulled his wife off of the movie star. \"Nice to see you again.\" Both men shook hands.</p><p>\"I'm sorry I couldn't make the wedding, but congratulations.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for the gift,\" Amaya said, still looking at him. \"I'll treasure it forever.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"Same old Amaya.\"</p><p>Satoshi showed him to a seat. \"What have you been up to?\"</p><p>\"Signing contracts. I just got the part in an American movie.\"</p><p>\"No?\"</p><p>Yi-jun nodded. \"Yes. We start filming in two months.\"</p><p>\"Man, you've always loved the United States.\"</p><p>\"Yes. We got into so much trouble there when we were kids.\"</p><p>Ichiro and Shaundra entered the den.</p><p>Yi-jun hopped out of his seat. \"Ichiro, damn, man, look at you. Where did those muscles come from?\" He shook Ichiro's hand.</p><p>\"The gym,\" Ichiro answered. \"When did you get in?\"</p><p>\"This afternoon.\" He looked at Shaundra. \"And who is this?\"</p><p>Ichiro pulled Shaundra forward and held her hand. \"This is my wife Shaundra. Shaundra, this is Yi-jun Lee. He's a famous movie star and Satoshi's best friend.\"</p><p>Yi-jun bowed to Shaundra. \"Shaundra Morrison?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded and tried to step closer to him, but Ichiro held on tight.</p><p>\"I've read all of your books.\"</p><p>Shaundra giggled. \"So you're Satoshi's friend. I think you and I will be great friends, and you'll have to fill me in on what Satoshi was like as a child.\"</p><p>\"You are so beautiful,\" Yi-jun said.</p><p>\"So are you,\" Shaundra said with a smile.</p><p>\"See, definitely Satoshi's friend,\" Ichiro said. \"He's known you five minutes and he's already trying to add you to his stable.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"I see you still have that wicked little sense of humor, Ich.\"</p><p>\"Don't you guys have any plain friends?\" Shaundra asked, really checking him out.</p><p>\"Thanks for the compliment,\" Yi-jun said.</p><p>Satoshi watched it all, amazed at how fast Shaundra and Yi-jun responded to each other.</p><p>Yi-jun stopped flirting with Shaundra as soon as Cristal entered the den.</p><p>\"Wow,\" both he and Yi-jun said simultaneously.</p><p>Yi-jun bowed. \"You look spectacular,\" he told her.</p><p>She blushed, Satoshi noted. Damn. He'd never seen her like this before. \"Are you two going out?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Yi-jun said. \"To dinner, dancing and whatever.\"</p><p>Cristal blushed again.</p><p>\"Cristal is not old enough for whatever,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Especially with you.\" He sounded jealous even to himself. He stepped back. He had no right. \"Have fun you two.\"</p><p>Yi-jun walked over to Cristal and took her hand. He bowed over it and kissed it.</p><p>\"Let's go,\" Cristal told him once he released her hand.</p><p>\"Before Masaaki grounds me.\"</p><p>Yi-jun turned, bowed again to everyone in the room and followed Cristal out of the den.</p><p>\"They look good together,\" Shaundra said, pulling Ichiro toward the den door.</p><p>\"Do they?\" Satoshi asked, following them out of the den.</p><p>They left Yori and Amaya again with their boring classical music.</p><p>\"Is there anything you can't do?\" Cristal asked Yi-jun as they danced on the rooftop of a ritzy hotel. Somehow he had talked the owner into renting the spot out to him, and having it decorated with a table set with delicious-smelling food.</p><p>\"The owner is a friend of mine. I stay here whenever I'm in town.\"</p><p>\"He must be a very good friend.\"</p><p>\"The best,\" Yi-jun said, dancing her slowly over to the table while the most romantic love songs in the world played through a speaker. He held a seat out for her and then flipped a napkin over his arm and started uncovering the dishes...all American. He served her prime rib, Oysters Rockefeller, New England clam chowder and for dessert, bananas foster.</p><p>\"I am going to gain so much weight hanging around with you,\" Cristal said as Yi-jun filled her glass with wine.</p><p>\"No you won't.\" He poured some wine into his glass and then sat down at the table across from her. \"Did I tell you look beautiful? And black is definitely your color.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Cristal said as she sampled the wine. \"Shaundra helped me get ready.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro's wife?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"She's a great friend.\"</p><p>\"And quite lovely. I don't know why I imagined that she'd look much older. Imagine my surprise to find a young woman who appears to be about our age.\"</p><p>\"She's fifty,\" Cristal told him.</p><p>\"Yeah, I know. The genes in her family must be stellar.</p><p>Ichiro is one lucky dude.\"</p><p>\"Every man she meets seems to think so, except Takumijo.\"</p><p>\"Well, Takumijo doesn't really like anyone.\"</p><p>\"No, it's not that. Takumijo is friendly to her, but he isn't in love with her like Ichiro, Satoshi and Yori.\"</p><p>\"That's because he's smart. Ichiro would kick his butt.\"</p><p>\"Enough about them. How long are you in town?\"</p><p>\"We have the entire night. I snuck away without telling my agent.\"</p><p>Cristal gasped in fake surprise. \"He is so going to ground you.\"</p><p>\"Probably,\" Yi-jun said. \"Dong does think that he owns me.</p><p>He's a cool dude though.\"</p><p>They ate their meal and then dessert and then went back to dancing on the rooftop.</p><p>\"Would you like to see my penthouse apartment?\" Yi-jun asked.</p><p>\"Does that line work on the rest of your women?\"</p><p>\"No, but I was hoping it would work on you. I really want you to see it.\"</p><p>\"Whatever,\" Cristal said, taking his hand and leading him to the door to the stairs. \"And I really want to see it.\"</p><p>\"I don't know why you're all bummed out,\" Takumijo said to Satoshi after he returned to the mansion. \"After all, you fixed them up.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know,\" Satoshi said with a sigh. \"I'm always seeking pleasure. I thought Cristal would get tired of him after a while.\"</p><p>Takumijo sat down. \"And it backfired and now you're miserable.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Why do I do foolish things? If I would have acted on my impulses, I would be the one Shaundra is draining sexually.\"</p><p>Takumijo looked at him oddly. \"No?\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked. \"Poor Ich could barely stand when she finished without him earlier. She had the poor lad swallowing down health drinks to rebuild his stamina.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"Shaundra is definitely making a man out of our baby.\"</p><p>\"How was your outing?\" Satoshi asked, suddenly changing the subject.</p><p>Takumijo stopped smiling. \"Interesting.\"</p><p>\"How is Osamu?\"</p><p>\"Always a pleasure.\"</p><p>\"You were careful?\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Always. Osamu sent his love.\"</p><p>Satoshi moved around nervously. \"When is he leaving?\"</p><p>Satoshi never really liked Takumijo's boyhood friend because scandal usually followed in Osamu's wake.</p><p>Takumijo frowned. \"Don't tell me you don't like him either?\"</p><p>\"Like has nothing to do with it. But you're always miserable when he leaves.\"</p><p>\"He'll be in town for another couple of days, and then he's flying to China. He's filming some kind of historical drama there.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of good news, Yi-jun got a part in an American film. He's so excited about it.\"</p><p>\"But he's already a big star in Korea. What does he want to do an American film for?\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"Like us, he craves the freedom of America. He was quite upset when his father moved back to Korea when we were kids.\"</p><p>\"You think he'll move there permanently?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Satoshi shrugged. \"Maybe if his career takes off.\"</p><p>\"Do you think Cristal will go with him?\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged again. \"Do you think she's coming home tonight?\"</p><p>Takumijo shrugged too. \"She will if she knows what's good for her. She'd better get here before Masaaki discovers she's AWOL.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of absent without leave, how did you manage to get out tonight?\"</p><p>Takumijo smirked. \"I'm taller and outweigh Masaaki. What can he do to me?\"</p><p>\"You have a point.\" Satoshi sighed. \"Life was much easier for him when we were kids. Maybe we should cut him some slack.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Takumijo replied. \"It's too much fun seeing him squirm.\" He paused. \"Did Yori and Amaya put in an appearance this evening?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi answered. \"Masaaki bailed them out, and they were sitting down here in the den when Yi-jun arrived.</p><p>Yori had to pry Amaya off of Yi-jun again.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"Yori has his hands full with a star- struck wife. It's obvious that he has feelings for Amaya, but what I can't understand is that belly-bumping dance with Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"You know Yori. It's do as I say, not as I do. He can flirt with Shaundra all he wants, but Amaya has to be the devoted wife to him and not flirt with other men.\"</p><p>\"How is Ichiro? He was pretty angry when he left the club.\"</p><p>\"He's calmed down some. He put in an appearance too, along with his charming wife.\"</p><p>\"So what did Yi-jun think of Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"You know. He checked her out and she charmed the pants off of him.\"</p><p>\"You guys are hilarious. Shaundra will have all the males in Japan sniffing after her if she's not careful.\"</p><p>\"Not all,\" Satoshi said, looking at him suspiciously.</p><p>\"No, most,\" Takumijo replied. He rose and stretched. \"I'm tired. Don't stay up too late worrying. Cristal is a big girl.</p><p>She'll find her way home.\"</p><p>\"I don't think I can walk,\" Cristal said to Yi-jun as he held the car door open for her. \"The fleet is definitely in.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"Do you want me to carry you?\"</p><p>\"No thanks. I'll make it.\" She slid out of his car, and he reached out and took her hand.</p><p>Yi-jun pulled him to her for a kiss. \"I'm going to miss you,\"</p><p>he said once he stopped kissing her.</p><p>\"Next time give me some advance notice so I can train for another lovemaking marathon with you. You never cease to amaze me.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. \"You were perfect and very nimble.\" He kissed her on the lips again.</p><p>Cristal blushed. Yi-jun was positively shocking with his charm. \"Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to uphold.\"</p><p>\"You live in a house with four of the worst heathens of J- pop. Your reputation was ruined the day you accepted the job.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"Yes, they are a handful, but they're family.\"</p><p>Yi-jun kissed her again, this time allowing his tongue to slip through her lips. If he didn't stop this, she wasn't going to make it inside the house without tearing his clothes from his gorgeous body.</p><p>\"You'd better go inside before Masaaki puts out an APB on you.\"</p><p>The front door opened and Satoshi appeared. \"I thought I heard a car.\"</p><p>Yi-jun waved to him. \"Just bringing the princess home after the ball.\" He kissed Cristal on the cheek and waved goodbye to Satoshi. \"See you in China. Save me a front row seat for your concert.\"</p><p>\"I won't forget,\" Satoshi replied as Cristal walked up the stairs to him. \"We'll do China up right.\"</p><p>Yi-jun climbed into his car and sped off.</p><p>\"Has Masaaki been looking for me?\" Cristal asked, trying not to meet Satoshi's eyes.</p><p>\"No, lucky girl. He went out for the evening but hasn't returned yet.\"</p><p>\"Is he on a date?\" she asked as she stepped inside the farmhouse. Satoshi followed dangerously close like a shadow.</p><p>\"Would that surprise you?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"Quite frankly, yes.\"</p><p>Satoshi closed and locked the door. \"Why? He is a normal man with normal urges.\"</p><p>\"He's the manager of a famous J-pop group. One that constantly disobeys his orders.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled, took her hand and led her to the den.</p><p>Cristal sat down, and Satoshi sat next to her.</p><p>\"How was your date?\"</p><p>\"Fine. We went dancing, ate dinner and...\"</p><p>\"Whatever.\"</p><p>\"Yes, whatever.\"</p><p>\"You do know that Yi-jun has done whatever with lots of women?\" Satoshi pushed a lock of hair away from her eye.</p><p>His finger stroked her cheek.</p><p>\"Yes, I know.\" Why is my body reacting to his touch so soon after being with Yi-jun?</p><p>\"Are you in love with him?\"</p><p>Cristal shrugged. \"It's too soon to say. But he does make me happy.\"</p><p>\"But does he make you laugh like I can? Can he make your eye sparkle like they're doing now just by talking to me?\"</p><p>Cristal trembled involuntarily. \"What's with the fifty questions?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"It's an old American saying for why are you being so nosey?\"</p><p>Satoshi removed his fingers. \"I'm just curious. Humor me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he does make me laugh. Yi-jun has a wonderful sense of humor and...\"</p><p>Satoshi leaned into her and kissed her.</p><p>Cristal's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>Satoshi deepened the kiss. \"I can smell him all over you and taste him on your lips.\" He rose. \"Forgive me. I should not have done that.\"</p><p>\"Why did you?\"</p><p>\"Because for the moment you looked like you needed it.\"</p><p>Satoshi turned on his heel and walked out of the room.</p><p>Cristal sighed. Stupid Satoshi. Why did he have to kiss me like that? Now I'm really confused. Cristal rose and hurried out of the den and up the stairs. She heard Masaaki come home fifteen minutes after she made it safely up to her room.</p><p>\"Let's adopt a baby,\" Ichiro told Shaundra as she snuggled up next to him in bed.</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked, pulling away from him.</p><p>\"Let's adopt a baby.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because I think it would be good for you, and you won't get lonely when I'm away working.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Are you serious? Why are you thinking about this all of a sudden?\"</p><p>Ichiro pouted and folded his arms across his bare chest.</p><p>\"It's not all of a sudden. I just don't want you to get lonely and leave me for another man. A baby will keep you too busy to notice.\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"Silly boy.\" She moved closer and released his hair from the elastic band. It cascaded down his back and around his face. \"Why would I even look at another man when I have you?\" Truth be known, he still rocked her world.</p><p>Ichiro removed her hand from his hair. \"I am trying to be serious here.\"</p><p>\"So am I, Ich. I don't have time in my life for a baby right now. I'm obligated to two publishers, and I'm married to a pop star who wants me to go on tour with him. I have four grown kids back in the United States. My plate is full.\"</p><p>\"But.\"</p><p>Shaundra put his finger on his lips. \"No buts. A baby is a big responsibility and a lot of work. Do you realize I'll be in my seventies when this child reaches adulthood? And you'll be what? Forty-six?\" Damn, and probably still hot. \"Do you really want to give up our time together to raise a kid?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" he said. \"I just thought it might be nice for you.\"</p><p>She could tell when he was lying to her. \"You're sweet, but you're all the baby I need.\" She reached beneath the covers and stroked him with her hand.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" Ichiro said as he trembled. \"Don't do that. He's dead.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Nonsense. He's too young to die. He just needs a little attention.\" She crawled beneath the covers and proved it to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaundra felt like crap the next morning when she crawled out of bed and every bone in her body ached from playing mattress mambo with Ichiro to the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>She sighed. Sometimes being fifty really sucked.</p><p>Shaundra walked over to her armoire, took out her high blood pressure machine and carried it back over to her bed to test her pressure. She grimaced after getting the reading.</p><p>Maybe she should drink more water. She put away the machine, reached for her arsenal of medicine and downed it with a full bottle of water. Every morning she followed the same routine to jumpstart her back into the land of the living.</p> <p>She gazed over to the clock on the nightstand. Six a.m. and time to go to work. After showering and dressing, Shaundra ate the breakfast Ichiro left for her on the bedside table. She gazed lovingly at the single long-stem red rose he'd picked fresh from the garden. Spring was arriving, and she looked forward to witnessing the trees bloom with cherry blossoms.</p><p>Shaundra looked for her reading glasses while her laptop warmed up in her office...a room connected to her and Ichiro's bedroom. It would have been a perfect spot for a nursery if she was foolish enough to consider Ich's proposition. She found her glasses and slipped them up the bridge of her nose so she could read the fine print on her table and on her monitor screen. Constant reading and being on the computer strained her eyes to the point that she needed bifocals. She typed in her login name and password, and moments later her desktop appeared. First stop, Twitter, to catch up on All-K-Pop, her favorite Asian entertainment source. After drooling over all the new male pop idols, Shaundra surfed over to Facebook, where she said good morning to her fans and Happy Birthday to those friends celebrating their birth. After reading all the current posts, she clicked on her profile page to make sure that no one had posted any advertisements and to read comments from her friends, fans and family members who were all concerned about how she was adjusting to her move to Osaka.</p><p>Shaundra friended a couple of people and then went to her fan page, where she wrote about her current works in progress and upcoming releases. She posted all of her new book covers and announced a contest for her latest gay book, Manly.</p><p>The next stop was perusing her publishers' Facebook pages to catch up on what her fellow writers were up to. One quick surf brought her to Aomori's Facebook page. Their fans had been busy since early this morning posting comments.</p><p>Most of the posts were from young girls professing their love to the fellows. A few had uploaded their favorite Aomori music videos, and a lot of them voice their excitement about Aomori's upcoming China tour.</p> <p>What's this? Shaundra groaned. Someone had posted a video of her and Yori dancing at the club the other night and one of her fighting with Amaya. Her daughters were going to strangle her when they saw that their mother was once again gracing the pages of YouTube. Oh God, she thought. What were her fans going to think? That settled it - no more clubbing with Aomori.</p><p>Shaundra signed out of her site and went to check her e- mail. She groaned again. She had about three hundred new letters. Yahoo is going to shut me down. She quickly deleted the Yahoo digests she subscribed to, except the ones from her current publishers. She deleted the ones informing her that she had won a lottery and the ones trying to sell her penile enhancement products.</p><p>She zeroed in on the e-mails on how to promote her books, read some reviews on her books and responded to editors who had sent her ARCs that needed tidying. Her eyes landed on several new requests for friendship from Facebook and Twitter. There were also about fifty from YouTube, no doubt concerning her latest debacle with Yori. Shaundra clicked on the first one. Someone actually told her that Amaya deserved the butt-kicking she received, and a few said some pretty unpleasant things about her dancing with Yori.</p><p>Enough. Shaundra put checkmarks in the boxes and deleted all of them. All that was left in her box were Calls for Submissions and a letter from Harper Kehoe's New York office. She grimaced. It probably contained a pink slip after seeing her latest video. She clicked on it. Shaundra groaned.</p><p>Harper wanted her to do some promoting with him in China in a couple of weeks when they went overseas. The last time she did this type of work for him she ended up the love interest of several hot Japanese singers, a music arranger, a photographer and God knows who else. At fifty, she seemed to be drawing men to her like flies. He said he would be arriving soon and would stop by to see how she was doing.</p><p>Shaundra replied, See you when you get here. We have a lot to catch up on. She sent the reply.</p> <p>A part of her was really excited about seeing Harper again, since she hadn't seen him in a couple of months since her wedding day. She wondered how Dorothy, Jackson and Riley were doing. She promised herself she would call or drop them each a line in a day or so. Now she had to get down to some serious writing and typing.</p><p>Shaundra's head still throbbed. The medicine hadn't kicked in yet, but she had a lot of work to do. Her current project for her New York publisher was an erotic vampire series, and she owed NiiKi, her Japanese publisher, a book for their Asian gay line. She reached for the thermos of coffee that Ich had left for her and poured herself a cup. Shaundra moaned when it hit the pit of her stomach, and she felt nauseous. Ignore it, she told herself.</p><p>For the life of her she couldn't concentrate on her work.</p><p>She kept rehashing her dance with Yori over and over in her mind, adding to her headache. What was I thinking? Did she love Silk that much to foolishly agree to dance with him, even when she knew he still carried a torch for her...proven by a gigantic bulge in his pants that she felt when he held her close? If she was Amaya, she would have slapped her too.</p><p>Shaundra knew better but still did the bump and grind on the dance floor with the sexy Japanese man who still held a special spot in her heart.</p><p>The door to her office opened and Ichiro entered. \"Good morning, beautiful wife.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked over and smiled at him. Ichiro was dressed cutely in a dark brown suit and on his way to another business meeting. Lately he was becoming quite the entrepreneur with the opening of his restaurants in Japan and Korea. She still hadn't met his relatives but looked forward to it one day before the band left for China. She was pretty proud of his accomplishments, but his being away so often cut into her face time with him. Still, she got a lot of work done with the time she had to herself.</p><p>He walked over to her, smelling like sunshine and a new light cologne he'd just purchased, and kissed her. \"I should be back this afternoon,\" he told her.</p> <p>\"I'll be here.\"</p><p>He peered over her shoulder at her laptop. \"What are you working on?\"</p><p>\"A new book for Mr. Niigata.\"</p><p>\"Yaoi?\" he asked with a disgusted look on his face.</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>\"I don't know what people get out of reading such trash.\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned at him.</p><p>Ichiro quickly covered his mistake. \"I don't mean that your books are trash. I mean the genre. Two men romantically involved is rubbish.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Was her gorgeous J-popper a homophobe? \"I have this philosophy that people fall in love with who they fall in love with. It doesn't matter if they're both men.\"</p><p>\"It's just not natural,\" Ichiro argued. \"And how do you know what two men do in a room together behind closed doors?\"</p><p>\"I don't, but I have seen movies and done my research.\"</p><p>\"You've been watching gay porn?\"</p><p>\"Not lately, but I have seen quite a few movies.\"</p><p>Ichiro didn't fail her. He blushed beet red. \"Oh Shaundra, how can you stand to do that?\"</p><p>\"Would it be better on you if I wrote about two women?\"</p><p>Ichiro brightened and smiled. \"Maybe.\"</p><p>\"You do understand that I would have to watch a lot of lesbian movies and do a lot of research.\"</p><p>\"I hope you mean you'll have to go to the library or surf the Internet.\"</p><p>Shaundra hummed but did not answer him. Let him squirm.</p><p>He changed the subject. \"If men were made to be together, women wouldn't have been created.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"You are so innocent.\"</p><p>Ichiro frowned. \"Don't tease me, Shaundra. You don't know what it's like having men look at you like you're dessert.\"</p><p>Yes, she did know. She went through it daily. \"Ooh, hit a nerve. Are men still lusting after my gorgeous husband?\"</p><p>\"I don't want to talk about it,\" he said.</p><p>The guys of Aomori were always dealing or skirting around the issue of their feminine looks. To her it made them hot, and that was what drew her to them in the first place.</p><p>\"I'm serious about my beliefs, Shaundra.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose and went into his arms. For a moment she felt faint, but she quickly recovered. \"I know you are and so am I. It's just fiction. I don't have some deep latent fantasy of seeing you with another man. Or another woman either, for that matter.\" Unfortunately she did have fantasies of having Yori join her and Ichiro in bed, but she was never going to act upon them.</p><p>\"Good, because it's never going to happen.\"</p><p>Shaundra pinched him on his backside, and Ichiro quickly backed away from her. \"What's wrong with you?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Ichiro answered. \"I'm going to be late for my meeting.\"</p><p>Shaundra eyed him curiously and then let it go. \"Okay, see you later.\"</p><p>Ichiro headed for the door and stopped. \"One more thing: try to stay away from Amaya and Yori today.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, I already know. Anyway, I probably won't step foot out of this office except to get something for lunch or to use the toilet. I have a lot of work to do.\"</p><p>\"I mean it, Shaundra,\" Ichiro said like he didn't believe her.</p><p>Why is he being this way? Usually he had the temperament of a kitten. Now he sounded like a...husband.</p><p>She raised her right hand as she sat down in her chair. \"I promise that I won't go anywhere near Yori or his crazy wife.</p><p>I will stay in our suite until you come home.\"</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at her sarcasm and walked out.</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Being arrogant did not fit him. If she wanted to be treated like a child or a possession, she would have married her ex-boyfriend Donald.</p><p>Her telephone rang. Shaundra looked down at the caller ID. Juanda. Shit. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Have you lost your mind, Mother?\"</p><p>It had begun. Normally she would have been glad to talk to her eldest daughter, but not this morning. \"No.\"</p><p>\"Then you must like controversy. Why are you the talk of YouTube again?\"</p><p>It would be nice every now and then to get a call from Juanda that began with Mama, how are you feeling? or something like that.\" \"Oh, so you've seen it?\"</p><p>\"So have several million viewers. I think they crashed the server, because I'm not able to pull it up again.\"</p><p>Great, sarcasm from two smart-asses this morning. \"She started with me.\"</p><p>\"Don't even go there. Why were you dancing with that woman's husband?\"</p><p>\"Because he asked me to dance,\" Shaundra answered.</p><p>Why is everyone making such a big deal out of this? It was just a dance.</p><p>\"Were you out on a date with him or something, and she came to the club and busted the two of you together?\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. Where did this girl get these ideas?</p><p>\"No, we all went to the club together. He asked me to dance after she went to the ladies' room.\"</p><p>\"And that wasn't a clue?\" She laughed. \"My mother, a home wrecker.\"</p><p>\"I did not wreck their marriage,\" Shaundra said in her own defense. \"We are all supposed to be friends, so I didn't see anything wrong with dancing with a friend.\"</p><p>\"Put yourself in her shoes. You and her husband were once a hot item, and then she comes out of the ladies' room and sees you belly-rubbing with him on the dance floor to 'Freak Me Baby.' What would you have done?\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"Probably the same thing.\"</p><p>\"I hope you've apologized to her.\"</p><p>\"Hell no,\" Shaundra answered rudely. \"She's been picking with me since she came back from her honeymoon. She's lucky beating her butt was all I did to her.\"</p><p>\"You've changed,\" Juanda said. \"You didn't used to be so vindictive. Where was Ichiro during all of this?\"</p><p>\"Home,\" Shaundra replied. \"He'd just returned from a business trip and was tired. We had already made plans to go out for a while.\"</p><p>\"Does he know?\"</p><p>\"Most of it. He did show up toward the end before the police arrived.\"</p><p>\"The police? Please don't tell me that you went to jail.\"</p><p>\"No, but Yori and his wife did.\"</p><p>\"And you're still sharing a house with them?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Are you crazy? What happens if she wants to retaliate?\"</p><p>\"Then I'll deal with her.\"</p><p>\"Mother, fifty-year-old women should not be fighting over a man.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Shaundra replied. The more she talked to Juanda the more her head hurt. And she felt a bit feverish. \"But I had to defend myself. I couldn't let her get away with slapping me like that. Maybe I shouldn't have danced with Yori, but I'm no one's punching bag.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Juanda said. \"Just do me a favor. Please stay away from them.\"</p><p>\"I will,\" Shaundra replied. \"They'll be moving out a soon as they can find a house.\"</p><p>\"You do know that I worry about you, and Japan is a heck of a long way to be traveling to visit you in the hospital.\"</p><p>\"How are the kids?\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Juanda replied. \"And don't change the subject.\"</p><p>\"I thought you were through. Listen. I appreciate the concern, but I can take care of myself.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, you've got a real mean right hook.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled.</p><p>\"This isn't funny, Mother. I swear, sometimes I think our roles have reversed.\"</p><p>\"Ich wants us to adopt a baby.\"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro wants us to adopt a baby.\"</p><p>Juanda squealed. \"That's good news. Am I getting a brother or a sister?\"</p><p>\"I haven't agreed to it yet.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Juanda asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\"Because I don't know if I can handle a baby. That's a big responsibility for someone my age.\"</p><p>\"But you were a great mother, and my kids love you.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, and I can send them home to you when they start to get on my nerves. I can't do that with an adopted child.\"</p><p>\"Too bad you can't have one of your own or find a surrogate mother. Then the child would at least be Ichiro's.\"</p><p>\"Are you volunteering?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Hell no,\" Juanda answered. \"I'm trying to send the ones I have back.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. The twins were quite a handful. \"I hope he changes his mind. We're both at the top of our careers, and we don't have time for changing diapers.\"</p><p>\"Not even to save your marriage?\"</p><p>\"My marriage isn't in trouble.\" Shaundra rubbed her forehead. It throbbed unmercifully.</p><p>\"Mama, you were belly-bumping with Yori. Ichiro has to have seen that video by now.\"</p><p>\"I love Ichiro and I would never do anything to harm him.\"</p><p>\"I know that. Only love would have made you leave the United States, but he's still so young. He does not understand that you wouldn't cheat on him.\"</p><p>Juanda was right. Things were a mess, and it was mostly her fault. \"I'll have a long talk with him tonight when he comes home.\"</p><p>\"And give the adoption thing another thought. You have plenty of love to share. I'll try to call you again next week.\"</p><p>\"Bye, baby,\" Shaundra said, hanging up. She sighed. From now on she'd be the epitome of good. She yawned. But at the moment she still felt like crap. She walked out of her office and crawled back into her bed.</p><p>Four bedrooms, three baths, a place to practice, and even a workshop Amaya could use for designing her clothes. Yori opened a cabinet. Plenty of space for food and a nice-sized kitchen. There was even a formal dining room and a room for entertaining. \"Well, what do you think?\" he asked Amaya.</p><p>\"It's kind of small,\" Amaya replied. \"I envisioned us in something bigger.\"</p><p>Yori sighed. \"Why? It's just the two of us. How much more room do we need?\"</p><p>\"You're a famous idol. You deserve to live in a mansion.\"</p><p>With billions of people in Japan, they were lucky to find this home. \"Idol does not equate to billionaire. This place is affordable, and it's close to both our parents' homes.\"</p><p>\"But the farmhouse is so much larger. Why can't Shaundra and Ichiro move in here and we take the farmhouse?\"</p><p>Yori smirked. No matter what he said, Amaya would never be satisfied. \"Because we all agreed that Ichiro and Shaundra could have the farmhouse. What am I supposed to do, throw them out?\"</p><p>Amaya nodded. \"You don't even like Ichiro. Why are you being so generous?\"</p><p>Yori stared at his wife. \"To get the record straight, Ichiro is like a brother to me. He's Aomori's maknae. Just because we're having a few issues doesn't mean that I hate him.\" He wasn't lying, but he still intended on making Ichiro pay for that kick. It was disrespectful, and his back still ached. With the China tour less than two weeks away, he had to go see a chiropractor or something to get back into shape.</p><p>\"Your brother? I'm your wife. It is your duty to make sure I'm happy, not Ichiro.\"</p><p>Yori chose to ignore her. Sometimes it was the best approach to dealing with her. \"We could look around a little more, but I don't think we'll find another place better than this on the market right now. It's just a starter home. We'll get something larger as the family grows.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"You know, when we have kids.\"</p><p>Amaya made a face. \"You never mentioned kids. I assumed you didn't want any.\"</p><p>Yori stood over her and looked into her eyes. \"Oh, yes, I want loads of kids.\"</p><p>Amaya backed away from him, frightened. \"As a matter of fact,\" he continued, \"we should start right away.\" She had nowhere to run. He had her trapped against the kitchen cabinets. Yori lifted her, placed her atop the cabinet and wiggled his way between her legs, then leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>Amaya closed her eyes and waited.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Waiting to be kissed.\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. She hadn't a passionate or compassionate bone in her body. He pecked her against the lips and turned away.</p><p>\"Hey, where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Home,\" he replied. \"I need to call the realtor to tell him to show this house to someone else because we're looking for something bigger to raise a family in. I guess we can stay in my little suite in the farmhouse until we return from China.\"</p><p>\"Wait, don't make that call,\" Amaya said, hopping from the counter and running behind him. \"Let's take this place. It's just the right size.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. The idea of having multiple babies terrified the hell out of his wife.</p><p>\"That has to be illegal,\" Satoshi said to Takumijo as they watched a video on the computer in the den.</p><p>\"What?\" Ichiro asked, entering the room.</p><p>Both he and Takumijo jumped in front of the monitor.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Are you guys watching porn?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo answered.</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Ah, come on, you guys. I'm over twenty-one. Let me see.\"</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo stepped aside, and Ichiro looked down at the screen. \"Oh my,\" he said. \"When did this happen?\"</p><p>\"The other night,\" Satoshi replied. \"At the club before the fight.\"</p><p>\"Now I see the reason for the fight. Why didn't you guys tell me about this?\"</p><p>\"We didn't know how to,\" Satoshi replied. \"Things are already messed up between you and Yori.\"</p><p>Ichiro rewound the video to the beginning and replayed it.</p><p>\"Yori has done some pretty low things in his lifetime, but this is ridiculous.\"</p><p>\"You can't blame it all on him,\" Satoshi said in his leader's defense. \"He's not dancing alone. And by the way, your wife has a great ass.\"</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at Satoshi.</p><p>\"What are you going to do?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Have a very long talk with my wife. Where is she?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Satoshi said. \"I haven't seen her since last night.\"</p><p>\"Me either,\" Takumijo said. \"But I think she's here, because I've been hearing music coming from your room.\"</p><p>Ichiro stormed out of the den.</p><p>\"Maybe we should stop him,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"Ich would never hit a woman,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>The bedroom door opened and slammed, startling them.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Shaundra sat up with a start in her bed. Ichiro stood at the foot of the bed, looking angrily down at her. \"What's wrong?\"</p><p>she asked.</p><p>\"I just saw you and Yori on YouTube,\" he replied, breathing hard.</p><p>\"Oh,\" she said, sliding back down on the pillows and pulling the covers back up to her neck. She closed her eyes.</p><p>Ichiro snatched the covers from her body.</p><p>Everything on her body still ached, and he was messing with her.</p><p>\"Oh, is that all you have to say?\"</p><p>Shaundra opened her eyes again. \"What do you want me to say? I told you that I slow-danced with Yori the other night.\"</p><p>\"That's not a slow dance, Shaundra, that's intercourse.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat up. \"Be for real. We're fully dressed and there are about two hundred people in the club.\" She didn't like the way he looked at her.</p><p>\"I have tried to be patient with you, but you've really crossed the line this time.\"</p><p>Oh no he didn't. Shaundra's brain went on the defense despite the terrible headache. But she wasn't going to give him the benefit of seeing her suffer. She swung her legs over the side of the bed and walked over to face him. \"What line have I crossed?\" She put her hands on her hips. Damn, they hurt too. \"If you have something to say, just come on out and say it.\"</p><p>\"If I wanted a whore for a wife I would have married one.</p><p>That video is not only trashy, it's disrespectful. Why do you refuse to act your age?\"</p><p>There it is. She knew it would come out of his mouth sooner or later. \"And how is someone my age supposed to act?\"</p><p>\"You are a grandmother, for Pete's sake. You're not supposed to be clubbing or doing half the stuff you do. One of these days you're going to have a heart attack.\"</p><p>A pain shot through Shaundra's head, and she wobbled a little.</p><p>Ichiro looked at her and then reached for her.</p><p>Shaundra backed up from him. She was tired of people telling her what to do and telling her to act her age. And she sure was not going to take it from Ichiro.</p><p>\"Are you ill?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No,\" she lied. Now she felt worse than crap.</p><p>\"Why are your eyes so red? Have you been drinking?\"</p><p>\"No, you know I don't drink alcohol.\" It was probably the flu, and her blood pressure being elevated didn't help.</p><p>\"Let me see if you have a fever.\" He touched her, and she pushed him away.</p><p>\"No thanks,\" Shaundra replied. \"I'll be okay.\" She didn't need him babying her or feeling sorry for her. Like he'd said, she should act her age, which meant being independent and not having others do things for her.</p><p>\"Maybe you should lie back down.\"</p><p>\"Don't tell me what to do, Ich. As a matter of fact, why don't you go back downstairs and join your little friends. I've been by myself all day. What's another couple of hours?\" She walked back over to the bed and sat down before she fell.</p><p>Ichiro took one last look at her and then left.</p><p>\"Jackass,\" she mumbled. Oh God, she felt like she was dying. Maybe she shouldn't have been so hasting and sent Ichiro off packing. No, she argued with herself. She didn't need him to help her. She lay down on the bed, pulled the covers up to her neck again and closed her eyes.</p><p>Satoshi looked at Takumijo as Ichiro stormed past them, grabbed his car keys from the hook in the foyer and left the house. Moments later they heard a car driving quickly away from the premises.</p><p>\"Trouble in paradise,\" Takumijo observed as he walked back toward the music room.</p><p>Satoshi took one more look at the stairs, hoping to hear Shaundra come out of the room and read Ichiro the riot act.</p><p>Nothing. He followed Takumijo. He didn't like the vibes in the air. It was like something was forewarning him that trouble was coming. He'd never seen Ichiro so upset, never heard him raise his voice so loudly, or heard him speak to anyone the way he'd spoken to Shaundra. Sure, what she'd done was foolish, but to call her a whore was reprehensible.</p><p>He entered the music room and sat down at the piano.</p><p>Maybe he should have suspected something was wrong when she didn't come out of her room at all today. Normally she'd come down for lunch. Why isn't she eating?</p><p>Ichiro usually took care of her and made sure she ate well.</p><p>God, he hoped she wasn't ill. \"Don't you think Ichiro overreacted just a bit?\"</p><p>Takumijo shrugged. \"How would you have reacted if she was your wife and you saw her on YouTube bumping and grinding with Yori?\"</p><p>\"Well, first of all, I would have accompanied her to the club no matter how tired I was, and second, Yori never would have gotten the opportunity to get close to her. This is as much his fault as hers.\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Why hasn't she come down today?\"</p><p>See, it wasn't just his imagination. Takumijo knew her routine as well as he did. \"I was just thinking the same thing.\"</p><p>\"Do you suppose that she's ill? Doesn't she suffer from hypertension?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"The last time it got her down was when one of her fans tried to blow her up. The stress from the event sent her pressure soaring.\"</p><p>Something hit the floor loudly upstairs.</p><p>Satoshi looked at Takumijo, and they ran from the music room and headed toward the staircase.</p><p>Takumijo's long legs took the stairs two at a time, but Satoshi managed to catch up with him and pass him at the top of the landing. He beat Takumijo to Ichiro's door. He knocked. \"Shaundra, are you okay?\"</p><p>He heard a groan.</p><p>\"I hope she's decent,\" Takumijo said, turning the doorknob and entering. \"Shit. She's on the floor.\"</p><p>Satoshi followed him in, gasping as he saw blood oozing from a wound on her forehead. He hurried over to her and knelt beside her. \"Shaundra, honey, are you awake?\" No answer. He lifted her hand. It felt hot, and her pulse raced.</p><p>Her breathing was a bit off.</p><p>\"We need to call an ambulance,\" Takumijo said nervously.</p><p>\"No time,\" Satoshi said. \"Call Kenshin and tell him to bring the limousine around.\"</p><p>\"Kenshin isn't here,\" Takumijo said. \"He took Masaaki into town and hasn't returned yet.\"</p><p>\"Then we'll have to take her.\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"You stay here with her and I'll go get my car.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed. Takumijo left the room. His big footsteps sounded down the halls and down the steps. Satoshi continued to hold Shaundra's hand. Her face looked flushed and sweaty. \"Hold on, honey. We'll take care of you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Whoa, where are you going in such a hurry?\" Yori asked Takumijo as he let Amaya out of the car at the front of the farmhouse.</p><p>\"To get my car,\" Takumijo said. \"It's Shaundra. We found her unconscious on the floor in her bedroom.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Yori asked, hopping out of the car.</p><p>\"Satoshi is upstairs with her.\"</p> <p>Amaya leaned against the railing on the porch. \"It's probably from all those Valiums she pops,\" she said sarcastically.</p><p>Yori looked at his wife, dashed up the stairs past her and through the open front door. He ran up the stairs that led to the second floor bedrooms and toward Ichiro's rooms. He found Satoshi sitting on the floor next to Shaundra, stroking her forehead and holding her hand.</p><p>Satoshi looked up and saw him. \"She won't wake up,\" he said, nearly in tears. \"Where are Takumijo and that car?\"</p><p>\"No time,\" Yori said, staring down at Shaundra's pale face.</p><p>He bent over and scooped her up into his arms. \"Come on. My car is parked out front.\" Yori turned and left the room, carrying Shaundra in his arms. He passed Amaya, who still stood on the stairs.</p> <p>\"What do you think you're doing, Yori?\"</p><p>\"Taking Shaundra to the hospital.\"</p><p>\"She just needs her stomach pumped. Call an ambulance.\"</p><p>\"Don't be so foolish,\" he told her. \"She's barely breathing.</p><p>I can't wait on an ambulance.\"</p><p>Takumijo had arrived with his car.</p> <p>\"We'll take mine since it's bigger,\" Yori told him.</p><p>Takumijo nodded and reached into the window and turned his car off.</p><p>Satoshi opened the back door of Yori's car and stepped aside.</p><p>Yori bent into the car and laid Shaundra down across the backseat.</p><p>Satoshi climbed in and sat beside her. Yori ran around to the driver's seat, and Takumijo jumped into the front passenger's seat. Yori started the car and drove away from the farmhouse. He had to take her to the nearest hospital.</p><p>\"Where's Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Takumijo answered. \"He and Shaundra got into an argument earlier, and he hopped into his car and drove off.\"</p><p>Yori gasped. \"Did he do this to her? I will kill his ass.\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Satoshi said. \"Ich would never hit a woman.\"</p><p>\"What were they arguing about?\" he asked as he drove.</p><p>\"You,\" Takumijo answered.</p><p>Figures. He'd probably seen their latest YouTube video.</p><p>\"See if you can reach him by phone and tell him to meet us at the hospital.\"</p><p>Takumijo pulled out his cell phone and tried several time to reach Ich, but the calls went directly to voice mail. He left a message. \"He's not answering. He must be really pissed.\"</p><p>\"Are you guys sure he didn't touch her?\"</p><p>\"We can't be entirely sure because we weren't upstairs with them,\" Takumijo said. \"But we know Ichiro. He would not hit a woman.\"</p><p>\"You guys keep saying that, then why can't we reach him?\" At the moment he didn't care about Ichiro's feelings.</p><p>He kept looking through his rearview mirror to the backseat of the car. Shaundra still hadn't woken, and poor Satoshi looked like he was about to spazz out. He still held her hand.</p><p>\"Her fever has escalated,\" Satoshi announced. \"She's burning up.\"</p><p>\"We're about five minutes away from the hospital. She'll hang on...she's a fighter,\" Yori told him. Don't die, Shaundra.</p><p>\"I've never seen her so still,\" Takumijo said, looking back at her. \"She's always been a bundle of energy.\"</p><p>Satoshi bent over and kissed Shaundra on the lips.</p><p>\"Hey, man,\" Takumijo warned. \"That's Ich's wife.\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" Satoshi replied. \"I may never get another chance to...\" His voice faltered and broke.</p><p>Not good, Yori thought. Satoshi was the last one of them to get sentimental. Even Takumijo had his moments of weakness, but never Satoshi. He felt like a heel.</p><p>Shaundra body's suddenly jerked and convulsed.</p><p>\"A woman never did that before when I kissed her,\"</p><p>Satoshi spat out.</p><p>\"Step on it, Yori,\" Takumijo told him. \"She's may be in cardiac arrest.\"</p><p>The hospital appeared as Yori turned the corner. Takumijo jumped out of the car even before Yori brought it to a complete stop. He ran inside to get help. Two orderlies followed him back out. Shaundra's body was still not moving.</p><p>Yori almost had to pry Satoshi from Shaundra so the orderlies could get to her.</p><p>\"What if she dies, man?\" he asked with a sob.</p><p>\"Then we're going to have one berserk six-feet-tall geisha to try to control.\"</p><p>The interns looked Shaundra over and then removed her from the backseat and put her onto a gurney.</p><p>Yori tried Ichiro's number as he walked to the admission section with Takumijo and Satoshi. It went straight to voice mail. Where was he?</p><p>Ichiro sat in his car outside the farmhouse for a long time, refusing to go in and face his wife. He was so embarrassed about how he'd acted. He'd been holed up at his restaurant all afternoon, getting on his brother's and sister's nerves pouring over books and checking supplies and making everyone miserable. Finally his brother sat him down and had a nice long talk with him about life and sent him back home to his wife.</p><p>The door opened and Cristal came running out. \"Ich, where have you been? The guys have been trying to get in contact with you. They had to rush Shaundra to the hospital.\"</p><p>Ichiro literally felt the world stop revolving. \"What? Call them and tell them I'm on my way.\" He started up the car.</p><p>He'd thought about checking his phone messages but decided against it, since he figured Satoshi and Takumijo would have given him the business from arguing with Shaundra. What had happened after he left? She had felt a little warm and her eyes were red, but she hadn't once told him that she didn't feel well. He pounded his hand against the steering wheel.</p><p>Idiot. Why would she tell you after what you said to her? He put his foot down on the accelerator, increasing his speed.</p><p>The nearest hospital was about ten minutes away. She'd better not die on him before he apologized.</p><p>After serious consideration, he'd realized that Shaundra would never cheat on him with Yori. Every day she tried to show him that she loved him with her mind, her touch and certainly her body. And she had chosen him over the more sexually advanced Yori and married him. She had given up her home, partial citizenship and left her kids to follow him to a country where she couldn't even speak the language. He felt like such a fool. It was just a dance, and had he not put his business before her, he would have been there to go clubbing with her.</p><p>Shaundra had never asked him for anything, but she had unselfishly given him her everything. If they made it through this, he promised that he'd be more attentive, less jealous and even apologize to Yori. Don't let her die, he prayed.</p><p>His phone vibrated in his pocket, and Ichiro quickly answered it. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Where the hell are you?\" Satoshi. He sounded very upset.</p><p>\"About five minutes away from the hospital.\"</p><p>\"Get your ass here now. They're asking us questions we can't answer, and they can't do anything for Shaundra without a family member's signature.\"</p><p>\"Tell them I'm on my way.\" He paused. \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"No time to explain. Just get here to the emergency room.\" Satoshi hung up.</p><p>Ichiro looked down at his phone. He had twenty messages.</p><p>He was in deep trouble.</p><p>He didn't even remember parking his car or locking it.</p><p>Ichiro dashed into the emergency room and ran to the desk.</p><p>\"My name is Ichiro Yoshida. My wife was just admitted.\"</p><p>The triage nurse looked at him oddly and then looked over toward the waiting room.</p><p>Ichiro looked around. Yori, Satoshi and Takumijo stood against the wall. They weren't even wearing disguises.</p><p>Yori nodded at the nurse. What the hell had happened when he left?</p><p>\"Your wife is in pretty bad shape, Mr. Yoshida. We need you to fill out some forms and we need to see your insurance card.\"</p><p>He didn't have time for all of this. His wife could be dying behind those double doors. \"What's wrong with her?\"</p><p>\"We don't know yet. She was brought in by those three gentlemen, and she hasn't regained consciousness yet. But we need your signature to perform tests.\"</p><p>Ichiro quickly scanned the medical documents while signing and initialing them. He pulled out his wallet and gave her his insurance card.</p><p>The nurse made a copy of the card and handed the original back to him.</p><p>\"Can I see my wife now?\"</p><p>\"Not yet,\" the nurse told him. \"You'll be able to see her as soon as the doctor finishes examining her. Please have a seat.\"</p><p>Takumijo walked over and led him away from the desk and to a seat. His heart pounded in his ears, and he couldn't concentrate. He'd nearly lost her once before. He couldn't keep doing this. \"Will someone please tell me what happened to my wife?\"</p><p>\"We don't really know,\" Takumijo said. \"We heard a loud noise upstairs right after you drove off. Satoshi and I ran upstairs and found her out cold on the floor. She had blood on her head and on her face.\"</p><p>Satoshi gasped. \"Blood?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, the interns think she might have bumped her head when she passed out. She wasn't breathing real well when we found her. We couldn't wait for an ambulance. Yori had just arrived, and he put her into his car and we jettisoned her as fast as we could.\"</p><p>Ichiro started to hyperventilate. He put his head down between his legs and wrapped his hands around his knees. He should have been there for her. Instead Yori had to step in and handle things.</p><p>A hand touched his shoulders. \"She's going to be okay.\" It was Yori.</p><p>Ichiro raised his head and stared at him. Concern showed in his eyes.</p><p>\"She's a fighter and too damn cynical to die.\"</p><p>Tears welled in Ichiro's eyes, but he refused to let them fall, to let Yori see that he was weak and couldn't handle this devastating situation. \"I can't lose her,\" Ichiro said. \"I don't think I can go on without her.\"</p><p>Yori raised an eyebrow but did not comment at first. \"The two of you had an argument?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded.</p><p>\"What about?\"</p><p>\"That YouTube video...the one with you and Shaundra dancing very intimately. I said some terrible, hurtful things to her that I never should have said.\"</p><p>Yori moved closer. \"I need to ask you something. You're a big guy. You didn't put your hands on her, did you? I mean, you didn't strike her, did you?\"</p><p>Ichiro moved away from him. \"No. What are you saying?</p><p>Shaundra is my wife.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I just needed to ask. Sometimes people do stuff in a fit of rage. Did she seem ill?\"</p><p>\"Well, she was in bed asleep when I barged into our bedroom like a lunatic. Her eyes were kind of red and she felt warm.\"</p><p>\"And you didn't ask her about her health?\"</p><p>\"Of course I did. But she backed away from me and told me not to touch her. She just sat back down on the bed, and I stormed out.\" His body shook with despair. \"If I hadn't been so angry, maybe I would have noticed that she just didn't look well.\"</p><p>\"You had no way of knowing, Ich.\"</p><p>\"I should not have screamed at her. The doctor back in the United States told me not to stress her out.\"</p><p>\"I can't imagine you getting angry enough to shout at her.</p><p>You must have really been upset about the video.\"</p><p>\"What do you think? I know you're still in love with her. I can see it in your eyes every time you see her.\"</p><p>\"It was just a dance, Ich, and I know how much she likes Silk. Granted it did get a bit heated between us, but she's a very sensuous woman. I just got caught up.\" He bowed.</p><p>\"Forgive me. I will never do something so forward again.\"</p><p>The double doors opened before Ichiro could reply. A doctor came out. \"Mr. Yoshida?\"</p><p>Ichiro hopped to his feet with the other three with him.</p><p>\"Your wife is awake.\"</p><p>\"Can I see her?\"</p><p>\"I would like to talk with you before you do.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" What did he want to talk about? Why couldn't he see Shaundra?</p><p>Yori and the others walked over. \"You go with the doctor,\"</p><p>Yori told him, being an adult. \"We'll check on our sister-in- law.\"</p><p>\"Don't upset her,\" the doctor told them.</p><p>Yori bowed. \"I understand.\"</p><p>\"My Yoshida,\" the doctor said, turning to Ichiro. \"When was the last day of your wife's menses? How many children have she given birth to? What is her current medical condition? Does she take any medications?\"</p><p>Ichiro looked back at his friends, who were trying hard not to listen. Yori walked toward the double doors, and Satoshi and Takumijo followed.</p><p>The doctor took him off to another room and questioned him for a long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cristal nervously paced the den floor. It was ten at night, and still there was no word from Satoshi or the other two.</p><p>Amaya sat on the sofa watching a drama, so unconcerned it was frightening.</p><p>Cristal's cell phone rang. \"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Cristal, its Yi-jun. Have you heard anything from the hospital yet?\"</p> <p>\"No, and I'm getting a bit nervous.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry; Satoshi is a pretty levelheaded fellow when he needs to be. I'm sure he'll call when he finds anything out.\"</p><p>\"Well, thank you for calling. I need to clear the line in case he or the hospital calls. I promise to call you as soon as I find anything out.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he said, and he hung up.</p><p>\"You guys are worried about nothing,\" Amaya said. \"She'd just hopped up on Valium. She'll be okay once they get it out of her system.\"</p> <p>\"Shaundra is not hopped up on Valium. I personally saw her flush that bottle of stuff down the toilet when she made it here without using it. The hypnotist cured her. Why do you want to make her out to be some kind of junkie?\"</p><p>\"Why do all of you want to make her out to be some type of princess, when in fact she's just an old woman living in a fantasy world?\"</p><p>Cristal walked over to her and snatched Amaya up off the sofa. \"Listen. I don't know who you think you are, but you have no right to talk that way about her. I've only known her for a short time, but Shaundra is kind and sweet and a very intelligent woman. Did you know she singlehandedly raised four children after her first husband died? Or that she volunteered at her church and at nursing homes before she moved here] Or that she gives part of the proceeds from her book to the Cancer Society?\"</p><p>Amaya shook her head.</p><p>\"Just because she's not Japanese that doesn't mean you're better than she is. Sure, she's had a rough life and she's older than we are, but that doesn't mean her life has to stop just because her kids are grown. It's time for her to enjoy her life.</p><p>I figure the Lord sent her Ichiro at the right moment. So why don't you lay off of her.\" Cristal released her, and Amaya flew back over to her seat.</p> <p>\"What part of 'she was belly bumping with my husband' don't you guys understand?\"</p><p>\"He wouldn't be your husband if it wasn't for her. She stepped aside when she found out that you two were engaged and let you have Yori. Had she chosen him, he would have dropped your self-righteous selfish ass and married Shaundra. And honey, for the record, if she wanted to screw your husband she'd have been smart enough not to dance with him in public. It was just a dance, and you and all the others need to get over it. So before you jump down on her, you'd better check your husband first. He asked her to dance and not the other way around.\"</p><p>The front door opened and closed.</p><p>Hello, is anyone home?\" It was Masaaki.</p><p>\"We're in the den, Masaaki.\"</p><p>Masaaki entered the den accompanied by a white man about forty years old. \"Where is everyone, and why is Takumijo's car parked all willy-nilly in front of the house?\"</p><p>\"They're at the hospital,\" Cristal blurted out. \"Satoshi found Shaundra unconscious on the floor of her room.\"</p><p>\"Shit,\" the good-looking man said.</p> <p>\"Excuse me, Cristal Gentry, this is your other boss, Harper Kehoe from the United States. Harper, this is Cristal Gentry, Aomori's publicist.\"</p><p>Harper bowed. \"Nice to meet you.\" He turned on his heels.</p><p>\"Come on, Masaaki. I have to get to Shaundra.\"</p><p>She looked so tiny and helpless lying there in the big hospital bed. Satoshi pushed a reddish-brown curl away from the bandage on her forehead. Shaundra had awakened only briefly and then drifted back off to sleep.</p><p>\"Stop torturing yourself,\" Takumijo told him. \"You got to her as quickly as you could.\"</p><p>\"No I didn't. I should have gone up and checked on her when she didn't come down to lunch. I promised myself that I'd look out for her.\"</p><p>\"That's Ich's job,\" Takumijo said bluntly. You have to let it go.\"</p><p>\"It's not as easy as you think,\" Yori said from his position leaning against a wall. \"Once you talk to her and she slips into your heart, it's hard to let go. I should know because I've been struggling with this for months.\"</p><p>\"And failing miserably,\" Satoshi replied. \"What possessed you to ask her to dance?\"</p><p>Yori sighed. \"It was her favorite song. No other reason. I seized the moment.\"</p><p>\"And probably screwed up four lives. You've also angered your fans again. Did you happen to read the latest posts? A lot of them want you to explain your actions.\"</p><p>\"To hell with them,\" Yori said. \"I'm a grown man and I don't answer to kids.\"</p><p>\"Those so-called kids buy our records and pay to see us perform in concert,\" Takumijo told him. \"Remember that.\"</p><p>\"Would you be so understanding if they decided to dig into your private life?\"</p><p>Takumijo didn't answer.</p><p>\"I guess not. We all have our little secrets.\"</p><p>Ichiro entered the room looking a little lost. Satoshi relinquished his spot next to Shaundra for him and walked around to the other side of the bed. Ichiro walked up the bed, grasped Shaundra's hand and looked down at his unconscious wife.</p><p>\"She opened her eyes for a couple of seconds,\" Satoshi said. \"But then she closed them again.\"</p><p>\"The doctor said she might do that for a couple of days,\"</p><p>Ichiro said.</p><p>\"What's wrong with her?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"They really don't know. All they do know is that her blood pressure was high when they tested it. They're going to run some other tests, but we might not know the results for a couple of weeks.\"</p><p>\"We'll be in China by then,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>The look in Ichiro's eyes said he might not make the tour, which worried Satoshi because they had signed contracts for four singers, not a trio. And who would sing Ichiro's solo?</p><p>They were behind schedule as it was, and they'd have to get back to rehearsing soon if they wanted to be ready in time for the concerts.</p><p>Shaundra stirred on the bed.</p><p>Ichiro stroked her hand, and Satoshi took her other hand in his. Ichiro looked over at him, and then Satoshi reluctantly released it.</p><p>\"Shaundra, it's me, Ichiro. Can you hear me?\"</p><p>Shaundra's eyelids slid back, revealing brown eyes, a little bloodshot but still beautiful. She didn't answer but stayed focused on Ichiro.</p><p>\"I'm so sorry for what I said to you earlier. If I could take it back I would.\"</p><p>Still no comment.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes moved from Ichiro to Satoshi. She smiled at him and then drifted off again.</p><p>Satoshi's heart fluttered in his chest.</p><p>Ichiro looked at him oddly but didn't say anything. His body looked so rigid, as if it was about to break.</p><p>\"I think I'd better call Cristal to let her know how things are going,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Yes, maybe you should,\" Ichiro replied, still staring at him.</p><p>Satoshi moved away from the bed and stepped out of the room, well aware that Ichiro's blue eyes followed him all the way out of the door. Why did she smile at me? Could it be she remembered the kiss? Satoshi pulled out his phone. The reception wasn't very good, so he stepped outside the hospital.</p><p>\"Hello, Satoshi.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked up. \"Harper? What are you doing here?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Masaaki walked up. \"He's here for the same reason you are. How is Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"She came to a few minutes ago, but she dosed off again.\"</p><p>Harper looked good, had lost a pound or two, but everything else was solid muscle. He was dressed expensively as usual in a tailored suit, accessorized from tie clip to cuff links. Maybe if he hadn't insisted that Shaundra accompany him last year to Japan for a promotion, he'd be married to her and not Ichiro.</p><p>Everyone knew that he loved her too. What was it about Shaundra that drew men to her like flies and made them fall in love with her?</p> <p>\"What happened?\" Harper asked, eyeing him coolly.</p><p>\"I found her lying unconscious on the floor in his room. I got concerned after I hadn't seen her all day. Normally she comes down for lunch to get a break from writing, but I hadn't seen her since yesterday.\"</p><p>\"I bet her pressure shot up again,\" Harper replied. \"If I told her once, I've told her a million times to make sure she takes her medicine, drink plenty of water and stay away from stressful situations.\"</p><p>Satoshi frowned. Harper seemed to know a lot about Shaundra and her condition.</p><p>\"She nearly scared the heck out of me the first time she blacked out at work. Her pressure spiked up to two hundred.\"</p> <p>\"How long has she had this condition?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Since she was a teen. It's hereditary. Her mother and her sister have it, and I think her brother does too.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra has a sister?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>Harper nodded. \"A younger sister named Deirdre.\"</p><p>Satoshi tried to pronounce the strange-sounding American name in his mind.</p><p>\"I wonder if she ate too much salt.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think so,\" Satoshi said, pushing his cell phone back into his pocket. \"Ichiro prepares her meals and he refuses to cook with salt, so we're on a salt-free diet too.\"</p><p>\"Then she's getting it some other way. Fast food, sodas, foods from cans.\"</p><p>She did drink soda at the club, but only one. He couldn't be sure of that though.</p><p>\"Or something or someone stressed her out. Has she been particularly aggravated lately?\"</p><p>\"Define aggravated. She lives in a house with these guys,\"</p><p>Masaaki said. \"I'm lucky I haven't had a stroke yet.\"</p><p>Satoshi sneered at his manager.</p><p>\"She's married to Ichiro,\" Satoshi replied.</p> <p>Masaaki smirked this time. \"No I don't think that's the cause. She got into a bit of a row the other night with Yori's wife.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"The two of them have never gotten along, and then they got into a fight in a club the other night. Apparently Amaya caught Shaundra dancing with Yori and she slapped her.\"</p><p>\"What, just for dancing with Yori? What were they dancing to?\"</p><p>\"'Freak Me Baby,' by Silk,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" Harper said giddily, as if he was envisioning dancing with Shaundra to that song. \"Oh,\" he groaned.</p><p>\"That's one provocative song. But that's still no excuse to slap her. I've danced with Shaundra before and nothing like this ever happened.\"</p><p>Masaaki cleared his throat. \"It was more than just a slap.</p><p>Apparently there was some hitting and pulling of hair.\"</p><p>\"Don't sugarcoat it, Masaaki. Shaundra beat the hell out of Amaya, and then Yori tried to stop them. They were brawling like professionals.\"</p><p>Harper raised an eyebrow. \"You mean to tell me she was fighting a young woman in a club? Where were you guys and where was your security when all of this happened?\" Harper asked. \"I thought they couldn't go to such places without security.\"</p><p>\"Oh, they were there,\" Masaaki replied. \"Cheering the women on. I reprimanded them, but technically they're only supposed to protect Aomori.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra is Ichiro's goddamn wife. She needs protection too, or have you forgotten about her fans? You should see her fan page. Some of them are still riled up that she married Ichiro.\" He turned to Satoshi. \"Where the hell were you?\"</p><p>Satoshi lowered his head in shame. \"Watching,\" he answered.</p><p>Harper glared at him. \"I knew something like this would happen if she married Ichiro,\" he said as he paced the pavement outside the hospital. People walked by, stared and went into the hospital or to their cars. \"I trusted you guys to look after her. God, she's fifty. Why didn't she listen to me when I told her not to marry him? A pretty face and a stiff you-know-what are not reasons to leave her family and her country.\"</p><p>Masaaki bowed in embarrassment. \"It is my fault. I should have looked after her better. She and Ichiro were supposed to have the farmhouse to themselves when they came home, but we were in Korea and hadn't made arrangements for the guys to move out, and then Yori couldn't take Amaya's parents interfering in his marriage so he came back to the farmhouse too.\"</p><p>\"You mean they are all living together? No wonder she's stressed out. Shaundra is used to an empty nest.</p><p>Togetherness might be fine for Aomori because they have lived together since they were kids. But you can't put two dominant females in the same house. There is bound to be trouble.\"</p><p>\"Three,\" Satoshi corrected. \"Our publicist stays there too.\"</p><p>\"Miss Gentry?\" Harper asked.</p><p>Masaaki and Satoshi nodded.</p><p>\"Her father is a good friend of Mr. Niigata, and he asked Mr. Niigata to look after her when he returned to the United States,\" Masaaki explained.</p><p>\"Just great,\" Harper said as he walked away from them and entered the hospital.</p><p>\"He's awfully upset about an employee,\" Masaaki said, straightening his glasses on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Yes, you would think she's his wife or something.\"</p><p>Cristal called Yi-jun and updated him on Shaundra's condition after she received Satoshi's telephone call. Yi-jun had made it back to Korea and had a couple of guest appearances scheduled, and then he would be leaving for China in a week. Aomori too was scheduled to leave around that time. The commercials were airing, the tickets were sold out and no one knew if Ichiro was going to participate or not now that his wife was ill. So far no one had told her to cancel anything. If Aomori backed out of this, they would take a big financial hit. Advertising and publicity wasn't cheap, and Mr.</p><p>Niigata didn't except failure.</p><p>Amaya had gone up to her room.</p><p>Cristal had ordered pizza for dinner since Ichiro wasn't there to cook, but Amaya wouldn't touch it. She just grabbed a can of some nutritional drink from the refrigerator and went upstairs without saying a word. Selfish twit.</p><p>Cristal didn't mind getting the silent treatment from her.</p><p>Everything that came out of Amaya's mouth was hurtful anyway. And she didn't know how long she could bear being under the same roof with someone like her. Maybe it was time for her to get her own apartment again. Mr. Niigata's offer was nice, but she needed her own space. She missed her independence and her freedom, and she was tired of being grounded. Tomorrow she'd go out and start looking.</p><p>Anyway, sharing a house with so many adults was no way for Shaundra and Ichiro to begin married life.</p><p>Cristal thought about her own problems as she soaked in a bath later, after going up to her room. She was still as confused as ever when it came to her feelings for Yi-jun and Satoshi. Both men had so much to offer. With Yi-jun there would be exotic trips, great sex and moonlight carriage rides.</p><p>He'd keep her in the lap of luxury, buy her the best clothes and smother her in jewelry.</p><p>Satoshi, on the other hand, would keep her smiling, fill her days with companionship, serenade her with beautiful love songs and always treat her as an equal. Like Yi-jun, she'd probably have to share him with thousands of adoring fans, but when it came to getting intimate with Satoshi, she had the feeling that behind that standoffish personality was a man with deep, raw emotions. The woman he'd finally dropped his guard for would be one very lucky lady and the recipient of his passion.</p><p>Cristal splashed her hand in the water. Either way, her life would definitely change. But just as Shaundra had tried to teach her, material possessions and sex did not make or keep a relationship. If a man wouldn't risk his life walking through a pit of fire to save her, then he wasn't the right man for her.</p><p>Cristal got out of the tub, dried off and slipped into her nightgown. She glanced over at the clock. Ten p.m. She heard a couple of cars pull up outside, then walked over to her window and looked out. Everyone had returned except Ichiro. She donned her robe, pushed her feet into her slippers, and went down to greet them and to find out more about Shaundra's condition.</p><p>The guys looked tired, worn out and worried. Harper Kehoe hadn't returned with them, so Masaaki must have dropped him at a hotel after leaving the hospital.</p><p>Satoshi grabbed her and pulled her to him. He hugged her tightly.</p><p>\"How is she?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"She's finally conscious but she's not talking. Ichiro is still there with her.\"</p><p>\"Do they know what happened?\"</p><p>\"The doctor thinks she just collapsed from too much stress, but they're running some tests.\" He released her and she missed his warmth.</p><p>\"She's not speaking?\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"No, but she's alert and probably can hear the conversation. The doctor said sometimes a body will shut itself down if too much stress is put upon it.\"</p><p>\"I better go check on my wife,\" Yori said. He bowed and walked out of the room.</p><p>Masaaki and Takumijo followed soon afterwards, leaving the two of them alone.</p><p>\"Amaya seems to think Shaundra overdosed,\" Cristal told him once she was sure that Yori was out of ear range.</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"Her stomach content was empty,\"</p><p>Satoshi replied. \"I found that much out by sneaking a look at her chart.\"</p><p>Cristal walked up the stairs, and Satoshi followed her into the house and locked the door. They headed toward the den to continue their talk. She sat down on the sofa, and he sat next to her.</p><p>\"Poor Ich must be beside himself.\" She put her head down on Satoshi's shoulder.</p><p>\"Believe it or not, he's taking it surprisingly well. Harper seems more upset than Ichiro. He kept fussing at us for not taking good care of her.\"</p><p>\"But that's ridiculous,\" Cristal said. \"You guys see to our every need.\"</p><p>\"Harper is just upset. He is still very attached to Shaundra.</p><p>I think he has delusions of her leaving Ichiro and that she will turn to him for comfort.\"</p><p>\"Do you?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Do I what?\"</p><p>\"Do you think Shaundra will leave Ich and go to Harper?\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged. \"Shaundra loves Ich very much. And as far as I know this is the first argument they've had. But whether they will stay together is anyone's guess.\"</p><p>\"It's a shame this had to happen so close to the tour.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"We're already behind with rehearsal, but we're starting tomorrow with or without Ichiro.\"</p><p>Cristal raised her head. \"You don't think he'll make it to China?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. I think it depends on Shaundra's health.</p><p>Ichiro wanted her to accompany him on the tour. That's why she had herself hypnotized - so she would be able to go.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he should hire a nurse to look after her until Shaundra is ready to travel. Or have one of her daughters fly here to be with her.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro would never agree to a nurse even though it is the best answer. Shaundra's eldest daughter is married and has a set of twins, and her youngest is in her senior year in college.</p><p>Neither may be able to just drop what they're doing and fly over here even though they want to.\"</p><p>Cristal rose. \"I believe things have a way of working themselves out.\" She yawned. \"But I'm exhausted. I think I'm going to bed, and you should too.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked up at her. \"You're dressed for bed already.</p><p>Do you want me to tuck you in?\"</p><p>Cristal smiled at him. \"If only you were serious about that.\" She bowed and left him in the den. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Practice for the tour began bright and early the next morning, and as everyone expected, Ichiro was a no-show.</p><p>Shaundra's condition was improving, and the doctors expected to discharge her later today. Still she hadn't spoken a word, even though preliminary tests didn't show any brain damage and both a stroke and a heart attack had been eliminated. The medication given to her had lowered her blood pressure back down to normal. Ichiro had come home briefly to shower and change, but other than that he kept a vigil at his wife's side.</p><p>Masaaki had arranged rehearsal at the Tokyo Dome since its stage was comparable to the one they'd be performing on in China. Mr. Niigata had called this morning to check on Shaundra and to tell them that tickets were selling fast and for Aomori to try to stay out of trouble and scandal. He and Mrs. Niigata were still having the time of their lives touring China and meeting with dignitaries.</p><p>John Sampson, their music arranger, had prepared all the new songs Ichiro had written and had hired a mini-orchestra to accompany them. Aomori's costumes had arrived and needed to be tried on tomorrow, and York kept his fingers crossed that everything would go off without a hitch. \"Okay, let's get this show on the road,\" he told everyone.</p> <p>Takumijo ended his telephone conversation, and Satoshi left John's side and walked to his mark on the stage. They left Ichiro's mark open next to Satoshi, and it was obvious that Satoshi missed looking over at him, since they had been lining up the same way since they were kids.</p><p>\"This is going to get a bit awkward,\" Satoshi said. \"Who is going to sing Ichiro's part?\"</p><p>\"We'll stick Kenshin in if we have to,\" Yori answered.</p><p>Kenshin looked up from the book he was reading while sitting in the front row.</p><p>\"You heard me right. You still know how to sing, don't you?\"</p> <p>Kenshin had once been a part of another boy band managed by Mr. Niigata, but he didn't like the hustle and bustle of touring. Mr. Niigata assigned him the duty of Aomori's driver after that since he was still under contract.</p><p>\"I think so, but I might be a bit rusty.\"</p><p>\"We're not asking you to come out of your self-imposed retirement, just come up and stand on Ichiro's mark so Satoshi won't feel so lonely. I know you know the steps and the songs.\" Kenshin always joined them for rehearsal whenever he wasn't busy chauffeuring Masaaki around.</p><p>Kenshin put down his book and walked over to the stage and climbed up the stairs. He was about the same height and build as the rest of Aomori, but he wore his hair shorter because of his chauffeur's position.</p><p>The practice began. Kenshin missed a couple of steps, but it was hardly noticeable. And if push came to shove and Ichiro could not make the tour, Kenshin would be able to fill in. His voice wasn't as unique as Ichiro's, but he still could carry a tune. Halfway through the routine, he had to get out of his uniform jacket because Takumijo's dance routines had him sweating like a horse.</p><p>\"I see why you guys are so skinny. These dances shake the fat off of you.\"</p> <p>Takumijo chuckled. \"You can stand to lose a pound or two.</p><p>Sitting in a car all day and eating junk food have made you lazy. From now on when Aomori trains or goes to the gym, you're going with us.\"</p><p>\"Aw, why?\" Kenshin whined.</p><p>\"Because women love slender men.\"</p><p>Yori and Satoshi nodded.</p><p>Kenshin protested. \"But I have a girlfriend.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't matter. You want to keep her, don't you?\"</p><p>Kenshin nodded his head briskly.</p> <p>\"Then she'll just love you with tighter abs.\" He raised his shirt and showed his stomach to Kenshin.</p><p>Both men and women in the orchestra pit whistled.</p><p>Yori glanced away. Takumijo had a spectacular body, toned and defined, while his and Satoshi's frames were slender and svelte like... Don't think it. Maybe he should work out a little more at the gym. It was bad enough he thought he looked like a girl.</p><p>The practice resumed. Hours passed without a word from Ichiro. Mr. Niigata called again to check on Shaundra and to tell them that Aomori's paraphernalia were flying off the shelves.</p><p>Besides the concerts, Cristal and Masaaki had booked them on talk shows, which Yori hated because his Mandarin was horrible and so was the rest of Aomori's, except for Ichiro who adapted easily to foreign languages. His English was also improving, thanks to his coming out of his shell talking to Shaundra. He still clammed up around strangers, but not as much as he used to. Yori wondered how he managed to open those restaurants and to host all those business meetings without talking. Yori frowned. Lucky little fairy. Shaundra had taken Ichiro's virginity, and from what Takumijo had told him, she was insatiable and tiring poor Ichiro out. That part was both funny and enticing. Maybe he'd volunteer himself as a surrogate lover once or twice a week if Ichiro needed a backup.</p><p>Ichiro's solo came up next. Kenshin began slowly at first, and then he got into it. Yori noticed that Kenshin had an amazing voice and could hit quite a few high notes. It was a shame he'd given up singing. Maybe he could talk Mr. Niigata into adding Kenshin as a soloist to open for them on their other tours. It was a pity to let all that talent go to waste.</p><p>After practice Masaaki treated the group to dinner at Ichiro's restaurant.</p><p>\"I've always wanted to see the place,\" Satoshi said, eyeing the pretty young waitress who greeted them at the door.</p><p>Ichiro's brother Daichi, who managed the restaurant, came out of his office to greet them. It had been some time since Yori saw Daichi. He was shorter than Ichiro, but older, and he bared a striking resemblance around the eyes, though Daichi's were brown and not blue.</p><p>\"I have reserved a private room in the back for you,\" he told them.</p><p>Satoshi kept looking at one of the waitresses. It did not go unnoticed by Daichi. He waved the young woman over. She had long black hair which she wore in a ponytail. And she wore a traditional white kimono.</p><p>\"Etsuko, you remember Ichiro's friends, Satoshi, Yori and Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"Etsuko?' Satoshi asked. Etsuko was Ichiro's baby sister.</p><p>The young woman nodded. She had grown into quite a beauty. She bowed and blushed. Yes, definitely Ichiro's sister Daichi pointed to the hostess. \"And that's Hana.\"</p><p>Ichiro's other sister. Damn, both had turned into beautiful young women. Yori tore his eyes off them, bowed and followed Etsuko to the private room. The restaurant was packed even for early evening, and the place had a warm, friendly atmosphere. Meats roasted on open spits; chefs prepared meals directly at some tables, and traditional Japanese music serenaded the diners through hidden speakers.</p><p>\"This place is nice,\" Takumijo said as he got comfortable on the floor with the others.</p><p>Satoshi pointed to a picture of Ichiro and his family on the wall. It looked current, but Shaundra was missing. Hadn't the little idiot introduced his wife to his family yet? No, he supposed not, since they just got back to Japan and Ichiro and Shaundra were married in the United States.</p><p>Yori wondered what they would make of her. She was far from the common Japanese sister-in-law, and he couldn't image her being docile and walking several steps behind Ichiro. She was sure to set some tongues wagging at family gatherings, but if they could deal with Ichiro and his many quirks, then they could certainly deal with having a hot African-American writer in the family.</p><p>Daichi kept the food and the sake coming, and everyone except Kenshin was pretty much drunk by the time the meal had ended. Yori's head throbbed. He hadn't drunk sake in a long time for obvious reasons. One, it made him foolish, and two, it made him randy. If he just kept his mouth shut, he wouldn't say anything that popped into his head. Amaya, he mused, could take care of the other problem.</p><p>She barely spoke to him when he returned from the hospital. He couldn't say he much blamed her, since he literally left her on the doorstep and went charging off with Shaundra in his arms like a prince rescuing his damsel in distress. On some level he understood what Amaya was going through. But in reality Shaundra still claimed a big part of his heart. It was something Amaya would just have to deal with it. Hopefully she would forget all that tonight and be a loving wife.</p><p>\"Ichiro's really got a sweet place here,\" Satoshi replied with a slur. \"And two very beautiful sisters.\"</p><p>Masaaki chuckled drunkenly. \"Be nice to him and he might let you date one of them.\" He hiccupped. \"Then maybe you'll stop macking on his wife.\"</p><p>Takumijo keeled over with laugher. \"No, you didn't go there, Masaaki. Where did you learn that from?\"</p><p>\"You guys think you're the only ones who are cool? I get around.\"</p><p>Everyone laughed except Satoshi. \"That's not the least bit funny, and it's untrue. I don't mack on her. We're friends, and I don't want you guys to sleaze it up.\"</p><p>Even Kenshin laughed this time. \"We're not sleazing it up.</p><p>I keep telling you that she's hot for Ichiro. When they're in the limousine they steam up all the windows and she just has her way with him.\" He continued to chuckle. \"But I like and respect her, and I hope she gets better.\"</p><p>They raised their cups in a toast.</p><p>\"To Shaundra,\" Masaaki said. \"Speedy recovery.\"</p><p>Yori swallowed the sake down. She'd never steamed up any windows with him. He smirked. Even though they did heat up a massage parlor once. The more he thought about her, the more his body encouraged him to get home to Amaya, hopefully before any of the guys noticed.</p><p>Unfortunately Satoshi did.</p><p>\"At least you have a wife to go home to.\"</p><p>Yori blushed, and Satoshi chuckled at his discomfort.</p><p>\"There's always Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I know. But I'm not the total sleaze everyone thinks I am. If I can't have the real thing, I won't make Cristal her sloppy substitute.\"</p><p>Kenshin managed to get them into the limousine after Masaaki settled the bill and drove them back to Osaka.</p><p>The farmhouse was completely empty when Ichiro brought Shaundra home the next day. Aomori had driven back to Tokyo to practice, Cristal had gone into the KiNii office to finalize some of her public relations work and to visit with Harper Kehoe, and Amaya thankfully was off visiting her parents.</p><p>Ichiro carried her things into the house first and left her in the car until he could come back and get her. He'd brought her one of her button-up dresses and clean underwear to the hospital to change into, as he knew she wouldn't be caught dead coming home in a hospital gown. She managed to pull her shoulder-length hair into a ponytail to keep it from rubbing against the small bandage on her forehead.</p><p>\"Are you feeling well enough to take a walk with me?\" he asked.</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>Ichiro took her hand and led her around the side of the farmhouse to the garden area. Spring had arrived, and the garden was awash in color.</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"Cherry blossoms.\"</p><p>They were the first words she had spoken to him in a couple of days.</p><p>\"You told me once that you would like to see the trees in bloom.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"They're beautiful.\"</p><p>He caught the sadness in her voice. \"I'm sorry, baby,\" he said, coming up behind her and wrapping his arms around her.</p><p>Shaundra shuddered.</p><p>Oh God, she's depressed. It didn't take a doctor's diagnosis to tell him this. He'd never seen her so sad before.</p><p>\"Please forgive me for being jealous and acting like a bitch.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved out of his arms and walked over and sat down on a bench beneath the trees. Tiny cherry blossoms fell out of the trees and floated down around her and into her hair.</p><p>Ichiro took out his cell phone, turned on the video and recorded the sight. She looked so lovely he had to capture it.</p><p>He turned the video off and sat down next to her on the bench. \"I don't know what I have to do to make this right.</p><p>Maybe we can go away somewhere together after the China tour ends. Or move back to the United States. Maybe I was wrong to ask you to leave your home and family and follow me. Just tell me what you want me to do.\"</p><p>Shaundra put her hand on top of his and patted it. \"It's not you, Ich, it's me.\"</p><p>Ichiro groaned. The words no man wanted to hear. It was like the kiss of death to a relationship. Shaundra could not mean they were over. He knew he'd messed up, but not this bad.</p><p>Shaundra yawned.</p><p>\"Maybe I need to take you in.\"</p><p>She smiled weakly at him and rose.</p><p>Ichiro rose and led her back to the porch, swept her into his arms and carried her over the threshold like he should have the first time they came to the farmhouse as man and wife.</p><p>He carried her up to their bedroom, undressed her and helped her into bed. He put on one of her favorite CDs by Silk, chose a song, \"Freak Me Baby,\" and began to strip while she watched. He climbed into bed after the song ended and another song played. He had to snap her out of her funk the only way he knew how. \"I love you, Shaundra,\" he said, taking her into his arms and kissing her tenderly. \"Don't give up on us yet.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked deeply into his eyes and then stared at his naked chest, shuddered, and finally turned her back to him and cried herself to sleep.</p><p>Masaaki hired someone to sit with Shaundra the next day so Ichiro could go to practice, even though Ichiro didn't like it.</p><p>He didn't want to leave her with some stranger, but he needed to practice and at least get out of the house to think after yesterday's little fiasco. She'd never turned down sex with him before, and he didn't know how to deal with it. As much as she drained him, he actually missed those private times.</p><p>Takumijo's new dance routine left him winded, and Kenshin teased him about being an old man, which got to him since he was younger than all of them. He hadn't slept well for a while and needed to get back in shape if he expected to make it through the tour. He would have to go back to the gym and get plenty of sleep, which shouldn't be hard since his wife didn't want to be bothered with him at the moment.</p><p>At the end of the rehearsal he was so tired he just sank down and lay flat on his back on the stage.</p><p>Yori and Takumijo were polite enough not to bother him, but Satoshi couldn't resist.</p><p>\"What's the hell's the matter with you? You barely kept up!\"</p><p>\"Tired.\" Ichiro sat up.</p><p>Satoshi sat down next to him and began stroking his hair.</p><p>\"I didn't realize that Shaundra was feeling that well again.\"</p><p>\"She's not. I guess I just need to get a good night's sleep and hit the gym.\" He was too tired to slap Satoshi's hand away.</p><p>\"My surrogacy offer is still out there.\" He stopped stroking.</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"Go on and joke. I'm too tired to kick your ass.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose and offered him a hand. \"We'll go for a run this afternoon like we used to do.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"That sounds doable.\" Satoshi was thin but he could sprint. Maybe he had his own demons to get rid of.</p><p>Satoshi brushed the hair out of Ichiro's eyes. \"Why weren't you born a girl? Life would be so much easier.\"</p><p>Okay, Satoshi was back to his old self again.</p><p>\"Why weren't you?\" Ichiro asked. \"Then I would have lost my virginity a long time ago.\"</p><p>\"Okay, ladies, let's get out of here,\" Takumijo said. \"You two can continue mating when we get home.\"</p><p>\"Bite me,\" Satoshi told Takumijo. \"You're just jealous.\"</p><p>Takumijo feinted hurt. Everyone laughed, even Yori. They hadn't had this type of fun in a long time, and it felt good.</p><p>Maybe it was time to put past mistakes behind them. After all, they weren't kids anymore.</p><p>\"You guys want to get something to eat before we go home?\" Kenshin asked as they walked outside the Tokyo Dome.</p><p>Everyone looked at Ichiro. \"I have steaks thawing for dinner, but if you guys want fast food...\"</p><p>\"No,\" everyone said in unison.</p><p>\"Are you going to fix those little potatoes?\" Takumijo asked. \"The kind with the little pearl onions and chives?\"</p><p>\"Only for you, Takumijo,\" Ichiro told him, patting his cheek with his hand and then sliding into the limousine. The others followed them in. Masaaki sat in the front seat with Kenshin.</p><p>\"And Kimchi Bi Bim Pap?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>Ichiro nodded. He turned to Yori, lifted his eyes to him and waited.</p><p>\"Seafood gumbo,\" he replied. \"Louisiana style.\"</p><p>\"I think I can handle that for a friend. I think I can even scrounge up some Louisiana hot sauce and season it just the way you like it.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. \"The hotter the better.\"</p><p>It was the second decent thing he had done for him this week. The first was rushing the woman they loved to the hospital.</p><p>\"Hmm,\" Satoshi said. \"Maybe I should forego my date with Ichiro this evening and let Yori have him.\"</p><p>Yori stared into Ichiro's eyes. Ichiro knew that look.</p><p>\"Tempting,\" Yori said and nothing else.</p><p>Ichiro blushed. These guys were too much. He pulled out a fan and opened and fanned it in front of his face.</p><p>\"Look, he's blushing,\" Takumijo said. \"Now that's the Ich we all know and love.\"</p><p>\"Bite me,\" Ichiro told Takumijo.</p><p>Takumijo moved to the edge of his seat.</p><p>Ichiro gulped. Wrong member to tease.</p><p>\"If I thought you were serious I'd be all over you. I have a thing for big blue eyes.\"</p><p>Yori and Satoshi laughed at his discomfort.</p><p>Masaaki laughed from the front seat. \"Ichiro, it is not nice to tease a tiger. Sometimes they do bite.\"</p><p>Takumijo continued to gaze into his eyes, and then he ran his tongue over his bottom lip.</p><p>Ichiro melted into his seat. Shit.</p><p>\"Ooh, something smells good,\" Cristal said, entering the kitchen later that evening when she came home from work.</p><p>Ichiro was busy at the stove stirring something in a big pot. \"Gumbo,\" he replied. \"For Yori.\"</p><p>\"I haven't had gumbo since I was a child.\"</p><p>\"It's Shaundra's mother's recipe.\"</p><p>\"How long before dinner?\" She looked at her watch.</p><p>\"About an hour,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>This had to be the longest conversation she'd ever had with him.</p><p>\"I'm waiting on the steaks.\"</p><p>\"Do you need any help?\"</p><p>Ichiro stopped stirring. \"Can you cook?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"Why does that surprise you?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. You pal around with Satoshi and Takumijo.</p><p>That equates to not domestic.\"</p><p>Crystal chuckled. \"You're gorgeous and you have a sense of humor.\"</p><p>Ichiro blushed at the complement. \"Thank you. Would you like to fix the salad?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded.</p><p>\"The vegetables are already washed and sitting in a colander in the refrigerator.\"</p><p>Cristal bowed, continued into the kitchen and went to work on the salad. An hour passed quickly as she advanced up to dessert fixing and wine chilling.</p><p>Ichiro was an excellent teacher and quite amusing, even though she could see in his eyes that he was tired.</p><p>\"What is this?' Satoshi asked as he stepped inside the kitchen.</p><p>\"What does it look like?' Cristal asked, retrieving a beer from the refrigerator, screwing the top off and handing it to Satoshi.</p><p>\"It looks like you're cooking.\"</p><p>\"She's very good at it,\" Ichiro said as he removed the potatoes from the oven.</p><p>\"You've been living here how long, and I've never seen you cook?\"</p><p>Cristal shrugged. \"That's because all you and Tak eat is pizza and takeout food.</p><p>\"Gross,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>Satoshi saluted her with his beer. \"I like the apron; it makes you look like a little housewife.\" He touched the material. \"I think I like this look and your giving me cold beer when I come home from work. Makes me feel all warm and tingly inside.\"</p><p>\"You are so full of it, Satoshi,\" Cristal told him.</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"Yes, he is.\" Some of his hair fell in front of his eyes. Ichiro took off his gloves and removed the band.</p><p>The hair cascaded down his back and face. He pulled it back again and secured it in a band, and then he washed his hands.</p><p>Satoshi's eyes lit up and zoned in on Ichiro's hair.</p><p>\"Kinky,\" Cristal said.</p><p>Satoshi drew his eyes away from Ich and put them back on her.</p><p>\"Takumijo told me about that, but I didn't believe him.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" Satoshi asked, taking another swig of his beer.</p><p>\"Your fascination with Ichiro's hair.\"</p><p>Ichiro turned around and stared at Satoshi. \"Gross.\"</p><p>\"I like to fondle it too,\" Satoshi told her.</p><p>Cristal took the beer from Satoshi and sipped it. \"Let me know when the two of you get together. I wouldn't mind being the cream in the center of that cookie.\" She handed him back the beer and walked away from him.</p><p>\"You are one sick puppy,\" Ichiro told Satoshi. \"Now you're getting Cristal all hot and bothered and freaky. Don't you think I have enough hot mamas in this house after me?</p><p>You're bad enough, and now Yori and Takumijo are looking at me like I'm delicious.\"</p><p>Cristal nearly screamed with laughter as she washed her hands. \"You guys are a riot.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The doctor will see you now,\" a nurse told Shaundra a couple of days later, after she'd gotten home from the hospital. Shaundra hadn't told Ichiro about the visit because she didn't want to worry him so close to the tour. She still could not bear to touch him since he'd all but called her a whore, even though he'd apologized a million times.</p><p>Apologizing did not take away the fact that he'd said it and hurt her feelings. She supposed he was embarrassed having a wife who was an erotic author, who dabbled in novels and manga about homosexual men. From what she'd noticed for a while, he didn't seem to be sexually attracted to her, always leaving the bed after sex and not wanting to cuddle afterwards. She sighed as she rose from the chair. She knew it was too good to last.</p><p>Shaundra had a lot of time on her hands lately to think things out. Maybe Harper and everyone was right...she was too old for Ichiro. He was young and vibrant and needed that type of wife to help him with his career. Maybe on some level he knew that too, and that was the reason he hadn't registered their marriage as soon as they arrived in Japan and made her a part of his family.</p><p>The nurse made her climb onto a scale. \"A hundred and fifty pounds.\"</p> <p>\"There must be some kind of mistake,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"I've been a hundred and thirty-five pounds forever.\"</p><p>The nurse messed with the scale again. \"Well, you're a hundred and fifty pounds now. Maybe you've gained a few pounds with all that good food your husband prepares at his restaurant.\"</p><p>Shaundra sneered at the nurse. Did everyone in Japan know who she was and about her life?</p><p>\"Follow me.\" The nurse led Shaundra into an examination room. \"I need to get your vitals...your blood pressure and temperature.\"</p> <p>Shaundra sat down in a chair, and the nurse put a thermometer under her tongue and then wrapped a pressure cup around her right arm. The machine came on, squeezing her bicep for a couple of minutes before releasing it.</p><p>\"One hundred and twenty over eighty. Perfect.\"</p><p>It should be, Shaundra mused. She had been living off of gelatin and plain porridge for a couple of weeks now. She hadn't been able to keep down much food lately.</p><p>The nurse removed the thermometer and read it. \"Ninety- nine degrees. Not bad.\"</p><p>But it wasn't ninety-eight point six.</p><p>\"When was the last time you had a Pap smear?\" the nurse asked her.</p> <p>\"Last year,\" Shaundra replied. \"And a mammogram. I think it was in January.\"</p><p>\"You're past your year. The doctor may want to perform one.\" She handed Shaundra a hospital gown. \"I need you to take everything off and put this on, opened to the front.\"</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, she knew the routine. It was the same thing in her country too. The nurse left to give her privacy to change. Shaundra didn't know why she needed a Pap smear if she was just there for the results of her tests. She removed her clothes, folded them neatly, put them on the chair by her purse and then climbed up on the table and sat down.</p><p>Shaundra looked around, reading all of the posters on arthritis, hypertension and diabetes. When she got bored with that she looked over at a cabinet by the sink. Atop it was a tube of KY Jelly and a pair of plastic forceps. Shaundra grimaced. She hated those things, and she could not get comfortable during a pelvic examination.</p><p>The door opened a few minutes later, and Doctor Ito from the emergency room entered and bowed.</p><p>\"You look much better, Mrs. Yoshida,\" he said as he sat down and began looking over the chart the nurse had left for him. Doctor Ito was about sixty, with gray hair, and fortunately for her, he spoke English.</p><p>\"It's hard to believe that they brought you in unconscious almost three weeks ago. Your pressure and temperature are now normal, and the cut has healed on your head. How have you been feeling?\"</p><p>\"I'm still a little tired, and I don't have much of an appetite.\"</p> <p>\"That's to be expected,\" he said. \"It will improve with time.\" He jotted something on the chart. \"I'm going to need to give you a female examination.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Yes, the nurse told me.\"</p><p>The nurse re-entered the room and came in and stood next to her.</p><p>\"Just lie back on the table, put your feet in the stirrups and try to move down as far as you can.\" The doctor rose, walked over to the sink, washed and dried his hands and then put on a pair of latex gloves. \"I'm going to check your breasts and abdomen first,\" he told her.</p><p>After checking for lumps, he moved down to her stomach and pressed down on it, and then he sat down on a little seat and inserted the speculum.</p><p>Shaundra closed her eyes; her stomach clenched and her knees shook.</p><p>Doctor Ito removed the offensive tool and gave it and the sample scraping to the nurse to prepare for the lab. Next he inserted a couple of fingers and felt around inside of her, further humiliating her. He removed his gloved fingers. \"I'll leave you a few minutes to get dressed, and I want you to come over to the room next door when you finish. I have the results from the tests we took in the hospital.\"</p><p>The doctor and nurse both left. Shaundra got down off of the table and dressed. A few minutes later, she joined the doctor in his office and he told her about the results.</p><p>Tears welled in Shaundra's eyes. \"No,\" she said, not accepting what he told her.</p><p>\"It's true,\" the doctor said. \"These tests are ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent accurate.</p><p>\"How much time do I have left?\"</p><p>\"About six months.\"</p><p>The tears spilled. \"I won't accept it. I just got married, and I'm leaving for China in a couple of days. I have books to write.\" Shit, she was still in deep Kimchi.</p><p>\"I understand,\" the doctor said.</p><p>\"My husband and I just started our life together. We haven't had time to be alone, to go for walks holding hands, and I haven't met his family yet. There were so many things I planned to do in the future.\"</p><p>The doctor pulled some pamphlets out of a drawer and handed them to her. \"Let your husband and family read these after you tell them. It will make the transition easier.\"</p><p>\"He's only twenty-five. This is going to freak him out. He won't be able to deal.\"</p><p>The doctor patted her hand. \"I know this will be difficult, but there are specialists who can help. Your husband will find a way to deal. He won't leave you.\"</p><p>The tears poured from her eyes. She didn't know how she made it back to the farmhouse. The taxi driver probably thought she was crazy.</p><p>Shaundra got into the shower and then changed into her nightgown. Lucky for her she didn't have the sitter to deal with now. She couldn't bear to see anyone just yet. All she wanted to do was sleep. The tears continued to fall. Poor Ich, she thought, just before dozing off to sleep.</p><p>\"Wow, look at you,\" Satoshi said to Shaundra when she entered the kitchen dressed in a navy blue pinstriped suit, stockings and navy blue pumps. She'd done her hair up professionally in a French twist, and she'd accessorized with jewelry. \"Where are you off to this morning?\"</p><p>\"Work,\" Shaundra said, putting her briefcase on the floor next to a chair. \"I have an appointment with Harper and we need to finalize plans for his China promotion.\" She fixed herself some tea and joined him at the table.</p><p>\"I hope he's not asking you to promote with a C-pop group.\"</p><p>Shaundra made a face. \"I hope not either. I don't think he'd be foolish enough to try that again. I think Mr. Niigata has talked him into trying to open another office in Beijing.\"</p><p>\"Ah, the first stop on our tour. It's so like our bosses to mix business with business.\" He sighed. \"It must be nice being billionaires,\" Satoshi said, getting up and refilling his tea cup.</p><p>\"I bet it is. They can jettison off to some private island to escape their problems. Hell, they can buy the island.\"</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\" Satoshi asked, sitting down again.</p><p>\"Better, \"Shaundra replied. \"I'm getting my strength back, and I can stay up for longer periods of time.\"</p><p>\"Have you gotten the results back from your tests?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Stress,\" she replied. \"I guess the flying, the hypnosis and the writing caught up with me.\"</p><p>He sipped his tea. \"You need to learn to take it easy.\"</p><p>\"No more clubbing or fist-fighting.\" She picked up her cup and sipped her tea. \"Where is everyone?\"</p><p>\"Oh, you don't know, do you? Yori and Amaya have found a house and are signing papers as we speak.\"</p><p>No reaction.</p><p>\"Takumijo went out to get his hair styled for the trip, Masaaki and Cristal are at the office putting the final touches on our travel plans, and Ichiro is out of town.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Shaundra said. \"That means it's just me and you.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised both his eyebrows up and down quickly.</p><p>\"You can take advantage of me all you want.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled weakly.</p><p>He noticed the spooked look in her eyes, which meant she was worried about something. \"Are you okay?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Would you like me to fix you something to eat?\"</p><p>\"No thank you,\" she said. \"I don't have much of an appetite.\"</p><p>\"Are you taking a new medicine or something?\"</p><p>\"No, just the same stuff I've been taking for years. Why?\"</p><p>she asked.</p><p>\"Just asking.\"</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" she told him. \"Just a little acid reflux. I have to stay away from greasy and highly seasoned foods.\"</p><p>\"Why do I have the feeling that you're not telling me the whole truth?\"</p><p>Shaundra lowered her teacup. \"Because you're curious and suspicious by nature.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"You're not your usual bubbly self and don't think I haven't noticed that you and Ichiro have been avoiding each other like the plague.\"</p><p>\"Don't be silly.\"</p><p>\"You didn't even know he had gone out of town again, and he hasn't slept at home in a week.\"</p><p>\"All couples go through things,\" she explained. \"We'll work it out.\"</p><p>\"He's neglecting you,\" Satoshi said. \"That's unforgivable.\"</p><p>\"He's not neglecting me,\" she said in her husband's defense. \"I can take care of myself, regardless of what everyone thinks. I have hypertension and I have had it for years. And I'll be fifty-one in a couple of months. It's just nature catching up with me. Ich, on the other hand, is twenty-five and suddenly saddled with a sick wife. He has to deal with it in his own way.\"</p><p>\"He married you knowing you had this illness.\" He paused.</p><p>\"You don't think he has a girlfriend, do you?\"</p><p>This made Shaundra laugh. She seemed back to her old self for a moment. \"No, I don't think so. But if he does I hope he's man enough to tell me about it. I don't mind stepping aside for another woman, but I can't abide being cheated on.\"</p><p>\"That's very noble of you. Not many women would be so understanding.\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. \"I don't want a man who doesn't want me. I'm not a fool. He is in love with me now, but one day some pretty young thing is going to catch his eye. All he has to do is be honest with me. I won't break or have a hissy fit.</p><p>I'll just step aside.\"</p><p>A car horn sounded outside. Shaundra rose. \"That's my taxi. I have to go.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose. \"Let me see you to the door.\"</p><p>\"That's not necessary. I know the way.\"</p><p>\"Humor me,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>Shaundra smiled at him again. It was the same smile she'd rewarded him with at the hospital. \"You're going to make some person a fine mate one day,\" she said as they left the kitchen and walked to the front door.</p><p>Satoshi smirked. \"No, I don't see that happening.\" He helped her into the taxi and watched as it drove away from the curb and past the guard shack. He walked back into the farmhouse and closed the door. The house sounded empty.</p><p>He hadn't been alone in a long time. He walked back to the kitchen and cleared away their teacups. His plans were to arrange some music for a song he'd written and then spend the rest of the day watching a movie he'd been trying to watch for about a month now. Shaundra was wrong. He'd never make some person a good mate, and she wasn't okay.</p><p>Harper kissed her on the cheek and offered Shaundra a chair. \"You look a hell of a lot better than the last time I saw you, and you've put on a couple of pounds.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at the blond stud across from her. \"You silver-tongued devil. Women do not like to discuss their weight.\"</p><p>\"But it looks good on you. It's just more of you to love.\"</p><p>His frankness was the reason they'd remained friends all these years.</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\"</p><p>\"Fine. I just don't have much of an appetite.\"</p><p>\"Did the doctor give you something for it?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No more medicine. I just need to watch what I eat.\"</p><p>\"Then it's a good thing you're married to a chef.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I suppose so,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>Harper raised a blond eyebrow. \"What's wrong? Trouble in paradise?\"</p><p>\"No really,\" Shaundra replied. \"We've both been very busy.\" She pulled a manuscript out of her briefcase and handed it to him.</p><p>\"You've finished it?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Yesterday. I wanted to hand deliver it to you in person so you can read it.\"</p><p>\"All your books are great,\" he told her.</p><p>\"So what are your plans for me in China?\"</p><p>\"Just some book signings and personal appearances, and...\"</p><p>\"Please don't say a promotion with a C-pop band.\"</p><p>\"Hell no,\" Harper said quickly. \"I wish I could turn back time. I shouldn't have forced you to come to Japan.\"</p><p>\"Don't blame yourself. Fate brought me here. Aomori and I were destined to meet. It could have very well happened in New York just as well as here.\"</p><p>\"True,\" Harper said. \"You're not regretting getting married, are you?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded again. \"I should have listened to you. I love Ichiro but...\"</p><p>\"But what?\"</p><p>\"I don't see us growing old together.\"</p><p>\"Well, to be frank, he'll just be in his prime when you turn seventy.\"</p><p>\"I didn't think I would change that much at seventy. I figured I'd still be me, just a little grayer and a little shorter.\"</p><p>\"And now?\"</p><p>\"Now I don't think about the future. I'm just living life one day at a time.\"</p><p>Harper shuddered. \"That's morbid, even for you. You sound like you don't plan to be alive to see seventy.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked away.</p><p>\"Shit. What's wrong?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" she said quickly.</p><p>Harper jumped out of his seat and ran over to her. He pulled her out of the chair. \"What aren't you telling me? I'm your oldest and dearest friend. You can tell me anything.\"</p><p>Shaundra started to cry.</p><p>\"Holy shit. I've never known you to do that before. Don't go acting all girly on me.\" He hugged her tightly as she sobbed. A few minutes later she stopped and sat down again.</p><p>Harper returned to his seat. \"What happened at the doctor's office?\"</p><p>Shaundra opened her briefcase and pulled out the doctor's report. She didn't have the courage to tell him. She pushed the results toward him. \"Before you read it, promise me that you won't say a word about this to anyone, especially Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"He hasn't seen this?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra said. \"I haven't seen him since I got this, and I haven't figured out the right way to tell him.\"</p><p>Harper pulled out his reading glasses and put them on. He began to read the results. He pulled off his glasses and put them on the desk and handed her back the papers. \"How do you want to handle this?\"</p><p>\"As quickly as possible?\"</p><p>Ichiro parked his car in the garage and walked back toward the front of the house. It was late and everyone was probably in bed, since they were flying out to China at ten in the morning. The last of his business meetings were over, Daichi had everything under control at the restaurant, and all he wanted to do was take a bath and go to bed.</p><p>Ichiro entered the house, removed his shoes and put on his slippers. He walked into the den. He needed a drink, and something stronger than tea. Heading over to the bar, he reached for a bottle of sake he'd been saving for a special occasion, then poured himself a cup of the rice liquid and swallowed the entire contents down. He carried the bottle over to the couch and sat down trying to find the courage to go up and face his wife that he hadn't seen in a week. She was probably pissed beyond belief at him for not calling or telling her that he was going out of town for a couple of days.</p><p>He'd left her in good hands. Satoshi wouldn't let anything happen to her.</p><p>He hoped this trip to China would be good for them. Maybe he and Shaundra could rekindle what they'd lost. He'd been doing all of this for her...to provide a stable future for them.</p><p>Being young did not make him naive. He knew he couldn't perform on stage forever, and he had to have something to fall back on when the time happened. With the restaurants up and running and doing well, he could take care of his wife properly. Shaundra was levelheaded. She'd understand. As things stood now, he didn't even know if she still loved him.</p><p>Maybe she regretted choosing him and not Yori. He poured himself another drink. Well, Yori wouldn't be a problem anymore since he and Amaya would be moving out as soon as they returned from China. Now all he had to do was work on getting Satoshi and Takumijo out of the house. No, he thought. This was their home as much as it was his. Maybe he'd build Shaundra a home away from all of this.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea.</p><p>Maybe being around a J-pop band wasn't what she needed.</p><p>She was a writer, which meant she needed tranquility. Yes, he'd build her a grand house in Kyoto with a big office and a library with lots of cherry trees outside her office window so she could watch them bloom next spring. And he'd build a nursery just in case she changed her mind about adopting a baby. And then he'd take her to Paris or to a romantic island in the Pacific for their first anniversary. Yes, that would be nice, just the two of them.</p><p>His body stirred at the vision. Hmmm, that hadn't happened for a long time. He sipped the sake. He wondered if Shaundra would mind if he woke her to help with his sudden arousal. He got up and walked back over to the bar and put the sake away. Leaving the den, he headed down the hall to the stairwell.</p><p>Romantic music echoed from Yori's suite. Ichiro smirked.</p><p>Maybe he was getting the stick out of Amaya's butt. He continued to his room. Lights were out in all the other bedrooms.</p><p>Ichiro entered his bedroom and turned on the light. He panicked. Shaundra wasn't there. Where is she? he wondered as he checked her office and the bathroom. He walked back into their bedroom and found a white envelope on the bed, his name written on it in Shaundra's handwriting. He sat down on the bed and opened it. He pulled out the piece of stationary, read it, groaned and fell back on the bed.</p><p>Shaundra had left him.</p><p>\"What do you mean she's gone?\" Masaaki asked Ichiro the next morning as they prepared to leave for the airport.</p><p>\"She's gone,\" Ichiro replied. \"She said she didn't want to be a bother to me anymore.\"</p><p>\"But where did she go? She doesn't know anyone in Japan.\"</p><p>\"Probably back to the United States,\" Ichiro said. \"That's where her family is.\"</p><p>\"Have you called to check?\"</p><p>Ichiro shook her head. \"It's nighttime there. I thought I'd wait. I've tried calling Shaundra's cell, but the number has been disconnected.\"</p><p>Satoshi walked into the office. \"Aren't you guys ready yet?</p><p>Kenshin is waiting outside in the van.\"</p><p>\"We have a problem,\" Masaaki said. \"Shaundra is gone.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean gone?\"</p><p>\"She left Ichiro.\"</p><p>Satoshi frowned. \"I knew something like this would happen. When did she go?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Ichiro replied. \"She wasn't here when I came home last night. When was the last time you saw her?\"</p><p>\"Yesterday morning,\" Satoshi said. \"She told me she had a meeting with Harper.\"</p><p>Kenshin blew the horn.</p><p>\"You can call him on the way to the airport,\" Masaaki replied. \"If we don't leave now we'll miss our flight.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. He'd call Harper when he got into the van.</p><p>He followed Satoshi and Masaaki out to the van and climbed in.</p><p>Harper's phone just kept ringing.</p><p>Ichiro put away his cell phone and settled back in his seat.</p><p>This wasn't a very good time to panic.</p><p>\"Did you reach Harper?\" Satoshi asked as he climbed into the van and sat down next to him.</p><p>\"No, his cell phone and office phones are just ringing.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we'll run into him at the airport. He's on his way to China too.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" Satoshi said. \"I assumed she came home yesterday, figuring she went off to her room while I was in the music room.\"</p><p>\"It is not your fault. I should not have put such a responsibility on you. I will find my wife.\"</p><p>Kenshin drove the van away from the curb, and the security guards followed in another van. The only place she could go was to her family. He sighed. He hoped the hypnosis was still working and she wasn't panicking aboard a plane flying overseas alone. What was she thinking? She was not a burden to him. She was his wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Narita Airport's terminal was jam-packed with young women and men waiting to send Aomori off in style on the first leg of their China tour. Cristal stayed closed to Satoshi as Aomori and their entourage made their way to the line to check in. Kenshin and some of the roadies pushed the group's luggage on carts while bodyguards held back the crowds who tried to touch them or take pictures.</p><p>\"Yori, I love you,\" one teen hollered.</p><p>Yori shoved his hands into his pockets and walked next to Masaaki. Amaya had decided to stay with her parents and not join him on the tour. She'd started work as a dress designer.</p><p>Cristal suspected that the plans changed because they now owned a house and she wanted to stay behind and tend to everything before Yori returned and they moved in. This did not hurt Cristal's feelings, and she was glad she didn't have to see Amaya for a while.</p> <p>Takumijo stopped and signed some autographs and posed for some pictures. One young lady bowed and handed him a teddy bear. Takumijo accepted it and bowed to her. The crowd went wild when he smiled at the young lady.</p><p>Satoshi ignored the shouting of his name most of the time.</p><p>Every now and then he'd wave to be sociable, but as far as she could tell he didn't like any of it.</p><p>Ichiro walked behind them solemnly. He hadn't said a word to anyone since they left the farmhouse. She didn't know what had happened or where Shaundra had gone, but she suspected it had all gotten to be too much for her. Dealing with her sudden mysterious illness, the argument with Amaya, and then Ichiro leaving her night after night alone had added to the older woman's depression. Cristal hoped she was okay, but she guessed she wouldn't know anything until they arrived in China.</p><p>\"Flight 1010 leaving for China boarding at gate five,\" a young woman announced over the public address system.</p> <p>Masaaki led the way. Everyone pulled out their tickets and passports, and walked single file up to the attendant to check them in. A few minutes later they had all boarded the plane.</p><p>Aomori and the others disembarked from the plane, donned in dark glasses and looking every bit pop idols as they entered the Beijing Capital International Airport. The Niigata's breeding and the years of training rang supreme as they appeared one by one in the terminal to greet their screaming fans. To new fans this must have made quite an impact, as the statuesque, handsome six-foot-tall males descended on them one at a time.</p><p>Yori appeared first, dressed in a pair of dove gray linen pants and jacket with a white shirt beneath it. His hair now came to his neck, a little shorter in a more masculine cut. His dark glasses hid those spectacular brown eyes, and he appeared a bit friendlier waving to his fans.</p><p>Takumijo appeared next, dressed in a dark gray linen suit with a black shirt. His hair, perfect as always, looked short and sporty, and he had added some brown highlights. He wore jewelry down from his ear to his pinky finger. The females in the crowd went wild shouting his name. Takumijo waved and took pictures with his adoring fans even though he could barely speak the language.</p><p>Takumijo's entrance was followed up by Satoshi. He wore a black and white two-toned jacket with white trousers.</p><p>Beneath the jacket he sported a white high-collared shirt. He had pulled his hair back in a ponytail. He, like the others, hid those perfect chocolate brown eyes behind a pair of dark glasses.</p> <p>Ichiro appeared and the crowd went wild. He was dressed all in black with a diamond pin glittering in his tie, with a matching diamond earring in his ear. The fans screamed his name as he walked alone like a runway model. His long black braid hung down his back and touched his butt. He waved a couple of times, posed for pictures and accepted tokens of love from the fans...quite uncharacteristic of his usual shy and demure attitude toward crowds.</p><p>Masaaki and Kenshin brought up the rear. Masaaki wore a dark business suit, and Kenshin arrived in his dark blue chauffeur's livery. Cristal herself, getting into the role of publicist, dressed in a dark navy blue suit and pumps with her hair pinned up high on her head. The fans surprised her as they recognized her, calling her by name and asking for Yi- jun. Her eyes were covered by dark blue sunglasses to hide the bloodshot red that stained them from lack of sleep, staying up to console the depressed and distraught Satoshi who missed Shaundra and felt responsible for her sudden disappearance. She, like the others, had tried to convince him that he hadn't done anything wrong and had no way of knowing that she planned to leave.</p><p>Ichiro had calls into her kids and mother in the United States, but so far he hadn't heard back from any of them.</p><p>Beijing was a balmy sixty-eight degrees when they finally stepped out of the terminal. Young people lined the streets, bands played and people performed with banners raised high baring Aomori's name in Japanese, English and Mandarin. The band members waved and smiled as they stepped into the limousines waiting to take them to their hotel, where they'd stay a week before traveling to Taiwan, the second leg of their destination.</p><p>Cristal looked out of the window, marveling at the Central Business District centered at the Guomao area. They rode past Jianuai SOHO, Park Hyatt and Yintai CCTV Headquarters and other tall office buildings in the financial district. This was home to a variety of corporate regional offices, shopping precincts and expensive housing. They passed a lot of historical buildings which she hoped to tour once Yi-jun found some free time in his busy schedule. He'd promised to show her around town, and she was holding him to it.</p><p>They arrived at the hotel, and after unpacking and getting comfortable Masaaki took them all to dinner, where they feasted on such Beijing cuisine as Peking duck, sweetened vinegar spareribs, hot and sour soup, egg and shrimp wrapped in cornflower pancakes, and fried cake glazed in malt sugar followed by green tea. Afterwards they got back into the limousine and drove to the Beijing National Stadium where the 2008 Summer Olympics had been held and where Aomori was scheduled to perform in two days.</p><p>\"Would you look at this place?\" Takumijo said, removing his sunglasses as he climbed up the stairs. \"This is just too fantastic for words.\"</p><p>Kenshin followed him up next. \"This is by far one of the best stadiums you guys have ever performed in.\"</p> <p>\"Just say the word and you can join us,\" Yori told him.</p><p>\"Ooh, not this time,\" Kenshin said. \"Maybe next time. I have to work off some of this Peking duck.\"</p><p>Ichiro sat down in one of the stadium chairs instead of following the others onto the stage. He took out his cell phone, and Cristal sat down next to him. He got Shaundra's mother on the line.</p><p>\"Are you sure you haven't heard from her?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Please call me if she gets in contact with you.\" He disconnected the international call.</p><p>\"No one has seen or heard from her,\" he said. \"She should have arrived in New York by now.\" He tried Harper's corporate office again. The same thing...no one had heard from Shaundra. \"This is so difficult. I'm starting to get very worried. She didn't take anything with her when she left, not even her luggage. What if something has happened to her?\"</p><p>Cristal patted his hand. \"Don't start thinking negatively.</p><p>We'll find her.\" Deep in her heart, though, she was starting to worry too. Satoshi had said she wasn't acting like herself the last time he spoke with her. She sighed. She hoped Shaundra hadn't gone off and done something foolish.</p><p>Masaaki's cell phone rang. \"Hello. Oh hello, Harper. No, we haven't heard from her yet.\" Masaaki took the phone away from his ear. Harper shouted and cursed. \"We are doing everything we can to find her. Mr. Niigata has his people searching for her. Japan is a pretty big place. She could be anywhere. I understand she can barely speak Japanese. She has gotten along so far. She'll run into someone who speaks English.\" He took the phone away from his ear again. Harper still shouted, and then the call ended. Masaaki shoved the phone back into his pocket. \"He said he's hiring an investigator to search the United States for her. He said the last time he'd seen her was a couple of days ago when she stopped by his office.\"</p><p>Ichiro stood and walked back out of the stadium.</p><p>Cristal sighed, hoping someone would find her alive and well.</p><p>Cristal nearly knocked him to his knees as she ran and jumped into his arms in the lobby of the hotel where Aomori was staying. He also had a room there for the duration of his stay.</p><p>\"Ooh, I'm so glad to see you too,\" Yi-jun said as he swung her around in his arms. His lips bore down on hers when the world stopped revolving.</p><p>\"Get a room,\" he heard someone say.</p><p>\"Satoshi.\" Yi-jun freed Cristal and walked over and shook his friend's hand. \"Man, it's good to see you.\" The two friends hugged, making her feel lower than a snake's underbelly for inadvertently coming between them. \"This hotel is fabulous, and there's so much to do and see in town.\"</p><p>\"You two kids enjoy it,\" Satoshi said. \"Some of us have to work.\" He walked past them and headed toward the elevators with his hands buried deep into his pockets and his head down.</p><p>\"I feel so bad for him,\" Cristal told Yi-jun as he whisked her out of the hotel lobby and into a fancy black chauffeur- driven limousine he'd rented to ride around in with her. \"He blames himself for Shaundra's disappearance.\"</p><p>Yi-jun helped her into the car and then went around to the other side and got in. A pretty Chinese chauffer pulled out into the busy Beijing traffic. \"Satoshi has always been that way,\" he told her. \"He worries a lot about everyone and things that are out of his control. He's truly the backbone behind Aomori. Yori might be the leader, but Satoshi holds that group together, sometimes sacrificing his own needs for theirs. He's their heart, and without him they're just a band without a talented piano player.\"</p><p>Cristal snuggled up against him, and he liked the way her hair smelled. \"You guys are truly the best of friends.\"</p><p>\"How good is your Mandarin?\" Li-jun asked Cristal.</p><p>\"Not as good as my Korean,\" Cristal replied. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"If you need to go somewhere and need to take a taxi, it is best to print out the names of places you want to visit in Chinese characters, or better yet get someone from the hotel to do it for you. And when you cross the street assume that none of the drivers will give you the right of way.\"</p><p>\"I'll remember that,\" she said. \"But I don't plan to go anywhere alone.\"</p><p>The chauffeur did a good job maneuvering through the crowded road full of cars and bicycles veering toward her from different directions.</p><p>\"Where are going?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Tiananmen Square,\" Yi-jun answered. \"It's in the center of the city in the Dongcheng District.\"</p><p>\"Uh huh,\" Cristal said sarcastically.</p><p>\"It's a big public square where visitors from all around the world visit daily.\" The driver parked once they reached their destination. The chauffeur got out this time and opened the door for them.</p><p>People stared at Cristal, and some outright chuckled.</p><p>\"What's their problem?\" she asked.</p><p>Yi-jun took her arm and put it near his. \"Most of them have never seen an African-American beauty in person before. They're not trying to be rude, just curious.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" she replied, apparently not offended and probably used to similar treatment in Korea and Japan.</p><p>He led her over to the landmark. Tiananmen Square was surrounded by many big buildings like the Great Hall of People, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Museum of Chinese History, the Qianmen Gate of the Forbidden City, Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and the Monument to the People's Martyrs. \"Which place do you want to try first?\"</p><p>\"I would say the Forbidden City, but with my luck I'd probably end up in jail, so let's try the Museum of Chinese History.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled, pulling her toward the Forbidden City.</p><p>\"Wow,\" Cristal said, marveling at the palace. She was about as awestruck as the other tourists as she gazed upon a part of history from the Ming Dynasty.</p><p>\"For nearly five hundred years it served as the home of the Empress and their household,\" he explained to her.</p><p>\"Can you imagine living in something like this during that time period?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Yi-jun nodded and took her hand. \"You would be my Empress, and we'd have scores and scores of babies running around through the palace by day, and we would get busy in the fancy Emperor's bed at night making more babies.\"</p><p>Cristal playfully punched on the arm. \"Leave it to you to think of something like that.\" She sighed. \"You have quite the vivid imagination, Mr. Lee.\"</p><p>Yi-jun chuckled. If she only knew.</p><p>He took her to the museum next. It was impressive but not yet up to the standards of those he'd seen in Paris and Rome. Afterwards they sat and drank tea at the Temple of Heaven in the Chonguen District. He had the driver return them to the hotel to change for the evening and to check with their prospective bosses to see if they had any fires to put out before dashing out again. This time to the Tiangiao Acrobatics Theater in the Xuanwoa District, followed up by the opera at the Beijing Opera House.</p><p>Things happened very fast with Cristal. Most of the time she left him breathless. She was intelligent, funny, beautiful, and talented. She was, as the Americans said, the whole kit and caboodle. \"Come with me to the United States,\" he said to her out of the blue after they'd just shared a round of silly laughter.</p><p>\"What?\" she asked, still not fully recuperated from the giggles.</p><p>\"Come with me to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Are you serious?\"</p><p>\"I've never been more serious about anything in my life,\"</p><p>he told her as he pulled her into his arms just outside and placed his lips against hers. He leaned into the softness of her body and his knees felt weak; his pulse raced, and he swore he felt the planet move beneath his feet. He didn't know how long they stood there, both oblivious to everything around them. He was in no rush to break the passionate kiss, and he was sure that she didn't mind. If the world came to an end at that very moment he would go happily, knowing that at that very moment Cristal wanted him as much as he wanted her.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" she answered when they finally broke the kiss. \"This is so sudden.\"</p><p>The world stopped revolving.</p><p>Cristal moved around in her seat, quite excited at the prospect of finally getting to see Aomori perform. The stadium was filled to capacity. Fans armed with royal blue fluorescent light sticks waited for the young men to appear. She'd never seen anything like this before...at least not for a Japanese group. It made her heart feel good to know Aomori was as well loved overseas as they were in Japan and Korea.</p><p>\"You seem as excited as most of these kids,\" Yi-jun said from a nearly front row seat next to her.</p><p>\"I am,\" she replied, shaking her blue stick at him. \"I've always been a big fan of boy bands.\"</p><p>\"Then you're in for a pleasant surprise. These guys are fantastic.\"</p><p>Cristal settled back in her seat, still a bit perplexed by Yi- jun's offer to join him in the United States. She supposed she could use this time to visit with her parents, whom she hadn't seen in a long time. Their living in California would save her on travel expenses or where she would live for two weeks if she decided to take him up on his offer. But what did it mean if she actually did accept? That she loved him enough to follow him? Or did it mean that she was running away from making a decision that she still needed to address...her feelings for Satoshi? Yi-jun's offer was so tempting, especially since Satoshi hadn't exactly expressed undying love for her.</p><p>She wished he would do something, anything to let her know that he actually cared for her. And if she actually decided to go with Yi-jun, did that mean the decision would be made for her? Cristal sighed and settled back into her seat.</p><p>The lights dimmed, and Yi-jun squeezed her hand affectionately. The stadium glowed in the blue rays of the light sticks like a wave of water against the night skies.</p><p>\"Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our show.\" The announcement was broadcast in Mandarin, Japanese and Korean.</p><p>The music started to play. \"Welcome Aomori.\"</p><p>The curtains lifted.</p><p>Cristal involuntarily took a deep breath and exhaled. She prayed for her sake that the performance went off without a hitch. Oh my God. Is that the doofuses? Oh my God, they look so scrumptious. The spotlights beamed down on the stage as they started with a rousing dance number that brought the audience to their feet. Yori sang the lead, while Satoshi played the keyboard, and Takumijo and Ichiro dazzled with amazing synchronized footsteps and sung backup. By the end of the song Cristal found herself screaming Aomori's name at the top of her lungs like the other tweens, teens, and star-struck femmes.</p><p>Aomori were all dolled up in black tuxedos and white dress shirts, looking slim and debonair. Satoshi had finally let his hair out of the ponytail. In all the time they had spent together, she'd never seen it this way. She'd always had a thing for a guy in bangs. Shit. No. Decision not made, her body decided for her, especially when the spotlight gleamed down on him for the next song...a solo, and for all accounts a love song.</p><p>His eyes searched, found and locked with hers, and she rewarded him with a smile. His deep and sexy voice serenaded only her.</p><p>Yi-jun's hand tightened on hers, drawing her away from the fantasy developing in her mind.</p><p>\"It appears he's singing just for you,\" Yi-jun whispered in her ear.</p><p>\"Don't be ridiculous,\" she said, not taking her eyes off the Japanese hottie as he belted out his feelings for her in his song. And when it ended, their eyes remained locked and her heart did a funny little flip. What the hell am I going to do now?</p><p>Where is she? Three weeks had gone by without a word from Shaundra. And Ichiro suspected that maybe it was time to get the law involved. He stretched out on his bed in his hotel room in Taiwan during the second leg of their China tour. He hadn't seen any of the others and didn't want to. He was tired of hearing questions about his state of mind or inquiries about where he thought Shaundra might have gone to. By now he'd spoken to her entire family, including her baby girl, Tricia, and so far no one had seen her since the two of them left for Korea.</p><p>Korea? He hadn't thought of there. Maybe she'd returned to Korea, since that is where her physiatrist was. He got off the bed to retrieve his wallet and search for the doctor's card.</p><p>It was nearly noon, and he hoped the doctor hadn't gone off to lunch or was busy with a patient.</p><p>Ichiro reached for the phone, got an outside operator and placed the call. \"Hello, my name is Ichiro Yoshida. May I speak to Doctor Wong?\" A few minutes later the doctor picked up the line.</p><p>\"Hello, Doctor Wong, speaking.\"</p><p>\"Doctor Wong, my name is Ichiro Yoshida. I don't know if you remember me. My wife Shaundra is a patient of yours.</p><p>You treated her with hypnosis for a fear of flying.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Yoshida. I remember you. How can I help you?\"</p><p>\"I have a problem, Doctor. My wife has disappeared.\"</p><p>There was a pause on the other line. \"What do you mean disappeared?\"</p><p>\"She was supposed to accompany me to China on a tour about three weeks ago. She left home to meet with her boss, and no one has seen her since. I know you can't divulge any personal information to me. In fact, you're my last hope. I just need to know if she had an appointment with you in the last three weeks.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Mr. Yoshida. I hadn't seen her. The last I knew she was supposed to fly back with you to Japan.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we did fly back to Japan. Thanks to you she was able to do it without medication.\"</p><p>\"How did she seem the last time you saw her? Did she seem depressed over anything?\"</p><p>Ichiro thought about it. \"Well, she did get sick shortly after we returned home, and she had to be hospitalized for her blood pressure. She did seem a little sad, but I thought it was from being so far away from her family.\"</p><p>\"Have you gotten in touch with them?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Ichiro said. \"No one has heard from her, and I'm beginning to worry. It's not like her to do something like this.\"</p><p>\"Everyone has things in their lives they can't deal with, Mr.</p><p>Yoshida. Shaundra's no different. But no, unfortunately, I haven't heard from her. Can you give me a number where I can get in touch with you if I do hear from her?\"</p><p>Ichiro gave him his Interstate cell phone number and Masaaki's number. \"I'm in China right now and will be here for another couple of months.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing in China, if you don't mind me asking?\"</p><p>\"I'm on tour. I guess Shaundra failed to mention that I was a pop star.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but Mr. Yoshida, she did say that she loved you. This I remember because she wanted so badly to kick the drugs and be able to travel with you. I guess I shouldn't be saying this, but she wasn't addicted...she only took them to travel and no other time, but she saw how worried you were and she didn't think anyone would believe her, not even you.\"</p><p>Tears welled in Ichiro's eyes, and he choked back a sob.</p><p>\"Thank you, Doctor. That means the world to me. I will let you know if I hear from her. Thank you for all you have done for us. Goodbye.\"</p><p>\"Goodbye, Mr. Yoshida, and good luck.\"</p><p>Doctor Wong hung up, and Ichiro couldn't stop the tears from flowing. Grown man or not, he missed his wife and now feared that all of this might not turn out right in the end. He wiped his eyes again and got a Japanese operator on the line.</p><p>\"Hello, I'd like to be connected to an Osaka operator.\"</p><p>The operator put the call through. \"Hello, I'd like to be connected to the Osaka police department.\" A few seconds later the phone rang and a male voice answered.</p><p>\"Osaka police. How may I help you?\"</p><p>\"Hello, my name is Ichiro Yoshida and I would like to place a missing person's report.\"</p><p>\"Who is missing and how long has this person been missing?\" the officer asked.</p><p>\"Her name is Shaundra Yoshida. She's a well-known romance writer, and she goes by the name of Shaundra Morrison. She's an African-American female, fifty years old, and she's been missing for three weeks.\"</p><p>\"What is your relationship to the missing person?\"</p><p>\"She is my wife,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>\"Why did it take three weeks for you to report her missing?\"</p><p>\"I thought that she went back to America to her family, but no one has seen or heard from her. The last person to see her was her boss, and he said he put her into a taxi and sent her home to Osaka.\"</p><p>The questioning went on for a long time, and then Ichiro felt more like a suspect than a husband. He could not stop the tears again, and by the end of the call he knew he would not be going on stage tonight.</p><p>Satoshi and the others gathered in a meeting room of the hotel where they were staying to discuss the latest incident.</p><p>\"Ichiro is not going to finish this tour,\" Masaaki explained.</p><p>\"He is going back to Osaka to search for Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"What are we going to do?\" Takumijo asked. \"We have a show to perform.\"</p><p>Masaaki turned to Kenshin. \"We need your help. I wouldn't ask if we had any other choice.\"</p><p>Kenshin nodded. \"I'll do it for Ich, and for Shaundra.\"</p><p>Yori and the others agreed. Kenshin would have to step in for Ichiro, but in their hearts they knew it wouldn't be the same without their maknae.</p><p>\"What will we do for wardrobe?\" Yori asked. \"Kenshin is heavier than Ich.\"</p><p>\"I have costumers working on that,\" Masaaki explained.</p><p>\"No excuses. I want all of you to pull yourselves together and give the citizens of Taiwan the best performance you can.</p><p>Ichiro will expect no less of you.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed, trying to keep his emotions in check.</p><p>\"That's it,\" Masaaki said. \"Have a good performance.\"</p><p>Yori and Satoshi stayed behind after the others had departed.</p><p>\"What do you want to do?\" Satoshi asked him.</p><p>\"I don't know, but I know I just can't sit around here and do nothing. I'm about to lose my mind.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"I know exactly what you mean. I can barely concentrate on my music for worrying. Every day I expect to see Shaundra sitting in the audience smiling at me when we take the stage like she did in the United States.\"</p><p>\"Here's the kicker - even Amaya's upset now and truly sorry for how she treated Shaundra.\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"Sometimes it takes something like this to bring family together.\"</p><p>Yori nodded.</p><p>\"What if she's...?\"</p><p>\"Don't say it. Shaundra's not dead. She can't be dead.\" His voice broke, and he didn't try to save face and hide it.</p><p>Satoshi went over to him and wrapped his arms around Yori. Poor baby. He knew exactly how he felt. And for the first time since they were kids, both of them cried for the possible loss of the life of a very important woman in both their lives.</p><p>They also cried for Ichiro and what he would be going through if he could not find his wife.</p><p>Yori regrouped first. \"Will you see him off? I know he won't accept me doing this since...\"</p><p>\"I'll go,\" Satoshi said. \"I'll make sure he has everything he needs.\"</p><p>Yori patted him on the shoulder. \"You are our rock, and sometimes I don't know what I would do without you.\"</p><p>Satoshi bowed. \"I'll always be there, Yori. You don't have to worry.\" He bowed again and left the meeting room, leaving Yori to get himself together before going out to meet the public.</p><p>There was a knock at his door. Ichiro opened it, and Satoshi stood on the other side. \"I came to see if you needed help packing.\"</p><p>Ichiro stepped aside and allowed Satoshi to enter. \"Not really,\" he said, pointing to the packed suitcases on a cart in his room. \"I never get too comfortable when we travel.\"</p><p>\"Masaaki has told everyone what is going on, and Kenshin has agreed to take your spot until you can return to us.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"Kenny's a good man, and he deserves a big break. I guess I'm not the only one who thinks he's wasting his time chauffeuring us around.\"</p><p>\"No, you're right. He deserves this. He's been with us since the beginning.\" He paused. \"Are you okay?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro answered honestly. \"But I will be once I'm on that plane heading back to Japan.\"</p><p>\"You think she could still be there?\"</p><p>\"I'm hoping,\" Ichiro said. \"Harper checked all the airports, and her name did not appear on any manifests. If she hasn't gone back to the United States, where else could she be but still in Osaka?\"</p><p>\"How is she surviving there?\" Satoshi asked. \"She only knows a couple of words in Japanese and she can't drive.\"</p><p>\"Yes, she can,\" Ichiro said. \"She just chose not to. And as for communication, Shaundra knows enough to communicate with us all this time. She knows the basics.\"</p><p>\"Can I ask you something?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded.</p><p>\"Do you believe she just walked away on her own, or do you think that she might have been abducted? You know how the fan girls feel about her, and there are all kinds of kooks in the world.\"</p><p>\"The letter was written in her handwriting. I'm hoping she just walked away,\" Ichiro said. \"Japan is a pretty big place.</p><p>Just because her skin is dark doesn't mean she can't lose herself within the country.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. He hoped Ich was right and that Shaundra had just taken an emotional leave of absence to deal with her problems.</p><p>\"Do you need a ride to the airport?\"</p><p>\"No, I'll take a taxi.\"</p><p>\"Do you need any money?\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled. \"No, I'm straight. I'm a restaurant mogul, remember?\"</p><p>Satoshi walked over and hugged him. \"Good luck,\" he said.</p><p>He brushed Ichiro's bangs back and gently stroked them one time before releasing him. \"Godspeed, my brother.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded and stepped away from him. He grabbed his luggage cart and pulled it out of the room.</p><p>A bigger hole in Satoshi's heart opened as he watched his maknae leave them. If things had been different, if they didn't have a tour, he'd be the first to volunteer to join him.</p><p>But they had obligations, and there was no one to replace him with. He walked out of Ichiro's room, closing the door behind him, and headed down to the lobby to get himself a strong cup of black coffee before meeting the others for rehearsal.</p><p>He ran into Cristal in the lobby.</p><p>Satoshi looked totally depressed, and it scared her because she didn't think anything got to him. \"Where are you on your way to?\" she asked him.</p><p>\"To the cafe,\" he said. \"I need coffee and plenty of it.</p><p>Would you care to join me?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I was just heading that way myself.\" She didn't know what kind of help she could be in his hour of need.</p><p>Satoshi reached out his hand and she grabbed it. His hand was soft for a man's. They walked together, ignoring the stares of the Taiwanese. Why did so many people have a problem with her being with an Asian man? When was this prejudice going to end?</p><p>They entered the cafe. It was a quaint little establishment that served quick meals like sandwiches and desserts twenty- four hours a day. There was also a restaurant in the hotel where they usually met for dinner.</p><p>They walked up to the counter and ordered their coffee.</p><p>The cashier filled the cups, and then they walked over to a vacant table and sat down.</p><p>\"Is it true that Ichiro is leaving?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"He's already gone. I didn't think he'd last this long.\"</p><p>Cristal sipped her coffee and grimaced. She opened the top and added cream and sugar, then stirred before recapping the steaming liquid. \"Do you think he'll find her?\"</p><p>\"I hope so, because I think it might be the end of Aomori if he doesn't.\"</p><p>\"Three weeks is a long time for someone to go missing.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but Shaundra's tough and a survivalist.\"</p><p>\"I hope you're right,\" Cristal said. \"I miss her so. She's the first real friend I've had in a long time.\"</p><p>\"Yi-jun is your friend,\" Satoshi said, finally changing the subject.</p><p>\"I was wondering when you were going to bring him up.\"</p><p>\"It's kind of hard not to. How serious are you about him?\"</p><p>\"Very serious,\" she replied. \"He's asked me to join him in the United States.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised an eyebrow. \"And are you considering his offer?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"It would be nice to see my parents again.\"</p><p>\"You know that's not what I'm asking.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I'm seriously considering it since I haven't received a better offer.\"</p><p>Satoshi lifted his cup and sipped before putting it back down again. \"Yi-jun is a good man, but he's not the settling- down type, if that's what you're hoping.\"</p><p>\"I'm too young to settle down,\" Cristal replied, irritated that he still would not tell her how he felt about her. Just one word - that was all she asked.</p><p>\"What about your job with us?\"</p><p>Question one. Does he put his job before your happiness?</p><p>Answer: Yes. \"I wouldn't be going away forever. Just two weeks, using my annual vacation time.\"</p><p>\"And after that?\"</p><p>\"Then I'd return to my job and my life if...\"</p><p>\"If he doesn't make you a better offer.\"</p><p>Cristal nodded.</p><p>\"Women are so confusing.\"</p><p>\"And men never say what's on their mind or confess their true feelings.\"</p><p>He rolled his eyes at her. \"I would if I could be truly open, when at the moment my heart has a big empty hole in it.\"</p><p>Cristal sighed. \"Shaundra?\" Question two. Does he put others before you? Answer: Yes.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"I just can't go on with my life until I find out that she's okay.\"</p><p>\"And if she is, then what? She will still be married to Ichiro. Or are you hoping that she did leave him and wants out of the marriage?\"</p><p>He didn't answer her, but she could see the answer in his eyes. He really did love Shaundra. She chuckled. \"That's tragic,\" she said. \"You guys are too much. Why waste your time on someone you can't have?\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged. \"There's always hope.\" He rose from the table with his cup. \"Have a good time in the United States.</p><p>Give Yi-jun my love.\"</p><p>Cristal watched him leave the cafe. I guess that settles that. Decision made for her. She pulled out her cell phone.</p><p>\"Hello, Yi-jun, this is Cristal. I've decided to take you up on your kind offer.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Are you sure you don't want us to get in contact with your husband?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra told the nurse. \"He's busy working in China.\"</p><p>\"What about a family member?\"</p><p>\"No, no one. My family is in the United States.\"</p> <p>\"Very well, the anesthesiologist is here.\"</p><p>Shaundra turned her head toward the door. A friendly looking Asian man around her age entered.</p><p>He bowed and introduced himself. \"My name is Keiichi Wantanabe, and I will be your anesthesiologist for your procedure.\"</p><p>Good, he speaks English. \"It's nice to meet you.\" Her doctor told her that the procedure would take about forty-five minutes and she would be sedated the entire time, which she hated since it was dangerous for her to have any more drugs in her system, especially since she'd tried so long the last couple of weeks to be careful.</p><p>\"I'm going to put some medication into your IV. You're going to feel some warmth go across your chest, and then you'll feel cold.\"</p> <p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>The procedure began.</p><p>\"Let me know when you feel the warmth.\"</p><p>It happened almost instantaneously. \"I feel it,\" she replied.</p><p>Then the cold. Shaundra shivered.</p><p>\"I need you to start counting backwards from one hundred,\" he told her.</p> <p>\"One hundred.\" The room began to shake. \"Ninety-nine.\"</p><p>The room shook a little more.</p><p>\"Oh, shit,\" the anesthesiologist said. \"Earthquake.\"</p><p>Lights flashed off and on in the operating room. Shaundra heard noises as she began to drift off to sleep. Something fell to the floor and shattered.</p><p>\"We have to get this patient out of here and to safety,\"</p><p>someone said.</p><p>She couldn't tell who because the voice seemed so far away. The bed shook, and she prayed she wouldn't fall off.</p><p>Someone laid themselves across her protectively.</p> <p>The tsunami warning sounded.</p><p>Shit, she thought. This could be serious.</p><p>\"There's no time to move her. We have to bunker down here.\"</p><p>\"Ninety-six.\"</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>His feet were barely planted on Japanese soil when he felt the ground move under his feet. Ichiro looked around. An earthquake...a big mother. People screamed and ran for cover as the insides of the airport terminal shook and the walls swayed. He waited for the earthquake alarms to sound.</p><p>They went off simultaneously.</p><p>\"Attention, ladies and gentlemen,\" the announcement started over the public address system. \"A powerful earthquake has just struck Japan. Please remain calm.\"</p><p>Fruitless words, Ichiro thought. Of course people were going to panic.</p><p>\"A tsunami warning has been issued for the coastal areas to include the Miyagi Prefecture.\" Ichiro knew the area well.</p><p>But that was nowhere near his intended destination, Osaka.</p><p>Thinking fast, he made it to the baggage claim, got his luggage, and headed outside to see if he could secure a taxi to take him the rest of the way. Poor Shaundra. Wherever she was she must be terrified.</p><p>Luck was with him. A taxi. Ichiro hurried over to it. \"I need to get to Osaka,\" he told the man.</p><p>\"Don't you know there's been an earthquake?\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Ichiro told him. \"But I need to get there to check on my wife.\"</p><p>\"I hope it's still there,\" the taxi driver said. \"I've been trying to get some information over the radio. I'll take you there, but there's no promise.\"</p><p>Ichiro hopped into the cab, and the driver drove away from the airport, adjusting the radio. He found the news.</p><p>\"Mass destruction.\"</p><p>\"Oh my,\" the driver said.</p><p>The roads were crowded but passable. Finally he made it to the farmhouse. Ichiro paid the driver and hurried inside with his things, turning on the lights and the television in the parlor. A red light on the answering machine caught his eye.</p><p>There were several messages for various members of the household.</p><p>\"Hello, this is Detective Sato. This is a message for Mr.</p><p>Ichiro Yoshida. We have some information on your wife. We have credible evidence that she was in Miyagi Prefecture within the last week.\"</p><p>Ichiro sank to the floor as Miyagi Prefecture flashed across the scream. It had been hit by a killer tsunami. Ichiro screamed.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
