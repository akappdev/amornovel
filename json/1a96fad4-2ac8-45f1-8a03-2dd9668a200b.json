Built by his grandfather in 1872, after the ravages of the Great Chicago Fire of October 10, 1871, it had the grace\u2014and even opulence\u2014of the mid-Victorian era. The staircase was carpeted in deep crimson, a shade picked up in the period furniture. Swirling drapes in black and cream adorned the parlor, and the windows were etched glass. He had changed little since his grandfather\u2019s day.</p><p>It boasted a true gentleman\u2019s den with bookshelves that lined the walls, filled with wonderful tomes, old and new. It also boasted some of his fabulous collections, the most impressive of which was his collection of Egyptian artifacts. They were legally obtained, since Austin\u2019s grandfather had been on the dig when Tut\u2019s tomb was discovered; he had lived much of his life prowling the sands of the Sahara in pursuit of discoveries. Canopic jars were kept in a temperature-controlled display case, along with funerary statuettes that were gilded and bejeweled. A real sarcophagus\u2014that of a king\u2019s illegitimate son, of little import to Egyptians at the time\u2014stood open in a corner of the room. It had been arranged in a display case of its own, built by his grandfather in the mid-1930s. He\u2019d exhibited his collection of mummified snakes and cats behind glass, as well. On one side of Austin\u2019s beautiful desk was an exquisitely crafted statue of the god Horus, adorned with gold paint and fine jewels. On the other side was a carafe, where he kept his finest brandy and glasses for when the need arose.</p> <p>Yes, Austin loved his den. He held his most important meetings here, with business associates and with fellow members of the Egyptian Sand Diggers, the Society of Chicago and scholars who loved and appreciated all things Egyptian.</p><p>He felt the need for a brandy arise at that moment. Tonight, he was happy. So happy. After more than a century of being at the bottom of Lake Michigan and her shifting sands, the Jerry McGuen might well be on her way to twenty-first-century discovery!</p><p>He knew he should go to sleep. His doctor had warned him that he had to rest and that he had to avoid sleeping aids, that he needed to take his heart and blood pressure medications and stick to a healthful regimen. He was, after all, eighty-three years old.</p><p>But...</p><p>They were on the brink of knowledge. Nothing had hit the papers yet, but come morning, divers and documentarians would, at long last, discover the Jerry McGuen.</p> <p>And, with the ship, untold treasure.</p><p>His cat, Bastet, a beautifully marked Egyptian Mau, also seemed restless that night. Bastet meowed and sidled along his leg.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, Bastet, tomorrow!\u201d He had changed for bed and wore his pajamas and a smoking robe, although he\u2019d long ago given up the cigars he\u2019d once enjoyed so much.</p><p>But a little brandy wasn\u2019t a bad thing.</p><p>He poured himself a snifter and rolled the tawny liquor against the sides of the glass, smelled it and finally sipped. He let out a soft sigh. \u201cTomorrow, Bastet, tomorrow,\u201d he said again.</p><p>But the cat leaped atop his desk with a screech that was frightening.</p> <p>\u201cBastet!\u201d He frowned. He tried to stroke the cat, but Bastet vaulted from the desk and disappeared behind the standing sarcophagus. What could be bothering the creature? Mrs. Hodgkins, his housekeeper, was long gone for the day.</p><p>The massive grandfather clock behind him began to toll the midnight hour.</p><p>He swallowed another sip of his brandy.</p><p>A cool breeze blew from the patio beyond the den; the curtains wafted.</p><p>The clock chimed three times, four, five.</p><p>And then...</p><p>He saw it. Moving in from the patio.</p><p>He sat completely still and blinked. He had to be seeing things. But, as if compelled by his vision, he rose, swallowing down the rest of the brandy. He wanted to scream. He couldn\u2019t scream, but somewhere in his mind he knew that even if he could, no one would hear.</p> <p>The clocked chimed six times, seven, eight.</p><p>It was coming...coming...coming for him.</p><p>His heart! Instinctively, he clutched his chest and felt the thundering of his heart. He groped in his pocket for his nitroglycerin pills, but just as he reached them, it reached him. The pills were knocked from his hand.</p><p>The clock chimed nine times, ten, eleven.</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d been struck by a sledgehammer. The pain was overwhelming. The thing before him was enveloped in the black of his vision.</p><p>The clock chimed the hour of midnight.</p><p>And he fell down dead.</p><p>The wee hours</p><p>Kat Sokolov slept deeply, and in that sleep, she dreamed. It was a lovely dream. She was sailing somewhere. She stood on the deck looking out at the darkness of the water and watched the stunning display in the sky overhead. The moon was full, but clouds drifted in and out, and the world seemed beautiful.</p><p>She listened to the music from the ship\u2019s grand salon, where someone was playing a Viennese waltz. Attracted to the sweet sound of the music, she turned. She wore a gown as elegant as those she saw around her. Silk and velvet, it swept gracefully as she moved. There was a celebration going on, and she could hear delighted laughter along with the enchanting strains from the piano. At the doors to the grand salon, she felt the breeze and pulled her fur stole more closely around her shoulders. It couldn\u2019t be about to snow! The moon had been too bright, too visible. The breeze had seemed so gentle....</p><p>But now it touched her like a blast of ice. When she opened the door to the salon, she felt the wind snatch it from her. It banged hard against the wall, and she was embarrassed for losing it and creating such an awful sound. But before she could apologize to anyone, the ship suddenly pitched and rolled. Glass shattered; people screamed. She thought she heard the blast of a horn, or a high, loud whistle. Then people were shouting, screaming. A voice of authority boomed out, warning people that a storm had come in, that they needed to go to their cabins immediately.</p><p>A couple pushed past Kat as if she wasn\u2019t even there. \u201cIt\u2019s cursed! The ship is cursed!\u201d the man said to the young woman at his side. \u201cOh, God! What they should do is cast out the cargo, clear us of the curse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me!\u201d the young woman cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my darling!\u201d the man said.</p><p>Then the woman seemed to see her. She looked at her with wide, desperate eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s a storm, that\u2019s all,\u201d Kat heard herself say reassuringly. She smiled at the young woman. But then she turned. There appeared to be something out on the water. Something huge coming toward them.</p><p>She felt another blast of cold. Wet cold. The lovely night had become treacherous. It wasn\u2019t snow rushing at her; it was ice. They had sailed into an ice storm.</p><p>And still, that thing was out there, mammoth, a dark shadow that couldn\u2019t quite take shape because of the raging elements.</p><p>The wind picked up again and seemed to strike her in the face.</p><p>Then she awoke, frozen.</p><p>Kat blinked. She was still in her room in the lovely California hotel where her Krewe was staying.</p><p>She almost laughed aloud. She was cold because she\u2019d kicked away her covers. Jumping up quickly, she hurried over to the thermostat. Somehow, sometime, either she or the maid had set the temperature down to the fifties.</p><p>She reset the thermostat to eighty-five.</p><p>She was much fonder of heat than cold.</p><p>That done, she dragged the extra blanket from the closet, grabbed all her covers again and curled back into bed. She\u2019d practically forgotten the dream, she\u2019d been so cold.</p><p>As she lay down, she thought it had been quite absurd. But then, of course, dreams often were.</p><p>Next morning</p><p>9:00 a.m.</p><p>The water of Lake Michigan was eerie, with different shades of gray shadows and darkness, as Brady Laurie plunged into the chilly depths. Only near the surface could anything that resembled natural light or warmth be found; the lake had always been a place of darkness and secrets. Motes seemed to dance before his eyes as the dive light on his head illuminated his journey, ever deeper into the water. Tiny bits of grasses, sand, orts from the meals of the lake\u2019s denizens swirled like dust particles, shimmering as his light hit them.</p><p>It was a world of silence down here, making every little noise sharp. The sound of his breathing and the throb of his regulator, the expulsion of his air bubbles, the very pulse of his heart.</p><p>It was a world he loved, but today he was on a mission.</p><p>He was so anxious. He shouldn\u2019t have been diving alone; he knew that. It was against every rule of scuba and salvage, but people often did it, anyway. In fact, he\u2019d met enough he-man types so sure of their own prowess that they ignored the rule all the time. He didn\u2019t usually\u2014just today.</p><p>He knew exactly what he was looking for, and the sonar on his boat seemed to have proven his theories and calculations right.</p><p>At long last, he\u2019d found the sunken ship\u2014the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>He believed in his heart that he\u2019d found her, the freighter that had carried sixty men and women to their graves, doomed along with the treasures they\u2019d brought from Egypt. The ship had sailed faultlessly all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and up the Saint Lawrence River, only to be lost on December 15, 1898, a day before the journey\u2019s end, battered and buffeted by a sudden, fierce storm. She had disappeared so close to her destination, just east-northeast of Chicago.</p><p>People had speculated then, as they still did, that a curse had lain upon the ship. The explorer who\u2019d made the Egyptian discovery, Gregory Hudson, had been aboard. And, of course, there\u2019d been a threat, etched into the stones of the tomb, warning that any man who disturbed the final resting place of Amun Mopat would soon know misery and death. Surely the passengers and crew of the Jerry McGuen had known both\u2014almost able to see Chicago, but storm-tossed in violent, winter-frigid waters, finally succumbing to the brutality of the lake and disappearing.</p><p>Yes, the ship had disappeared, never to be seen again.</p><p>Until today. He would see her again. He, Brady Laurie, would see her again!</p><p>Salvage crews had hunted for her soon after she\u2019d sunk\u2014to no avail. And through the years, time after time, historians and divers had sought her, but like many a ship lost in the murky waters of the massive lake, she was simply not to be found. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brady had been certain all his life that she had to be there. And he\u2019d excitedly put forth his theory to his coworkers that, following their recent wicked summer storm, there was a chance she could now be discovered. Violent storms altered a lake bed, just as they could alter the seabed in the Atlantic. He had seen what storms could do. A ship sunk in Florida had gone down on her side; one of the storms that had torn apart the Florida Straits had set her up perfectly again. He believed the same strength and force of that phenomenon was going to reveal the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Storms moved sand and dirt. Storms had tremendous power\u2014enough power to right a multi-ton ship. Even one lost for more than a century, a true shipwreck. His calculations had been off, but not by much. Not if what the sonar had shown him was true.</p><p>Through the dark, mystic water of the lake, he saw her.</p> <p>There she was. The Jerry McGuen!</p><p>She lay at an angle, starboard hull lodged into the lake bed, as majestic and visible in the glow of his dive light as if she were at dock.</p><p>His heart beat fast, and pride surged through him.</p><p>They\u2019d done it! They\u2019d found her.</p><p>No\u2014he\u2019d found her!</p> <p>His theory was sound, his calculations making adjustments for time, weather conditions, the power of the recent storm and the earth\u2019s rotations. It couldn\u2019t account for the various unknowns, but he\u2019d been so close. And now, as he saw it looming before him, his time had come. While that kind of storm usually sank ships, this one had removed layers of sand and almost righted the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Yes, there she was, her massive hull tempting and seductive...</p><p>Even righted as she was, she had suddenly seemed to loom before him. The lake bed made the water so dark at eighty feet.</p><p>Just eighty feet! She\u2019d been there all along, so damned close to Chicago!</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel any cold through his dive suit, but he was numb. A shiver of excitement reverberated through his limbs. All around him, the water danced in the wavy shadows of the eighty-foot depths, and he became intensely aware of the sound of his own breathing again, the pump and flow of his regulator. He wanted to shout with happiness and share his discovery with the world. Of course, he would do that soon enough, and if any of his team had followed him out today, they\u2019d already know that he\u2019d been right. Everyone would know that he\u2019d been right, including every salvage diver who had ever dreamed of finding her.</p><p>He laughed inwardly, smiling around his regulator. He was pretty sure someone had been behind him. Not that everyone on Lake Michigan had to be following him, but he thought he\u2019d seen a research vessel in the distance when he\u2019d come down.</p> <p>His coworkers might be angry that he\u2019d jumped the gun, but Amanda had already sold the story of their search to a film producer, who was going to document and finance their historic discovery. He\u2019d supplied money for the search based on Brady\u2019s theory. Now they could begin to chart out and rope off the ship and show the world the remains of the Jerry McGuen. Others interested in pursuits far less esoteric than theirs would be stopped at the gate. No more worries about Landry Salvage or Simonton\u2019s Sea Search beating them to the punch!</p><p>He could imagine the treasures in the hold. Priceless Egyptian artifacts, the still-sealed coffin of the high priest known as the Sorcerer of Giza, the sarcophagi, the army of golden figures, the canopic jars, the ancient stones...</p><p>Underwater for more than a century, he reminded himself.</p><p>But even the Egyptologists of the nineteenth century had known about preservation. Sure, they hadn\u2019t reckoned on toxins and gases, but they knew all about waterproofing\u2014gunpowder and the pursuit of war had certainly furthered man\u2019s knowledge of that!</p><p>Of course, the hold might have been compromised, a zillion things might have happened and still...what they might find!</p><p>He\u2014they\u2014didn\u2019t seek treasure or the fortune it could bring. The treasures they discovered always went to museums, and he felt a thrill rush through him as he imagined the headlines when they returned the jeweled sarcophagus of Amun Mopat to the Egyptian people. Amun Mopat would be back where he rightfully belonged, and the name Brady Laurie would be revered in Cairo\u2019s museum. Yes, yes, yes!</p><p>The Jerry McGuen.</p><p>She lay there\u2014exposed! He was so elated his heart seemed to stop.</p> <p>He checked his air gauge. He had at least another ten minutes to take a quick look at his momentous discovery, another ten minutes to explore, and then time to decompress at thirty-three feet and safely reach his research vessel on the surface.</p><p>The Jerry McGuen appeared huge, her forward section still pitched slightly into the lake bed, as if she\u2019d taken a dive while sinking. Parts of the hull were broken, exposing staterooms and a passenger lobby, and what had been the purser\u2019s office. Brady knew the ship; he had studied her plans time and time again. She was a steel-hulled ship, built by the American Stuart Company of Chicago and launched on October 2, 1888. One hundred and eighty-six feet long, thirty-two feet wide, and twelve feet in depth. Her gross tonnage was four hundred and eighty-six, and when she sailed the seas, she\u2019d been powered by a triple-expansion steam engine and two Scotch boilers. There had been fifty-two cabins for guests, captain\u2019s quarters, first mate\u2019s quarters, four cabins for officers and a bunk room, down in the hold, for crew. The ship, chartered by the very rich Gregory Hudson, had been a state-of-the-art beauty.</p><p>Her ballast for the trip had been stones\u2014great stones taken from the tomb of Amun Mopat. Before Howard Carter\u2019s discovery of King Tut\u2019s tomb, the discovery of Amun Mopat\u2019s tomb right in the Valley of the Kings had been one of the most important events in the annals of Egyptology. But the treasures had come aboard the Jerry McGuen, and just a few months after that, those treasures and their history had been lost to the ages. They were soon forgotten by the world at large as new findings occurred and the age of Egyptology moved on.</p><p>But now...</p><p>He eased himself slowly along the hull, fumbling at his dive belt for his underwater camera. As he began to snap photos, the sound of the shutter whirred softly in the water. The flash illuminated bits and pieces of the ship. There it was\u2014the grand salon, exposed by a gaping hole in the port side, encrusted in weeds and grasses, occupied by fish, large and small. The treasures would be down below.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>The hull was ripped open belowdecks, as well. He didn\u2019t have much time. Just minutes left now, but he could slip through the great tear in the port side, move along the length of the ship....</p><p>It was dark within. Eerie. Time had stolen any vestiges of life that might have remained; the cold and the elements would have eaten away at organic fabric\u2014and human bodies.</p><p>He found the hold and moved past giant crates, some protected by tarps that had withstood the years. Before him was a door, which swung open when he pushed it. The door hadn\u2019t been sealed, which might have aided in the flooding that had brought about the ship\u2019s demise, he thought, distracted. He didn\u2019t care at that moment how the ship had sunk. He\u2019d nearly reached the treasure....</p><p>As he kicked his flippers and swam through, the dive light strapped to his head suddenly went out.</p><p>He muttered to himself, tapping the light. It came back on.</p><p>He saw the boxes\u2014huge crates, really, wrapped and sealed in waterproof tarps!\u2014and in the midst of them, he could see the giant box with the label peeling and nearly gone, and yet...he could still read the name on it.</p><p>Amun Mopat.</p><p>There it was! The box containing the sarcophagus holding the inner sarcophagus and then the mummy. It had survived; the men who\u2019d discovered the treasure had stolen it away carefully sealed....</p><p>Over there, boxes of jackals and sphinxes and funerary artifacts, bows, quivers\u2014</p><p>His light went out again. Cursing silently, he tapped it. As he did, he heard a curious sound. A noise so deep in the water was different from what it would be on the surface, and yet...</p><p>It sounded like the hold door was closing on him!</p><p>The light came back on.</p><p>He stared in horror.</p><p>He opened his mouth to scream. Losing his regulator, he sucked in air, and his scream was silent.</p><p>He was stunned, terrified....</p><p>The curse! The curse, silent, unspoken in these depths...</p><p>It was real!</p><p>Yes, he had found the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>But he would not live to tell the tale.</p><p>1</p><p>\u201cAmun Mopat,\u201d Katya Sokolov said to Logan Raintree. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>The heat that had been shining through the skylight seemed to disappear, as if the sun itself had lost some energy.</p><p>The name made her shudder. They\u2019d just finished investigating a death in Los Angeles at Eddie Archer\u2019s special effects studio\u2014a death based on an old film noir remake. The original movie had been titled Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. The new one, fittingly, was called The Unholy.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not kidding,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>He had a fascinating face, the result of Native American and European parents, handsome and filled with character. She had learned to read it well, and she knew\u2014he was not kidding.</p><p>Amun Mopat.</p><p>It was the name of the insidious ancient Egyptian priest who had supposedly come back to life to perpetrate murders. He was a character in a movie.</p><p>A character used in the very recent tragedies that had taken place.</p><p>And now...Amun Mopat?</p><p>\u201cAmun Mopat, yes,\u201d Logan said, almost as if she\u2019d spoken aloud. He leaned back, looking around with a sigh. They sat in the beautiful little lobby-caf\u00e9 of their boutique hotel, surrounded by wrought-iron lattice work and art deco design. The past weeks\u2014although somewhat traumatic in the final resolution and cleanup\u2014had still contained some nice upswings. They\u2019d seen tapings of half a dozen TV shows, including Kat\u2019s favorite comedy, spent days at the beach in Malibu, visited the Magic Castle and other attractions, and actually experienced something that resembled a vacation.</p><p>This meeting didn\u2019t bode well. She\u2019d received the call to meet Logan while she was enjoying a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits. It had been an urgent call, and she\u2019d known it meant she wouldn\u2019t be seeing a retro performance of the Rocky Horror Picture Show that night with Tyler Montague and Jane, two of the six in their special FBI unit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d wondered if the others were going to be involved, but she was sitting here alone with Logan.</p><p>She had all but forgotten her strange dream of the night before. And now, even as it seemed to come crashing down around her, she wondered what a storm at sea could have to do with Amun Mopat.</p><p>The curse. She\u2019d heard the words in her dream. Egyptian entities always seemed to come with curses!</p> <p>\u201cGo figure. After all this\u2014Amun Mopat. In Chicago,\u201d Logan said in a dry voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, go figure. Chicago,\u201d she repeated blankly.</p><p>Logan Raintree was her superior, the head of their team. Their actual boss was the elusive Adam Harrison, who had begun this excursion into the unknown\u2014and the known\u2014combining FBI technology and certain...unusual talents. Logan worked loosely with the head of the first team, Jackson Crow, evaluating information from those who sought help and deciding which cases truly called for their unique abilities. Since the original group of special investigators had become known as the Krewe of Hunters, they\u2019d unofficially been dubbed the Texas Krewe. Their first case had been in San Antonio, home to many of them. Working with Logan and the other team members was thrilling and gratifying at once; it felt as if they spoke an ancient and secret language, and had come together as nationals from the same foreign country.</p><p>At the moment, she wasn\u2019t feeling especially thrilled. Or gratified. She wished she was back at the Tar Pits.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to go out there now?\u201d Kat asked. She didn\u2019t add alone.</p> <p>Logan glanced at his watch.</p><p>\u201cYes. It could be nothing.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd it could be something. But we\u2019re talking about a dead body, and the autopsy is probably being performed as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago is a big city, and I\u2019m sure they have a fine staff of medical examiners and pathologists,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they do, too. But before too much time goes by, I want you in on it. Even the best people in their fields can miss little signs and clues, especially when they\u2019re convinced by the circumstances that they\u2019re looking at an accidental death.\u201d</p><p>Everyone on the Krewe had his or her technical or \u201creal world\u201d specialty.</p><p>Hers was forensic pathology.</p> <p>\u201cAmun Mopat,\u201d Kat said again. \u201cIn Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned forward. \u201cAs I said, this could be nothing\u2014nothing at all. That\u2019s why I need you there first. Sean is still out in Hawaii, but he\u2019s been alerted,\u201d he said, referring to another of their team members, Sean Cameron, who had been most heavily involved in the recent occurrences. \u201cAnd we still have a few loose ends here\u2014the last of the legal documents, another deposition\u2014so I\u2019m keeping Kelsey, Jane and Tyler with me. If it\u2019s a tragic but simple case of drowning, there\u2019ll be no need for the whole team. In that case, we\u2019ll meet back at headquarters. But if it\u2019s something else...\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded dully. There was a dead body. She was a medical examiner. The dead body, of course, wasn\u2019t an ancient Egyptian priest. It was a historian and diver.</p><p>Who had died. Searching for a sunken ship in Lake Michigan.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed I was on a ship last night,\u201d she told Logan.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the passengers were talking about a curse.\u201d</p><p>His expression was serious. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be able to use that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cMaybe it was to warn me I was about to head off\u2014to Chicago. And a sunken ship. And a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think in our line of work,\u201d he said, eyebrows raised, \u201cwe\u2019ve learned that curses are pretty much things people invent when they want to do something evil for their own gain. And you may only be there a few hours. Who knows? The situation might just be that this diver went overboard in his excitement when he should have waited for the other researchers. The entire discovery was supposed to be filmed. But, like I said, he didn\u2019t wait. His excitement might have led to carelessness, which is probably what happened. And there\u2019s always competition to salvage the treasure on a sunken trip. But because we\u2019ve been helped by the documentary crew in question, I feel it\u2019s important that we help out in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s doing the documentary?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cAlan King. We barely saw him when we were in San Antonio, but he had a bad time with the documentary there, especially losing his star. Apparently the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center\u2014where our dead man worked\u2014is struggling like the rest of the world. They need funding.\u201d He studied his papers. \u201cOne of the staff, Dr. Amanda Channel, sent out queries to various film people and hit upon some friends of ours\u2014you remember Bernie Firestone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he\u2019s frequently hired by Alan King, who can make films whenever he wants because he has billions\u2014no, he didn\u2019t make his billions in film. He\u2019s able to do documentary films because he does have billions. Bernie approached Alan, who loved the idea, and there you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean should be available soon,\u201d Kat murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s worked with them before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s needed, he\u2019ll be there. Remember\u2014we don\u2019t know if this is anything at all. Anyway, if you do end up staying, you\u2019ve at least met Alan and you know Bernie and his cameraman, Earl Candy. Right now, you\u2019ll take a look at the deceased, read the autopsy report, talk with a few people\u2014and, if there\u2019s nothing, we\u2019ll all meet back in Virginia. Requests for our expertise are already piling up back at headquarters.\u201d Logan paused. \u201cBut like I said, I feel we\u2019re in debt on this one. There\u2019s also the fate of a historical institute on the line, not to mention an incredible discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s ironic?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cI thought that, too, but then, not so much. Not really. When the original Sam Stone was filmed in the early forties, the sinking of the ship in Lake Michigan had occurred half a century earlier. A writer, one who was fascinated by Egyptology, would readily have seized upon a real priest for his story. I looked into it and found out that the original screenplay was by a man named Harold Conway\u2014who was born in Chicago. He grew up going to the Field Museum and hearing stories about the Jerry McGuen. The priest\u2019s actual mummy, with the inner and outer sarcophagi, as well as other treasures, went down with the ship. So our screenwriter would definitely have known about Amun Mopat, and he was obviously interested enough in the historical character to use him in a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Kat muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, it could be an M.E.\u2019s dream,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA mummy? An anthropologist\u2019s dream, not mine,\u201d she retorted. \u201cBut...all right, so I\u2019m to examine the body and try to discern if he died by natural means, or...\u201d</p><p>She let her voice trail off.</p><p>They dealt with the unknown, the world that lay beyond the veil. Their \u201csixth sense.\u201d</p><p>But Logan had a point. In her experience, and in that of the others, they\u2019d never come across a ghost or a curse that killed.</p><p>It was human beings who killed other human beings.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not expecting to find much left of the people who went down with the ship,\u201d Logan was saying. \u201cAccording to the records, there were no survivors, and no bodies rose to the surface\u2014or none that were found or recognized. But I\u2019ve read that time would have destroyed even their skeletons by now. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cUnless someone was caught in a sealed area, it\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019d be any remains. Time and sea creatures take their toll. They may find skeletal remnants, but only once they\u2019re into the bowels of the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it really is one big watery grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does seem respectful to salvage what might be important to history and the living, and then let the ship itself stay where it sank, a memorial to those who were lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s the eventual plan.\u201d Logan flipped a page in the file that lay before him on the table. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alone,\u201d he told her, grinning as if he\u2019d read her mind. She wasn\u2019t afraid of being alone, nor was she unaccustomed to the strange and unusual.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA member of the original Krewe is out there now. He happened to be visiting an old buddy in Chicago when this came down. You\u2019ll meet up with him. His name is Will Chan. He\u2019ll stop by to see Alan, Bernie and Earl this afternoon, and he has an appointment with the people at the Preservation Center bright and early tomorrow morning. He\u2019ll meet you at the morgue at 10:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but do I need to reach him first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Head straight to the morgue. Will\u2019s going to catch up with you there.\u201d Logan handed her the folder. \u201cHis contact information is in here. Between the two of you, we\u2019ll have a good sense of what\u2019s going on, be it too much enthusiasm by a diving historian\u2014or a predator with an enthusiasm for murder. Oh, and Alan King has hired private security to guard the dive site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can guard a dive site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a diver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I dive because I love it, not because I\u2019m looking for lost treasures.\u201d Kat offered him a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019ve seen salvage from the Titanic and the Atocha in museums. I never went looking for them. And I usually dive in nice warm water in the Caribbean or the Gulf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvage rights are complicated. Federal law says that all wrecks belong to the state that claims the waters. Depending on what\u2019s found, ownership of artifacts and the wreck itself may wind up in court for years. But the Preservation Center did file papers for the right to dive and work on the wreck. However, it\u2019s not the legal aspect that people worry about as much as the black market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther divers stripping the site and selling salvage illegally?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t begin to imagine what can be bought and sold on the black market.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill...it\u2019s got to be tricky, raiding a dive site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s been done. Hence, the security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have gone diving in cold water, right?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you pack a good dive suit. I understand the water temperature ranges between fifty and sixty at this time of year, and I believe that\u2019s kind of cold when you\u2019re down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in Lake Michigan.\u201d Kat frowned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been involved with the discovery of a wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you\u2019re all excited now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcited. Well...I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the best word to describe how I\u2019m feeling, not after we nearly lost Madison Darvil to Amun Mopat\u2014or his look-alike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew that Amun Mopat wasn\u2019t the killer. And we know that mummy isn\u2019t swimming around planning to kill anyone who discovers the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that anyone is killing people at all yet,\u201d Kat said. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably been asked in because Alan King is feeling a little worried\u2014since his luck with documentaries hasn\u2019t been so good lately.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked up at the skylight. Then he looked back at her. \u201cNo, we won\u2019t know anything until you examine the body and get more information. Since Alan has hired private security near the site, hopefully no one else will be exploring the area and ending up dead while the situation is investigated. You\u2019re booked on a 5:40 p.m. flight out of Burbank. You should be in a nice cozy room by midnight, and then tomorrow... I\u2019ll be waiting to hear what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t find the answer in the autopsy?\u201d Kat asked him. \u201cOr in anything else we\u2019re able to examine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll join you\u2014and figure out where the answer does lie.\u201d</p> <p>Kat nodded and sipped her coffee. The sun seemed to come out again and stream through the skylight overhead.</p><p>\u201cYou have information on the ship, the sinking, the discovery of the tomb\u2014all kinds of stuff\u2014in the folder,\u201d Logan said. \u201cAlong with info on all the principle players working on the discovery and preservation of Egyptian antiquities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBe glad it\u2019s not the dead of winter?\u201d</p><p>There was no keeping down a true scholar.</p><p>Will Chan hadn\u2019t come for a lesson in Egyptology, but it seemed to be part of the interview.</p><p>Senior researcher Jon Hunt grew animated as he spoke, saying, \u201cAmun Mopat lived and died during the reign of Ramses\u2014Ramses II, the most powerful ruler of the New Kingdom and the nineteenth dynasty and perhaps the most powerful of all the great pharaohs or god-kings of Egypt. Ramses ruled from 1279 BC to 1213 BC, and it appears that Mopat, reputed to be a shady character, was born in the same year and the same month, which seemed to be a great oracle to people at the time. Ramses was first drawn to him, believing in the power of sorcery. Amun Mopat lived a life of luxury, respected and consulted on most important matters of state. Ramses, you\u2019ll remember, was a warrior king. He\u2019s the one with Moses in all the movies\u2014the villain, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept,\u201d Amanda Channel\u2014also a senior researcher\u2014interjected, \u201chistorians have argued constantly over the true factual dates of \u2018the time of Moses.\u2019 And whether or not he eventually expelled the Hebrews from Egypt, Ramses II was a builder and a soldier and a peacekeeper. In short, a remarkable ruler. Living in a world with a totally different belief system, of course. Must have been nice to be a god, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Will sat in a conference room at the offices of the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center as he spoke with\u2014or, more accurately, listened to\u2014Jon Hunt and Amanda Channel. Both of them were trying to explain everything at once, or so it seemed. More than three thousand years of ancient Egyptian history, Brady Laurie\u2019s tragic death and the story behind the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Apparently neither of them needed to take a breath very often. And they switched from Egyptian history to Brady and then to the Jerry McGuen with record speed.</p><p>But then, Egyptian history, Brady and the ship were now joined for all eternity.</p><p>\u201cBrady loved anything that had to do with ancient Egypt,\u201d Jon said. \u201cHe could rattle off every pharaoh in every dynasty in the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom more quickly than your average high school kid could come up with all fifty states.\u201d</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t sure most high school kids could rattle off all fifty states.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Amanda jumped in, her voice almost a fluid continuation of Jon\u2019s thoughts, \u201cBrady especially loved the New Kingdom, and everything that\u2019s been learned from excavations in the Valley of the Kings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoward Carter\u2019s discovery of King Tut\u2019s tomb happened after the discovery of Amun Mopat\u2019s. Since the treasures of Mopat\u2019s tomb\u2014a good portion of them, anyway\u2014went down with the Jerry McGuen, a lot of important artifacts and information were lost to history,\u201d Jon explained. \u201cAnd Amun Mopat, much as he wanted to be a god, was only a priest. Tut had been a pharaoh.\u201d</p><p>He actually paused for breath and Amanda remained silent. Will took the opportunity to survey the conference room; there was an excellent bust of Nefertiti on a counter that stretched out from the back wall. Next to her were a dozen or so canopic jars, all copies, according to Amanda and Jon.</p><p>He assumed they were telling the truth. Next to the canopic jars was a large coffee urn, and the usual collection of paper cups, sugar, creamer and whatever else one might desire for a cup of coffee. Nothing truly valuable would have been kept so casually and haphazardly where coffee could spill at any time.</p><p>He\u2019d only had a quick glimpse of one of the workrooms. It was sterile in appearance except for a piece Amanda had been working on, a funerary statue that had been dug out of a pit in the city\u2014property of someone who\u2019d lost everything in the Great Chicago Fire. The fire had occurred in 1871, before the sinking of the Jerry McGuen, but collectors had been avid about ancient Egyptian pieces for a hundred years by then, and there\u2019d been those who\u2019d coveted Egyptian art even before Napoleon\u2019s soldier had cracked the code in 1799 and translated the Rosetta Stone.</p><p>\u201cBrady was being an ass,\u201d Amanda said mournfully.</p><p>Jon Hunt immediately looked offended, and Amanda softened her words.</p><p>\u201cAn ass in the way we can all be asses. Jon, please, I\u2019m not insulting him. I\u2019d say the same thing about us. We get too excited about a discovery like this.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBrady grew up hearing his great-grandfather talk about the disappearance of the Jerry McGuen. Maybe that\u2019s when he fell in love with Egyptology. Or maybe it started with the visits to the Field Museum. And you can imagine how he felt, considering what he knew about both Egyptology and the Jerry McGuen. We can\u2019t help it. I guess we\u2019re real nerds\u2014oh, my God! Who would\u2019ve thought that being a nerd could be dangerous? We think we know what we\u2019re doing, and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was brilliant.\u201d Jon shook his head as if he still couldn\u2019t accept that his friend and coworker was dead.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant\u2014and, this one time, so foolish!\u201d Amanda said. \u201cYes, I admit the rest of us hadn\u2019t totally believed in his theory. I mean, we believed\u2014we just weren\u2019t as insane about it as Brady. That\u2019s how we work. Even when we\u2019re not convinced that someone else is right, we work with them to find out. And all of Brady\u2019s calculations did make sense. We were scheduled to start looking together. If they hadn\u2019t been sound theories and calculations, we wouldn\u2019t have approached the film director\u2014Mr. Firestone. Oh, if Brady could just have waited...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have been right with him,\u201d Jon said. He gritted his teeth. \u201cI was the one who found him,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe found him,\u201d Amanda corrected.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I was the first to see him...floating there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have two boats,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cHe took one out ahead of us. We have a small, exploratory dive boat, and then our larger vessel. It was Saturday and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jon interrupted. \u201cIf only it hadn\u2019t been a Saturday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were supposedly off work, but Brady called both of us that morning. He said he was going to take the boat out and use sonar,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cSeriously, finding anything actually salvageable on the McGuen was always a long shot, but Brady believed that the treasures taken from the tomb had been so carefully packed, there was a real chance. I thought we were going to start on Monday, but he called me. I called Jon, and we agreed we\u2019d go out with him, but he\u2019d already taken the smaller boat. We let him know we were on our way, but I think he ignored us because he had to prove it to himself first. He shouldn\u2019t have gone down to the wreck. He shouldn\u2019t have gone down alone\u2014he knew that. I was furious with him. Before we found him, of course.\u201d She paused, looking at Jon and then at Will and added, \u201cI was afraid. We didn\u2019t want to lose our funding.\u201d She glanced at Jon again, as if feeling guilty about something she\u2019d done while trying to rationalize it at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWe brought out our second boat\u2014the big one, Glory\u2014and found the Seeker at anchor. There was no sign of Brady. And it was wrong of him, because Mr. King, the producer, said from the beginning that he\u2019d finance us as long as we let him document every step\u2014right or wrong\u2014along the way,\u201d Amanda told Will.</p><p>\u201cI think Brady was afraid we\u2019d start work, and there\u2019d be no ship,\u201d Jon said. \u201cAnd if that was the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d already taken money,\u201d Amanda broke in. \u201cIt\u2019s also really competitive, diving for salvage. It can be confusing, too, with U.S. laws, state laws, international laws...except that we\u2019re not in it to make a fortune. A 1987 federal law says the states own all wrecks found in their territorial waters, but there\u2019s still money in salvage. There\u2019s another law about disturbing a grave site, but really, there can\u2019t be anything left of the people.... Except if the mummy itself was properly sealed... The thing is, we believe in returning antiquities. What we\u2019d earn would be a percentage of what Mr. King makes in IMAX films and the like. Of course, he gave us a hefty sum as a down payment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew something was wrong when the boat was empty, and Brady\u2019s dive flag was still out,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d Amanda continued, \u201cMr. King\u2019s director, Bernie Firestone, and some of his crew came out with us, taking their boat\u2014nice and fancy, all kinds of great stuff on it\u2014and two of his underwater cameramen followed us down. And...and we found Brady.\u201d Tears welled in Amanda\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was great. He\u2019d found the Jerry McGuen,\u201d Jon said bitterly. \u201cAnd we found him.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda let out a little choking sound. They both stared at Will, their eyes soulful and wet.</p><p>Amanda was thirty-two, a pretty woman, reed-thin and passionate about her work. Jon, her coworker, was a few years older. His brown hair was graying at the temples and he wore bottle-thick glasses and was also thin. He was wiry and seemed fit as the proverbial fiddle.</p><p>Their attempt to explain everything to him at once seemed to point to their clinical and obsessive pursuit of knowledge. They both spent hour upon hour\u2014day upon day\u2014in their little cubicles or labs, painstakingly dusting or chiseling away the dirt and dust of the ages. Sometimes, they got to go on a dig or a dive, but most of the time, they were in their offices and labs.</p><p>Will liked everything he\u2019d read about the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center. He\u2019d always been intrigued by history himself, especially by the way many societies\u2014including the ancient Egyptians\u2014used mysticism and magic.</p><p>As Amanda had said, the center kept none of the antiquities it discovered or worked on; its sole purpose was to preserve historical artifacts, delve into their secrets and pass them on to their homelands or an institution worthy of guarding and displaying them. It had been founded in the latter part of the nineteenth century by Jonas Shelby, an avid Egyptologist. In the years since, grants and private donations had added to Shelby\u2019s legacy, and while the \u201ctreasures\u201d came directly from ancient Egypt, they might also have been discovered in a Chicago backyard.</p> <p>Amanda suddenly frowned at Will. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure why you\u2019re here, Agent Chan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe brought Brady right up. He was dead by then. Obviously dead.\u201d Jon grimaced. \u201cWhen I radioed in the emergency the guy kept telling me to give him artificial respiration. I would\u2019ve done anything for him\u2014but Brady was dead when we brought him up. Like Amanda said, the filmmakers followed us down, so there\u2019s actually footage\u2014\u201d he broke off \u201c\u2014footage of us finding Brady. The film crew has it. And the police have a copy, too.\u201d</p><p>Will listened gravely. He knew that already. He\u2019d spent yesterday with Alan King, Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy. Alan didn\u2019t dive, but Bernie and Earl did. Alan was deeply worried about his future in film; it was not a good thing if people kept dying on the films he produced. Will had seen the footage of the two divers coming upon their dead coworker. Luckily, neither of the men was the kind of person to leak such footage to YouTube or any other site.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell Jon or Amanda that he\u2019d seen the film. He wanted to hear their version of everything that had happened.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was taken right...right to the morgue,\u201d Amanda said. She appeared stricken, as if she\u2019d begin crying again. \u201cHe drowned down there, and it\u2019s tragic. To us more than anyone else, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drowned,\u201d Jon said flatly. \u201cWhy is the FBI investigating?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour filmmaker.\u201d Will smiled and leaned across the conference table to pick up a copy of the Sunday paper, lying there. The headline read Historian Dies Tragically During Greatest Discovery\u2014Accident or Victim of Ancient Curse?</p><p>\u201cOh, please!\u201d Amanda said. \u201cSeriously, oh, please! That\u2019s just a reporter scrambling for headlines. I saw Brady. He drowned!\u201d She sighed. \u201cListen, I loved him like a brother. But we have to keep going on this, and quickly. We\u2019ve gotten the rights to dive her first and salvage what we can. And Brady was absolutely correct. The precious cargo down there was carefully\u2014carefully!\u2014wrapped and stowed. We\u2019d dishonor Brady\u2019s memory if we didn\u2019t complete his mission!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, back up for me, please. You have the rights of salvage? Didn\u2019t you need to find the ship first?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Amanda flushed. \u201cOur paperwork is all on file. We have a maritime attorney on hand who has us all ready to go with recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if another person or enterprise had found her first....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose someone else could have filed for the rights, as well,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cBut no one else had Brady\u2014or studied the effect of storms on the lake like he did.\u201d</p><p>Will doubted that a competing group would care how someone had determined the location of a treasure. They would just want the bottom line. \u201cWho else has been searching for the Jerry McGuen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThrough the decades?\u201d Jon shrugged. \u201cAnyone with a ship, sonar or a dive suit.\u201d</p> <p>Will smiled. \u201cRecently. Do you know of anyone or any other enterprise searching for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago there was an article about a company called Landry Salvage that was interested. Their CEO was quoted in a local TV piece on the wreck,\u201d Amanda said.</p><p>Jon was thoughtful, drumming his fingers on the conference table for a moment before speaking. \u201cThere\u2019s also a company called Simonton\u2019s Sea Search that was interviewed briefly for the same piece. It was one of those little five-minute news segments, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never occurred to you that since the treasure on the ship is worth a fortune, someone else might be eager to acquire that fortune?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone could just keep everything, or that a salvage effort on the lake wouldn\u2019t be spotted!\u201d Amanda insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, but whether the treasures were returned to Egypt or turned over to our government,\u201d Will said, \u201cthe finder\u2019s fee or percentages could be staggering. Though I\u2019m not seeing a legitimate bid as something that\u2019s likely to supersede yours. The black market is where the real money would be.\u201d</p><p>Amanda shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s why we needed to find it. Stop the black market activity. And we still need to get down there fast, although...thanks to Brady, our papers have been filed.\u201d</p><p>Will lowered his head, hiding his expression. The world did go on. They\u2019d found Brady\u2019s body in the ship\u2014and they\u2019d made sure their legal work was done, probably as soon as Brady Laurie was on his way to the morgue.</p><p>\u201cThe mission won\u2019t be stopped\u2014will it? I mean, I know there\u2019s competition out there, but Brady drowned. I saw him.\u201d Amanda\u2019s eyes were anxious as she looked at Will. \u201cPoor Brady\u2014but he must have died happy. He did find the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p><p>Will doubted that Brady had died happy. Drowning was a horrendous death.</p><p>\u201cThe salvage is not being stopped,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd, so far, the medical examiner\u2019s conclusions are that Brady Laurie died as a result of forgetting his deep-water time because of his excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...why the FBI?\u201d Amanda asked, obviously still puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThe director of the documentary is an old friend of Sean Cameron\u2019s\u2014Sean\u2019s an agent in one of our special units\u2014and the producer, Mr. King, is anxious about what\u2019s happened. Not to mention all these rumors about the curse. Because of their association with us and their concern that the salvage and the documentary go well, they came to the agency. And because our most senior officer, Adam Harrison, has great relationships with state governments, we were invited in. We\u2019re not sensationalists. We\u2019re here to disprove a curse, as much as anything else and, hopefully, make sure there are no more accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Amanda said, blinking away tears again. \u201cWell, as long as our work isn\u2019t stopped. Brady\u2014oh, God, I miss him, I loved him, but he was acting like a cowboy. He just had to get down there before we were really ready. He knew not to dive alone. I mean, come on, an experienced diver knows never to dive alone. Anywhere. Not even in shallow reefs in the Keys, much less here. He just thought he was better than anyone and... We are diving the wreck tomorrow? An exploratory dive before we start with the salvage?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Will assured her. \u201cEverything will go ahead as planned. Just one change,\u201d he told her pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ll be joining you, and so will another member of my unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Amanda was obviously dismayed. \u201cMore people down there? You don\u2019t understand how careful you have to be with artifacts. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Dr. Channel,\u201d he said. \u201cMy colleague and I will meet you at the dock tomorrow morning.\u201d He rose to signal that he was leaving\u2014and that he\u2019d be back.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Amanda started her protest and then frowned. \u201cI could probably answer any other questions you might have right now. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have another meeting,\u201d he informed her, \u201cbut I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled politely and exited the room, and then the Preservation Center.</p><p>It was situated near the aquarium, on South Lake Shore Drive, and when he stepped out the front door, he saw Lake Michigan. The water glittered in the sun, and he wished he could get out on a boat in a dive suit right away, but he had a meeting with a member of Logan Raintree\u2019s crew.</p><p>And with a dead man.</p><p>He turned away from the lake and headed for his rental car.</p><p>2</p><p>More than eighteen thousand deaths were reported to the Cook County office of the medical examiner yearly. Of those, some six thousand received an autopsy.</p><p>The office handled investigations for a large part of the state; in January 2011, there\u2019d been such a backup due to the number of bodies and the holidays, they were stacked one on top of the other. The morgue had been overcrowded due to what the press had dubbed \u201cthe killing season,\u201d when gang violence had erupted on the South Side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat knew these things because she\u2019d done nothing but read since she\u2019d boarded her plane for Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.</p><p>Cook County wasn\u2019t different from any other large metropolitan area. People died. Thankfully most of them died naturally.</p><p>But some did not. Some died because of gang violence, and sometimes they died in police custody or in jail. Some died because of domestic violence, and some were simply and pathetically in the wrong place at the wrong time\u2014victims of random crime. Some died \u201csuspiciously\u201d or without apparent explanation.</p> <p>Despite the fact that she wasn\u2019t in Chicago because she wanted to be, she wasn\u2019t disturbed by her particular assignment here. While many people feared a medical examiner\u2019s office as a frightening and gruesome place, Kat had always found that an autopsy\u2014though invasive\u2014was a service that man had come to do for man. It was an effort to let the dead speak for themselves, to seek justice, find a killer or, conversely, prove accidental death when no other human was at fault. Autopsy helped the living, too; some medical advances would have never come about without autopsies determining the cause of death. In medical school, she hadn\u2019t started out feeling that she\u2019d rather work with the dead than the living. It had been during her residency that she\u2019d discovered she had a penchant for unspoken truths...and that, even when silent, the dead could sometimes tell their tales.</p><p>The Texas Krewe\u2014her unit of their section within the FBI\u2014was supposed to investigate whatever couldn\u2019t be answered by the evidence. Usually it wasn\u2019t because of incompetence or because leads weren\u2019t followed by the local police. They were called in when the leads themselves were unusual. Some people described those leads as paranormal.</p><p>But in this instance...</p><p>A diver had jumped the gun. He\u2019d jumped the gun on an incredible discovery mainly because he was the scientist who\u2019d been determined to find the wreck of the Jerry McGuen. He\u2019d been looking for ancient Egyptian treasures lost along with the ship.</p><p>And those treasures included a mummy.</p> <p>It just had to be a mummy! she thought, wincing as she conjured up an image of Brendan Fraser and his hit movie. And of course there was the mummy in The Unholy\u2014the recent Hollywood remake of a 1940s film noir\u2014had been that of an evil Egyptian priest who\u2019d turned out to be real.</p><p>\u201cSad beginning to this whole thing, huh?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Katya looked over at Dr. Alex McFarland, the M.E. who walked her down the corridors and past offices, vaults and autopsy rooms. He seemed a decent enough sort, cordial and receptive. Bald as a billiard ball and wearing spectacles, he reminded her of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew of Jim Henson\u2019s Muppets fame, the epitome of what the general public expected a doctor or scientist to look like.</p><p>\u201cVery sad,\u201d she agreed. The victim had been in his thirties, an expert on Egyptology and an expert diver. A young man with his life stretching out before him.</p><p>And now that life was cut short.</p><p>McFarland rolled his eyes. \u201cTragic...and almost no one\u2019s talking about the boy\u2019s death. Of course, the disappearance of the Jerry McGuen has been one of the great mysteries of Lake Michigan since she went down in the late-nineteenth century. There\u2019s more coverage given to the discovery than to the poor boy\u2019s death. And God help us all\u2014the curse! But, then again, although Chicago is hardly considered to be one of the world\u2019s great dive spots, the lakes hold a lot of wrecks where divers frequently go. I don\u2019t dive myself, but we have many professional and recreational divers in the area. Many of them say he was being careless, that he took chances in his excitement and shouldn\u2019t have been diving at seventy-five, eighty feet on his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should always dive with a buddy,\u201d Kat said. \u201cSadly it\u2019s often the divers\u2014even expert divers\u2014who go out on their own who wind up in autopsy. There are no guarantees in the deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy this. Like I said, the Great Lakes are filled with shipwrecks. I find the lakes and wrecks fascinating. I\u2019ve studied them all my life\u2014to the point of obsession, I\u2019m afraid. Many are known, but many are not. Lake Michigan has a surface area of 22,400 square miles and its average depth is 279 feet with its greatest depth being about 923 feet,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest lake completely contained in one country in the world, and ranked fifth largest on the globe.\u201d</p><p>McFarland obviously loved Chicago. He sounded very proud of the lake.</p><p>But then he sighed. \u201cLots and lots of room for tragedy over the years, and lots of room for ships to disappear. Sure, finding wrecks in the deep, frigid waters of the North Atlantic is a challenge, but if you\u2019ve ever looked out at the lake, you might as well be staring at an ocean, it\u2019s so immense.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him; McFarland knew the power of water, and he seemed well up on his history of the area. He was as fascinated as everyone else by the discovery of the sunken ship.</p><p>\u201cThe exploration is still going on,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo I understand. The world doesn\u2019t stop spinning because one person has died.\u201d McFarland shrugged. \u201cYou have heard that everyone\u2019s talking about a curse, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Normally, of course, they would never have been called in because of an accidental death that occurred while a man was scuba diving. Such deaths would be handled by the medical examiner\u2019s office, but there usually wasn\u2019t any hint of paranormal activity, so no reason for their unit to be brought in.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the wheels of progress when there\u2019s been a great discovery, I guess,\u201d McFarland said.</p><p>\u201cEvery day is money,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSomeone\u2019s livelihood. In this case, many livelihoods.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Kat didn\u2019t know nearly as much about film as Sean Cameron or a few of the others who belonged to one of the \u201cKrewe\u201d teams, but from their time in California she\u2019d learned how much money could be involved. In the file Logan had given her she\u2019d read that production prep had already begun; crew and talent had been hired. Of course, Alan King was, according to Forbes, a billionaire, so if he lost money on the enterprise, he\u2019d probably be just fine. But making the documentary meant much more to the struggling historians running a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the past.</p><p>Sean would arrive soon. He\u2019d taken a short holiday with Madison Darvil after their last case. When they got back from Hawaii, Madison would resume her work in California, and Sean would come here.</p><p>She smiled just thinking about it. She loved Sean; they were old Texas friends. She felt sure that he and Madison would be able to keep up with their demanding jobs\u2014he with the unit, she with her work at a special effects company\u2014and maintain a relationship.</p><p>Kat returned her attention to Dr. McFarland and the situation. At the moment, however, that didn\u2019t seem to help. Whatever had happened to Brady Laurie was still confusing.</p><p>But in every case, someone needed to speak for the dead....</p><p>\u201cWell, from what I understand, Alan King doesn\u2019t care if he loses money on a film as long as he produces a documentary that makes him proud,\u201d Kat said to McFarland. \u201cKing already has his director and shipboard cameraman\u2014who are two men my team and I actually know. They\u2019re from San Antonio. I understand that King also has underwater videographers on-site, ready to detail every single step of the ship\u2019s recovery...and that they were there when members of the Preservation Center found Mr. Laurie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the information I have, too,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the site. The body was brought here. And I swear that man hadn\u2019t been out of the water for more than two seconds before the curse hysteria started.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe in curses; she did believe in the way a curse could be used to prey on people\u2019s minds. She\u2019d seen people die because of what they were convinced was true, hearts that had stopped beating because of fear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an Egyptian tomb that doesn\u2019t come with a curse\u2014or at least a rumored curse,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>McFarland grinned. \u201cI see you\u2019ve read up on all this. The man who discovered Amun Mopat\u2019s tomb, Gregory Hudson, was aboard the Jerry McGuen when she sank, which, of course, gave rise to the belief that the curse is real. To tell you the truth, the only curse I see is the wicked Chicago weather. But you\u2019ve probably heard our old saying. \u2018If it weren\u2019t for the weather, everyone would want to live here!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jerry McGuen carried the mortal remains and effects of the New Kingdom, nineteenth dynasty priest\u2014or sorcerer\u2014Amun Mopat, beloved of</p><p>Ramses II,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe had his own burial crypt and chamber built before his death. He\u2019d filled it with treasures and\u2014in his own hand, the story goes\u2014chiseled a curse into his tombstone, damning anyone who disturbed his eternal life. Or disturbed the place where his body rested while he joined with the pharaohs and gods. He was apparently quite taken with himself. He wanted to be a god like the pharaohs.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAccording to some of the research a colleague pulled for me, he had blood ties to Ramses II. He felt he should have been seen as a god all his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very good. You seem very well informed.\u201d McFarland shrugged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019ve called the FBI in on this, except that...curses and ghosts are your specialty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I\u2019m qualified to be here, Dr. McFarland,\u201d Kat told him. \u201cI received my doctorates in medicine and forensic pathology from Johns Hopkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you were well qualified, Dr. Sokolov\u2014and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand what we\u2019re dealing with better than the fellow who\u2019s already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Chan is here now?\u201d she asked. She wished she\u2019d had a chance to meet with him earlier. Introductions over a corpse were always a bit awkward, even if she was a medical examiner and far too familiar with morgues. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, he arrived about ten minutes ago. He said you were informed that you\u2019d be meeting him. He\u2019s not a doctor,\u201d McFarland said, his tone irritated and more than a little condescending.</p><p>\u201cBut he is an agent,\u201d Kat reminded him.</p><p>McFarland opened the door to the autopsy room; they were both gowned and gloved.</p> <p>Kat usually noted the corpse first.</p><p>But this time she noted the man who belonged to the original Krewe.</p><p>He greeted her as she entered, with words rather than a gloved hand. \u201cHello, Dr. Sokolov, I\u2019m Will Chan. I believe you were expecting to meet me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Logan told me you were already in the city,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to stare at him in obvious assessment.</p> <p>But she did. She probably would\u2019ve been tempted to stare at him anywhere. He wasn\u2019t just an appealing, attractive or handsome man, he was different, and not merely because of his striking appearance. There was an aura about him, an energy that immediately caught and held her attention.</p><p>She had to look up at him, but she was only five-four, so it seemed that she looked up at most of the world. Somehow, with him, it was...disconcerting. Or maybe it was the circumstances that were disconcerting. We don\u2019t know each other, except for what we know about each other. And yet...</p><p>She\u2019d been given so many files to read on the plane, she had to mentally put what she knew about Will in order. He\u2019d become an agent with the original Krewe of Hunters when they\u2019d solved a case at a historic mansion in New Orleans. Before that, he\u2019d performed as a magician and an illusionist. He was also astute with video, film and discerning what was really just smoke and mirrors, recognizing what lay beneath the surface. Will had gone through the academy and passed with flying colors. He was a talented agent.</p><p>And, of course, he\u2019d happened to be in the city.</p><p>She cleared her throat, not wanting to seem gauche. \u201cLogan gave me an extensive file,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a film expert, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a few things about it,\u201d he said, lowering his head with a quick smile. \u201cI come from a long line of illusionists.\u201d</p> <p>He was tall with intriguing features. His background was Trinidadian and he\u2019d spoken with a slight accent that made her think of the Caribbean island. His hair was dark. His eyes, just as dark, were slightly almond-shaped. His features suggested Asian and perhaps Indian antecedents, and then again, there was something classic about them. His face seemed to be sculpted in the mold of a Roman statue, but with the rugged chin of an American cowboy. She found herself studying him\u2014and almost forgetting that he was standing beside a corpse.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m one of Jackson Crow\u2019s team, and most important, I was in Chicago when this happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kat nodded. \u201cAnd so...what have you learned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t learned anything yet,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone over the autopsy report with him,\u201d he added. \u201cWe knew you were on your way.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded again, but looked at Will Chan.</p><p>McFarland had no idea just what this man\u2014a Krewe member who could speak with the dead\u2014might have learned.</p><p>She glanced away from Will Chan with determination, unable to still the curiosity stirring within her. As part of Jackson Crow\u2019s team, he\u2019d been specifically chosen for his position.</p><p>Because of a special talent.</p> <p>McFarland drew out his report and frowned as he studied it. \u201cAs we all know, Mr. Laurie was a white adult male, thirty-six years old. No alcohol in the system, no drugs. His body was found drifting in the hold of the Jerry McGuen, at a depth of eighty feet in Lake Michigan, Chicago jurisdiction. Autopsy revealed no sign of violence and showed that Mr. Laurie was in perfect health at the time of his death. The lungs were filled with salt water, so I\u2019m planning to officially sign off on this report as death by drowning, accidental.\u201d</p><p>Kat gazed at the corpse. When it came to their unofficial role with the Krewe of Hunters, she was always glad of her medical degree and her specialization in pathology.</p><p>People didn\u2019t think she was crazy when she touched the dead.</p><p>She moved forward, inspecting the dead man and then touching his arm.</p><p>She waited, hoping for something. A sense that he was still there, and that she could communicate with the remnants of his life, spirit or soul.</p><p>But she heard nothing in her mind, saw nothing at all in the part of her own soul that was different from other people\u2019s. Her skill, or gift, or whatever one chose to call it, was out of the ordinary\u2014but shared by some. Like Will Chan...</p><p>She glanced up at him again. He was watching her, and his striking dark eyes divulged none of his thoughts.</p><p>Stepping back, she gave her full attention to the visual aspect of the corpse.</p><p>Drowning. She hadn\u2019t done the autopsy herself. She saw that Dr. McFarland\u2019s Y incision was neatly cut and just as neatly sewn with small, competent stitches. It didn\u2019t take a brilliant doctor to detect when the lungs were filled with water, and she didn\u2019t doubt his conclusion on that.</p><p>She turned from the body to the report. The man had definitely drowned.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t like the coloration of the corpse. Blue lips\u2014natural, given what had happened. However, the lips were also puffy, and one side of his mouth seemed more swollen than the other. And there were curious bruises on the arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware of the bruising?\u201d she asked McFarland.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He was obviously indignant at her question. \u201cI make painstaking notes. Every bruise is listed in the report, and you will have a copy of it for your files.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to ignore McFarland and Chan, studying the body once again. She was certain that McFarland was adept at his work\u2014and from what she\u2019d seen thus far, his notes were painstaking, just as he\u2019d said. But the medical examiner needed to note the condition of a corpse and assess possible causes for that condition. McFarland\u2019s Y incision on the dead man had been nothing short of artistic, and she was sure he\u2019d inspected the man\u2019s vital organs and taken all necessary samples for the pathology lab.</p><p>Brady Laurie showed no postmortem lividity in his lower extremities, which led her to believe that he\u2019d floated, probably upright, after death.</p><p>But the bruising on his face still bothered her. So did the bruises on his arms. Those were smaller\u2014the size of fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you make of these?\u201d she asked McFarland.</p><p>\u201cBruises. As I mentioned, they\u2019re noted in the report,\u201d McFarland said curtly.</p><p>Chan cleared his throat as he eased around the gurney. \u201cWhat would\u2019ve caused bruises on both arms?\u201d he murmured. Kat had the same question. They weren\u2019t as conspicuous, perhaps, as the contusions around his mouth, but unmistakable nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cThe man was a diver. He was dealing with a lot of equipment. He knocked around in one of the ship\u2019s holds until he was found by other divers from the Preservation Center,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cHe could have gotten them from an air tank or from some of the equipment he had piled on him. He was carrying a camera, and he was wearing one of those headlights divers use during night dives or cave dives. There was a dive knife strapped to his ankle. He had a huge light on the camera, as well\u2014and, like I said, he bounced around the hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...I don\u2019t think we should discount these bruises,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Chan seemed to agree. He moved around the corpse again, studying the bruises on Brady Laurie\u2019s arms. Then he angled forward. \u201cThey look like fingerprints,\u201d Chan said. \u201cSee? If I were to reach out and grab him...\u201d</p><p>He demonstrated, putting his fingers just above where the bruises showed on the flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou think he was held down?\u201d McFarland sounded skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Chan said, and he turned to Kat.</p><p>\u201cMore than possible.\u201d She stepped forward, gently touching Brady\u2019s lips with her gloved fingers. \u201cAnd there\u2019s some injury around the mouth....\u201d</p><p>McFarland seemed troubled now, staring at the corpse and then referring to his notes. Finally, he shook his head. \u201cMr. Laurie was down in that hold alone. All alone. I don\u2019t know anything about him as a man. Perhaps he had a temper. Maybe he got into an argument with someone before he went down. Maybe someone grabbed him roughly. I imagine he had a few bouts with his fellows at the Preservation Center. He could have gotten these bruises in a scuffle with a friend\u2014even roughhousing for fun.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked at him incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the body of a man who engaged in any kind of serious fight!\u201d McFarland said firmly. \u201cThe bruises are small. There\u2019s no injury to any of his bones. There are no real cuts, just some chafing around the mouth. He came in here having drowned. He definitely did drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you assumed he might have been in a scuffle?\u201d Will asked. \u201cDo you often hear of fistfights among historians who don\u2019t agree with each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real violence to the body. And historians are human like everyone else,\u201d McFarland said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I spent the morning with this man\u2019s coworkers\u2014and there was no difference of opinion. They all wanted the same thing,\u201d Will told McFarland. He sighed. \u201cDoctor, please look at these bruises. Look at the way they match my hands. Think about a regulator. If it was ripped out of a man\u2019s mouth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have exactly that kind of trauma,\u201d Kat finished.</p><p>\u201cAnd exactly that kind of bruising,\u201d Will said impatiently.</p><p>His tone made McFarland bristle, and Kat frowned at Will.</p><p>He ignored her.</p><p>Despite the tension in the room, Kat kept her hand lightly on the icy-cold arm of the corpse. She knew that Will was right; she had noted the particular patterns of the bruises on Brady\u2019s arms almost immediately. And combined with the marks around his mouth, they suggested certain conclusions. But then, she was a diver. McFarland was not. And the man who\u2019d been brought to him had been floating alone in the hold of a sunken ship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At this rate, however, they weren\u2019t going to be welcome back at the morgue.</p><p>She wished she could get some feel for the man who\u2019d been Brady Laurie.</p><p>Nothing. She was getting nothing from the body. If only Brady Laurie was still somehow here...but his body was cold. Empty.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. It\u2019s...it\u2019s not like he has massive bruising anywhere,\u201d McFarland sputtered.</p><p>\u201cThe bruises may darken, giving us a better idea,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been dead that long,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cHe might not have gone ten rounds at the WWE SmackDown,\u201d Will put in, \u201cbut it looks to me as if he was held in a firm grip shortly before his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that one of his coworkers could have gotten angry enough to have killed him. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re out to claim the treasures for themselves,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d McFarland\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cWhat? A mummy crawled out of an inner sarcophagus and an outer sarcophagus\u2014not to mention careful waterproofing\u2014to rip his regulator out of his mouth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThis man was the one who discovered the ship! He was alone down there,\u201d McFarland emphasized.</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2014and maybe not,\u201d Will said. \u201cOthers had to have known. Brady Laurie had done careful charting before the preservation group sent out requests for financial help, trying to sell their research as a documentary. This is the age of computer hackers, so plenty of people could\u2019ve found out. And Lake Michigan hasn\u2019t been closed, has it?\u201d</p><p>Kat wanted to kick him for his sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cAgent Chan, I have been at this job for over twenty years,\u201d McFarland began.</p><p>Kat stepped in quickly. \u201cOf course, Doctor, and your autopsy and notations are commendable. But there are factors involved that weren\u2019t included in the information you were given. You had no reason to suspect foul play. But with the possibilities out there\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat possibilities? A curse! A swimming mummy?\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged and replied casually, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure the mummy would have deteriorated if it had somehow come to life,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney, Doctor. A treasure of inestimable worth. We don\u2019t know if any other party discovered the wreck due to Brady\u2019s research. It might have been a simple drowning. And then again, maybe not. At this point in the investigation, we have no idea who else might have been out on the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died by drowning,\u201d McFarland insisted.</p><p>Will raised his eyebrows. \u201cYes, he died by drowning. But whether it was accidental or not\u2014that\u2019s a completely different question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really suggesting he was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than suggesting, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s quite likely,\u201d Will said. \u201cYour findings were absolutely correct, Dr. McFarland, except that...they weren\u2019t. Brady Laurie was grabbed and he was held in the water. He drowned not because he ran out of time, but because his regulator was ripped from him. That\u2019s why he has injuries on his lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung man, what you\u2019re suggesting is a remote possibility!\u201d McFarland said.</p><p>\u201cRemote? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDr. McFarland, the point is...there is a possibility,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAnd not so remote,\u201d Will added.</p><p>He looked over at Kat. He was challenging her to step up to the plate. She wasn\u2019t in the least worried about doing that; she just wished she didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>She looked back at Will, who watched her steadily. And then, her heart sinking because she\u2019d so badly wanted this to be nothing, she turned to McFarland. \u201cDoctor, this is your morgue and your call. But...under the circumstances, I\u2019d change that report if I were you. At the very least, hold on to it for a couple of days and let us do some more investigating. There\u2019s a good possibility that this was willful death caused by person or persons unknown.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cCould you have been any ruder?\u201d Kat demanded of Chan.</p><p>\u201cCould he have been any more incompetent?\u201d he fired back.</p><p>They were out on the street. Car horns blared now and then, and the whir of fast-moving traffic seemed to be all around them.</p><p>Kat shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s still nothing to actually prove him wrong, Agent Chan. The bruise could conceivably have been caused by jostling around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never went to medical school, Agent Sokolov, but I don\u2019t think you need a degree to recognize bruises on postmortem flesh. My fingers fit perfectly into those bruises, so I\u2019d say whoever killed him had nice large hands. Brady Laurie wasn\u2019t any kind of a hulk, although he was certainly strong enough to defend himself to some degree. But you dive, so surely you\u2019re aware that a lack of oxygen can quickly deprive you of energy and skill, leaving only the instinct to survive\u2014and fight against whatever is keeping you from breathing. An actor in a James Bond movie may be able to hold his breath forever while waging a heroic battle, but in most instances, you expend what air you have in trying to fight, and then...\u201d He broke off, his implication grim. \u201cAnd you agreed with my findings. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have said what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe your findings suggest further investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond a doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that would usually suggest not insulting the medical examiner to the point that he doesn\u2019t want you back in the morgue! In any city, we need to be on the best terms with local authorities,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>Will Chan stared back at her for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cAll right, fine. I should have tiptoed around his feelings. We should have pleasantly gone along with him\u2014and then he would\u2019ve released the body and we\u2019d be left with nothing. Well, excuse me. You can go back in and ask the good doctor out for coffee or drinks, but I\u2019m headed to the police station.\u201d</p><p>He turned and started walking. Kat glared at him, her temper soaring. She decided to go after him and practically had to run to keep up with his long strides. She caught him by the arm and was surprised by her own strength when she spun him around to face her.</p><p>\u201cLook, my team was the one called in. You just happened to be here. This is my investigation, and I need you to stop your high-handed behavior before you offend every cop in the city of Chicago, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I offend a cop who\u2019s dealt with a situation competently?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been informed that I\u2019ve already begun the investigation. I did so right after Logan Raintree got the request and called Jackson Crow and Adam Harrison with the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Except that you offended the medical examiner. Did you offend the film people, too? Or any of the others we\u2019ll have to depend on for access and information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t offended anyone, Agent Sokolov. What I did was conduct a very professional meeting with the film crew and then speak to the two researchers who worked with and found Mr. Laurie. I\u2019ve politely informed them that we\u2019ll be diving with them tomorrow. Unless, of course, you prefer to maintain your investigation here on the surface. I will certainly understand.\u201d</p><p>She wondered what would happen if she simply combusted with anger on the street.</p><p>\u201cAgent Chan, it was my understanding that I was to examine the corpse at the request of the producer, Alan King, and that if I found anything I didn\u2019t believe to be completely straightforward, then an investigation would begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Agent Sokolov, I was told last night to step right up and get things going since I was in the city. That\u2019s what I did. When a body pops up, the first hours can be the most important\u2014as you know\u2014so time was of the essence. Would you like me to share what I\u2019ve learned? Or would you rather let someone else die while you start your own investigation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I\u2019m a professional, but I cannot work with this man!</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cYou do realize, Agent Chan, that we didn\u2019t just go in and prove that Brady Laurie was murdered. Yes, it\u2019s possible that he was held in some way while his regulator was ripped from him, but it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion. There are other reasons such bruising might have occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidence locker,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurie\u2019s dive gear is in an evidence locker down at the police station, since the police were with the rescue units when he was brought in. I\u2019m going down there to meet up with the local investigator and see exactly how much air was left in Laurie\u2019s tank.\u201d He paused. \u201cI was a day ahead of you\u2014although, yes, it\u2019s your case. I\u2019ve seen the footage that was taken when the body was discovered. Laurie was dead when they found him, which wasn\u2019t long after he\u2019d gone down himself. I still can\u2019t accept that it was a simple drowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014whoa! I didn\u2019t know there was footage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s footage. And you can call Bernie right now, or you can take my word for it. I haven\u2019t been to look at the evidence yet, but I intend to. You can get together with King Productions now or come with me and see the footage later. Your call.\u201d</p><p>She really wished it would be professional just to slap his determined and impatient face.</p><p>Another deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s my call, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will come with you. As you pointed out, I can see the footage later.\u201d</p><p>He stood his ground but seemed slightly taken aback, something of a smile almost curving his lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not on opposing sides,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who makes what call. We\u2019re here to find out if a murder has occurred, and if an investigation is necessary. I\u2019m here for Brady Laurie, Agent Chan, not for a pissing contest with you.\u201d</p><p>Now his lips did curve into a full smile. \u201cSorry. But the M.E.\u2019s findings were just too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if there was no reason to suspect foul play, his findings really weren\u2019t negligent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re defending him because he\u2019s an M.E.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only saying what\u2019s true, especially in a big city where you can have days when the bodies just pile up,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll apologize when I see him again\u2014if I see him again\u2014and let\u2019s pray I don\u2019t. As to the rest, time can mean everything in this kind of investigation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m not sure whether we can answer all the questions we need answered or if those answers will lead to more questions. If we find air in the tank...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s a good chance he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d turned already. She suddenly hated the fact that he was as tall as he was. Keeping up with him was an effort.</p><p>\u201cEven if the air is gone, we can\u2019t be certain of what happened. The air might have bled out after he died,\u201d she said, catching up with Will. \u201cAnd if there is air in the tank, it still doesn\u2019t prove that the regulator was ripped from his mouth.\u201d</p><p>He stopped so abruptly that she plowed into him. He reached out one hand to prevent her from falling.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t prove anything one way or another, not without additional evidence. But it will be interesting to find out if there is or isn\u2019t air in his tank and to take a look at the regulator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a car?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got into my room around midnight. I took a cab from the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the garage.\u201d</p><p>He started walking again. This time, she kept a certain distance.</p> <p>He\u2019d rented a Honda. When Kat climbed in, he indicated a folder thrust between the seats. \u201cNotes from my meeting with Amanda Channel and Jon Hunt at the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center\u2014and what I\u2019ve dug up from recent newspaper clippings.\u201d</p><p>Kat quickly leafed through the folder while he maneuvered the car out of the parking garage. The center sounded like a truly commendable enterprise. Nonprofit, it was dedicated to preservation. The staff was small and included three researchers, a receptionist and a general assistant. Grad students came and went. Of course, now with Brady Laurie gone, it was down to two researchers.</p><p>\u201cLandry Salvage and Simonton\u2019s Sea Search,\u201d she murmured, skimming various articles written about the elusive Jerry McGuen. \u201cThese can\u2019t be the only two parties interested in finding the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that over the last century, countless individuals and companies have tried. Think about discoveries in the past. Both the Titanic and the Atocha took years and years of fruitless searches before finally being discovered.\u201d He glanced over at her. \u201cLaurie must have been a brilliant historian and scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as brilliant a diver,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have gone down alone.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cMaybe it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the first person to come across the treasure was supposed to die,\u201d he said cryptically. \u201cOr maybe his coworkers weren\u2019t supposed to be so close behind him, who knows? But I believe we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have a lot of confidence,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>He flashed her a smile that was surprisingly charming. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do\u2014find things out. So far, my team hasn\u2019t stopped until we\u2019ve gotten the answers. Don\u2019t tell me your team gives up so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t given up yet!\u201d Kat said indignantly.</p><p>His smile remained in place as he drove.</p><p>At the station, they were led first to one desk and then to another, and finally to the officer in charge of the accidental death investigation, Sergeant Riley. His supervisor had advised him to expect fed agents, and while he was pleasant and seemed to have no problem offering them assistance, he was confused about why they were there. \u201cSad, but the way the papers tell it,\u201d Riley said, \u201cLaurie went down on his own and drowned. You would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d know better. Every year, every damned year, there\u2019s a diver lost somewhere in the lake, some fool so convinced of his own ability that he just goes down\u2014and comes up dead.\u201d Riley was in his early thirties, tops. He was medium in height and size, and wore a white tailored shirt with the sleeves rolled up. \u201cAt the moment, the personal effects found on the corpse are in the evidence room. We\u2019ll go sign them out and you can study them all you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there when Brady Laurie was brought up?\u201d Kat asked him.</p><p>\u201cThey were on the lake. Our marine unit went out to the site. He was declared dead at the hospital, but there\u2019d been attempts at resuscitation before that. I took over the investigation when his wet suit and dive tanks were sent to us, and I\u2019ve been awaiting the medical examiner\u2019s report, but...I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t expecting anything to come of it,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>He walked them back to the evidence cage, where they were introduced to the officer in charge and signed in. \u201cWas the equipment tested for leaks?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cImmediately. No problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFingerprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Chan said.</p><p>Riley frowned. \u201cIs that a problem? I doubt we\u2019d have gotten anything, anyway, since divers in the lake wear gloves. And then, of course, our technicians worked with the equipment to find out if it was faulty in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>In the evidence area where the tank, regulator and buoyancy control belt had been stowed, along with Laurie\u2019s weight belt, Will looked back at Kat. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d Laurie\u2019s equipment had not been disassembled; the \u201coctopus\u201d with the regulator, secondary system and computer console was still connected to the air tank.</p><p>Will examined the computer at the end of one of the hoses. He grimaced and beckoned to Kat. She came over and stood next to him, staring down at the dials. Brady Laurie had died with five minutes of air still available.</p><p>\u201cThere was air in his tank,\u201d Will explained to Riley. \u201cAfter it was checked out for leaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so there is,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThen he must have panicked and spit the thing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperienced divers don\u2019t panic when they have a regulator and air. He had a secondary system, too,\u201d Kat said thoughtfully. \u201cProperly attached to his BCV.\u201d Riley was looking at her blankly. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, indicating the buoyancy control vest. \u201cHe could easily have reached for it if he\u2019d had difficulty with his main regulator,\u201d she said, pointing to the mouthpiece. \u201cIt allows for the flow of air.\u201d</p><p>Riley shook his head. \u201cWe really think it was just a tragic accident.\u201d</p><p>Kat stepped in front of Will. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sergeant Riley. We don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking over the investigation?\u201d he asked. To Kat\u2019s astonishment, he sounded hopeful.</p><p>He must have read her mind. \u201cHey, big city here, folks. I have my hands full, so...the chief already sent down orders to set you up in one of the conference rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Will said. \u201cThank you.\u201d He pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket. \u201cCan you see that we have access to this equipment, and a technical officer if need be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want that we\u2019ve got,\u201d Riley assured them.</p><p>\u201cCan you also connect us with the officer in charge of the marine patrol unit?\u201d</p><p>Riley was happy to do so. He was happy, perhaps, to do anything that would make them someone else\u2019s responsibility.</p><p>Outside the station, Kat took out her phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell Logan I can\u2019t say for sure that Laurie died by accident,\u201d she explained to Will. \u201cDo you need to call in, as well? Now might be a good time.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to report yet. Jackson Crow knew I\u2019d be staying on for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I happen to love Egyptian history,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou seem delighted that there might have been a murder,\u201d she said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDeath never delights me.\u201d His voice had grown serious. \u201cYou came into this expecting an accidental drowning\u2014which is also what the police believed. But whenever there\u2019s big money involved and a massive black market, I expect trouble. We need to put a stop to it or it\u2019s going to continue.\u201d He studied her for a moment. \u201cHey, this is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in this if you can\u2019t hack it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hack it just fine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou forget I\u2019m a doctor\u2014a certified medical examiner and forensic pathologist. I\u2019ve studied all manner of deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly\u2014you constantly remind me.\u201d</p><p>He walked away so she could make her call.</p><p>Kat looked after him, frustrated, her temper soaring again. Then she flushed and turned away. Was she afraid she didn\u2019t have control of the situation? Mental note: quit reminding people that I\u2019m an M.E.</p><p>Wincing, she made her call.</p><p>She told Logan that yes, it appeared that they should investigate, although she had nothing solid as yet. He promised that more team members would be there within twenty-four hours. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that you\u2019ve met Agent Chan?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s capable and professional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that,\u201d Kat said drily.</p><p>\u201cAnd what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ass,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe stomped all over the Chicago M.E. I try to speak first now to protect us from the wrath of local authorities.\u201d</p><p>Logan chuckled softly. \u201cI know Chan. I met him at our special units base in Arlington. He\u2019s, shall we say, irreverent, but apparently excellent at what he does. He\u2019s familiar with film, video and computer alteration, so he\u2019ll be great with the film crew. And he dives, which is a major asset on this case. Are you going to see the Jerry McGuen soon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I know Chan, very soon,\u201d Kat said, glancing over at her new colleague.</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted on any developments,\u201d Logan told her. \u201cI should be there by midafternoon tomorrow.\u201d Then he rang off and Kat returned the phone to her purse, signaling that the call was finished.</p><p>Chan approached her seconds later. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>Their next stop was the harbor, where the police search and rescue boat that had brought in the body was docked.</p><p>The harbor and the lake were beautiful that day. Summer was still with them but would begin to fade in the next few weeks. Today, though, the water glistened under a benign sun.</p><p>They were able to see all four officers who\u2019d been on the search and rescue boat. Officer Aldo Reynald had been in charge, and he seemed sincerely interested in their queries.</p><p>\u201cWhen we got there, the woman was crying her eyes out...Amanda. Yeah, Amanda Channel. She was kneeling over the dead man. She said she\u2019d done CPR, but she didn\u2019t think it helped. She said we had to save her friend. The other guy, Jon Hunt, was walking around the dock, rubbing his chin, scratching his head. I tried CPR as we got him to shore. No luck. We have a state-of-the-art truck to deal with emergencies like this. You get a lot of divers who think they know their stuff and don\u2019t, or divers who are used to the tropics and get into trouble in the lake. And naturally we have boating accidents, so...we\u2019re prepared. We used every possible method of resuscitation on the way to the hospital, but...then we got there and they called it.\u201d He shook his head glumly. \u201cI\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to have to be vigilant as this whole thing proceeds because diving a wreck is inherently dangerous, and a newly discovered one even more so.\u201d</p> <p>Reynald was lean and fit; he was obviously experienced, practical\u2014and compassionate.</p><p>\u201cBut you believe he was dead when you arrived?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>He nodded grimly. \u201cDead as a cold mackerel, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Will asked next.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been dead more than half an hour or so,\u201d Reynald told them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m basing that on, other than that I\u2019ve pulled more than a few bodies out of the lake. Like I said, he was declared DOA at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there other boats near the dive spot?\u201d Will asked.</p> <p>\u201cBoating on a good day on Lake Michigan? You bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to the dive site?\u201d Kat continued for Will.</p><p>Reynald drew in a deep breath. \u201cYeah, near enough, I think. The other Preservation Center boat was there\u2014as well as the one the dead man had been on. Oh, and the film crew has a snazzy research boat, too. There was a sailboat maybe two hundred feet away and others farther out....\u201d</p><p>One of his fellow officers chimed in. \u201cThere were two motorboats nearby. One was a Cigarette\u2014nice speedboat. I noticed that because I always wanted one. The other...a little cabin cruiser. Looked like the people aboard were fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing,\u201d Kat echoed dubiously.</p><p>The officer grinned. \u201cNot that long ago, Lake Michigan was so polluted you could die from eating fish you caught out there. But it\u2019s cleaned up. You\u2019ll find lots of people fishing in the lake now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice anything else about the boat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither have a dive flag up?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d the second officer replied.</p><p>\u201cWe were called in on an accident, and rescue was our main objective,\u201d Reynald told them. \u201cI feel like a fool because we\u2019re also law enforcement officers. Do you suspect it was more than an accident?\u201d</p><p>Kat answered carefully. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet. We\u2019re just investigating at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re here anytime you need us,\u201d Reynald said.</p><p>They thanked him. As they headed back to the car, Will seemed thoughtful. He glanced over at her. \u201cYou tired? You want to call it quits for the day?\u201d</p><p>She scowled back at him. If she\u2019d been falling off her feet, she\u2019d never have admitted it to this man. \u201cI\u2019m fine. What do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo quick stops\u2014Landry Salvage and Simonton\u2019s Sea Search. Neither may really help. Salvage companies don\u2019t usually drive around in Cigarette speedboats, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if someone else is searching for treasure, that person may not be involved with a salvage company at all,\u201d Kat added.</p><p>He paused at the car door, looking over it. \u201cTrue. But you have to know something about diving to get down there. You\u2019d have to follow the research to find the ship\u2014and you\u2019d have to follow Brady Laurie out to the site...and gone after him right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s someone who works for a salvage company,\u201d Kat suggested. \u201cNot the company itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my bet.\u201d Will grinned as she joined him in the front seat. \u201cYour choice\u2014Landry or Simonton\u2019s Sea Search first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimonton\u2019s. I like the alliteration,\u201d she said.</p><p>Simonton\u2019s was just north of the pier. There was a massive vessel with all kinds of cranes and netting at the dock. The office itself was small and looked more like a sea shanty than a professional building. Inside, Kat was surprised to see that it was nicely outfitted with modern office furniture and file cabinets that occupied most of the wall space. The walls were decorated with old anchors, flags and other boating paraphernalia. A receptionist who introduced herself as Gina led them to a back room, where the walls were decorated with sea charts and maps, and the rear wall held the figurehead of a beautiful siren.</p><p>The man standing behind the desk was in a windbreaker, deck shoes and jeans. His desk was strewn with papers, despite the computer that took up at least half of it. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Andy Simonton,\u201d he greeted them. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>He was young, maybe thirty, with slightly shaggy blond hair and bright blue eyes. He swept out a hand to indicate the chairs in front of his messy desk. They sat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the FBI?\u201d he asked curiously. He didn\u2019t seem afraid or threatened in any way, but rather intrigued.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking into the death of Brady Laurie,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cSad affair, that drowning,\u201d Simonton murmured.</p><p>\u201cThis is your company?\u201d Kat asked him.</p><p>Simonton nodded. \u201cMy father\u2019s company, really. He wants to retire. I\u2019ve been handling the business for about a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your business, exactly?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Simonton looked confused. \u201cUm, salvage.\u201d</p><p>Will had the grace to laugh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, what type of salvage? What are you working on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Simonton said. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting two recovery missions. A Florida boater underestimated the power of the lake and sank a sixty-foot sailboat, and we\u2019re also working on recovering the cargo from the hold of the Mystic Susan\u2014she\u2019s a merchant vessel that went down with crates of high-fashion clothing,\u201d Simonton explained.</p><p>\u201cThat does sound like work. Not terribly exciting,\u201d Kat said sympathetically.</p><p>Simonton gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cIt pays the bills, and quite nicely, too. Oh, and Mrs. Ciskel\u2014she\u2019s the wife of the Florida boater\u2014is furious because she had a lot of jewelry aboard when their boat went down. I\u2019d like to find that cache myself. To return to her, of course. She\u2019s promised a massive bonus if we get back all her jewels.\u201d He frowned. \u201cNow, what\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering if you\u2019d ever had any plans to explore and salvage the Jerry McGuen,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cWe were invited to the reception put on by the Egyptian Sand Diggers.\u201d</p><p>Kat glanced at Will. \u201cThe Egyptian Sand Diggers?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>Simonton waved one hand in the air. \u201cThey\u2019re a local service club\u2014and they\u2019re just a little nutty, you know? In love with all things ancient Egyptian. Some of them are true scholars, while the rest are more what you\u2019d call armchair historians. They held a reception about six months ago, and they shared all sorts of current information on expeditions into the Valley of the Kings, the closing of the Great Pyramids for maintenance, stuff like that. And they had an exhibit on Gregory Hudson\u2014he\u2019s the guy who discovered the Amun Mopat tomb way back\u2014and the Jerry McGuen. They were trying to encourage local salvage companies to search for her. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the time or money to go on a wild-goose chase, although I wish I had gone on that goose chase. I suppose the location is pretty well-known by now and anyone might have found her after she shifted on the seabed. See, it was wide open. The State of Illinois gets everything recovered in this area of Lake Michigan, but the salvage company that finds it does get certain rights. The original company went bust soon after the sinking of the Jerry McGuen and the passengers\u2019 families were paid off with what was left, so any descendants aren\u2019t really a factor. Now, as far as the salvage goes, the State of Illinois would probably return most of it to the Egyptians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know of anyone else who was planning to go after the ship?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cLandry,\u201d he said. \u201cHe and my dad were always competitive. Maybe he wanted to find it just to rub in my dad\u2019s face\u2014or my face now. He was at the reception, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many boats do you have, Mr. Simonton?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a little Mako for my own pleasure,\u201d Simonton said. \u201cYou can go see her if you want. She\u2019s sitting right outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis looks like a good operation.\u201d Kat smiled. \u201cAnd obviously a successful one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all about paying the bills,\u201d Simonton said. He tapped a pencil on his desk. \u201cCan I do anything else for you? I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m kind of busy and...well, honestly, I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re after.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe think someone helped Brady Laurie drown,\u201d Will said bluntly.</p><p>Simonton gaped at him. \u201cWow. Well, I can\u2019t see how that could have happened. I mean, his own people were right behind him and they\u2019re the ones who found him.\u201d He sat back, staring at them, still not threatened, just surprised. \u201cUm, you\u2019re welcome to search anything we own or, uh, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. If we need to search, we\u2019ll get back to you,\u201d Kat said. \u201cWhat we could use is information on the Egyptian Sand Diggers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure!\u201d He started rummaging through his desk. \u201cThat invitation is in here somewhere.... They used nice stationery and calligraphy on it.\u201d</p><p>He gave up with a sigh and stood, heading out to the receptionist\u2019s desk. \u201cGina, can you find me that invitation from the Egyptian Sand Diggers?\u201d</p><p>Simonton stood by the door as Gina searched for the invitation. Kat leaned over and whispered to Will. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call the Tribune and announce that we\u2019re looking for a murderer? We\u2019re not even sure of it ourselves!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat? You think people will believe the FBI is involved because we want to dive a wreck?\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth again, but before she could respond, Simonton returned with the invitation. \u201cHere you go. Their address is right there, where it says RSVP.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kat said, accepting it. She smiled. \u201cYou were really helpful. I hope we can count on you in the future, if we need to.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a warm smile in return. \u201cOh, you bet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a lovely job. Maybe I should let you do all the talking,\u201d Will muttered as they left the office.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cMr. Simonton was quite...taken with you. That\u2019s good. He\u2019ll help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Chan, that is hardly\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProfessional? Sorry. But you were being all nicey-nice, and in this case, it seemed to work. I say we go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say it\u2019s better than you offending M.E.s and cops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcFarland needed to know that he\u2019d make a fool of himself if he crossed Laurie off as an accidental death. Now he knows, and he won\u2019t do it. And I was perfectly polite with the cops. I don\u2019t blame them. This is a tough town, and when they can close the books on a situation, they have to do it. I honestly don\u2019t think it occurred to most people working the drowning that it might have been an assisted drowning\u2014or murder. Now, they\u2019ll think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going out to talk to Landry or the Egyptian Sand Diggers?\u201d Kat asked. She decided to let his previous remarks\u2014a backhanded compliment if ever there was one\u2014slide.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check out Landry first,\u201d Will said.</p><p>Kat agreed, getting out her phone.</p><p>Will glanced over at her. \u201cAre you getting someone to look up the Sand Diggers?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>After a brief conversation, Logan promised that he\u2019d learn whatever he could about the avid amateur Egyptologists. By the time she\u2019d finished, they were pulling into a lot by the glass-and-chrome offices of Landry Salvage.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be doing a bit better here, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked Kat.</p><p>\u201cEither that, or they\u2019re more impressed with appearances.\u201d</p><p>Where the offices of Simonton\u2019s Sea Search had seemed like an old-fashioned sea shanty, Landry\u2019s was almost sterile. The floors were bare, the white walls adorned with single black strokes of paint. The reception desk was sparse, and the woman who greeted them was young, very pretty and very blank. It seemed to take her several minutes to figure out who they were, and then several more to understand what they wanted. The little sign on her desk identified her as Sherry Bertelli.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh!\u201d she said at last. \u201cOh! You\u2019re here about the professor or the Egyptologist or the...whatever he was who died so tragically!\u201d She pushed a button on the single piece of office equipment before her. \u201cMr. Landry, the FBI is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>They heard an impatient reply. \u201cThe FBI? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>Kat leaned over the desk. \u201cAgents Katya Sokolov and Will Chan, Mr. Landry. We\u2019d like to speak with you. We\u2019re hoping you can help us.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of dead silence, and then Landry said, \u201cOf course. Come on in. Ms. Bertelli will escort you.\u201d</p><p>Sherry Bertelli rose quickly. \u201cThis way, please.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to tell where glass walls and doors met. They went down a long hallway. Eventually Sherry Bertelli pushed on a glass panel, and they were ushered into another state-of-the-art ultramodern office where Landry was standing behind a black chrome desk.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, how do you do?\u201d he asked, stepping around to shake their hands. \u201cI\u2019m Stewart Landry. Have a seat, please, have a seat. Would you like coffee or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, thank you, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Kat assured him. Will held one of the chairs for her, then took his own. Stewart Landry sat back at his desk. Sherry Bertelli just stood there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all, Sherry, thank you,\u201d Landry said.</p><p>Without a word she turned and marched out of the office. Landry cleared his throat. \u201cSherry\u2019s, uh, very popular with our clientele,\u201d he said, as if excusing his receptionist\u2019s undeniable limitations.</p><p>Landry was somewhere between fifty and sixty years old. His suit was designer label, his nails were clean and buffed and his silver hair was well groomed. Kat had to wonder if there wasn\u2019t something more intimate going on between him and Sherry than the typical employee-boss relationship.</p><p>\u201cNow, how can I help you?\u201d Landry asked.</p><p>\u201cFrankly,\u201d Will said, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to find out if you\u2019d considered diving the site of the Jerry McGuen. We understand that a group called the Egyptian Sand Diggers was encouraging local interest and, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read or seen on the news, a diver died at the site.\u201d</p><p>Landry frowned. \u201cYes, I saw the news, and I knew Brady Laurie. He was quite angry at that reception and behaved rather badly. He wasn\u2019t a member of the group, made very clear that kind of thing was beneath a true historian such as himself. He argued with the members that he was already on the case, and that he and his colleagues needed to find the treasure, not any of us \u2018money-grubbing bastards.\u2019 Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014the death of any young person is lamentable. But Dr. Laurie was out of line. The Egyptian Sand Diggers invited us all to that soiree, and I think it was because they didn\u2019t believe Laurie was right in his calculations. He was, of course. That\u2019s obvious now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you plan to dive the site at all?\u201d Kat asked, returning to the original question.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHonestly? It was an intriguing thought. But as to planning any operation\u2014no. Our big ship is out in Lake Huron working on a ferry that went down. We have some smaller vessels working more shallow waters, but as to the Jerry McGuen... If Laurie hadn\u2019t found her, we might\u2019ve made an attempt to see what our sonar could identify in the area. Thing is, no one really knew exactly where she went down, other than that she was supposedly near Chicago. You might not realize it, but the lake is huge. Searching it is almost like searching the North Atlantic. When you\u2019re just looking at the lake, it seems to stretch out forever. And when you\u2019re boating on it alone, you can feel as if you\u2019re the last man on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the treasure in the Jerry McGuen is of inestimable worth,\u201d Will commented.</p><p>Landry nodded. He smiled suddenly. \u201cBut searching for that kind of treasure\u2014needle in a haystack. I can tell you that Brady Laurie was obsessed with it. I wasn\u2019t shocked when I heard about his death. He was threatened by all of us\u2014no, no, that came out wrong. No one ever threatened him, but...check with the Egyptian Sand Diggers. They were pointing out the historic value of the find, which we already knew, and he got furious. Their president is a fellow named Dirk Manning, and what they call their \u2018guardian\u2019\u2014an old fellow who\u2019s been involved in it since he was twenty-one\u2014is a man named Austin Miller. Talk to one of them about Brady Laurie. In my opinion, he had no real interest in joining the group, but he probably spoke to those gentlemen more than anyone else. Me? I believe Laurie was so obsessed with the ship that he signed his own death warrant.\u201d</p><p>Will stood up and shook hands with Landry. Kat stood, too. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, please let me know,\u201d Landry said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Kat smiled\u2014then remembered Will\u2019s earlier remark about her niceness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Ms. Bertelli show you out,\u201d Landry offered.</p><p>\u201cWe can find our way,\u201d Will told him, \u201cbut thanks.\u201d</p><p>When they passed Sherry Bertelli, she was sitting behind her desk, flipping through the pages of a fashion magazine. She looked up long enough to smile vaguely at them and wave. \u201cTa-ta!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, ta-ta,\u201d Kat responded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize Will was laughing until they were in the car again. \u201cTa-ta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply returned the courtesy,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling they didn\u2019t hire her for her math skills.\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head and turned to him. \u201cThis is just about impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one, not even the first responders, really knows if anyone else was near the site when Brady died\u2014or was killed. It sounds like he could be extremely hostile about anything concerning the Jerry McGuen. He did dive alone\u2014and went down almost a hundred feet in cold water. This wasn\u2019t a pleasure dive to a warm-water reef.\u201d</p><p>Will glanced at her, then looked at the road again. \u201cBut you saw his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I saw his body. And seeing his body made me believe this is worth investigating. But what we saw doesn\u2019t guarantee that Brady Laurie was murdered. There are other explanations for the bruises. It\u2019s possible that he might have gotten into an altercation with someone. He was furious with the Egyptian Sand Diggers and apparently everyone knew it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you think one of the Sand Diggers was out on a boat, slipped into the water while pretending to fish and killed Laurie?\u201d Will asked. \u201cWhy?

Islanders can be very superstitious. I\u2019ve seen men who felt convinced they were possessed, and women who managed incredible feats of contortion in a ceremonial dance. The mind is a powerful influence on the body.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone would sabotage the mission to keep Amun Mopat from being brought back to the surface?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy people can latch onto anything, but...at this point, I don\u2019t know what I think or feel,\u201d Kat told him. \u201cExcept that it\u2019s been a really, really long day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll be an early morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was glad he\u2019d said that; his stamina seemed to be on a par with the Energizer Bunny\u2019s. She hoped he was taking her back to her hotel. \u201cI\u2019m at a place called the Edwardian off Michigan Avenue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that, of course,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t just drop her off; he brought the car in front to the valet. She sighed as she saw him get out and walk around to her. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGovernment dollar.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe go where they get their deals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the lobby at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re diving at 8:00 a.m.?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it. Remember? We\u2019re excited about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to get some dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just go upstairs and order in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then.\u201d</p><p>There was a small restaurant in the hotel. He walked toward it, a folder and an iPad in his hands. He was going to keep working, she realized.</p><p>And she was starving....</p><p>He stopped suddenly, a curious frown tightening his brow. She was startled to notice again what a striking and unusual man he was.</p><p>He walked back to her. \u201cAll day I forgot to ask... Well, I suppose you would\u2019ve said, but...did you get anything from the corpse?\u201d</p><p>Kat studied his eyes. She was surprised, after the day they\u2019d spent together, to feel strangely close to him. But then, when you were one of the lucky or the cursed who\u2019d always assumed they were ever so slightly crazy, there was an instant bond with others who shared that luck or that curse. She shook her head. \u201cNo, and I was hopeful. We\u2019re always hopeful,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all. And I just think that in this situation, with the money involved in salvage, what seems to stink does stink. I really believe he was murdered. I grew up in the islands. I\u2019ve been diving since I was a kid. No, he should never have gone down alone, but from what I\u2019ve learned and seen, there was nothing that should have caused him to lose control. His equipment was in perfect working order. Even after being tested for leaks, his tank had air.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. We still can\u2019t explain why some souls stay around, and some don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some people who die by violence aren\u2019t compelled to stay on earth to see that justice is done,\u201d she said. \u201cSome may find peace\u2014who knows? There\u2019s an incredible amount that we haven\u2019t begun to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, get some rest.\u201d</p><p>He started to walk again. He was a workaholic, she thought. Usually so was she. But she really was tired.</p><p>Still, they were supposed to be working this case together. She sighed.</p><p>A mummy. Great. It just had to be a mummy. The mummy of Amun Mopat.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019ll join you. We can discuss what direction we\u2019ll take after the dive.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was going to dive. And the idea gave her the creeps.</p><p>She suddenly wished the Jerry McGuen had remained lost to the world forever.</p><p>4</p><p>Will passed his iPad over to Kat as soon as they\u2019d ordered. \u201cJust click Go. You\u2019ll see the footage that was taken when they found Brady Laurie,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>Startled, Kat looked at him. \u201cYou had this all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But the cops who were on duty when Brady was brought up, not to mention the salvage companies, are easier to visit by day\u2014not at night.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, thinking he might have told her he had the film footage. Sure, he said he was giving her the lead in their investigation, since her Krewe had been called in. Somehow, he was taking the lead, anyway. She felt like getting up and going to her room, but reminded herself that she was the one who\u2019d said they weren\u2019t in a pissing contest.</p><p>Kat touched the icon, and the footage leaped onto the screen. She lowered the volume, not wanting anyone nearby to hear, but there really wasn\u2019t any sound, other than the videographer\u2019s breathing, and then, of course, the muted screams when Amanda and Jon came upon the body of Brady Laurie.</p><p>As she\u2019d heard, Brady could be seen floating in the hold. Jon had come upon him first; he\u2019d tried to get the regulator back in Brady\u2019s mouth. Amanda had been at his side soon after. For a few minutes, there was nothing but shots of the inside of the hull and the flooring, covered with plankton and other growth, and strewn with holes. The videographer had momentarily forgotten his task in the horror of their discovery. When he regained control, Kat was glad to see that once they\u2019d found Brady, they had left behind all curiosity and interest in treasure; they started back to the surface immediately. In the course of doing that, they had to make a few safety stops. At the surface, the footage ended.</p><p>\u201cI met with Alan King, Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy last evening, as soon as Jackson reached me,\u201d Will explained, studying her across the table. \u201cEarl wanted to destroy his film\u2014he doesn\u2019t want gawkers watching the discovery of a man\u2019s death. I promised him that when the investigation\u2019s over, I\u2019ll destroy this copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kat murmured. She pushed the iPad toward him, frowning. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how anyone could have gotten to Brady between the time he went down and when his coworkers and the film crew arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy enough, I suppose. Down in Lake Michigan, it\u2019s damned dark. If someone was already down there, knew the lake and was a good diver, he\u2014or she\u2014could have found Brady\u2019s coordinates just before Brady did...and waited for him. Remember, Brady had made a big thing of his belief that he could find the Jerry McGuen. If someone hacked into his computer or even read his blogs, they could follow his reasoning and figure out where the ship might have ended up. That\u2019s one idea. Or, perhaps, someone could\u2019ve been surprised by Brady. If you know the area, you keep to the depth, follow your compass and then come up at a distant point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Kat said. \u201cBut still, the timing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much diving experience have you had?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She tensed inwardly. \u201cA fair amount in the Caribbean\u2014around a number of the islands. I\u2019ve dived cold-water springs in Florida and caves in Mexico. I haven\u2019t done a lot of cold-water diving, so I admit I\u2019m grateful it\u2019s still summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the temperature as much of an issue. Think about how much time\u2014at that depth, with safety stops\u2014it took Amanda and Jon to get down there. And then to go back up\u2014and call a search and rescue boat. The depth isn\u2019t that great, but we\u2019re talking time and water pressure.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo you think it could be Landry? Or Simonton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe neither,\u201d he said with a grimace. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know whether Brady Laurie died because he surprised someone down there, or if the intent was to start killing people so the search would end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s the first.\u201d</p><p>Their meals arrived; they\u2019d both ordered fish. \u201cI would\u2019ve taken you for a steak eater\u2014in Chicago, anyway,\u201d she told Will.</p><p>\u201cAh, but we\u2019re going down nearly a hundred feet tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep it light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do eat steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re a vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a wannabe. I like cows. They do no ill, not to my life, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussian?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>He changed focus quickly, she thought. \u201cMy dad,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom is a good old American mix of English, Irish and Scandinavian. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in the States. My parents are Trinidadian. A mix of English, Chinese and Indian,\u201d he said. \u201cYour first time?\u201d</p><p>She sat back at the question, stunned at his audacity.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI meant your first time with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>She wished she wasn\u2019t so pale and that a flush didn\u2019t instantly cover her from head to toe. \u201cA ghost. Of course,\u201d she said, looking down. She raised her eyes again. \u201cI was at a Civil War reenactment with my parents. I was about ten. I talked with a soldier. Everyone assumed I\u2019d talked to a reenactor, and I believed them. Years later...I was at my grandfather\u2019s funeral. He was desperate that my grandmother find his financial records. He died suddenly, you see, and had barely written a will, much less made sure that his affairs were in order. She was old school and hadn\u2019t paid bills or known anything about finance. He told me where to look for his papers.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI think my grandmother had something of whatever this...ability is, too. She seemed to understand right away how I knew things\u2014and she warned me to be careful. People would make fun of me, or worse, she said. They\u2019d see that I was locked up. And then...when I was in residency after med school, I was present at the death of a child. There\u2019s nothing worse. But she\u2019d written a letter to her parents, filled with love. She\u2019d had a severe case of cystic fibrosis and wanted them to know she was at peace, and that she loved them and her sister. She told them that her time with them had been happy. After that...an old M.E. I knew talked me into changing course. Who knows? Maybe he had a bit of it, too. So I went to work as an M.E., and I wound up working with the San Antonio police a lot\u2014and with Logan Raintree, who was with the Rangers\u2019 office then. Eventually, we all met Jackson Crow and worked a San Antonio case before becoming, unofficially, the Texas Krewe. And you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was born in the States but I spent a lot of time in Trinidad and the other islands. Conversing with the dead is far more accepted in some of those places. I think I was five. I was in Jamaica. A fisherman had been murdered.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe corpse told me who did it. If only it was always that simple.\u201d His grin was engaging. \u201cActually, of course, it wasn\u2019t that simple. I told my father, who told the cops, who almost arrested my father. But when they investigated, they found out that what I\u2019d said was true. Then, of course, they wanted to arrest my father for being an accomplice. So I learned to keep quiet. I didn\u2019t go into law enforcement at all. I went into magic\u2014I\u2019m a really good magician, should you ever need one\u2014and from there, I segued into film. And then I was called in to work with Jackson Crow, and wound up taking the training at Quantico...and here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange how we were all found,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Adam Harrison worked quietly with the FBI for years before his units were formed. And for him, it came from not having the gift, while his son, who died young, had been blessed with it. After that he began to seek out those who did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess if you know it exists, you can find it,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Will glanced at his watch. \u201cWe should get some sleep. We\u2019ll be at the dock early in the morning. I\u2019ll meet you in the restaurant at seven. We should have something to eat before we head out.\u201d</p><p>Kat felt her teeth grind. He was taking control again. She decided that was a childish reaction, telling herself he was right; they were going diving.</p><p>But for some reason, that made her grab the bill the moment it came to the table. He didn\u2019t protest. Apparently, he had no hang-ups about a woman paying. She tried to take a deep breath; she really was acting childish. It was just that this was the first time she\u2019d been on an investigation without Logan and the others, and she couldn\u2019t help remembering that the whole thing had begun because her unit knew the filmmakers who\u2019d requested that they step in. So she felt a little proprietary....</p><p>They left the dining room and headed for the elevator. She hit the button for the fifth floor. He didn\u2019t hit a button at all. She should have known. Their rooms were next to each other.</p> <p>The accommodations had been booked from their central office in Virginia. Tomorrow, Kat was certain, she\u2019d discover that Logan and the rest of her unit were booked into the surrounding rooms. Logan\u2019s would be a suite with a big round table where they could work on their computers and discuss their findings.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Will said.</p><p>She wished him a brusque good-night as well and entered her room.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been tired; she should still have been on L.A. time. But, as she\u2019d said earlier, it had been a long day.</p><p>A very long day, she thought.</p><p>Just last night she\u2019d been in a comfortable bed in L.A., dreaming about being on a ship.</p> <p>She flinched, unsure why it bothered her so much that she\u2019d dreamed about the ship\u2014and then been sent out to investigate a death in a shipwreck.</p><p>She really wanted to sleep. She didn\u2019t want to dream.</p><p>Before climbing into bed, she pulled out her octopus, dive boots, mask and flippers. It had seemed prudent to bring her own equipment. With those objects packed in a rolling dive bag, she was ready for morning.</p><p>When she did fall asleep, her dream wasn\u2019t the same.</p><p>This time, it was about mummies.</p><p>She was somewhere...somewhere in a green darkness. There were wall sconces that burned bright blue here and there along the walls. She didn\u2019t seem to be walking, but floating.</p><p>Suddenly, ahead of her\u2014a plethora of mummies. They all had their arms outstretched and moved with the slow, staccato movement she\u2019d seen in classic mummy movies.</p><p>Even in her dream she paused to think that such an image was ridiculous. Mummies were bound with their arms crossed over the body. In any case, a mummy couldn\u2019t just reach out an arm\u2014it would break off!</p> <p>But these mummies were coming toward her. And behind them, she saw a man. It was, of course, none other than the evil, robe-wearing high priest Amun Mopat. The priest who had wanted to be a pharaoh, a god.</p><p>He was laughing. In old movies, all villains had a maniacal laugh.</p><p>They were coming closer and closer and she kept floating toward them. Now that, too, was totally idiotic. She never understood why people in films just stood there and screamed. The mummies moved so slowly. If she turned and ran\u2014or floated more quickly\u2014she could easily escape them. In movies, the heroines usually tripped, and then lay on the ground screaming as the mummy or monster closed in on them. Scenes like that made for great movie posters!</p><p>In her dream, she reminded herself that she was a medical examiner and that she understood the human body. She understood the nature of human remains in any condition, even mummified. If she met the mummies, she could fight them\u2014break them into a million pieces\u2014and she\u2019d be fine. But there were so many....</p><p>She floated into the fray. As she\u2019d expected, the mummies were brittle, dry and fragile. They weren\u2019t much for fighting.</p><p>But behind them was Amun Mopat, watching her from beneath his hooded cape.</p><p>They stared at each other, and she wanted to run but couldn\u2019t and then\u2014</p><p>Then she woke, startled by a sound. Glancing at the clock radio, she noted the time\u20144:31 a.m.</p><p>For a moment, she lay in bed, vividly remembering her dream and puzzled by the sound that had awakened her.</p><p>It came again and her eyes flashed to the door. Someone had tried to enter her room. The sound had been that of an electronic key card.</p><p>She rolled over and reached into the bedside table for her FBI-issue firearm and jumped to her feet, instantly alert. There was no sound now. She walked to the door and looked through the peephole. She saw nothing. Thinking quickly, she grabbed her key card from the side table and dropped it in the little pocket of her nightshirt and walked back to the door, looking out again.</p><p>She waited, then slid the top bolt, cringing when she heard the noise it made. Gun at the ready, she threw open the door.</p><p>There was no one out there, but Will Chan\u2019s door had opened, too. She knew he was standing much as she was\u2014his firearm leveled.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d She whispered his name.</p><p>He stepped out of his room, wearing floor-length pajama pants and nothing else, and his hair, while dead straight, was disheveled, as well. He gave her a nod, which she knew to mean cover me, and walked out into the hall, turning from one direction to another, striding away from the elevator bank, and then back toward it.</p><p>There was definitely no one in the hall.</p><p>\u201cThe elevator,\u201d he said softly. He was standing by it.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take the stairs.\u201d</p><p>As she went down the stairs in her long T-shirt of a nightgown and bare feet, stopping to look out at every floor, she thought she should have opted for the elevator.</p><p>Will was waiting for her when she got to the bottom.</p><p>One lone clerk was on duty at the reception desk across the lobby. Kat arched a brow at Will. \u201cDid he see anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. What did you hear?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWhat woke you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded as if someone was trying to get into my room with a key card. What did you hear? Did they try your room, too? Maybe it was just a drunk on the wrong floor,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe someone was trying to get into our rooms. And maybe that someone has a room at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s rather stupid, isn\u2019t it? Trying to break in on agents in their rooms? Obviously we\u2019re armed. And even more obvious\u2014we\u2019re going to have the doors bolted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the intent wasn\u2019t to hurt us, just to throw us off,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cThe clerk says no one\u2019s gone through the lobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since about 1:30 a.m. And he assured me he would\u2019ve noticed. The last customers left the restaurant at about 11:00 p.m., and the last drinker left the bar at one-thirty. He says it\u2019s been quiet ever since\u2014quiet as a tomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there must be back entrances to the hotel,\u201d Kat pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But if someone came or went, that someone is long gone. However, we can go get dressed, come back down and speak to the security guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a security guard on duty tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a legit hotel. Yes, there\u2019s a security guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess he didn\u2019t see anything alarming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s watching the cameras\u2014except that all the cameras are watching the entrances. They aren\u2019t installed in the hallways yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the elevators?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe cameras in the elevators inexplicably went down sometime this afternoon. They have a call in to their service center for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t put a lot of faith in such convenient coincidences,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThe guard makes a sweep every thirty minutes and watches the screens in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll know if anyone went in or out of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one went in or out. I already asked,\u201d Will said. \u201cYou were slow coming down those stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not!\u201d Kat protested. \u201cI checked out each landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. But it gave me time to talk to the clerk and have him call security. I don\u2019t think the guard\u2019s bad at his job\u2014I\u2019m sure he\u2019d handle rowdy young drunks or a bar fight just fine\u2014but I doubt that he\u2019s ready for a major espionage job. I\u2019ll go over the tapes tomorrow, but whoever got in was, I\u2019m afraid, one up on the guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t imagine someone in the hallway,\u201d Kat said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go back up. We\u2019re not going to get anywhere now. I\u2019ll ask for the tapes and inspect the machinery when I\u2019ve showered and dressed. It\u2019s almost 5:00 a.m., and we have to be up and out in a few hours. I know cameras and security systems. I can check it all out and you can grab an hour\u2019s sleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight. Like I\u2019ll be able to go back to sleep now,\u201d Kat muttered.</p><p>\u201cLater on, you\u2019re going to wish you got more sleep,\u201d Will warned. Kat noted that the clerk was staring over at them. She was barefoot, and her T-shirt only made it halfway down to her knees. She smiled and waved at him.</p><p>\u201cYou guys okay?\u201d he called over to them. He had to be in his early twenties. Crew cut, wearing a suit, he still had the voice of a young man. \u201cYou want me to call the police or anything?\u201d he asked worriedly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Kat assured him. She held her Glock behind her back and realized that Will had already moved his from sight. She wondered how he\u2019d managed to hide it while talking to the clerk\u2014a half-naked man with a gun approaching him at five in the morning would surely have upset the young man.</p><p>Will bent down and scooped something from a large ornamental planter. Ah, that explained it.</p><p>He hit the elevator button. Waving to the clerk, they both backed in.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have contacted the local police,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThey could have done a more thorough search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Whoever it was is gone or back in a room somewhere in the hotel. I\u2019ll make sure the elevator cameras are working by tomorrow night. I don\u2019t like to bring the police in unless we really need them. If they don\u2019t find anything, we become the boy who cried wolf and I don\u2019t want to create that impression.\u201d</p> <p>He was right, Kat decided. Again.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s your call, of course,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cQuit that,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cQuit...deferring to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cYou seem to defer to me only when you want to annoy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my intent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen quit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You are the lead investigator. You\u2019ve stated as much.\u201d</p><p>Kat wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or be angry. She let out a sigh of exasperation. \u201cYou hit on it today. We\u2019re here to work. And we work as a team,\u201d she said. \u201cLogan isn\u2019t here, and Jackson isn\u2019t here. That makes us the only Krewe members present right now. That means we need to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoes the clerk know we\u2019re FBI?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Will said, shrugging. \u201cThe manager does, since this is Adam Harrison\u2019s hangout when he\u2019s in Chicago. But as for the night clerk, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Back on their own floor, he was alert as they walked down the hall. \u201cUntil tomorrow, we\u2019re supposed to be the only people on this floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone wasn\u2019t just at the wrong room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRooms,\u201d Will said. \u201cI heard a key card slide into my door, too. There are eight rooms on each floor. It\u2019s a \u2018boutique\u2019 hotel, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes people do get off on the wrong floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do\u2014but not after they\u2019ve slipped invisibly past a night clerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the clerk had earphones on and was listening to AC/DC?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the security guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was listening to another heavy-metal band,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>He grinned, then paused, staring at the wall by her room, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d she began to ask.</p><p>\u201cThe wall. There\u2019s something on the wall.\u201d</p><p>She stood close to him, examining the wall, which looked as if someone had stuck a yellowed and dirty old bandage against it.</p><p>\u201cThis looks like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy wrapping,\u201d Kat said. Her dream rushed back to her. \u201cExcept it\u2019s not. Mummies are treated after they\u2019re wrapped, and this just seems like someone\u2019s idea of a Halloween prank.\u201d Her tone was harsh. Despite her training, common sense and logic, it was unnerving to see that someone had been outside both of their rooms, either out to do actual harm or trying to...unnerve them.</p><p>\u201cMummies aren\u2019t always treated,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cThere are a number at various museums around the world that haven\u2019t been soaked in any kind of resin. The reign of the pharaohs went on for thousands of years, and I don\u2019t know about all their interment rites, but I\u2019ve seen mummies that were buried only in wrapping. I agree with you, though. I don\u2019t think this is real. I think it\u2019s something bought from a Halloween shop. But I\u2019m going to get an evidence bag and see what we can find out.\u201d</p><p>She waited, her fingers tight around the grip of her Glock, while he went to his room for an evidence bag. He returned in a matter of seconds. He\u2019d relinquished his gun\u2014because he felt there was no more danger or because he had faith in her, she didn\u2019t know\u2014and had brought a knife and the bag. She noticed then that his chest and arms were lean, sleek and well-muscled, and that he could move with the silence and agility of a cat, despite his height and build.</p><p>He scraped the fragment of slimy gauze from the light gray wall into the bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my alarm set for six-thirty. Not much point now, even if I felt I could fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be good and early. I\u2019m going to shower and dress. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs at six. That\u2019s when they have the coffee ready so we should get the first cups.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, wondering if she should say what was on her mind\u2014that she didn\u2019t like the idea of people crawling around the hall.</p><p>He seemed to read her thoughts. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to do a setup. It won\u2019t take long and it\u2019ll help put you at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been trained. I\u2019m not a coward,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a major difference between being wary and being a coward,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me a minute, and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m up to.\u201d</p><p>The man seemed to be prepared for anything. He disappeared into his room and reappeared with a small camera, a thick wad of duct tape and a desk chair. He used the chair to stand on while he attached the camera just above her door. It was wireless and she thought it was small enough to go unnoticed, especially with the ornate trim over the lintel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a laptop, right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe camera works on a frequency. It\u2019ll come in on a screen in my room, but I can have it zapped on to your computer. Then you can see what\u2019s going on in the hall, and so will I. Any problems with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. In fact, I really like it,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI have to grab a bit of software.\u201d He disappeared into his own room again, then followed Kat into hers. She showed him where she\u2019d set up her computer on the desk and he went to work. As he did, she noticed the door to the adjoining room\u2014his.</p><p>He\u2019d been concentrating on the task at hand, and when he finished, he turned to her. \u201cThere\u2019s your icon. Hit it, and you\u2019ll see whatever is going on in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I wonder if we should unbolt the connecting doors, too.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot a bad idea. Hey, knowing someone might be in the hallway is creepy, no matter how well-armed you are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to take your gun in the shower, especially when you\u2019re washing your hair.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhich is exactly what I want to do.\u201d She walked over and unbolted her side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the same from my room,\u201d he told her. \u201cThough I\u2019m not expecting anything else for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it was done to warn us?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the local news about us,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure that word gets around and those who need to worry about us are aware. But, yeah, I think it was done for effect. Okay, meet you downstairs at six.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, she heard the bolt slide open on the other side of the connecting door. The sound made her smile. With the camera in place and the connecting door unlocked, she felt safe enough to take a shower.</p><p>The first day manager came on at 6:00 a.m. He arrived a little early and was surprised to find that Will was waiting for him the minute he stepped into the lobby. But apparently he\u2019d been informed that he was getting an FBI crew as clientele. He didn\u2019t blink an eye when Will asked if he\u2019d allow him to look through their security footage. If the technical crew who handled their video surveillance didn\u2019t show up that afternoon, Will went on, would the manager let him check out the elevator cameras that evening?</p><p>The manager, Jonah Rumble, didn\u2019t mind. Will ran through the tapes from the night before and decided that nothing had been altered. Whoever had come to their door had clearly returned to a room in the hotel. Knowing that, he thanked the security man on duty, and the manager, then discreetly made a call to the office in Virginia.</p><p>Afterward, he found Kat waiting for him. She was talking with the manager and had obviously charmed him. But then, it seemed that his diminutive blonde counterpart had a way of charming everyone she met.</p><p>Maybe he should leave her to it. He should\u2019ve been a lot more patient with Dr. McFarland but he wasn\u2019t a medical examiner; he\u2019d just been around enough corpses now to know a few things. It frustrated him that he could make a few observations and discern that Brady had taken a beating, yet the expert missed what had been apparent to Will. That seemed inexcusable to him. And hiding his feelings was not Will\u2019s strong point.</p><p>He\u2019d learn.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Kat asked politely as he joined them.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Jonah, the manager, turned to him to apologize. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can only imagine that another guest was lost or disoriented, realized the mistake and moved on to his or her own room. In this day and age, we should probably have more security, but...we\u2019re a small hotel. We specialize in a business clientele and we seldom have even a minor disturbance. Mr. Harrison\u2019s been coming here for years, and truly, he\u2019s never had a problem. I understand that his office made your travel arrangements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe hotel is just great, and we\u2019re sorry to have disturbed you,\u201d Will said, glancing at Kat. \u201cWe truly enjoy it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d Jonah said. \u201cI assure you that we\u2019ll be vigilant as to the elevator cameras. Still, no harm was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm at all,\u201d Will agreed pleasantly.</p> <p>\u201cThen, please, coffee is available in the lobby. And if you want to reach me, the reception staff can find me at any time, day or night.\u201d</p><p>Will thanked him, took Kat\u2019s elbow and led them toward the coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSuck up to a pathologist or a cop like that, and we\u2019ll have it made,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we get a list of hotel guests?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ve called the higher-ups to see that we\u2019re given the list. If Adam makes the call, we won\u2019t have to hear about privacy laws and all that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood thinking,\u201d she said.</p><p>Complimentary coffee was served out of a silver urn on a marble counter by the restaurant. He poured them both a cup of coffee and offered her cream and sugar.</p><p>\u201cI take it black,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe all do, I guess, with the places we go and the hours we keep,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I used to add cream,\u201d she said, heading toward the dining room.</p><p>He followed her. She was a strange choice for one of the Krewes, he thought. She was tiny\u2014maybe five-four, and a hundred and five pounds. She was a blue-eyed blonde and looked like a little Russian fairy princess. Katya Sokolov was also a certified medical examiner. He\u2019d always known that. It was her appearance and her manner that surprised him. She was just so...tiny and perfect.</p> <p>Each Krewe member had a talent beyond that of communication with the dead. His was film and cameras\u2014and determining what was illusion, what was reality. He knew that in the Texas Krewe, Sean Cameron was the video/film man, and of course, Sean\u2019s association with the documentary crew hired to film the salvage of the Jerry McGuen was why they were involved.</p><p>\u201cI got a nice long email from Logan Raintree this morning. Research on the Egyptian Sand Diggers,\u201d she told him as they chose a table in the dining room.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She drew out her phone and pulled up the email, not reading but checking it now and then as she spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cThe society was actually formed back in 1932. There\u2019ve been many times that Egyptology was the rage, and even as we plunged into the Great Depression, this group raised money to find the ship. Through the years, many of the members have been high-ranking politicians, respected scientists, you name it. It\u2019s a private society\u2014like the Masonic Order or the Shriners or Elks\u2014that does community service. Their dinners and dances and events support major children\u2019s hospitals. Right now, they\u2019re busy supporting exploration in the pyramid of Cheops\u2014or Khufu\u2014one of the \u2018great\u2019 pyramids at Giza, built over four thousand years ago for the pharaoh. But they\u2019ve also financed various expeditions and the preservation of Egyptian antiquities from the different kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>He nodded eagerly. \u201cThe Old Kingdom, which would be roughly the third millennium, leading up to the New Kingdom, the Greek and Roman periods, and then invasion by what we consider more or less modern Europeans. Ramses II, or Ramses the Great, was a nineteenth dynasty king and ruled from 1279 to 1213 BC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was a warrior king, and very nicely played by Yul Brynner in the old movie,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe was considered a magnificent general and a good ruler, whether he did or didn\u2019t lose half his men when the Red Sea fell back after Moses. So Amun Mopat, as his high priest, is of tremendous interest to scholars.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThose poor people in the Sand Diggers must have been cringing when the movie Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum was originally made. A number of liberties were taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were upset, maybe not. Maybe they were happy to see some interest\u2014any interest\u2014in ancient Egypt. And maybe they enjoyed sharing their information. Just as they were probably happy to correct everyone when the press got it all wrong reporting on your last case in California.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI read the papers. Usually online, which means the New York, L.A., Chicago and London papers. I know the FBI is downplaying our part in the Hollywood case as much as possible, but if you\u2019re with a Krewe...well, you read between the lines. And I guess it must be somewhat disconcerting to go from Amun Mopat to...Amun Mopat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we do, right?\u201d She smiled, aware that she was paraphrasing an earlier remark of his.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s what we do. And I love Egyptology,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the artifacts on that ship. Especially the mummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to the dead. But I\u2019ve never been asked to examine the remains of a mummy, although I know pathologists who have. I believe in speaking for the dead, but...I think my sympathies are with the people who died on the ship, rather than a priest who apparently lived well and had many convinced that he was all-powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Brady Laurie?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re learning more about him. That he was determined to follow through on his discovery and that he might have had a temper and\u2014in short\u2014been human.\u201d She paused. \u201cI really wanted his death to be an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t buy that any more than I do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll figure out what went on,\u201d Will said solemnly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m intrigued by this group. Neither Amanda Channel nor Jon Hunt at the Preservation Center mentioned them to me. Then again, maybe they just dismiss them as amateurs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the Sand Diggers are also avid\u2014and scholarly,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd apparently they do good works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know where to find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir meeting house is on Michigan Avenue,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe can start there, and if we don\u2019t find the two men Landry mentioned\u2014Austin Miller and Dirk Manning\u2014we can get information on their schedules. I\u2019m sure Logan sent me their home addresses. I\u2019ll go through the notes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say we head over there after a lovely morning of diving!\u201d Will said. \u201cHey, come on. How often will you see a freshly discovered shipwreck and treasure so far untouched?\u201d</p><p>Only in my dreams, Kat thought. Only in my...dreams.</p><p>She realized that she dreaded seeing the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>No.</p><p>She dreaded discovering that she\u2019d already seen it.</p><p>5</p><p>Kat remembered meeting Alan King, Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy in Texas, when she was involved in the case at the Longhorn Saloon. They\u2019d been helpful, and they were interesting people\u2014and friends of Sean Cameron\u2019s. She\u2019d seen more of Bernie and Earl, but when the case came to its conclusion, she, Logan and the others had dinner with the group, and she\u2019d enjoyed their company.</p><p>They all met at the docks. It was decided that Kat and Will would go out on the film crew\u2019s boat and meet up with the Preservation Center\u2019s boat at the dive site. Today\u2019s dive would be on video, from beginning to end.</p><p>Kat was glad. That meant lots of people in the water.</p><p>And it meant that everything would be on video.</p><p>Bernie Firestone was a man of about forty, pleasant, with graying hair and warm brown eyes. He greeted Kat with a crushing hug and called out to his main cameraman, \u201cEarl! Dr. Sokolov is here. Agent Sokolov these days, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bernie. Hey, Earl!\u201d</p><p>She received an equally warm hug from Earl. He was stocky and shaggy-haired and reminded her of a teddy bear.</p><p>She\u2019d only met Alan King, the billionaire producer, once, but he, too, was friendly when they greeted each other. Alan didn\u2019t look or behave like her idea of such a wealthy man. At the moment, he was in swim trunks and a worn T-shirt and his cap of white hair was unruly in the breeze.</p><p>He shook hands with her and Will, and thanked them for being there.</p><p>\u201cHappy to,\u201d she murmured, feeling somewhat guilty. She didn\u2019t tell him that it hadn\u2019t been her choice.</p><p>\u201cAmanda and Jon haven\u2019t arrived yet. You want to come into the cabin and have some coffee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, more coffee sounds great,\u201d Will said.</p><p>Kat wondered about the wisdom of that, considering they\u2019d be spending time in dive suits, but she supposed one more cup couldn\u2019t hurt, and they\u2019d have a chance to talk with the filmmakers for a few minutes.</p><p>The filmmakers had hired a charter out of Chicago, and the cabin wasn\u2019t luxurious but comfortable and well-appointed. The charter came with Captain Bob Green, who looked like he could\u2019ve been whaling in New England a century earlier, and first mate Jimmy Green, his nephew, an eager young man in his early twenties. They went about their business on the boat, apparently unfazed by any rumors of a curse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had private security watching the site since Brady Laurie was brought up, right?\u201d Will asked as they sat at the galley table and Bernie got them coffee.</p><p>Alan King nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Well, boats on the lake, but nothing at the dive site,\u201d Alan said. \u201cThing is\u2014it\u2019s a dive site. We can\u2019t station people 24/7 down at the wreck. And we can\u2019t stop other boats from being out on the lake. My people have reported curious boaters going by, but they just see them looking over, then moving on. Someone with the right equipment could anchor at another spot and go beneath the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but not so easy. You have to know how to dive, and you have to allow for air consumption,\u201d Will pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that deep,\u201d Earl Candy said, sitting next to Kat. \u201cI was worried about this project, but you don\u2019t have to go below a hundred feet. When you think about it, it could have been a lot worse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alan turned to Kat. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathologist, Kat. You saw Brady Laurie. Are we being alarmists? Did he die by accident? We were down there, you know, when his body was discovered.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cMr. King, I can\u2019t say for sure. There were some suspicious marks on the body that mean an investigation is in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a talk-radio show today.\u201d Alan sniffed impatiently. \u201cThe host had on half a dozen people who were convinced the \u2018curse\u2019 is real\u2014that Amun Mopat hadn\u2019t wanted his tomb raided way back when, and that he doesn\u2019t want his watery grave disturbed. Half the guests on the show were convinced that Brady Laurie was killed by Amun Mopat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll say didn\u2019t happen\u2014it\u2019s that a mummy came out of a sealed container and killed a guy!\u201d Bernie said. Then he sighed. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that evil isn\u2019t alive. We all know it is. Evil exists in psychopaths the world over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBernie, could you show me what kind of equipment you\u2019re working with?\u201d Will asked. \u201cWere you able to get the remotes I suggested?\u201d</p><p>Bernie nodded. \u201cAnything I film will show up on the screen over there,\u201d Bernie said, pointing at the console.</p><p>\u201cWe can rig up a remote camera, too, for when no one\u2019s down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the little remote casing yesterday afternoon,\u201d Bernie said. \u201cYeah, we can watch whatever goes on,\u201d he assured Will.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we have a videographer coming in from the Keys. He\u2019s done underwater work all over the world, so we\u2019ll be in good shape,\u201d Alan King told them.</p><p>Jimmy Green came halfway down the ladder to the cabin. \u201cYour scientists are here, and they\u2019re getting ready to head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re ready to follow,\u201d Alan said.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, they were at the dive site. They linked up with Alan King\u2019s security boat, a little cabin cruiser. The two men aboard looked more like surfers than security; they were both young and muscular, wearing swim trunks and Ts.</p><p>\u201cAll is well?\u201d Alan called to them. The taller of the two gave him a thumbs-up.</p><p>To the east of them, the Preservation Center\u2019s boat drifted close, then anchored.</p> <p>Kat realized that Will was standing next to her. He\u2019d begun crawling into his wet suit and squeezed his arms and torso inside as he spoke softly to her. \u201cThe woman is Amanda Channel and her partner is Jon Hunt. They\u2019re the two main Egyptologists at the center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two who found Brady Laurie,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoo-hoo!\u201d Amanda sang out across the water. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do an assessment dive. We\u2019ve got some netting and collection bags, and we\u2019ll probably pick up a few small pieces if we find any. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll bring the cranes and wrenches and go for the crates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re ready,\u201d Alan shouted. \u201cBut Jimmy Green is going down with us as dive master. We\u2019ve had one death down there. Jimmy will be along for safety. When he says it\u2019s time to come up, it\u2019s time to come up. We can make a second dive this afternoon for more logistics and cataloging.\u201d</p><p>Amanda said something to Jon; she clearly wasn\u2019t happy about being told how to dive a wreck, even if her coworker had just died.</p><p>Kat started to gather her equipment. Earl was already suited up; Captain Bob was helping him with his tank, a distraction that didn\u2019t seem to bother Earl as he was busy rolling video. She hurriedly got into her booties, suit and slippers, added her weight belt, then checked her tank, opening the air gauge.</p><p>She\u2019d tested it as recently as this morning.</p> <p>Sitting, she slid into her BCV, which was attached to the tank. Jimmy came by to give her a hand up. The last thing she saw before she dived backward into the lake was Earl\u2014filming her as she held her mask and light in place and went in.</p><p>Even wearing a full neoprene wet suit, gloves and booties beneath her flippers, Kat felt the shock of Lake Michigan\u2019s water the moment she hit the surface.</p><p>Because other divers were descending with her, she could see a strange array of colors as beams from the flashlights they wore strapped around their heads were darting in a number of directions. It seemed that a stream of dust motes\u2014tiny bits of lake growth and remnants of anything left behind\u2014danced in the shades of blue and green.</p><p>At thirty-three feet they made their first safety stop. Then again, at sixty-six.</p><p>Kat swallowed hard, clearing her ears.</p><p>They followed the anchor rope down. There were eight of them in all\u2014dive master Jimmy Green, the three men working on the documentary, Amanda Channel and Jon Hunt, and Will and Kat. She tried to sort out who was who by the colors of their dive suits. It wasn\u2019t difficult to find Will; she could see his dark hair streaming like a strange halo around his head.</p><p>She released more air from her BCV, and her weight belt kicked in, helping to carry her ever deeper.</p><p>And then...</p><p>They were there.</p><p>When the massive hull of the Jerry McGuen first appeared, she had to admit it was an impressive sight. Long sea grass undulated around the ship\u2019s rusting hulk, along with denizens of the lake.</p><p>Despite storm damage and years of resting at the bottom, covered by silt, sand and muck, the Jerry McGuen still retained a majesty, a splendor. The hull was broken or rusted in many places. It was almost like looking at a stage or film set, Kat decided, because she could see into the grand salon and into what had once been elegant staterooms.</p><p>Amanda was in the lead, moving toward the cargo hold.</p><p>Kat found herself pausing by the grand salon. For a moment, she felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that was almost overwhelming.</p><p>The massive staircase could still be seen. Pieces of glass from the wrecked chandelier were strewn about, picking up the divers\u2019 lights and glinting strangely on the shipwreck. Kat began mentally restoring the salon to its former grandeur\u2014and thought she could see men and women in elegant bygone dress, sashaying along the floor.</p><p>Surely, she saw the couple who\u2019d walked by her in the dream!</p><p>The room was at an angle in the thick muck of the lake bed, but her imaginary people floated along....</p><p>She felt and heard a tap on her tank and turned around. Will was studying her, his eyes piercing behind the glass of his mask. She gave a thumbs-up and followed him toward the others, who hovered around the hold.</p><p>The people she\u2019d seen in her dream were long gone, if they had ever existed; predators, small and large, at the bottom of the lake effectively made sure of that.</p><p>Crates in some kind of tarps, astonishingly intact after all the years and the brutal effects of the cold water, were wedged here and there. Earl Candy watched as the divers made their way through the broken-out hull to view the contents.</p><p>The hold was massive; some watertight doors to other compartments stood ajar, while others remained closed. Bags of ballast sand had split apart in places, and smaller boxes and crates had shattered.</p><p>Something sparkled in the lake silt that now covered the floor of the hull. Kat was beside Will and touched his arm lightly before diving down to see what it was.</p><p>He followed her. Whatever glimmered was covered with growth, but Kat began to carefully dust away the sand, silt and zebra mussels. Will helped her, pausing for a moment to gesture at a metal box nearby that had opened. He moved to collect the box and returned, pointing at the lid. She realized it was thick, heavy wood and had withstood pressure, cold and water to survive. Of course, the lake, being freshwater, didn\u2019t have the bore worms that ate away at wooden artifacts that went down in the oceans and salt seas.</p><p>There were hieroglyphics still faintly discernible on the box. Will slid it into the netted bag he\u2019d carried down, attached to his weight belt. She continued to work at the object that seemed imbedded in the ground. At last, still covered with grit and slime, it came free.</p><p>It was a dagger. And it would have fit perfectly into the box Will had retrieved.</p><p>She handed it to him, and he added it to the bag. Earl Candy turned the camera on the two of them. Will waved to the camera; she did the same.</p><p>Then Earl tapped his dive watch, pointing across the hold. Kat saw that Jimmy had tapped on his tank, informing them that they were to surface.</p><p>Will nodded. Earl gave a kick and went over to Amanda and Jon, who were working with waterproof charts, cataloging everything they saw. Amanda looked stubbornly at her own watch, but Jon sent her a fierce frown.</p><p>None of them could\u2014or should\u2014forget Brady Laurie.</p><p>They made the appropriate stops, using the anchor chain as their guide. As they surfaced, they all returned to Captain Bob\u2019s boat.</p><p>Jimmy came up first and was soon ready to help the other divers shed their gear.</p><p>For a while, the conversation was excited and coming from everyone at once.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s spectacular!\u201d Amanda was saying.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much left!\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a historic moment,\u201d Alan said.</p><p>\u201cI got really great film. My God, when it just suddenly appears there in the green darkness, it\u2019s awesome!\u201d Earl was already filming them on deck as they talked about the discovery.</p><p>\u201cLook what I brought up!\u201d Amanda said, walking toward him. She had a box of specially treated cloths and she took one, using it to lift one of the little objects she\u2019d found. \u201cThank God stone preserves so well! These are what they call shabti statues. Some tombs had over four hundred of them. They represent slaves or workers who would do menial tasks for kings and priests who passed into new lives. They\u2019re very hard to see clearly now, because they have to be cleaned. We\u2019re setting them in water again until we get them to the center for proper preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found a box and a dagger,\u201d Will volunteered, taking one of the specially treated cloths Amanda had used before reaching into his net bag. \u201cI can\u2019t read hieroglyphics, but whatever dye they used to stain the box is still visible. And the dagger appears to be jewel-encrusted. There\u2019s shell attached, but I assume the center will know what to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou found that?\u201d Amanda asked.</p><p>\u201cI found the box. Kat found the dagger,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you touched them?\u201d Amanda asked incredulously. She spun around, telling Earl, \u201cGet that camera off now!\u201d She pushed him when he didn\u2019t move quickly enough. She whirled to face Will and Kat. \u201cThis is an historic expedition. What\u2019s the matter with you? You are not trained or equipped to handle treasure!\u201d</p> <p>Will\u2019s face didn\u2019t betray an ounce of emotion. \u201cDr. Channel,\u201d he said, \u201cI may not have your training, but I\u2019ve dived many a wreck. We were gloved down there, just as you were. If you\u2019re disappointed that the value of the dagger outweighs that of the three shabti pieces, I\u2019m sorry. But you will not be able to do this on your own, and if I understand correctly, you barely have permission from the State of Illinois to control this dive site. Only Alan King\u2019s promise of a complete record of the event has allowed you to rush it through. And Mr. King has asked us to work along with you. I\u2019m sorry if this disturbs any of your proprietary feelings about the search, but we are here, we will remain here, and if we\u2019re able to find any artifacts\u2014which will go into the same cache as those you bring up yourself\u2014we will continue to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Chan! I am a highly trained historian and scientist!\u201d Amanda snapped.</p><p>Jon was behind her by then, but Amanda kept spewing her venom. \u201cYou are nothing but a government lackey, here for a ridiculous purpose. And pseudo-Egyptologist though you might be, you\u2019re endangering treasure! You will not pick anything up!\u201d</p><p>Alan walked over to Amanda. \u201cWhat did either of the agents do that could be perceived as any different from what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, why\u2014they\u2019re trying to pocket treasure!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we were trying to pocket treasure, Dr. Channel,\u201d Kat said indignantly, \u201cwhy would we produce it for a camera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, everyone!\u201d Jon Hunt cried. \u201cAmanda, they didn\u2019t do anything at all. As long as items are treated tenderly the minute they reach the surface\u2014and only extracted when they can be easily picked up\u2014there\u2019s absolutely no harm done. Come on, let\u2019s be honest. That dagger\u2019s a beauty. I wish I\u2019d found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Channel, there are dozens of organizations and companies I could finance on this dig,\u201d King said politely.</p><p>Kat thought that Amanda was about to stomp her feet.</p><p>She smiled at the woman. \u201cWill may be an amateur Egyptologist, but if so, I imagine he has the knowledge to rival many a person who\u2019s doing it for a living. As for me, I despise mummies, so I will certainly never be stealing anyone\u2019s treasure\u2014or thunder, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine!\u201d Amanda broke in. \u201cWill you at least let us return the objects to cold water until we\u2019re back in the lab?\u201d</p><p>Will handed over the dagger and its box. Carefully. Jon was still staring at Amanda; she caught his stare and flushed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. You just can\u2019t imagine what this means to us. Forgive me, all of you. Mr. King, I\u2019m really grateful. But...what happened to Brady\u2014it was an accident. I feel horrible, but...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off. Kat wondered just how bad the woman really felt. Her coworker hadn\u2019t been dead for even forty-eight hours.</p><p>But then, maybe Brady Laurie would\u2019ve acted the same way. Maybe to him the discovery had been everything, as well.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take an hour or so to eat, relax, chill out,\u201d Bernie Firestone suggested.</p><p>\u201cI had Jimmy stock us a galley full of good sandwich stuff,\u201d Captain Bob said. \u201cI say let\u2019s relax so we can get into the second set of tanks this afternoon and take another dive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn the camera back on,\u201d Bernie told Earl.</p><p>The others were starting down to the galley. Earl paused in front of Kat. \u201cI never turned it off!\u201d he whispered. \u201cGreat shots of a diva!\u201d Winking, he walked on.</p> <p>Only Will was left topside. He grinned at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t have a team member attacked,\u201d she said.</p><p>An hour later they were back in the water on their second dive. This time, Alan King had said everyone was to see what he or she could bring up safely and easily. He\u2019d mollified Amanda by letting her give them a lesson in the collection and care of artifacts. It was mostly common sense, but Kat listened to her drone on.</p><p>\u201cSome of the pieces we were able to pick up today,\u201d she said, \u201cwere accessible because of the storm and the shifting sands that more or less righted the Jerry McGuen. When something that size shifts through the power of wind and water, things are going to crash around and get broken. So there may be a lot of little treasures we can find. In fact, we probably need a few more days with handheld vacuum sifters to make sure we don\u2019t wreck anything small and precious while we\u2019re going for the big stuff. Also, according to federal law, the ship and its cargo belong to the State of Illinois until it goes through all the courts, so we don\u2019t want to do anything that will bother state officials.\u201d</p><p>Like kill a man, Kat couldn\u2019t help thinking.</p><p>She stayed silent and apparently attentive, as did Will.</p><p>Soon they were heading back down.</p><p>Divers always checked their tanks before donning them. She saw Will looking at her as she checked hers, arching a brow.</p><p>She smiled, and arched a brow in return.</p><p>In truth, it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that they were bringing up treasure from millennia ago. What a marvel that such artistic objects could have survived time and the deep cold waters of Lake Michigan.</p><p>But once again she was drawn to the broken-out part of the hull that seemed to be a window into the grand salon. She could see where the deck had been, and where a large gash had been ripped in it. Staring into the salon, seeing the ghostly wreckage that remained and remembering what she\u2019d seen in a dream, she found herself thinking of the cold that had suddenly come to her. The ridiculously low temperature of her hotel bedroom had surely brought on that vision! But in her dream the couple had passed her, and then she\u2019d turned to look out at the sea again.</p><p>There had been a nebulous shape, huge against the ice storm that was coming and the strange light and darkness created by the full moon.</p><p>She realized that while the other divers had moved on, toward the hold, Will was waiting for her. Again, she noticed his striking eyes behind his mask. He was watching\u2014and wondering what she saw.</p><p>He sensed she was seeing something, and that made her oddly uneasy.</p><p>She turned away from the salon and smiled around her regulator. She let out a little more air from her BCV and kicked her fins slightly, passing him. He followed.</p><p>Amanda had her waterproof chart and marker dangling from her belt; she hadn\u2019t forgotten the observations she wanted to make.</p><p>But she seemed more obsessed with finding little treasures that had, most probably, fallen from various containers when the Jerry McGuen shifted. She was studiously examining the silted flooring of the ship.</p><p>This time, Kat took a good look at the cargo hold. The ship had been built with the customary precautions, bulkhead doors to prevent flooding from one compartment to another. Some were closed tight, Kat saw, and she assumed that what lay behind those doors would be well preserved. Some were just ajar.</p><p>The real work of salvage would take months. Maybe even years. But the others were busy picking up whatever fragments they could find in the sand, and she went to work with them until Will nudged her, pointing to Jimmy, who was tapping his watch. She checked her air gauge and knew he was enforcing a safety time with a few extra minutes. She had no urge to argue.</p><p>Once again, they began their ascent.</p><p>When they surfaced, Amanda was ecstatic at the amount they\u2019d brought up. She talked to the camera, describing their findings, talking about what might still remain and what had probably been lost. But they were walking into a time machine, recovering treasures from the days of Ramses II that had been lost during the Victorian era.</p><p>As far as any threat of danger went, the day had been entirely calm.</p><p>The only upset was caused by Amanda, who wanted to dive again. She was argued down by Alan King; he warned her that they were looking at months of work, and that while she might have the stamina, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBut we need to work quickly. There\u2019s so much that could be stolen by other divers!\u201d Amanda protested.</p><p>\u201cWe have a boat guarding the area. I have men continually coming and going from the boat so they\u2019re alert and ready. They\u2019re all licensed divers and licensed security,\u201d Alan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given this chance, and others haven\u2019t. Let\u2019s take it slowly and carefully,\u201d he advised her.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d Alan said firmly.</p><p>Will sat next to Kat. He was quiet, his expression solemn. She imagined that he was inwardly smirking.</p><p>\u201cAmanda, look at the many treasures you\u2019ll have to study every night,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>To her surprise, the woman cast her an angry glare. \u201cIt\u2019s the integrity of the situation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I mean to maintain.\u201d Alan didn\u2019t raise his voice but his determination was unmistakable.</p><p>Kat glanced over at Earl. He wasn\u2019t aiming the camera at Amanda. Kat was certain Amanda had no idea she was being filmed, but she could see the little red light; Earl hadn\u2019t let a minute of her argumentative behavior slip by unrecorded.</p><p>Jon spoke up quietly. \u201cAmanda, we\u2019re lucky to be where we are. This whole thing\u2019s in court\u2014to decide exactly what our percentage will be and how the salvage will be handled. In the meantime, we\u2019re here at all because of who we are\u2014and because we\u2019re documenting everything so carefully. Let\u2019s enjoy the process, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a great dive!\u201d Jimmy Green said cheerfully.</p><p>Kat watched the Chicago shore and its renowned skyline as they motored back in. She could see the various harbors and, to her right, the peninsula with the Shedd Aquarium and, beyond that, the magnificent skyscrapers. The city was beautiful, she thought. \u201cCity of the big shoulders\u201d\u2014she remembered from an American lit course that this was how the poet Carl Sandburg had described it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the lake, so beautiful, too, was part of the history and grandeur of the city. It had been treacherous throughout history. Ships caught in storms had gone down since the days of earliest discovery.</p><p>Because of weather. Or collisions. Or...</p><p>She recalled her dream. Night on almost any body of water could be dangerous. Storms could be killers. And yet...</p> <p>What was it that she\u2019d seen in the dream? The large black thing that had loomed up suddenly from the depths? Did it mean anything?</p><p>No, it had been a dream. Just a dream.</p><p>They arrived back at the wharf late afternoon. Will was impatient to leave, wanting to visit the office of the Egyptian Sand Diggers, and they set off as soon as they\u2019d divested themselves of their diving equipment. They returned to the hotel briefly to shower and change, then made their way to Michigan Avenue.</p><p>He found parking nearby and they walked down the street until they reached the address\u2014a building that had a historical marker. They paused together to read it. The Shelby-Turner House. This Colonial Greek manor was built for the fur-trader Angus Turner in 1859. Purchased by the Shelby family in 1880, it was donated to the Society of Egyptian Sand Diggers in 1932.</p><p>They walked up the steps to the door. Will lifted the heavy brass knocker, and Kat almost jumped when a little peep-door above her head slid open and a pair of bright blue eyes surrounded by wrinkles stared out at her.</p> <p>\u201cPassword!\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Kat turned to Will.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ramses?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>The door started to close.</p><p>\u201cHow about FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI!\u201d the voice repeated.</p> <p>The door opened. The man with the bright blue eyes was short and wizened but had the kindly, bearded face of a Santa Claus. \u201cYou\u2019re with the FBI? And you need to speak with us?\u201d Before they could answer, he hurried on. \u201cWelcome, FBI. Which one of you is F and which is B and where is I?\u201d He chuckled at his own humor. \u201cSorry, couldn\u2019t resist. I\u2019m Dirk Manning. President of the society, or Grand Vizier as we call it here in old Cairo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak with you?\u201d Kat said. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Kat Sokolov and this is Agent Will Chan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, Agents. I\u2019m alone here right now. We can talk in the parlor. Can I get you something to drink? You\u2019re on duty, of course\u2014coffee? I always have a pot brewing.\u201d</p><p>Kat started to say no, but Will said, \u201cWe\u2019d love some coffee. Can we help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be old, but I can pour coffee,\u201d Manning told them, grinning. \u201cBut come along, follow me. You can see a bit of the place.\u201d</p><p>The house had beautiful columns, a grand entry and a staircase that led to a balcony above. There were Egyptian pieces everywhere, covering the walls, in display cases here and there, standing sarcophagi, statues, death masks. Manning led them through the entry to an elegantly appointed parlor and, beyond that, a dining room that could easily fit thirty people and finally into a large kitchen. Even there, the wallpaper featured a series of hieroglyphics.</p><p>\u201cThis is...quite a place,\u201d Kat commented.</p><p>\u201cYes, I daresay. Some of the pieces\u2014the ones we\u2019ve locked up\u2014are real. Most of the others are copies of famous artifacts like the Tutankhamun death mask.\u201d Manning winked at her. \u201cWe have some pieces of old Chicago history, too. Did you know that the city was originally called Chigagou, which means \u2018wild garlic place\u2019? Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet were the first to meet with the Illinois Indians and map the area. They weren\u2019t the first to see it, but it was thanks to Jolliet\u2019s foresight that the canals were dug. That\u2019s what made Chicago\u2014to my biased mind, anyway\u2014the greatest city in the Midwest. At first, there were twenty miles of swamp and slush surrounding the lake. That had to be drained. Oh, and once upon a time that\u2014\u201d he gestured vaguely in the direction of the lake \u201c\u2014was known as Lake Chicago. Then Michigan won out. Oh, well, Michigan\u2019s a beautiful state!\u201d</p> <p>There was a large old butcher-block table in the center of the kitchen with chairs around it. Will pulled one out for Kat, then sat beside her. The kitchen did seem a cozy place to talk, but she doubted they\u2019d have to do much talking to get information from Dirk Manning.</p><p>\u201cSo. I guess you didn\u2019t come to hear about Chicago\u2019s history,\u201d Manning said, growing serious as he sat across from them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Manning, we understand you had a party during which the society tried to encourage salvagers and divers to look for the Jerry McGuen,\u201d Kat began.</p><p>\u201cWe did, we did! We invited archaeologists, salvage companies, film companies, divers we knew, charter captains.... Brady Laurie wasn\u2019t the only one to suspect that our last massive storm might have shifted things in the lake,\u201d Manning said. He shook his grizzled head slowly. \u201cBrady was already working on that principle. A brilliant young man! We were trying to recruit him into our ranks.\u201d He made a face. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like that skinny little witch, Amanda. He wanted to be a member. He told us that all history and investigation demanded scrutiny, and he believed that we loved the subject almost as much as he did. Sure, it\u2019s not our vocation or our job\u2014more like an avocation. Actually, keeping up this place is my job right now, but then I\u2019m retired. Ah, I\u2019m so sorry about that boy.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBrady drowned. What does the FBI have to do with it? Ah! Black market!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings haven\u2019t gotten that far yet, Mr. Manning,\u201d Will was saying. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out if anyone else was going for the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>Some of Manning\u2019s statements, like his insistence that Brady was practically one of them, contradicted what Landry had said, but Kat decided not to deflect the old man from his train of thought. Besides, Landry might well have his own agenda.</p><p>\u201cWe think someone might have helped Brady drown,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Manning shuddered visibly. \u201cOh, dear God! That\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019d like to eliminate the possibility if we can\u2014make sure no one out there is killing for the treasure...or the history,\u201d Will said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we tried to get everyone interested in the shipwreck,\u201d Manning told them. \u201cHmm. I was doing a lot of interviews with the press that night. If you want to know who really talked to our guests, it\u2019s my dear friend Austin Miller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to talk to him,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d</p><p>To her astonishment, the Santa-looking man whipped out the newest smartphone on the market and hit speed dial. A moment later he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach Austin for the past few days. He hasn\u2019t returned my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should just drop by,\u201d Kat suggested.</p><p>Manning nodded distractedly. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, we didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t open the door, I can let you in,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI have a key. I feed his cat when he\u2019s off on a jaunt.\u201d He smiled, then grew somber again. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little worried. He\u2019s an old codger like me. At any rate, the house isn\u2019t far.\u201d</p><p>Manning was, for whatever his age might be, surprisingly agile and quick. He ushered them out, setting the alarm and locking the door, then marched purposefully down the street. Austin Miller\u2019s house, a few blocks from the society\u2019s headquarters, was similar\u2014historic, beautiful, well-preserved. Situated on a corner lot, it was surrounded by a stone wall. Lovingly tended gardens and patios were visible through the wrought-iron gate.</p><p>\u201cAustin, Austin, you old coot! It\u2019s me, Dirk!\u201d Manning said, talking into the speaker at the gate.</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Manning pulled out his key chain, sorted through several keys until he found the one he was looking for and opened the gate. They followed him up a long walk to a porch and then a massive front door. There, Dirk Manning rang the bell and pounded on the door. His expression became more and more concerned.</p><p>\u201cI heard something,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>They were still for a minute. She heard the noise again and realized it was a cat\u2019s meow.</p><p>\u201cBastet,\u201d Manning murmured. \u201cHis cat. She sounds...hungry!\u201d</p><p>He opened the front door, and they stood in the entry, gazing around them. The house was exceptionally handsome, designed when molding was an art. There were numerous pieces of Egyptology as decoration, but the house also stood as homage to the Victorian era, rich with dark woods, a grand chandelier, an elegant staircase. They saw no sign of the cat.</p><p>The air conditioner was running, and Kat thought she detected a faint odor. She immediately felt a sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cAustin! Hey, old man!\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s his bedroom?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs. But his gentleman\u2019s den is just through that door to our left,\u201d Manning said.</p><p>Kat and Will strode to the door. Will opened it.</p><p>The odor Kat knew all too well became intense.</p><p>At first, nothing seemed to be in disarray. Then she saw that the desk chair had fallen backward, and although she knew they were too late, she rushed around the desk.</p><p>They\u2019d found Austin Miller.</p><p>6</p><p>Dirk Manning hadn\u2019t just led them to Austin Miller\u2019s house, he\u2019d insisted on coming. That could have made him an instant suspect.</p><p>But Will had to hold Manning back when they found the corpse of Austin Miller. To all appearances, he\u2019d had a heart attack while sitting at his desk. The massive explosion of pain had, it seemed, sent Miller falling backward in his chair. A pill vial lay on the floor near his right hand with tiny white capsules of what was probably digitalis scattered around it.</p><p>Kat glanced at Will and left him to deal with Manning as she carefully made her way to the body. She went down on her knees by Austin Miller\u2019s side. Looking at her and then the corpse, Will saw that Miller\u2019s eyes remained wide open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDial 9-1-1,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe can be helped!\u201d Manning cried.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Manning, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe\u2019s...gone. I\u2019d say he\u2019s been dead a few days, but I don\u2019t have any equipment with me to figure out a more precise time. And, of course, the authorities must be alerted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAustin!\u201d Manning wailed.</p><p>There were tears not just in his bright blue eyes but streaming down his face. Will placed an arm around his shoulders, trying to turn him so he could lead him from the room. \u201cMr. Manning, you don\u2019t need to be in here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Will asked him gently.</p><p>\u201cHorus!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorus\u2014there was a statue of Horus that always sat on Austin\u2019s desk. It\u2019s not there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look for it,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. That old codger and I knew each other since we were kids. He was like my big brother. The statue was his father\u2019s and his grandfather\u2019s before that\u2014he said that it would sit there for all of eternity. He wouldn\u2019t have moved it,\u201d Manning insisted. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have moved it. He wouldn\u2019t have moved it.\u201d</p><p>Will exchanged a glance with Kat. Then he urged Manning out of the room, steering him to a large upholstered chair tucked against the wall beneath the stairway. \u201cMr. Manning, sit tight. I\u2019ll look for the statue. First thing, though, we\u2019ve got to get the authorities out here.\u201d He\u2019d pulled his phone from his pocket and, while he kept an eye on Manning, started to dial 9-1-1 but then stopped. Instead, he called the police station they\u2019d visited and asked to speak to Sergeant Riley.</p><p>When Riley came on, he explained where they were and what they\u2019d found.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the old guy written up in newspaper articles and on local broadcasts now and then,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about his death\u2014but why are you calling me about an elderly man dying of a heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come out and investigate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come, but we don\u2019t really investigate heart attacks when they happen to a man his age,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was caused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drowning was caused and a heart attack is caused?\u201d Riley asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWhat better way to commit murder?\u201d Will asked in return. \u201cSergeant, please. I\u2019m afraid these deaths may be the start of something even more sinister. I\u2019d like it if you could pull some rank on this. We\u2019re here on behalf of a friend, but I\u2019ll get my superiors to see that the governor asks us in. Until then...help us out, will you?\u201d</p><p>Riley agreed, promising that he\u2019d send a medical examiner\u2019s van and ensure that the scene wasn\u2019t trashed. Patting the still-crying Manning on the knee, Will stood and moved away, calling his own boss, Jackson Crow. Jack would talk to Adam Harrison, who\u2019d get them the authority to take over the investigation, which would include any mysterious deaths surrounding the discovery of the Jerry McGuen. \u201cYou want to stay on this?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cLogan and part of his crew should be arriving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started with it, so yeah, I\u2019d like to see it through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. How is working with a new agent?\u201d</p><p>Will hesitated, slightly amused. \u201cOkay. At first I felt like I was working with Tinker Bell. Now...she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>By the time he hung up, he could hear a siren. The sound seemed to make Manning, if anything, more miserable.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be coming for me soon,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy oldest, dearest friend is gone. I guess I\u2019m going to be next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Manning, you\u2019re in great shape and you have a lot of wit and knowledge to continue offering the world. Plan on many more years with old friends\u2014and not-so-old friends,\u201d Will said.</p><p>They\u2019d left the gate unlocked. Will was gratified to see that Riley had sent two officers to secure the scene. They didn\u2019t go into the den but one stood by the door and the other came over and asked Manning if he needed any assistance.</p><p>Will was free to return to the den. He paused in the doorway, trying to absorb everything in the room.</p><p>The French doors that led out to the patio were open; a breeze was rustling the curtains. Someone could have come in through the patio. Will had noticed a security system control pad near the front entrance, but it hadn\u2019t been set. Maybe Austin Miller typically set it just before he went to bed.</p><p>The cat, a slender animal with spotted fur, suddenly jumped over Will\u2019s foot and stalked into the center of the room, meowing loudly.</p><p>If only she could talk! Will thought.</p><p>\u201cWas it a heart attack?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kat looked up at him. \u201cIt appears so, but...this is Chicago jurisdiction,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have Jackson Crow getting Adam to arrange an official invitation for us,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019ll give you leave to do the autopsy.\u201d</p><p>Kat stood with a shrug. \u201cWe don\u2019t have authority yet. When an M.E. gets here, it\u2019s going to be his or her responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can be at the autopsy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe thing is, I suspect we\u2019ll find out that it was a heart attack. Another \u2018accidental\u2019 death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think it was accidental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It looks to me as if something terrified him. He knew his heart would give out and reached for his pills, but...I think they were knocked out of his hand. And then whoever, or whatever, watched him die.\u201d</p><p>The cat meowed again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014Bastet\u2014must be hungry,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAnd she must be something of a guardian cat, too,\u201d Will noted. \u201cShe could\u2019ve left anytime, because the French doors over there are open. But she stayed inside screaming, wanting someone to come and take care of her master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Kat\u2019s eyes were sad.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen any other disturbance in the room?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>She shook her head, and Will moved across the room, exiting onto the stone patio with its wrought-iron chairs and a table with a colorful umbrella. Beyond it was lawn and then the walls and the walkway, all bordered by trees and bushes. The wall wasn\u2019t particularly high, maybe five feet or so. It would\u2019ve been easy for anyone to slip over. But to have come straight to the open doors of Austin Miller\u2019s den, the intruder would\u2019ve needed to know not only the garden but the house. Whoever it was had escaped without being seen. Will walked through the yard, looking for any kind of evidence that anyone had been there\u2014impressions in the soil, broken twigs, fibers caught on the stones. He heard himself hailed as he walked along the wall.</p><p>Sergeant Riley had arrived, and a medical examiner\u2019s van and a hearse had driven up outside the gate. Will hurried over to greet Riley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an initial report,\u201d Riley said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got a man from the Chicago morgue to see to the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it McFarland?\u201d Will asked, hoping not.</p><p>\u201cNo, one of our most senior men, and he knows you want your pathologist on it. So if the call comes in from the governor that the feds can have the case, Dr. Randall won\u2019t care. You really think it was more than a heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was a heart attack\u2014I just think something led up to it,\u201d Will said. \u201cCan we tape off the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe someone was in there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Tape is cheap.\u201d Riley shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll go in and get things started. You\u2019re lucky I happen to be the one on this,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cSince it looks like a natural death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am lucky. Thanks,\u201d Will told him. Because of Kat, he was trying to be courteous, to show his appreciation. He knew very well that courtesy was the way to deal with other authority figures, witnesses or anyone else they might need, and he usually treated them politely. McFarland had just gotten to him, wanting to close the case so quickly.</p><p>He resumed his inspection of the wall, confident that Kat could handle whatever was happening inside.</p><p>The yard was large, at least an acre, and the wall encompassed the whole area. He finished walking around it once. He\u2019d noticed nothing unusual and was frustrated, thinking he must have missed something.</p><p>He started again.</p><p>And then he found it.</p><p>He was about five feet from the corner, to the side of the main entry and the walkway to the front door. A car parked on the side street, he noted, would not be seen from the front, and the street would be dark at night. There were also a number of large oaks along the pathway, and they would have provided shelter and shadows.</p><p>What he\u2019d found told him he was right.</p><p>There was a bit of musty old gauze wrapping on the outside of the wall, caught on a snag. It resembled the mummy wrappings of many an old horror flick.</p><p>It was the same as the one he\u2019d discovered in the corridor at the hotel.</p><p>And near it, something lay shattered by the wall. The statue of Horus.</p><p>Looked like the mummy had done it.</p><p>Kat wanted to be alone with the body.</p><p>But they were still in Chicago, they were guests here, and she was fortunate that Dr. Randall was inviting her to perform the autopsy with him.</p><p>She was at the morgue in a white jacket, her hair pinned into a cap, mask covering her nose and mouth. Austin Miller\u2019s body temperature and lack of rigor led her to the conclusion that he\u2019d died two days earlier, sometime between 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.\u2014just hours before Brady Laurie had met his end. The stomach contents of the deceased might tell them more if they considered the time of his last meal, along with his known eating habits.</p><p>She had expected more resistance from those working with her; after all, Austin Miller had been elderly and he\u2019d been on heart medications. But it seemed that buzz about the \u201ccurse\u201d was circulating and everyone, especially Dr. Cranston Randall, seemed ready to help her. It wasn\u2019t that anyone believed in the curse, but it was titillating to think about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her relief, she hadn\u2019t seen McFarland since she\u2019d come back. Dr. Randall was attending with her, and assistants came and went. Other corpses were due for autopsy as well, despite the late hour.</p><p>So far Austin Miller had been disrobed, bathed and photographed. The call had gone to all the proper authorities, allowing her and Will to take over the investigation. No one seemed disturbed by that\u2014but then no one was convinced that any crimes had been committed.</p><p>\u201cTo see for oneself,\u201d Dr. Randall murmured.</p> <p>\u201cAutopsy? The word\u2019s from the Greek autopsia and means \u2018the act of seeing with one\u2019s own eyes,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re referring to?\u201d She was never sure if it was because she was a woman, or because she was small and blonde and fair that people always seemed to doubt her credentials.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t testing you,\u201d Randall said. \u201cI was just wondering what we might see for ourselves, what truth lies below the surface.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d just finished the external examination of the body. She paused before going any further. \u201cThere\u2019s a bruise rising on his right arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is,\u201d Randall agreed. He picked up the camera again, taking several shots of the area. \u201cAlmost like a defensive wound, as if he lifted that arm to ward someone off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut there are no other external marks on the body. Poor fellow, his feet weren\u2019t in great shape, but he wasn\u2019t overweight.\u201d</p><p>Kat had his medical records on her chart so she knew he hadn\u2019t suffered from diabetes. Other than his heart medications, not surprising for a man his age, he\u2019d been in excellent health.</p><p>\u201cHe was fit\u2014until he was dead,\u201d Dr. Randall said drily.</p><p>\u201cShall we open him up now?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>She took her own scalpel and began the classic Y incision, beginning at the upper left chest and bringing the angle down to the tip of the sternum, then repeating the action from the right, intersecting at the xiphoid process. Her incision extended downward to the symphysis pubis, just above the genital region, curving around the navel. She was always careful; a cut that went too deep could compromise the organs. Just as carefully, she lifted the flaps of skin and subcutaneous fat.</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful incisions,\u201d Randall said.</p><p>Soon, the musculoskeletal structure was visible.</p><p>\u201cNo past fractures apparent in any of the ribs,\u201d she noted.</p><p>She went on to make notations regarding the organs. Randall came forward with the rib cutters and freed the sternum and ribs and removed them.</p><p>It was usual procedure for the heart to be the first organ examined, which answered their questions immediately. Kat inspected and cut the pericardium. The damage there was acute.</p><p>\u201cHeart failure,\u201d Randall said.</p><p>She looked across at him and nodded.</p><p>The removal of the heart showed further sudden and massive damage, but not the kind of fluid accumulation that would indicate he\u2019d been shoved in the chest or struck with a blunt object. Kat hadn\u2019t expected anything else, nor did she expect to find injury\u2014other than the wear and tear of age\u2014to any of the other organs. The stomach interested her the most. She and Randall studied the contents together. \u201cLooks like fish and greens, probably consumed about five hours prior to death,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to his good friend Dirk Manning, he was punctual with his evening meal. He ate at precisely seven every evening, so that puts his death right around midnight,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you, Dr. Sokolov.\u201d Randall turned to her. \u201cWe found what you were expecting. I can finish up for you if you wish, and I promise I\u2019ll be thorough and take every possible sample for analysis.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou look as if you\u2019re going to drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my dear, youth is beautiful\u2014you could never look bad. But you do look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>She was exhausted. And she liked Randall\u2019s comfort with his profession, his unassuming competence, his ease with those around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that offer,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cMy colleagues may want to see him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Kat left him, shedding her scrubs and washing up. She\u2019d accompanied the body, and Will Chan had stayed at the house. Some of her own Krewe might have arrived by now, but when she went to Randall\u2019s office to get her purse, she hesitated only a minute before dialing Will Chan\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey. You done already? I thought an autopsy took longer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRandall is finishing up. I pretty much found what I was looking for. There were no evident poisons in the stomach, but it\u2019ll take a while to get the labs back. I believe he was frightened to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone was definitely here,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you. You ready for a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he drove by the morgue. \u201cYou look like hell,\u201d he said as she slid into the front seat.</p><p>Did people have to keep telling her this?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a pickup line of yours, is it? If so, it\u2019s not a good one.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSorry. Exhausted, is that better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tired. But what did you find?\u201d</p><p>He motioned to the glove compartment. She opened it and drew out a plastic bag, then looked at him with a gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s more of the...mummy stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the outside of the stone wall. I believe someone dressed up as a mummy and went after Austin Miller. It had to be someone who knew his habits\u2014where to go and what time. And that he didn\u2019t put on the alarm until he went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should actually be easy to figure out who this person is. Someone who dives, knows all about Egyptology, knew Austin Miller and has a boat, or an accomplice with a boat.\u201d She paused. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re still going on our assumptions.\u201d</p><p>He turned the corner to reach their hotel before speaking again. \u201cEducated assumptions. Or theories or guesses, whatever. We need to spend more time in the house. I think we may find clues among Austin Miller\u2019s papers. Thankfully he wasn\u2019t as up-to-date on technology as his good friend Dirk Manning. He didn\u2019t even have a computer that I could see. He did have dozens of ledgers, and pages and pages of notes. Also, one of those bookcases was filled with journals written by his father and grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Something touched Kat\u2019s shoulder. Something furry. She let out a startled scream.</p><p>\u201cOh! Sorry,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d As she spoke, the furry thing leaped into her lap. It was Bastet, Austin Miller\u2019s cat.</p><p>She stared at Will.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? The place is locked up tight and I\u2019ve had them cordon off the whole house, all around the wall, because I don\u2019t want visitors\u2014like whoever did the old fellow in.\u201d</p><p>The cat purred and sat calmly on her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with a cat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, I brought the litter box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your responsibility. I\u2019m a dog person. I mean, if I had a pet, it would be a dog,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an Egyptian Mau\u2014an expensive cat, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d</p><p>The animal was still happily purring.</p><p>\u201cI keep feeling she wants to tell us something,\u201d Will said. He gazed straight ahead. \u201cDid you feel that...Austin Miller might be of any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d She hesitated, stroking the cat\u2019s sleek head. \u201cI\u2019ve rarely had anyone speak in the middle of an autopsy. Maybe the soul gets stronger\u2014and stays away from that agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get back in that house,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to go to a meeting of the Egyptian Sand Diggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Austin Miller remain there?\u201d she asked. \u201cIn his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There were too many people. Riley is a really good guy. He kept everyone away from the death scene\u2014except, of course, the pathology team that was with you when the body was removed. But there were officers inspecting the alarm system and generally milling around. We can find out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to dive in the morning,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s important we be there for the next few days.\u201d He suddenly pulled the car to the curb. They were close to the hotel, and she had no idea why he\u2019d stopped.</p><p>Bastet curled up on her lap, still purring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cEvery time we go down to the ship, you stare at the grand salon. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ship\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t lie well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? The ship isn\u2019t impressive?\u201d</p><p>His smile deepened and he leaned back in the seat. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be nothing.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, touching her hand where it lay on the cat\u2019s soft fur. \u201cIn our world, nothing is rarely nothing. Please, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems kind of...well, ridiculous. And maybe it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve always seen the dead\u2014which of course doesn\u2019t mean that I see every dead person. Or that I can pull out a cell phone and dial a ghost. I\u2019m accustomed to seeking them out or having them come to me when we can help them, but I\u2019ve never had precognitive dreams or visions of the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, none of it connected. At first all I could think of was how horrified I felt. In L.A. we nearly lost a young woman because of a movie made in the forties\u2014about a murderous high priest named Amun Mopat. You\u2019re aware of all this, right? Well, what I didn\u2019t know was that the author of the screenplay had used a real entity. So, all I could think was, Oh, Lord, you have to be kidding me, not the mummy of that creep! But the night before Logan talked to me, I dreamed I was on a ship and people in Victorian dress were dancing and music was playing, and then...a storm came up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA storm destroyed the Jerry McGuen,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cBut in my dream, a couple moved past me, and they were talking about the curse. And when we went down to the wreck, I wasn\u2019t dreaming, and it wasn\u2019t real, but in my mind\u2019s eye, I could almost see the ship as I\u2019d seen it in my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you see in your subconscious can be important. I know that you\u2019re thinking, Ugh, mummy. Extra ugh, mummy of Amun Mopat. But maybe we should be looking more at the ship. I don\u2019t believe the ship went down because it was cursed or because it carried an Egyptian mummy. I\u2019m not saying that. But maybe there was more to the ship herself. Do you remember anything else about the dream?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d she said, petting the cat absently. \u201cI dreamed that something massive seemed to be coming out of the night and out of the storm. That it was coming toward the ship. Amun Mopat\u2019s \u2018curse,\u2019 maybe, except I don\u2019t believe in curses, either. I\u2019m a big proponent of the free will concept. But I do believe we can fulfill expectations and, for some people, a curse might be an expectation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso known as self-fulfilling prophecies,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m with you on that. Have you dreamed about this?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, although I did have another dream. A typical The Mummy dream. I was walking or floating somewhere and suddenly an army of mummies was coming at me. I became pathologist Katya Sokolov in the dream, telling myself I was in no danger because a mummy was brittle and would break when I punched it. But Amun Mopat was behind the mummies, and the mummies didn\u2019t break. And then I woke up.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014silly dream,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not silly. I think our dreams may be part of how we communicate with ghosts\u2014or souls that still have to depart the earth or this plane or whatever. They talk to us and show us things while we\u2019re in a state of unconsciousness, or a different consciousness if you prefer. If you dream again, write it all down as soon as you wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that in Texas, one of my team members, Kelsey, kept having strange dreams and visions of events that had gone on years before\u2014and they did lead her to the truth. It\u2019s just that dreams like this aren\u2019t...well, conducive to good sleep!\u201d</p><p>He laughed and reached over, ruffling her hair. It began as a friendly gesture, but his hand lingered and his eyes were on hers for a moment. She suddenly remembered how he\u2019d looked in his pajama bottoms and was shocked by the intense urge for closeness that seemed to overwhelm her. She\u2019d recognized him as an intriguing and handsome man the first time she\u2019d set eyes on him; she had, almost without being aware of it, labeled him sexy and sensual when they\u2019d run around the hotel in their nightwear. But she was surrounded by striking men who were made even more so by their ethics, determination and strength. She wasn\u2019t sure why Will Chan suddenly seemed more seductive to her than any other man.</p><p>Maybe he returned that thought. He quickly withdrew his hand, setting it on the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, you know, until this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were going to drop me off and head for the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean when more agents show up. I gather Logan\u2019s already here. But I\u2019ve checked in with Jackson Crow, and I\u2019m staying on this. I guess because I was here when it started and I feel I have to see it through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that...well, we\u2019re in this together. Don\u2019t keep things from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say ditto to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you weren\u2019t fond of working with me. I can tell that you think I can be rude and blunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can be a total jerk.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he turned to her. \u201cOkay, I promise I\u2019ll try not to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what annoys you about me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cNothing. Absolutely nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He put the car back in gear, and they drove the last few blocks to the hotel.</p><p>7</p><p>It was late when they finally returned to the hotel. Will was tired, too\u2014and he hadn\u2019t performed any autopsies.</p><p>When they arrived, the desk clerk told them that five more of their \u201ccompany\u201d had checked in\u2014Logan Raintree, Kelsey O\u2019Brien, Tyler Montague, Jane Everett and Sean Cameron. He was also quick to assure Will that the cameras in the elevators were now functioning, although, he said apologetically, it would be some time before the hotel had cameras in the hallways. Will thanked him as he and Kat walked to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I should wake my Krewe,\u201d Kat said, \u201cand find out what, if anything, they\u2019ve found out or have planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Bastet settled first, huh?\u201d Will suggested. Kat was holding the Mau; Will was lugging a litter box, a bag of litter and the cat food he\u2019d bought. Luckily the hotel was pet-friendly.</p><p>\u201cGood idea. And it is late. I\u2019m sure everyone will be up early in the morning,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Upstairs, while she continued to hold Bastet, he maneuvered his key card while balancing his purchases. But he\u2019d barely opened the door when he heard her name being called.</p><p>Logan Raintree stood in the hallway across from them.</p><p>\u201cHi, Logan! Just a second,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou two went out and bought an Egyptian cat?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you getting carried away with the subject matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...she\u2019s an orphan,\u201d Kat said. \u201cWant company in the suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it. Come on over and bring me up to speed,\u201d Logan told them. \u201cI can show you the printouts of the research we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Will strode into the room, aware that Kat was following him, still carrying a compliant Bastet. He decided the bathroom was the best place to set up a litter box. He\u2019d never had a cat before, but it seemed logical.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kat called to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d With the litter bag half-open, he looked out at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you think to buy some dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDishes,\u201d he said blankly.</p><p>\u201cPet bowls. For the food. And water. I know a cat can go a while without food, but water\u2019s a necessity.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, wondering how he\u2019d forgotten such a basic. If he\u2019d thought of it, he could have taken bowls from Austin Miller\u2019s house, but the only thing on his mind had been that this animal needed to be cared for.</p><p>Kat laughed, and he liked the sound, sweet and unaffected. Her lips curved upward and her eyes seemed even bluer, even brighter. He cleared his throat, looking away.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The restaurant\u2019s closed, but there\u2019s a soap dish in my room I can wash out. We\u2019ll use that for water. You can rinse yours out for food,\u201d she said. \u201cSomewhere\u2014in between diving, researching and trying to communicate with the spirit world tomorrow\u2014we can find a pet shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr just grab the bowls from Miller\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d Kat agreed.</p><p>In another few minutes, they had Bastet set up. They left her happily ensconced on Will\u2019s bed, regally cleaning her paws.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Bastet a goddess?\u201d Kat asked him as they crossed the hall.</p><p>\u201cYes. The ancient Egyptian cat goddess.\u201d</p><p>Logan opened the door as they knocked. He was alone.</p><p>Will had only met him a few times, when they\u2019d all been back at their special-units offices in Virginia. He was lean and fit, with a controlled, wiry strength; he was also calm and levelheaded, a man who thought before he spoke. Logan reminded him of his own team leader, Jackson Crow. While they were the authority figures in their groups, they knew how to work in ensemble situations, and both had an uncanny sense of who to send where and under what circumstances.</p><p>\u201cThe others are all in bed?\u201d Kat asked him.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cBut we\u2019re good to go in the morning. Kelsey is going to investigate the members of the Egyptian Sand Diggers and find out who else was at that party. I\u2019ve got Tyler checking on the people at Landry Salvage and I\u2019ll take Simonton\u2019s Sea Search. Jane will stay at the police station and be available to you\u2014or whoever needs her. Did you learn anything at the autopsy, Kat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned that he died of sudden and massive heart failure, which was not really unexpected. The doctor on duty was wonderful. I told him my colleagues might want to see the body. He\u2019s an experienced old-timer, and a team player to the nth degree. An excellent connection,\u201d Kat said. She nudged Will. \u201cShow Logan what you found.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and took out the two evidence bags. \u201cThe first I scraped off the wall right here on this floor when Kat and I thought we were being followed. The second came from the wall surrounding Austin Miller\u2019s estate.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at the bags and then at Will. \u201cIt looks like the wrapping from what we perceive as the stereotypical mummy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get these to our lab first thing in the morning,\u201d Logan told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019ll be interested to see what they come back with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He turned to Kat. \u201cYou want to keep up with the diving expedition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed the camera in the hallway. Is that yours?\u201d Logan asked Will.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll look at the footage before I go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll meet for breakfast in the morning,\u201d Logan said. \u201cNow, get some sleep. We\u2019ll see you downstairs around seven.\u201d</p><p>They bade him good-night. Will was glad Logan had come, and glad that Kat\u2019s team was there to handle the strenuous and exhaustive work of investigating the many people who might have been involved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Across the hall, he opened the door to his room and Kat opened the door to hers. \u201cWell...good night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>They both went into their rooms. For a moment, Will hesitated, wondering if he should knock on the connecting door and ask if she wanted it locked again, now that others were here. Then he wondered why it had even occurred to him\u2014except that, after today, he felt he knew her....</p> <p>And knew that he was incredibly attracted to her.</p><p>He shook off the thought and decided just to check out the hallway video on his computer.</p><p>He sat down and studied the video feed. He saw Logan and the rest of Kat\u2019s Krewe arrive, and he saw the maids come and go. Nothing else. He had a feeling, though, that they wouldn\u2019t have a visitor again. Not when there were so many agents on the floor.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the desk. Someone wants something.</p><p>Yes, of course, the vast treasures of the Jerry McGuen.</p> <p>But his intuition said it went deeper than that. Why kill Austin Miller? The elderly gentleman wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near the ship or the water.</p><p>He was pretty sure that whatever was taking place wasn\u2019t a one-person operation. The person who\u2019d gone down to the ship just minutes before Brady Laurie couldn\u2019t have been alone. He\u2019d have needed help, someone nearby on a boat. To the best of Will\u2019s knowledge, there was no scuba gear that would enable anyone to go to that depth\u2014and make it back to the Chicago shoreline.</p><p>He scribbled a note on a pad.</p><p>Timing. Who had access to a small craft\u2014and no alibi for the morning of Brady Laurie\u2019s death?</p><p>He yawned, glanced at the connecting door and almost jumped when he heard the cat meow. He rose, rubbed Bastet\u2019s head, stripped down to his briefs. He put the cat on the floor and crawled into bed.</p><p>He started to doze off; he was so tired that sleep came quickly. But he was startled awake by the sound of a plaintive cry.</p> <p>He blinked in the darkness of his room, then turned on his bedside light. The cat was scratching at the connecting door.</p><p>He stood and walked over to the cat, picking her up. \u201cHey, people have to sleep around here, you know? I volunteered to take you. You have to be happy with me.\u201d</p><p>The cat meowed pitifully again.</p><p>And then Will heard the sounds from next door. Muffled cries of distress.</p><p>He instantly set the cat down and opened his door, then the door to Kat\u2019s room.</p><p>She was tossing and turning on the bed, arguing softly\u2014and pushing at something. He couldn\u2019t make out the words.</p><p>He hurried to her bedside, sitting next to her and clasping her shoulders. It occurred to him that he should let her sleep, but she seemed to be fighting some real demon in her dream. And losing.</p><p>\u201cKat! Kat!\u201d He shook her gently, trying to awaken her from the depths of her dream.</p> <p>She fought him, striking out violently. He caught her arm to keep her from giving him a good right hook to the jaw or a black eye, and shook her with a little more force.</p><p>\u201cKat!\u201d</p><p>She bolted up, eyes suddenly wide open, and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014 Yes, yes, of course,\u201d she said. In the light streaming from his room, he could see her clearly. Her eyes were the brightest, clearest, most beautiful blue he\u2019d ever seen...or could ever imagine. And she might possess the greatest strength and will in the world, but at that moment, she seemed fragile to him.</p><p>\u201cYou were dreaming again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe ship\u2014or the mummy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe ship. I was on the ship. I could see everyone, so elegant and beautiful and having a wonderful time. The sky was gorgeous\u2014and then everything changed. The storm came in. I kept hearing people screaming about the curse. And then, when I turned, there was something coming at the ship. Something huge and ominous... You can\u2019t have a tsunami on a lake, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but in a storm... You\u2019ve seen the lake. It\u2019s huge and, in bad weather, the water can be an extreme power.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel it was part of the storm.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her trembling beneath the thin fabric of the oversize T-shirt she wore to bed. He wanted to pull her to him and stroke the softness of her hair, hold her close, feel the beating of her heart, of his own heart....</p><p>He started to stand. She reached out to stop him, her movement impulsive. \u201cWill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here and work for a while if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, that\u2019s silly. You need to get some sleep. I need sleep. Like real sleep. Badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not that much of a sleeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have to go back to bed. You have to. Just leave the doors between the two rooms open.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cDid I scream?\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Bastet leaped up onto the bed beside her.</p><p>Will laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s your answer. The cat was scratching at the door to get into this room. And when I went to stop her, I heard you crying out.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, shaking her head. \u201cOkay, Bastet, we\u2019ll keep the doors open. Then you can come and go as you like.\u201d She flushed, looking at Will. \u201cDo you mind? I\u2019m not a coward. I wasn\u2019t best in my class on the firing range, but I did score in the ninetieth percentile. It\u2019s just that...you can\u2019t shoot a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI\u2019ll hang around in here if you want.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again firmly. \u201cWe have to dive tomorrow. I want you to be well rested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you need me, holler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send the guard cat,\u201d she promised. \u201cOh, would you turn on the small desk light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d He went over and turned the light on, said good-night and left her. She lay back as he did, and he was stricken by the sight of them, Kat and the cat, curled comfortably together in the blankets. At the moment, though, he saw only one of them. The woman. He was gratified that she seemed so comforted by his nearness. Her eyes were closing and she let out a sigh, arms curled around her pillow and blond hair a radiant halo.</p><p>He returned to his own bed. He was afraid to dream, even though he wouldn\u2019t dream of the ship or the mummy.</p><p>He would dream about Kat Sokolov, her blue eyes intense as sapphires, her hair teasing his skin, and his hands...all over her.</p><p>He lay down.</p><p>And prayed for morning.</p><p>Kat was delighted to see Kelsey, Tyler, Jane and Sean in the dining room with Logan when she stepped inside. Her Krewe had become like family to her. She wanted to ask Tyler about his recent vacation and ask Sean about Madison, but they were already deeply involved in the case at hand. Sean rose first to give her a welcoming hug. \u201cAmun Mopat. Can\u2019t get away from the guy,\u201d he said with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, the salvage crew will find the real Amun Mopat\u2019s sarcophagi and mummy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Will came in behind her; he\u2019d stopped at the coffee stand before joining them. She felt a twinge of guilt, certain that it was her fault he needed the coffee. But he looked alert and well rested. Actually, he seemed more impressive than the first day she\u2019d met him, standing behind the autopsy table that held Brady Laurie\u2019s remains. She suddenly found herself thinking they could be an article in a women\u2019s magazine: Can this relationship work? No, they didn\u2019t meet in a bar or online\u2014they met over the body of a dead man.</p><p>She quickly looked away from him. They were working, and today promised to be as long as the day before.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>True, she\u2019d initially thought he was a total jerk. Brash, abrasive, out of line. But now it seemed that he\u2019d merely been indignant about work that wasn\u2019t up to par. He could be more than decent, respect her skills and talent, become gentle and empathetic.</p><p>Tyler stood to shake hands with Will, and then, as they all sat down again, Sean and Will immediately got involved in conversation. That was natural, since they were both technical whizzes when it came to computers and cameras. They all ordered; Kat decided she\u2019d just share with Jane because she didn\u2019t want to eat heavily. There was a fair amount of chatter around the table until Logan cleared his throat.</p><p>He passed out a stack of folders. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve discovered so far. Will, make sure you have all our numbers on speed dial. Tonight you and Sean will meet up with the film crew when you\u2019ve finished with everything else, so until then... Will and Kat, get going. We\u2019ll be in contact after the dive. Whoever\u2019s most caught up with their research will meet you at Austin Miller\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. He rose, and Kat rose beside him.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, you two,\u201d Tyler said, rising. Despite his respect for his female colleagues, Tyler stood whenever a woman did, and whenever she entered a room. Sean Cameron was like that, too. It made Kat smile. Sean always said it was a Texas thing. Or maybe they just couldn\u2019t let an old courtesy die.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a blast,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Jane shivered. \u201cI don\u2019t envy you in the least. That water is cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t it the truth.\u201d Kat smiled at Jane. Her coworker was a trim, attractive woman and a brilliant artist. She could have been doing just about anything. She had an uncanny ability to draw a face from someone else\u2019s description\u2014or to build a recognizable face from the skull of a dead man.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be diving with you tomorrow,\u201d Sean said. He rolled his eyes at Kat. \u201cI guess we\u2019re in this one because of Bernie, Alan and Earl, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. You get your just-vacationed butt down there!\u201d Kat teased him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch as soon as we\u2019re up and out,\u201d Will said.</p><p>They left, pulling their equipment. Although it would\u2019ve been easier to leave it on the boat yesterday, Will had decided they should keep their hands on their personal dive gear; he didn\u2019t intend to take any chances. And he was right, she thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the car she asked him, \u201cDid you get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I slept well.\u201d He glanced her way. \u201cAny more dreams?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She looked out the window and then asked, \u201cThe cat\u2019s going to be all right in your room, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI left a note for the maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe slept at my feet all night,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Was she a pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess I\u2019m growing to like her.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, something had changed. She was aware of his scent, the sleek darkness of his hair and the strength of his hands and long fingers on the wheel.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a good idea. Really. It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She gazed straight ahead. \u201cSo, you think you\u2019ll be fine working with my team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not? They seem great, and God knows, we don\u2019t have to hide anything about ourselves\u2014and no one in either group is ever going to talk to anyone else about us. It\u2019s like an instant fusion, you know?\u201d</p><p>Instant fusion. Yes, well, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. It had taken her more that an instant to feel this way.</p><p>Amanda and Jon were already at the lake. Bernie, Alan, Earl, Captain Bob and Jimmy Green were there as well, setting up for the day and planning to leave within fifteen minutes.</p><p>Alan King stood before them on the boat, hands on his hips. \u201cSo Austin Miller died of a heart attack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Will said, nodding gravely.</p><p>\u201cMassive heart failure, actually,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Bernie joined them on the dock, Earl filming all the while. \u201cDoes that seem a little odd to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOdd!\u201d Amanda came walking over. \u201cOdd! The man was eighty-three or eighty-five or something like that, and he had a heart condition. What could be odd about heart failure? Oh, I know. You\u2019re all thinking about the curse. Well, curses are idle threats. It\u2019s just that the great and powerful didn\u2019t want their graves robbed. Intelligent people don\u2019t believe in curses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Jimmy said, rolling a line of rope on his arm, \u201cit\u2019s a sad coincidence. A diver\u2014the first diver to reach the ship, an experienced diver\u2014drowned. And now, poor old Mr. Miller, dead of a heart attack. And both of these men were so committed to preserving history and respecting the past.\u201d</p><p>Amanda looked at Will. \u201cThe FBI believes that an elderly man dying of heart failure is worthy of the taxpayer\u2019s money?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re the FBI,\u201d Will said cheerfully. \u201cWe think everything\u2019s suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Jon Hunt muttered. \u201cJust sad. Austin Miller was a nice guy. I liked him a lot. He was passionate about the things he loved, and he was generous with local charities.\u201d He glanced at Amanda. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a one-track mind, Amanda. I miss Brady, and I\u2019m really sorry about Mr. Miller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss Brady, too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, please! An old man having heart failure? It happens, you know? He led a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can finish this argument as we move on out!\u201d Captain Bob called. \u201cCome on, people, time is money!\u201d</p><p>Alan didn\u2019t seem perturbed by the captain\u2019s insistence that they get moving. Kat didn\u2019t think it was because it was his money; she thought he was simply ready to be on his way.</p><p>There was a brief discussion as to whether both boats were necessary, but in the end, Amanda wanted the research vessel because of the equipment on board.</p><p>They took off for the dive spot side by side. As they headed out, Kat looked at Will, noting a strange expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too easy to read, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>The motor was loud and no one around could hear them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking there\u2019s something suspicious about Amanda,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not fair. I don\u2019t like her very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Kat said thoughtfully, \u201cbut we know she didn\u2019t kill Brady Laurie. She was with Jon Hunt and the film crew, going down to the ship right behind him. She was seen by several people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But this hasn\u2019t been a one-person job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was here. She couldn\u2019t have been diving ahead of Brady because she and Jon were behind him, and she couldn\u2019t have been on another boat for the same reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s frustrating. But there\u2019s something about her I just don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s abrasive,\u201d Kat said, then inhaled a deep breath. \u201cWe could still be crazy\u2014looking for something that isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cGet serious. You would never have supported me with McFarland when we saw Brady Laurie\u2019s corpse if you didn\u2019t know I was right.\u201d</p><p>She turned away; Bernie had taken a seat on the other side of her.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we going to make it through this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in curses. Okay, so I say I don\u2019t believe in curses. But this is starting to look more like the \u2018Tut\u2019 curse every day. A young diver\u2014dead. An old Egyptologist who encouraged the search for the ship\u2014dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no curse, Bernie,\u201d Will said. \u201cBad things happen sometimes. But no man has the power to invoke a curse, unless others let him do it. Unless they give him the power. Remember that, Bernie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m remembering,\u201d Bernie said. \u201cI just hope we get through this,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou know we will, Bernie,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>\u201cIf not, I\u2019m looking for another line of work!\u201d Bernie muttered. He got to his feet, calling out to Earl. \u201cHey, we\u2019re coming up on the spot. Get some footage of the research vessel coming in.\u201d</p><p>Once again, they suited up. The usual care was taken in descending. Jimmy Green watched over them like a watchdog while the security boat team and Captain Bob were on the lookout from above.</p><p>This time when she went down, Kat was determined to hover by the grand salon. She felt able to do so, knowing that Will would stay with her and that he believed in her\u2014more than she believed in herself.</p><p>And so, while the others dove the next seven or eight feet downward and toward the aft, Kat held her ground, staring into the grand salon.</p><p>She began to see it all again.</p><p>She could almost hear the music.</p><p>And then it seemed that she was there. She was standing on the deck looking out at the beauty of the night, but she was watching it anxiously. One of the crew members had been talking about the feel of the air, saying that the wind didn\u2019t seem to bode well. Someone else said they were nearly home, nearly at Chicago. She listened to the people as they walked past her. One man told the woman who clung to his arm that they were perfectly safe. He laughed at the idea of a curse.</p><p>\u201cCould one person possibly reach out from the grave to hurt another?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Only the living hurt the living.\u201d</p><p>Kat wanted to turn to the woman and tell her that the dead could come back, but they had no greater power than anyone alive\u2014all they had was the strength to influence, to insinuate horror into the human mind, something done just as easily by the living. But although she seemed to be part of it all, she wasn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t say anything. She was there\u2014and yet she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She wanted to scream; she wanted to warn them to man the lifeboats, to get out while they could before the danger struck.</p><p>They didn\u2019t understand that the danger wasn\u2019t going to be the storm.</p><p>She turned to the water again, and it was coming. The dark shape that seemed to accompany the icy wind. She lifted her arms, as if she could push it back, as if she could somehow stop it. But the massive dark shadow was bearing down on the ship.</p><p>It was coming closer and closer....</p><p>A wall of water was washing over her and she was breathing it in. She began to choke.</p><p>She realized the frigid water was engulfing her.</p><p>She was drowning in it.</p><p>8</p><p>Kat was suddenly jolted. She felt someone shove something at her face, and her instinct was to fight back. But she realized the thing pushed into her mouth was her regulator. Will was forcing her to take it back; she\u2019d evidently spit it out, forgotten to breathe. She tasted the cold water, felt it on her teeth. She coughed, choked, coughed up water, and then she was able to take in a sweet breath of air. She saw him looking at her, his dark eyes intense and huge behind his mask, and she felt his hands on her while he watched her, watched her breathe.</p><p>It seemed that aeons had passed, that the others must have seen her strange behavior. Seemed that it must be time to go back up.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. She saw that the others were busy down in the hold, looking at the doors that were ajar, those that were open and those that were sealed.</p><p>She inhaled deeply, and Will used his thumb to indicate that they should go back up; he was worried about her.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to smile. He frowned.</p><p>She shook her head more firmly and gave him an A-OK sign. She spoke around her mouthpiece, knowing the sound would be distorted. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Let\u2019s finish.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy, but he didn\u2019t stop her when she released more air from her BCV and continued downward to the hold. Earl Candy turned the camera on her and Will, and she went all the way to the bottom, determined to find more of the spilled treasure that was covered in zebra mussels and lake bed silt.</p><p>She was able to retrieve a few encrusted objects before Jimmy Green gestured that their time was up. As they moved toward the anchor line, she knew that Will was almost on top of her. He was still worried. She couldn\u2019t protest. She might have drowned with seven people surrounding her if Will hadn\u2019t been there to snap her from the past to the present.</p><p>Back on board, Kat was stunned that no one else had been aware of whatever had happened. With the camera going and Amanda taking center stage, demanding the ancient trinkets others had found to display before the camera, Kat couldn\u2019t say anything to Will. He behaved as the others were behaving\u2014happy about a productive dive that had allowed them to better chart and understand the condition and position of the ship, and the treasure that remained within. When everything had been shown, the real treasure of the day seemed to be a necklace. The true beauty of it would be hard to see until it was cleaned, but it was gold chain, Amanda said, with a golden sculpture of the god Horus attached. At last she finished with the camera and walked over to Alan. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we brought up this time. He can turn the camera off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alan stood. \u201cDr. Channel, we\u2019re documenting everything that happens.\u201d</p><p>Bernie stood next to him. \u201cI tell my man when to turn off his camera.\u201d</p><p>Amanda pursed her lips and stalked away.</p> <p>Will was checking the tanks for the second dive. He glanced up as Kat approached him. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, and, um, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to be his mantra, she thought.</p><p>\u201cYou have more belief in whatever it is I\u2019m seeing than I do,\u201d she said, speaking in a low voice.</p> <p>He looked around to assure himself that they weren\u2019t being watched. She took a step back. He\u2019d stripped off the arms and chest of his suit because the sun was hot. He was bronzed and lean and she wanted to touch him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something at the end of this...vision that\u2019s so horrible you don\u2019t want to see it and I\u2019m afraid for you to see it\u2014especially in seventy-five or eighty feet of water. Do you think you should go down again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I swear. And if you\u2019re next to me...\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou pack quite a wallop for a little girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you pack quite a wallop for a highly educated and brilliant but tiny agent\u2014how\u2019s that?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d She paused. \u201cDid I really hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried. Last night and today. But I\u2019m fairly bright and well-trained myself.\u201d</p><p>Kat noticed that Earl and Bernie were speaking somewhere near them. It was a private conversation, and she didn\u2019t mean to listen, but even on the decent-size boat, they were close.</p><p>\u201cAlan should just pull the plug on that bitch!\u201d Earl said.</p><p>Jon Hunt heard them and came over.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, please. I\u2019ll speak with Amanda. She\u2019s just intense. You have to understand that while you make documentaries on many things, we live ancient history. Please, try to understand her, and I promise, I\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to care that a good friend of yours died on this expedition! All she cares about is her own agenda. She wants the big stuff done immediately, and she wants to call all the shots,\u201d Bernie said, folding his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re here because the center is considered the best of its kind and isn\u2019t trying to stow away anything that legally belongs to the State of Illinois. She\u2019s pushing the boundaries, and if she isn\u2019t careful, she\u2019ll bring the curse of politicians and lawyers down on us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her!\u201d Jon said again.</p> <p>Kat excused herself to go to the hold to get a bottle of water. She wasn\u2019t part of this argument.</p><p>But as she started down to the galley she paused. Amanda was on the phone; she\u2019d gone there for privacy.</p><p>Kat would have left.</p><p>But she was here to investigate, to learn what she could.</p><p>And even if she hadn\u2019t been, she couldn\u2019t have left fast enough to avoid hearing Amanda\u2019s frantic whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll find it! I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ll find it!\u201d</p><p>She snapped her phone shut and turned and saw Kat. Her face went red, but she quickly rallied. \u201cHey, sorry. That was a friend of mine. I lost her Adele CD and I told her that if I couldn\u2019t find it I\u2019d buy her another one. I can\u2019t believe she called me in the middle of all this about a CD!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, people do love their music,\u201d Kat said mildly.</p><p>\u201cI guess. But...\u201d With a shrug, Amanda stepped toward the galley\u2019s counter. \u201cI\u2019m putting together sandwiches. We\u2019ll take another thirty minutes before our next dive.\u201d</p><p>Just then Jimmy came down the galley steps. \u201cReady for... Oh! Amanda. You\u2019re getting started on lunch. Great. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem. We all have to eat, right?\u201d</p><p>She was extremely pleasant. Kat grabbed her water, and moved to Jimmy\u2019s other side. With their assembly line, they had a stack of sandwiches prepared in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Topside, she saw Will in conversation with Bernie and Alan. Earl was filming sailboats that passed in the distance.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to Will before they went for their second dive, but she intended to keep a close watch on Amanda\u2014and to make sure that what she put in her bag came out of her bag when they reached the surface.</p><p>I\u2019ll find it. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ll find it!</p><p>The words flashed through Kat\u2019s mind as they descended. When she got to the ship\u2019s grand salon, she felt compelled to stop again.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>Will was there. He touched her arm, and she looked at him and knew he\u2019d be there for her, a safety net.</p><p>She looked into the salon\u2014and it began.</p><p>At first, the characters were ghostly. She heard her own breathing through the respirator; she felt Will close at her side.</p><p>Then the characters became real, and the water seemed to disappear. Once again she was alone on the ship\u2019s deck. She heard the laughter, the music. The people talking, the warnings about the curse...</p><p>It was coming, and she knew it. The wind that became icy cold. The blue sky turning dark. And then the thing, the shadowy, shapeless thing, massive in the night. It was coming toward them and then she could see it...</p><p>Huge, tall. It was a man. A man with incredibly large dark eyes, his arms crossed over his chest. He wore a tall, turbanlike hat or cap, and jewels adorned his neck. The eyes looked at her, stygian, blank, as if sightless, and yet all-seeing....</p><p>It\u2014he\u2014came closer and as he was nearly upon her, she felt pure terror.</p><p>Then...</p><p>She heard a garbled voice. \u201cBreathe!\u201d</p><p>She was being shaken. She blinked and saw Will. She was trembling in the water, freezing, as if she\u2019d been through an ice storm.</p><p>But she was breathing....</p><p>She didn\u2019t choke.</p><p>And as she saw him, she felt safe. She was strong; she had faith in herself. But his faith was even greater, and he would stop whatever demons came for her, stop them before they could reach her.</p><p>Yes, Will seemed to have faith in her, and he seemed to know her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to get her to go back up before the others, although he realized she\u2019d seen something more. She wanted to watch Amanda, and although she wasn\u2019t sure how to convey that to him, he didn\u2019t protest any of her movements.</p><p>They joined the rest of the group. It always seemed impossible that no one had noticed their later arrival. What felt like aeons when she was staring into the salon must have been just a minute or two.</p><p>She and Will went to work. Amanda and Jon were looking over a crate packed in a tarp, trying to determine size and weight and, no doubt, whether or not they could bring it to the surface.</p><p>Jimmy Green noted that their dive time was up, and they made the ascent.</p><p>There were more treasures, of course. As usual, Amanda commanded the time before the camera, while Jon did as he was told. Will hung in the background with Kat, and it wasn\u2019t until the dive trip had ended and they were in the car, headed to the hotel to shower and change, that he was able to ask her what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I was expecting a mummy to suddenly appear in the darkness. But it wasn\u2019t. It was a... I don\u2019t know what it was. A giant Egyptian, maybe. I saw a man, with slicked-back hair, wearing some kind of headpiece. He had deep, dark eyes. The eyes didn\u2019t seem to see, and yet the thing was coming at the ship. It was the great dark shadow that threatened the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Will said. \u201cMaybe once we\u2019ve gone through some of the journals at Austin\u2019s house, we\u2019ll figure it out. A giant Egyptian,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Kat was thoughtful. \u201cHe seemed like a young man, say early twenties, with dark skin and exceptionally fine features. I\u2019m not familiar with Egyptology the way you are, but I\u2019ve seen pictures of pharaohs that were similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was Amun Mopat. We don\u2019t actually know what he looked like,\u201d Will said.</p><p>Kat made a sound of distaste.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really Amun Mopat,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe know he wasn\u2019t a giant, and I still don\u2019t believe he came back from the dead to sink a ship. However, that might be who or what you saw in your mind\u2019s eye. Which could mean many things.\u201d</p><p>Kat sighed. \u201cWill, when I went down to the galley before the second dive, I found Amanda talking on her cell phone. She said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll find it. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ll find it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know you heard her?\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cShe said she\u2019d lost a friend\u2019s CD. And then she started making sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have lost a CD\u2014or she could be looking for something special associated with the ship. But...that\u2019s a long shot. The ship\u2019s been at the bottom of that lake for over a hundred years. And it\u2019s not like Amanda\u2019s ever down there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019ve all been bringing up pieces of pottery and stone statues\u2014and the dagger and the box. There could be something special down there,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWe have copies of the ship\u2019s manifest. I\u2019ve looked through it, but I\u2019ll read it more thoroughly and try to discern if there was one special thing among the treasures.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cTutankhamun\u2019s gold death mask was considered the major find in his tomb. Maybe I missed something like that.\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cHis death mask is big. Amanda couldn\u2019t have slipped anything of that size out of the water!\u201d</p><p>At the hotel, they went to their separate rooms. Kat couldn\u2019t help remembering that the doors separating the rooms were ajar, allowing Bastet to come and go between them. She felt much safer than she had the first night; they\u2019d all learned that everyone was in a better position with good backup.</p><p>She should have been concentrating on her vision, trying to analyze it and determine what she\u2019d seen with her sixth sense, but...she was human. And she was thinking about Will Chan, about his lean and muscular body and the beautiful warm color of his skin. Even though she was all alone, she blushed. She realized she didn\u2019t have to; she was an adult and it was okay to be attracted to a man. It was just that this man was a colleague. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a while since she\u2019d been in a relationship. Many men had been turned off by the mere fact of her profession.</p><p>Some were too turned on by it, and they scared the hell out of her.</p><p>But her last relationship had ended not because of what she did, since she\u2019d been seriously involved with another pathologist.</p> <p>He\u2019d happened to come in when she was talking to a corpse.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d been bothered. The relationship wasn\u2019t instantly over. It had ended one morning when she\u2019d awakened to find him staring at the ceiling. He had seemed so anguished, and then he\u2019d told her\u2014he believed she had some strange power, and he\u2019d tried, but he couldn\u2019t make the relationship work. He couldn\u2019t forget that she talked to corpses. And he was terrified that one day he\u2019d see them talking back.</p><p>The breakup had hurt. She\u2019d cared about him, and she knew he\u2019d cared about her, as well.</p><p>And she\u2019d wondered if she should keep her affairs few and far between and very casual.</p><p>There could be nothing casual about a relationship with Will. But while she found herself fantasizing about him in a sexual way, she was also gratified to realize that he was just like her. He wasn\u2019t turned off by her science or what lay beyond science.</p> <p>But...</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he was fantasizing about her!</p><p>After she\u2019d dried and dressed, she gave the cat some attention. \u201cPoor baby. Your master is gone,\u201d she said. Bastet purred, looking at her with beautiful cat eyes. She seemed to know.</p><p>Animals did know many things people couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to meet Will and we have to get moving, Bastet. The day is almost gone.\u201d</p><p>The animal meowed pitifully when Kat was about to leave. Stroking Bastet, she placed her on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut you have to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>She met Will in the hall.</p><p>\u201cI reported in to Logan,\u201d he said. \u201cTyler is at Austin Miller\u2019s. He\u2019s keeping an eye on things, plus he did a cursory search of the house and yard. I told Logan about the image you \u2018saw\u2019 at the ship and he\u2019s going to send Jane out to the house so she can sketch it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Kat agreed.</p><p>She looked around as they drove. Chicago was truly one of the great American cities. The lake, a constant presence, glittered in the bright sun. Heading along South Lake Shore Drive, she could see Grant Park and the Buckingham Fountain, the Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum ahead of them in the distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering,\u201d she said to Will, \u201cdo you think we should focus on Austin Miller\u2019s house\u2014or on the Egyptian Sand Diggers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll find more of what we\u2019re looking for at Austin\u2019s house,\u201d Will said. \u201cYour team is investigating the Sand Diggers. But the two people who can help us the most with the ship are Austin Miller\u2014well, not Austin himself but the journals in his home\u2014and Dirk Manning. You heard what Manning said\u2014he and Austin Miller were the rock-solid foundation of the society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Dirk\u2019s pain at losing his old friend was faked, I\u2019m turning in my badge and giving up on this,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Dirk Manning is guilty of anything. And Austin Miller is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to the salvage divers, then,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cAnd after what you heard Amanda say on the phone, I think she\u2019s somehow involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, Agent Chan, I\u2019m just musing aloud,\u201d she told him.</p><p>When they reached the estate, there weren\u2019t any patrol cars in evidence, but Kat reasoned that Tyler Montague must have rented the Honda that sat on the embankment. The house itself\u2014the circumference of the wall\u2014was wrapped in tape with regularly posted warnings not to enter.</p><p>Kat hit the buzzer; a minute later, she heard Tyler\u2019s voice. \u201cAgent Montague. What\u2019s your business here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kat and Will,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Dirk Manning\u2019s key. Just letting you know we\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnter into the museum!\u201d Tyler told them grandly.</p><p>He met them at the door. Kat had known Tyler a long time; like Logan, he\u2019d been a Texas Ranger before joining the Krewe, and they\u2019d worked a few cases together when she was a pathologist with the city of San Antonio.</p><p>She was very fond of him. In appearance, he might be the toughest-looking member of the Texas Krewe. He was tall and well-muscled and his passion was martial arts. He and Logan had been close friends through harrowing times.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said, shaking hands with Will, then hugging Kat. \u201cThe house is enormous but I knew you\u2019d be coming after the dive and I figured I\u2019d let the others continue with the research and alibis. But I\u2019ve been here awhile and, so far, I\u2019ve only gone through the parlor and the guest rooms. I\u2019m assuming that what we\u2019re going to discover is either in Miller\u2019s office\u2014his den\u2014or his bedroom, but this entire place is like a museum.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf we are going to discover anything helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we discover it,\u201d Will said. He looked at Kat. \u201cBedroom or office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish the guest rooms, then,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>He and Will headed up the stairs, while Kat went across to the office. She made a point of leaving the door open. Maybe Will should have done this room, since he seemed to love all things Egyptian. But she couldn\u2019t forget the way she\u2019d found the elderly man. He had loved his den. If there was something to find, it might well be here.</p><p>\u201cWhere to start?\u201d she said aloud. She pulled open the desk\u2019s bottom left drawer and took out an orderly stack of journals. The top one was the most recent. She began to leaf through it.</p><p>Despite herself, she quickly became fascinated. He had a clear, easy way of writing that engaged her in the subject. He\u2019d been writing to enhance his own scholarship\u2014and for his own pleasure. She studied the charts he\u2019d made and understood that each Kingdom or period had a number of dynasties. Strange, but until the past few days, she\u2019d thought of ancient Egypt as one phase of history, not realizing that the pyramids had existed for millennia by the time Ramses II lived and died, and the boy king, Tut, was buried in the Valley of the Kings. Austin Miller\u2019s notes were clear and precise...and interesting.</p><p>The last page of the last journal was about the party being thrown to entice scientists and divers to search for the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he wrote, \u201ctruly time, for that the ship to come to the surface, to disprove the concept that any talisman could bring about a curse. Or that a priest, any priest of any religion of any era, could rule the heavens or the earth. This is so much nonsense. Priests and rulers have always governed through fear. When a master manipulator can control the human mind by using terror and make that terror widespread, he must be stopped. Recovering the ship will allow us to show the world that fear and terror is all a matter of perception. That whatever Amun Mopat may have carved on his tomb is irrelevant. Our problem is that salvage divers know the gain will be the state\u2019s, so we\u2019ll let them see what fortune may come to those who seek!\u201d</p><p>She read the words in silence, and wondered what \u201ctalisman\u201d he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cMr. Miller,\u201d she murmured softly, \u201cdon\u2019t you know that because of the movies, there\u2019s no such thing as a tomb that doesn\u2019t come with a curse?\u201d</p><p>She set the journal down. There was one lower in the stack that didn\u2019t align with the others; it was a different type of journal, far older. She opened it curiously. The handwriting was different, and she saw that this journal had been written in 1898.</p><p>Holding it, she felt her heart leap. The Jerry McGuen had gone down in 1898 with her Egyptian treasures, years before Howard Carter had discovered King Tut\u2019s tomb.</p><p>The name in the book, however, was also Austin Miller. He had to have been this Austin Miller\u2019s grandfather.</p><p>The older Miller\u2019s writing was as engaging as that of his grandson. He spoke about being in the desert, crawling through sand, finding tomb after tomb that had been raided and looted. He wrote about the day one of their diggers had fallen into a hole. The hole had proven to lead to a shaft, and they\u2019d followed it and found the tomb.</p><p>At first, none of the men on the dig had been particularly excited. They\u2019d wanted to find the tomb of a pharaoh, and they\u2019d merely uncovered the tomb of a priest. But as they went through that tomb, the hieroglyphics told of a powerful man who had held others\u2014even the pharaoh\u2014in his grip. He was a magician, who could make mist and rain, force love when there was none and tell a pharaoh of victories to come, or when an enemy might attack.</p><p>Once the work of removing the precious treasures began, they\u2019d begun to know what they had. Gregory Hudson, the wealthy fur trader from Chicago who\u2019d financed the dig and loved the country of Egypt, its present and its past, was \u201cwell pleased,\u201d as Austin said, with their discovery.</p><p>Kat sat back, engrossed in the story. She heard the clock tolling the hours, but ignored it. This Austin Miller\u2019s journal read like an adventure story.</p><p>He went on about the months of exploration, and how Gregory Hudson, with his beautiful young bride, had chartered the Jerry McGuen to bring them home, along with some of his men and his treasures.</p><p>Austin Miller\u2014grandfather Austin Miller\u2014hadn\u2019t traveled with him because he\u2019d had to leave Egypt earlier, before their find could be cataloged and wrapped and crated.</p><p>And then, just before her arrival, the Jerry McGuen had gone down, and she and sixty souls and the treasure had all been lost.</p><p>\u201cIt made me remember what we saw on the wall of the tomb. Our interpreter was appalled by what he read when we first saw it. In fact, he left without his pay and did not return. But he did tell us that it warned that death and despair would fall upon those who disrupted Amun Mopat\u2019s final rest, for he was a god and wielded the scepter of a god. No matter where his remains might lie and in what condition, he would wield that scepter. I could not help but believe that Gregory, his poor, beautiful bride and all the others suffered and died because we should have let the dead rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Startled, Kat heard the clock chime again. She glanced up, an eerie feeling creeping down her spine.</p><p>The doors to the patio were no longer open; she was in the house with two fellow agents and no one else. There was no reason to have such a feeling, except...</p><p>She saw an elderly man standing before her. Tall and erect, clean-shaven with snow-white hair. His eyes were sad and his cheeks sagged heavily.</p> <p>She knew that face; she had come to know the face and form of Austin Miller as he\u2019d lain on the autopsy table.</p><p>\u201cYou see me, my dear?\u201d he whispered, and his words were both hopeful and pained.</p><p>No matter how many times she\u2019d seen the dead, it was always a shock.</p><p>She had so wanted to see this man. To speak with him...</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice tremulous.</p> <p>\u201cIt was no accident. Please, do not let it go as an accident!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I will not,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see that justice is done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cBut we need your help, sir. We believe that someone came upon you, terrified you\u2014and knocked your arm when you reached for your pills. Can you tell me who did it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe mummy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mummy came to me and killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Will asked, looking up as Tyler came to stand in the bedroom doorway.</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cThe guest rooms are neat, tidy and dust-free. They\u2019re filled with paintings, statues and knickknacks, most of them relating to Egyptology, and some of them to the history of Chicago. There\u2019s not a single piece of clothing and there\u2019s not a scrap of paper with any notes. I\u2019ve opened every jar and looked in every vase and...not a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find when you searched the property?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, but I noted the same small disturbance in the grass that you did\u2014near the section of wall where you found the scrap of gauze and the broken statue. I\u2019d definitely agree that someone crawled over the wall and came at Miller from his patio doors. Anything in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much. Notes about doctors\u2019 appointments, notes about meetings to be held at the house and a \u2018note to self: pressure Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center.\u2019 Obviously, they didn\u2019t need to pressure them a lot. Brady Laurie was so excited that he made the most foolish mistake any diver can make\u2014diving alone. Maybe he and Dr. Channel had the same personality trait\u2014no faith in anyone else. Speaking of Amanda, Kat heard her talking on the phone today, telling someone that she\u2019d \u2018find it,\u2019 or words to that effect. She told Kat she was talking about a CD, but she\u2019s an iffy character, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan has our Krewe looking up backgrounds on everyone involved, so if there\u2019s something we should know about her, we should know it soon,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHow can I help you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the dresser,\u201d Will suggested.</p> <p>As Tyler walked toward it, Will\u2019s cell phone rang. He answered it immediately. \u201cChan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, it\u2019s Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still at Austin Miller\u2019s house,\u201d Will told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I figured as much.\u201d He paused for a long moment. \u201cI have some strange information for you. That material you found\u2014on the wall at the hotel and then at Miller\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gauzy stuff that looks like mummy wrapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent it to an expert in D.C. early this morning. He got right on it, and called me a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? A prop from a movie set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the carbon dating, that wrapping is Egyptian. He estimates it to have been used in the New Kingdom\u2014and it\u2019s possibly from the reign of Ramses II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real, Will. At one time, that wrapping covered a real mummy.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Will agreed with Logan, who\u2019d decided he\u2019d have Jane return to the hotel, ready to sketch, and that he\u2019d have Kat bring some of the files and journals back with her.</p><p>Will hung up and called Kat on her cell. She sounded strange, which worried him, and he hurried downstairs, Tyler Montague right behind him. Tyler hadn\u2019t said a word but looked concerned. Will felt a little stab of envy, but he knew that he had the same sense of closeness with his own Krewe, all wonderful people. It would be easy to become attached to this Texas Krewe, as well.</p><p>When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Kat was standing in the entry waiting for them, a stack of journals in her hands. She seemed calm enough, and yet a little shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Will asked</p><p>\u201cI saw him,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Tyler echoed. \u201cWho? You okay, Kat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cOne of our ghosts showed up. Mr. Miller. He found me in the office. He wants us to help him bring his killer to justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...gone?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI guess he\u2019s still...finding his way. He was standing in front of me clear as day and he spoke to me, said that a mummy killed him, and then he faded away. But he trusts us,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe trusts us...to track down a killer mummy?\u201d Tyler spoke incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty strange things,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Will looked at her sharply. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in a killer mummy,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m sure you believe exactly what I believe\u2014that someone with access to historical artifacts, as in a researcher or museum employee, is dressing up like a mummy. Most of the costume probably isn\u2019t real, but the culprit has taken wrapping from a real mummy somewhere and, accidentally or on purpose, is leaving those bits around to be discovered. There you go. That explains the continuation of the mummy\u2019s curse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a mummy from a shipwreck didn\u2019t kill Brady Laurie,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cUnless things have changed since I went down in the deep, those wrappings\u2014real or fake\u2014would start to disintegrate quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but how better to give an elderly man with a heart condition cardiac arrest than by walking in on him as a mummy\u2014and then slapping his digitalis out of his hand?\u201d Will touched Kat\u2019s cheek gently. \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time for us to meet back at the hotel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll wait for us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you and Sean supposed to meet up with the film crew tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>They split up at their cars but drove straight back to the hotel. Logan had ordered food to the suite, and serving dishes, warmed by Sterno burners, were set up along one of the buffets. The table was filled with the team members, surrounded by computers and sheets of work they\u2019d printed during the day.</p><p>With all seven of them gathered in the room, Logan started a wipe-clean chart to write down what they\u2019d discovered; this was their usual procedure. Someone had access to mummy wrapping used in ancient Egypt. It had been discovered in two places, so obviously that someone had tried to get into Will\u2019s and Kat\u2019s rooms when they\u2019d first arrived. Someone\u2014or two someones working together\u2014had wanted to scare everyone around them with the possibility of Amun Mopat\u2019s curse.</p><p>Kat reported on speaking with Austin Miller\u2019s ghost at his home, and explained how speaking with him verified that someone had come upon him\u2014the mummy, according to Austin\u2014and the bruise on his arm had come when \u201cthe mummy\u201d blocked him from getting to his medication. She told them what she\u2019d heard Amanda say about finding it during her phone call, and what she\u2019d seen in her mind\u2019s eye during the dive.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go with you all?\u201d Will asked, looking around the table.</p><p>\u201cThe active members of the Egyptian Sand Diggers number forty. It was forty-one, but now with Austin Miller gone...well, it\u2019s down to forty,\u201d Logan said. \u201cThey come from every walk of life and range from the youngest, who\u2019s just turned twenty-one, to the oldest member, Dirk Manning. I was able to speak to about five of them at the club today, and they all seemed genuinely sad that Austin was no longer among them. They believe in art and history\u2014and they all say there is no curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned that Andy Simonton of Simonton\u2019s Sea Search, has a little Mako\u2014and that it was out on the lake the day Brady Laurie died,\u201d Kelsey said. She sat perched on the table near Logan. Will had realized that Logan and Kelsey were a couple, but he also saw that it didn\u2019t matter when they were working.</p><p>He lowered his head, distracted. In his own Krewe, Jackson Crow and Angela were together and, he thought, planning on marriage in the near future. He knew that with most agencies, teams were usually split up if members became romantically involved, but there was nothing usual about how they worked. Their offices were even separate\u2014an experimental section of the FBI.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake and returned his attention to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cSo Andy Simonton was out on the lake?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no certainty that Andy Simonton was the one out on his boat. All we know is that the dock master noted it was gone during the day. Andy keeps his little speedboat at a public dock, but the company\u2019s salvage ship stays at their own wharf,\u201d Kelsey explained.</p><p>\u201cI was at Landry Salvage,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAnd they have two large salvage ships, kept at their own dock, and two smaller motorboats, both of which sleep six. However, they\u2019re at a private dock, and the dockmaster there didn\u2019t remember either of them being gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimonton\u2019s boat was on the lake,\u201d Logan murmured, adding that notation to the board. He looked at Will. \u201cI hear you\u2019re something of a master magician,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a magician. Magic is tricks, of course, and sleight of hand,\u201d Will responded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you did work as a magician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn eighty feet of water could you make it look like you were a mummy?\u201d Logan asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou can make anything appear to be whatever you want\u2014the key is that you do something that persuades your audience to suspend disbelief. Then you go in with the trick, which might not be perfect, but because your audience is ready to see what you want them to see, they will. Like this.\u201d He reached over to Kat\u2019s ear and moved his hand forward, presenting a silver dollar.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was good,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve been stowing silver dollars in your ears, Kat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and you barely touched it,\u201d Kat told Will.</p><p>Will smiled at her. \u201cWhen we were talking, I made the natural movements I might make during conversation. I had my hand in my pocket, but then I waved it near your ear, so you never saw me with the silver dollar.\u201d</p><p>She took the dollar from him.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s mine\u2014it was my ear, right?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as making it look as if a mummy\u2019s attacking you in the depths,\u201d Jane said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re talking about a much more complicated illusion, but it could be done,\u201d Will said. \u201cYou get the right dive suit. Then you find out what kind of bandaging would work best in the water\u2014appear the most real\u2014and you come down prepared to shed your tank while you perform the illusion. And you\u2019ve got just that. An illusion. But I don\u2019t think Brady Laurie fell for it so easily. That\u2019s why there\u2019s bruising around his mouth. His regulator was torn from him. And someone held him. At least, I believe I\u2019m correct about that. Kat, those bruises looked like ones that would appear postmortem if someone had been held, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo all we need to do is find a mummy dive suit,\u201d Kelsey said, rolling her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that would require a hundred search warrants from judges who have to be convinced that a drowning victim was actually murdered and so was an elderly man who had a heart attack. Or maybe we can get Austin Miller to appear before a judge. And if the judge doesn\u2019t have a heart attack, Austin can try to convince him that a mummy did him in.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s phone rang, startling him. He excused himself to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Bernie. I hear Sean is in\u2014the two of you coming over to see what kind of footage we\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Will glanced at his watch. \u201cBernie,\u201d he said, nodding at Sean Cameron. \u201cHe\u2019s expecting Sean and me to see the film they\u2019ve taken thus far,\u201d he told the others.</p><p>Sean rose. \u201cReady whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>But Will was surprised to realize that he wasn\u2019t ready to go. He had, in a short period of time, become accustomed to working with Kat.</p><p>\u201cGo see what there is to see,\u201d Logan told them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Jane said to Kat, \u201cLet\u2019s get started on the face in that vision of yours.\u201d</p> <p>Kat nodded, but Will was glad to see that she was watching him\u2014watching him as he left. She gave him a smile, and he felt something inside him quiver.</p><p>Tinker Bell? Yeah, was what he\u2019d thought.</p><p>If so, he sure wanted to be Peter Pan.</p><p>That\u2019s so sophomoric! he told himself.</p><p>But when she watched him go and he saw her eyes, he felt rivulets of heat race through his veins.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t bother to tell himself that she was his colleague.</p><p>That just made her more appealing. No, she couldn\u2019t be more appealing.</p><p>She was everything a ghost-seeking illusionist turned law enforcement agent could ever want\u2014beauty, perfection...and understanding.</p><p>And then there were the basic but ravenous feelings he\u2019d begun to experience when he was near her, as primal as the earth and air.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember most?\u201d Jane asked Kat.</p><p>\u201cThe eyes. They were large and dark. And they seemed to be rimmed with a black liner,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd the face was lean and cleanly cut. Oval-shaped, I think. Classic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight. No twists, bulbs, lifts, curves\u2014very straight.\u201d</p><p>Jane sketched out the oval and the eyes and began shading, drawing in the nose. Then she asked about the mouth.</p><p>\u201cFull. Full lower and upper lip,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Jane asked, pointing to the sketch.</p><p>\u201cA little thinner in the cheeks.\u201d</p><p>Tyler had come to stand behind them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him. He\u2019s coming along nicely,\u201d Kat said. \u201cMaybe darken the eyes a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like someone,\u201d Tyler muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Kelsey stood over them then, Logan close beside her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on it,\u201d Tyler said, \u201cbut...there\u2019s something familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had on a hat. Not a turban, but it had width and substance and made him taller. Let\u2019s see...his chest was bare. And he wore a heavy necklace,\u201d Kat recalled.</p><p>Jane sketched the headdress and Kat instructed her to broaden it.</p><p>\u201cThat looks like an Egyptian ceremonial headdress,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI saw a few that were very similar on the pictures and statues we\u2019ve been studying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgyptian, and how strange in many ways. The ancient culture lasted almost thirty centuries, and yet, so much remained the same throughout the dynasties,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI was in the Sand Diggers\u2019 house, I was in Austin Miller\u2019s house and\u2014\u201d She broke off and looked up at Kelsey. \u201cYou\u2019re right. There are all kinds of similar faces....\u201d</p><p>Tyler, who now sat across from her, took her hands and squeezed them. \u201cHey, Kat. You seem worried. An ancient Egyptian did not come walking across the water to sink the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Tyler was the team muscle\u2014but he was also incredibly intelligent and surprisingly sensitive for the tough cowboy he often seemed to be. They\u2019d connected like brother and sister from the first time they\u2019d met, a number of years ago. \u201cI know that, Tyler. And don\u2019t worry. I definitely don\u2019t believe that an Egyptian priest could create a giant image of himself to sink a ship. But I do think there was more than weather out there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay. All we have to do, then, is figure out what happened that night.\u201d</p><p>Logan sat at the head of the table, frowning as he looked at Kat. \u201cInteresting. The ship went down over a hundred years ago, and while you were able to get a little more information from Miller this evening, he couldn\u2019t give you a name\u2014he gave you a mummy. But what you see when you dream and when you\u2019re below goes back to the sinking of the ship. I wonder if that has any bearing on what\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially,\u201d Jane added, \u201cif Amanda is searching for something specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, finding something specific in a ship that\u2019s lain on the bottom of Lake Michigan for more than a century is...worse than looking for a needle in a haystack!\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Amanda?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cAny ideas on how we find out whether she was involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like Will or Sean to get their hands on her computer,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Tyler grinned. \u201cThere is that pesky little thing called illegal search and seizure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, Tyler and Sean should dive with the film crew. Alan King told me that Amanda and Jon were bringing out their larger ship. It has a small crane and they plan to start pulling up a few of the boxes.\u201d Logan drummed his fingers on his desk. \u201cMaybe now we\u2019ll find out what Amanda is up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman is one skinny little witch!\u201d Earl Candy said.</p><p>He was showing the film he\u2019d taken the first day, which included Amanda having a fit on the deck of the film crew\u2019s boat. Will watched her, even though he\u2019d been there.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the other footage, and he knew she hadn\u2019t been down at the Jerry McGuen to kill Brady Laurie; there just hadn\u2019t been time. But maybe there was something hidden beneath the surface that was of more value than they\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cHow could there be anything more valuable than what they\u2019ve discovered so far?\u201d he mused aloud.</p><p>\u201cThe treasure does, in essence, belong to the state,\u201d Alan King said. He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know much about the black market, but if there were a major piece\u2014wouldn\u2019t everyone know once it went on the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black market exists all over the world and most collectors will talk about it if, say, a Rembrandt or Matisse appears on the market somewhere. But finding out who actually has it or where it may be or how money changed hands is a nightmare. Once something disappears into the hands of a private collector, it disappears\u2014sometimes for centuries,\u201d Will said. He spoke without looking at Alan. Like Sean, he kept his eyes glued to the film. \u201cThen, suddenly, you\u2019ll hear about an auction\u2014perhaps an estate auction\u2014and there it\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the family supposedly knew nothing about it,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Will interrupted him. \u201cHold on. That\u2019s the second dive on the second day, right?\u201d He hadn\u2019t been the first to get to the Jerry McGuen\u2019s hold. He\u2019d been with Kat, hovering near her in case she stopped breathing as she stared at the salon.</p><p>\u201cYeah, second dive, second day,\u201d Earl Candy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Bernie asked Will.</p><p>Will nodded at Earl. \u201cGo back to the end of the first dive, please.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced over at him, repeating Bernie\u2019s question. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe nothing. It just seemed that something changed. I wish I had a photographic memory, but I don\u2019t. Can you tell whether anything\u2019s off?\u201d</p><p>Earl Candy set his digital video back to the end of the first dive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had an angle of the divers starting to go up and, as he followed, he had a shot of the hold as he went up himself. The blue-green darkness of the water seemed to swallow it up and even the bulk of the Jerry McGuen slowly faded away.</p><p>He fast-forwarded through the footage he\u2019d taken on deck. Then the divers entered the water again and he followed Amanda and Jon down to the hold of the ship a second time.</p><p>\u201cHold it, Earl,\u201d Will said, leaning forward to point at the computer screen. \u201cThere\u2014that door. That bulkhead door. It was ajar every time we went down. Now it looks as if it\u2019s closed tight.\u201d</p> <p>Earl ran the two different views of the hold again.</p><p>\u201cCould be motion in the lake,\u201d Sean commented doubtfully. \u201cIn the water, the motion one of us makes can become amplified, sending currents that displace it elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Will looked at Sean, who was looking back at him.</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cBut we both think someone else was down there, don\u2019t we?\u201d Sean asked him.</p> <p>\u201cHow? How are they doing it?\u201d Alan was distraught. \u201cWe keep a boat there as security. We watch for anyone remotely near us on the lake.\u201d</p><p>Will sat back, folding his arms over his chest and smiling. \u201cI think I might know,\u201d he said. He glanced around. \u201cThe answer should have smacked us in the face from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>The drawing was completed and attached to the board. Logan doled out the various journals Kat had taken from Austin Miller\u2019s house so that his writing could be read more thoroughly. Will and Sean were still out, but they all said good-night; morning would come soon.</p><p>Kat went to her room but walked through to Will\u2019s. She cleaned Bastet\u2019s litter box and gave her more food and water, telling her as she did that a cat as regal as an Egyptian Mau should have toilet trained herself. Bastet looked at her balefully, as if to say she disdained such activities.</p><p>Kat hovered there, wishing that Will had come back. She really wasn\u2019t a coward, and she wasn\u2019t afraid of being alone, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling some dread about the things she saw in her dreams. She realized she needed to see them, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier.</p><p>She remembered the way Austin Miller had appeared to her that evening, and how convinced he was that he\u2019d been killed by a mummy. She\u2019d tried to tell him the mummy had been a man and hoped he\u2019d believed her in the end. \u201cThe curse was written on the tomb wall,\u201d Miller had said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat respectable Egyptian with power and money would die without a curse on the wall? It was to stop tomb-raiders,\u201d Kat had told him.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re tomb-raiders, aren\u2019t we? We deserve to be stopped,\u201d he\u2019d said, just before fading away. He was such a new ghost; he might find tomorrow or in the days to come that he could maintain his soul\u2019s image for those who could see. He was a charming man, and she hoped she\u2019d get to speak with him again.</p><p>She wondered if they were tomb-raiders. But she knew, perhaps more than most, that the saying You can\u2019t take it with you was entirely true. Dust to dust and ashes to ashes and all that was organic in life would eventually disappear. The soul was the essence of a person, and no amount of finery could change that.</p><p>She realized she wasn\u2019t frightened on the physical plane. She was a good shot, and she\u2019d learned how to deal with criminals and psychotics in instances when she wasn\u2019t armed and someone had to be \u201ctalked down.\u201d</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t like being alone now because she was accustomed to Will\u2019s presence. She sat in his hotel room with the cat; it wasn\u2019t really his place, and yet it reminded her of him. His aftershave was very subtle and pleasant and somehow spoke of breezy tropic nights and the sea. His shirts were neatly hung in the closet, his diving gear ready by the door. Always rinsed and always checked. He wasn\u2019t obsessive, she\u2019d learned. He was far more casual than she was, unless it had to do with survival\u2014such as diving equipment\u2014or something that wasn\u2019t right, like McFarland\u2019s desire to shelve Brady Laurie\u2019s death as an accident.</p><p>She needed to sleep. She stroked Bastet but left her curled up on Will\u2019s bed. It was as if the cat missed him, too.</p><p>She walked through to her own room, slowly got ready for bed and finally turned off all but the night-light streaming from the bathroom and lay down to sleep.</p><p>She started to think about the major players, at least the ones they knew. The film crew, who\u2019d called them in. But she didn\u2019t believe any member of that group could be involved. There were the two men from the Egyptian Sand Diggers, but Dirk Manning was nearing eighty and Austin Miller was dead. At the Preservation Center, Amanda\u2014highly suspicious, but constantly with them or on video or witnessed by others. And there was Jon Hunt, a far more amenable scholar with whom to work. Then there were Landry Salvage and Simonton\u2019s Sea Search. Landry was rich and definitely aware of what was going on. She didn\u2019t want Andy Simonton to be involved; he had seemed too nice and down-to-earth.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t make him innocent, she reminded herself. Many a serial killer had turned out to be the boy-next-door type.</p><p>At last, physical exhaustion seemed to settle her mind, and she drifted into sleep. Even as she did, she tried to fight the fact that she was slipping into another plane where she saw things.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t really see things, of course. There was no magic that let her see the past as it had been. People experienced haunting in two different ways. Residual haunting, in which events and the emotions they generated seemed to remain through the violence or energy of what had happened. It was why people saw Civil War soldiers in the misty fields of Gettysburg, or why some houses were haunted by murder victims.</p><p>Then there were \u201cintelligent\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d hauntings, such as Austin Miller returning to the place he loved, the place he\u2019d lived all his life. Returning to tell her that justice needed to be done, his killer needed to pay\u2014and his killer had been a mummy.</p><p>What filled her dreams? Residual haunting or active ones?</p><p>They seemed so very real.</p><p>She could feel the night and, at first, everything that touched her senses was lovely. How could the moon ride the sky so beautifully before being obliterated by darkness? The breeze seemed soft, but she knew it would grow to be a bitter and icy cold. She could hear the music, the rustle of silk gowns. The sounds of laughter and pleasant conversation were all around her. But as she stood on the deck, she knew what was coming. The couple brushed by her, the woman fearful, the man quick to reassure her.</p><p>It all happened as before. The moon was consumed by darkness in the sky; the breeze turned quickly and viciously into a cold wind. The brutal kiss of ice seemed to touch her skin. She heard laughter change to screams.</p><p>And from the darkness, she could see it coming. Massive and dark\u2014part of the darkness that covered the moon? There were cries all around her.</p><p>\u201cCursed!\u201d someone screamed.</p><p>And there it was....</p><p>She saw the figure\u2014the giant figure of the ancient Egyptian. It seemed to be fifty-feet high. It was coming closer and closer and seemed about to devour them all....</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The water was all around her. She was so cold she couldn\u2019t feel her body anymore, but her lungs were burning.</p><p>\u201cKat!\u201d</p><p>Distantly, she heard her name being called.</p><p>\u201cKat, breathe, breathe!\u201d</p><p>She woke. There was something pressing down on her, something pressing air into her lungs. There was pressure on her mouth, but it was a good pressure, and she was no longer cold. She was warmed by the body heat of the man on top of her.</p><p>She inhaled deeply, coughed, inhaled again.</p><p>She looked into Will\u2019s eyes. He was seated beside her by then, watching her breathe, dark eyes filled with concern and relief in one. She edged herself into a sitting position, still staring at him, afraid of what had happened, yet secure because he was with her again.</p><p>\u201cIn and out, breathe slowly.... I\u2019ll get you some water,\u201d he said.</p><p>He stood and hurried to the bathroom, returning with a glass of water. \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Just breathe and sip.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and leaned against the headboard. She sipped the water until she felt that her lungs were whole again, that oxygen was filling her system. She wasn\u2019t dizzy and she wasn\u2019t confused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I guess I drown in the dream,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should keep going down to that ship,\u201d he said worriedly.</p><p>She set the glass on her side table. \u201cI\u2019m not down at the ship, Will. I\u2019m safe in bed with a bunch of other agents near me\u2014and you with me,\u201d she added at the end. \u201cI have to keep going to the ship. My subconscious or someone from that ship keeps trying to tell me something, and I have to figure out what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if it\u2019s \u2018Hey, you\u2019re drowning!\u2019\u201d</p><p>She smiled. His muscles were still taut with tension, and his striking face was almost haggard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to leave you at all,\u201d he told her.</p><p>For a moment, time seemed to freeze.</p><p>This was it; this was her chance. Should she be flippant? Honest? Was she seeing something that wasn\u2019t really there, something she wanted to see? The light in his eyes said that he felt as she felt, not just the closeness because of what they were, but the attraction that happened between certain people.</p><p>She inhaled on a ragged breath. \u201cThen don\u2019t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand guard, I swear,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t want you standing guard ready to do more CPR,\u201d she told him. \u201cStay with me.\u201d One more breath and she could get it out. \u201cSleep with me.\u201d</p><p>He looked back her. A smile tugged at his lips. \u201cKat, you don\u2019t have to...\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he really understood. It was time to risk all. She could live with humiliation; she couldn\u2019t live with herself if she didn\u2019t carry through with this right now.</p><p>She could still taste his lips on hers.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned forward, slipping her arms around him and pulling him down with her. Finding his mouth, she pressed her lips to his in a way that had nothing to do with protection or security, and everything to do with need. With hunger.</p><p>He returned the kiss.</p><p>His touch was everything she\u2019d dreamed. She felt the sweet fire of his tongue sliding over her mouth and delving deep within. The strength of his body seemed to seep into her, and she held him close, melding with him as his mouth made love to hers.</p> <p>Then he drew away, breathless.</p><p>Again he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, does this feel like have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019ve wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gorgeous,\u201d she broke in, \u201cbut...stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant, a jerk!\u201d The taste of his mouth was like an aphrodisiac and his body so tightly against hers made her feel...combustible.</p><p>\u201cTinker Bell,\u201d he whispered around a kiss.</p><p>\u201cTinker Bell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful little fairy,\u201d he said, reaching for the hem of her nightshirt.</p><p>As she struggled out of it she looked at him and laughed. He smiled, too, and then his eyes were on her body and she molded herself against his chest. She had no idea what time it was; she didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d returned to the hotel a while before he\u2019d awakened her because he was in his night garb as well, men\u2019s long pajama pants. His chest was naked and solid against her own. His lips fell to her collarbone and then below. Entangled, they slid back into the bed. Under the soft cotton fabric of his pajama bottoms she could feel the rise of his erection, and that alone seemed to escalate an almost frantic desire in her. Yet she suddenly felt a sense of panic, and she stopped, tugging at the thick sleek darkness of his hair so that he looked up at her. \u201cI\u2019m so thoughtless,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this wrong? Is there someone in your life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot now. Not in a long time,\u201d he told her. And the way his mouth curved, almost wistfully, made her wonder if his life had been like hers, if those who had loved him hadn\u2019t been able to love him enough. Or if a greater tragedy had changed his life. She would ask later, because she had to know, but not now.</p><p>\u201cI should ask the same, except I\u2019m guessing that since you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one,\u201d she said.</p><p>He began to kiss her again, and she writhed beneath his touch, euphoric at the feel of his hair, the rippling muscles in his back. Then, just as he had made her nearly delirious with a series of very liquid kisses along her breasts, he pulled back. \u201cWait. I wasn\u2019t planning... I\u2019m not prepared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said and laughed softly. \u201cEver hopeful,\u201d she murmured, meeting his eyes as she marveled at a lock of his hair.</p><p>He smiled and moved back against her. She felt the tip of his tongue graze her nipple and his mouth form around it and she seemed to melt into the softness of the bed.</p><p>Nightmares were dispelled in the excitement of being alive.</p><p>She remembered the first time she\u2019d seen him, how instantly he had drawn her attention and curiosity. Now she could touch him, explore the length and contours of his body, and she did. She felt his every kiss, his every caress, so keenly. She moved against him in turn, fascinated by the way his body seemed to tremble beneath hers. Her kisses covered his abdomen, teased his sex, and then she rose again to meet his eyes. He held her there, studying her eyes as if in equal wonder. She knew that sex was instinct, and yet she knew equally that this was somehow different. Tonight was like breathing. She found herself laughing, feeling his fingertips on her skin, his kisses growing more demanding and intimate. It seemed as if the world would explode except that he rose, shimmying up her body again, the pressure of his flesh and heat so ecstatic it was nearly agony. Then he lifted himself above her, and she was so eager for him that he seemed part of her, a fit that was custom-made, exquisite. Slowly he sank into her, deeper and deeper, and she felt as though the world itself stood still. They both moved as if there\u2019d never be enough time, as if they had to fulfill the yearning, desperate to reach a climax, desperate to prolong it. Every fantasy she\u2019d ever had about lovemaking occurred. Heaven seemed real, above her and around her, in the touch and feel of him, the beating of his heart....</p> <p>For long moments they lay panting, damp, their breathing ragged, their pulses still racing. He stroked her hair and drew her against him. He didn\u2019t speak, and neither did she.</p><p>Eventually, he said, \u201cWe should sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we should.\u201d</p><p>But they didn\u2019t. Not then. They were a modern wonder of the world to each other, and there was simply no way they could restrain that feeling so easily.</p><p>They made love again.</p><p>And when Kat finally slept it was deeply, and if she dreamed or was plagued by any nightmares, she didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>\u201cAn underwater propulsion device,\u201d Will said. \u201cA diver propulsion device.\u201d He was speaking to the group at the breakfast table. \u201cI believe that our mystery diver, the person who killed Brady Laurie and has been looking for something ever since Brady\u2019s calculations found the Jerry McGuen, has what is basically an underwater motorcycle,\u201d he said, looking at each person in turn.</p><p>\u201cLike James Bond,\u201d Jane murmured.</p><p>Will smiled. \u201cI have some friends up on the northeast coast who have them\u2014they\u2019re great for going after lobster. Yes, you\u2019ve seen them in movies, but they are real. I think they were developed for the military, but they can be bought easily enough, although not quite as easily as a regulator or a dive tank. Even with that kind of motorized help, you have to watch your pressure, but as long as you take the proper steps descending and ascending, it can get you somewhere quickly and allow a fair amount of bottom time.\u201d He glanced at them all. \u201cSomeone could have a boat anchored a good distance away, and still be able to get to the site, spend time there, then return to the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of that before?\u201d Logan asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t see a lot of people using them,\u201d Kat suggested. \u201cConsidering the temperature of the water at depth, and the speed, it would be one cold ride. Not all that pleasurable. A lobsterman does it for the lobster. He isn\u2019t thinking, \u2018Oh, boy, let me go freeze my buns off!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, even with that security boat at the site,\u201d Logan said, \u201cwe have no real idea how many times someone might have been down there.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cWhat we need is Brady Laurie\u2019s computer. The police went through it, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have known what to look for. And we need to find out who he was communicating with about the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get hold of his computer,\u201d Logan told them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start research on motorized diving mechanisms and vehicles\u2014and who might have one,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll work with the pictures and reference books,\u201d Jane put in.</p><p>\u201cKat and Will, you need to get going for the dive. The big guns are coming out today, right?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cSome of them, yes. They\u2019re bringing the larger research vessel with the crane,\u201d Will replied.</p><p>When Kat and Will rose to head out to the dive site, Tyler and Sean rose, too.</p><p>Sean grinned at them both. \u201cSafety in numbers,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for it,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>The four of them piled into his rental car, stuffing their scuba gear in the trunk. It was a tight fit, even with Kat, the smallest, in the cramped backseat.</p><p>\u201cThis is good. One of us needs to keep an eye on Kat while the others are watching Amanda and the salvage efforts,\u201d Will said. He felt a pinch; she\u2019d gotten him from the backseat. He was startled and caught her eyes in the rearview mirror.</p><p>But Tyler turned to her. \u201cYou\u2019re daydreaming in the water?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine as long as one of us is with you,\u201d Sean told her firmly.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not arguing,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...I\u2019m a good diver, so once we\u2019re past the salon and down in the hold, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>When they got to the dock, they discovered that they were all going out on the Glory, the Preservation Center\u2019s main exploration and recovery vessel. It was outfitted with the cranes and wenches and chains they\u2019d need to bring up larger objects.</p><p>Again, Amanda was taking the lead. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to make sure the crates are properly secured. We\u2019re going back more than three thousand years to the New Kingdom and the time of Ramses II. One of those crates contains the sarcophagi, inner and outer, of Amun Mopat, and it\u2019s possible\u2014just possible\u2014that we could safely bring up the mummy. That would be extraordinary. We\u2019ll make news across the entire world. You can\u2019t imagine what an amazing feat that will be. So you have to understand that the filming doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, looking at the crew, \u201cand that protecting us because someone drowned earlier doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She paused again and looked at the agents. Then she stared at Captain Bob and Jimmy, who\u2019d been hired on for the day, Captain Bob to watch the boat and Jimmy to keep an eye on the divers.</p><p>There were also two interns from the Preservation Center, two twentysomethings, Ted and Carlo. They were gazing at Amanda wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cYou are all working for me on this,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Alan King said, \u201cI believe we\u2019re all working under the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois and that I\u2019m still financing what\u2019s going on. But we appreciate your expertise, Dr. Channel, and we will be excruciatingly careful in all endeavors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. You have to understand the value of what we\u2019re doing. And if you don\u2019t, we should let it go to someone else!\u201d</p><p>When they turned away, Will heard Jon warning Amanda, \u201cHey, ease up. The film guys could get pissed off and pull out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Amanda said. \u201cAnd go through all the paperwork to get started again\u2014with someone else?\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come on like the Hulk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>As they walked away, Will joined the Krewe; the others were carefully checking their air tanks.</p> <p>Kat sat at his side, staring out at the water as they headed to the site. Sean came over and hunkered down near them. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a few minutes after the first dive to work with Earl on setting up a remote. After what you said last evening, I think we need a camera down there. Someone\u2019s coming and going from the site, or at least that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. He indicated Kat with the slightest movement of his head, but she saw him. \u201cHey, if you need to work on that, too, just do it!\u201d she said. \u201cI only have the vision or whatever it is when we first reach the salon. Once we get to the hold, I\u2019m okay, and coming up I\u2019ll be okay, too. If we\u2019re connecting chains to big crates, I have a feeling that all hands will be required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m needed, I\u2019ll help out with them,\u201d Will assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a functioning member of the Krewe,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Sean was watching her intently. \u201cEvery one of us needs the others to watch our backs\u2014and whatever you\u2019re learning may be very important. What Kelsey saw in dreams led us to the truth at the Alamo, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Kat didn\u2019t argue. She studied the water, her blond hair streaming around her, blue eyes as deep as the lake and sky.</p><p>But that day, Will needn\u2019t have worried. Kat paused by the salon, then turned to him and shook her head. Nothing was happening. They followed everyone else to the hold.</p><p>The real difficulty was fitting themselves and the chains that were attached to the crane above inside the hold. The hull was broken out, but it was jagged in some areas and, in others, zebra mussels could cause serious damage to dive suits and equipment. Jimmy didn\u2019t attempt to help. Amanda managed to be just as authoritative with her hand signals beneath the water as she was with her voice on top. Tyler, Sean and Will moved as directed, trying to maneuver the large, tarp-covered crate through the broken area of the hull and onto the lake bed. Will noticed the big block writing that indicated it contained the valuable sarcophagi. Once they had it out, he and Tyler handled the crate while the others worked with the chains at Amanda\u2019s command. Finally, the crate was secured, the massive hook set into the center ring and two more on either side, and it was time to raise it. Jimmy gave the chain a tug, indicating to his uncle and the two interns above that they should start turning the giant winch, and the divers began to follow the slow ascent of the crate.</p><p>When they reached the boat again, the divers emerged while the weight of the water balanced the crate. They divested themselves of their tanks and regulators as they got the crate on board. Finally, the feat was accomplished, and although Amanda wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to touch the crate once it was positioned, she was beside herself with jubilation, certain they had, at the very least, obtained the sarcophagi.</p><p>Amanda was happy; she didn\u2019t want to dive again that day, she wanted to get her treasure back to the center where it could be opened in a climate-controlled room under the right circumstances.</p><p>\u201cAnd without any fear of a curse!\u201d Jon said cheerfully.</p> <p>She was immediately dismissive. \u201cOh, please! Newspapers started all that. Sure, the pharaohs warned people away from their treasures. Who wants to go to the world of the gods without a lot of jewels and servants? But did the lights in Cairo go out because Tut\u2019s tomb was discovered, or did they always go out in Cairo at the time? I\u2019m pretty sure that was the case. Some people did die naturally, or through accidents that would have occurred, anyway. It\u2019s like...even a broken clock is right twice a day. People can make events look like a curse. I mean, Howard Carter lived for years and years\u2014and he\u2019s the one who actually found the tomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t someone die when the sarcophagus was opened?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cIf so, it had to be that some kind of organic matter in the corpse was toxic. Anyway, we take precautions in the laboratory,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cThere\u2019s no curse, and you know that!\u201d she said, glancing around at the others. \u201cLet\u2019s go back. This is a triumphant day!\u201d</p><p>Earl Candy stared at Will and Sean, and Will said, \u201cA few of us are going to board the security boat for the day and set up a remote camera, Amanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? You already have a boat standing guard,\u201d Amanda said.</p><p>\u201cTo keep an eye on everything below. We want to guard your treasures,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Jon said with undisguised eagerness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still confused.\u201d Amanda frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not bringing anything up, right? It\u2019s illegal. The Preservation Center is the only entity approved to handle the recovery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmanda, I swear, we\u2019re not going to touch anything,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to safeguard what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she agreed, although she was clearly unhappy about it. Then she looked at her crate again, and Will wondered if she\u2019d ever be capable of giving a lover such a look of absolute adoration.</p><p>Alan contacted the security boat, and the two vessels brought out their bumpers, linking up long enough to transfer men and equipment.</p><p>Will paused, feeling anxious as he thought of Kat.</p><p>He felt a hand on his shoulder. It was Tyler Montague. \u201cI\u2019ll stick with Kat like glue, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded, ready to resume his work. But then he felt another touch on his shoulder and turned to see that Kat was smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. You take care, huh? And don\u2019t let Sean get too carried away with his filming.\u201d She stood on her toes and kissed his cheek, then waved as he and Sean joined the film crew on the security boat.</p><p>With an uneasy feeling, one he couldn\u2019t explain, Will watched the Glory head back to dock. But he gave himself a mental shake and listened to Earl describe the camera; he even joined in on the discussion about where he and Sean should set it.</p><p>As he prepared for the dive, Will thought about the uncomfortable feeling that seemed to be gnawing at his gut.</p><p>And then he knew why.</p><p>It was the mummy.</p><p>Amun Mopat\u2019s mummy was going into Chicago.</p><p>And, according Austin Miller\u2019s revenant, the mummy did it.</p><p>10</p><p>Kat wasn\u2019t worried about getting back to the hotel or wherever she needed to go; she could always call a cab.</p><p>But when they reached the docks, she found that Tyler had gotten Will\u2019s keys to the rented Honda, and they could leave whenever they were ready. Alan King and the film crew would bring Sean and Will back.</p><p>\u201cWant to watch them unload?\u201d Tyler asked Kat as they looked at the ship and everyone milling around.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather watch Amanda when they open that crate,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll open the crate in a climate-controlled room at the Preservation Center. And it won\u2019t be for a while. They have to get it off the boat now, into a truck and then get it to the center.\u201d Tyler gestured down the dock. \u201cAnd all hail! The press is here.\u201d</p><p>Media had come in droves. Kat could see TV reporters and cameras from all over the country\u2014and the globe. She recognized some of the major networks: CNN, BBC, NBC and more.</p><p>Apparently they\u2019d all gotten word that the mummy of Amun Mopat was coming in. Kat wondered if someone\u2014Amanda?\u2014had purposely alerted them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kat whispered to Tyler. \u201cHow come they\u2019re here today? This is the third day we\u2019ve been out on the lake, and Brady actually discovered the wreck and died on Monday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither they learned that the Glory went out this morning, or they got a heads-up that something major was happening.\u201d He grimaced and indicated Amanda.</p><p>\u201cI wondered about that myself,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Amanda announced grandly. She looked like a queen about to meet her people.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there yet,\u201d Jon warned her. Obviously he hadn\u2019t been party to this media scrum.</p><p>Amanda leaped from the boat to the dock and started down its length to the gate, where the reporters had been held at bay.</p><p>Questions shot out at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought up the first of the treasures!\u201d one man cried. \u201cIs it the mummy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have visual proof that it\u2019s the Jerry McGuen?\u201d a woman with an English accent asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of the curse?\u201d someone else asked.</p><p>\u201cDid the ship kill your coworker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the curse kill Brady Laurie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the death of Austin Miller is connected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in the curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you report to the scientific community on your discovery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be filming when you open the crate?\u201d</p><p>The questions came in a flurry from all directions. Amanda raised a hand. \u201cPlease!\u201d she said and laughed pleasantly. \u201cYes, it\u2019s the Jerry McGuen, and King Productions\u2014working on a documentary about our historic find\u2014will have footage for the media soon. I\u2019m a scientist, and I don\u2019t believe in curses. I\u2019m heartbroken that both Brady and Austin are dead. Brady\u2019s excitement led to his carelessness, I\u2019m afraid, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s watching over us as we continue his work, and that he\u2019s thrilled! Austin must have died knowing that, as well. We\u2019ve followed through on his dream! Now, I believe we\u2019ve found\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jon Hunt had been standing quietly behind her. He stepped forward at that, cutting her off. \u201cWe believe we have definitely found a major artifact from the tomb, but exactly what it is, we don\u2019t really know yet. As soon as we do, we\u2019ll have a press conference, and tell you all about it. We have to ask you to clear the way, however. We\u2019re going to unload and get our find to the Preservation Center.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Captain Bob and Jimmy were maneuvering the crane again, carefully lifting the crate from the deck of the Glory to the dock and onto a dolly, held tightly by the two interns. A large truck lettered with the Preservation Center\u2019s name waited beyond the group of reporters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give them a hand with this. That\u2019s a heavy crate for two skinny scientific types to handle,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cYou go, cowboy,\u201d Kat told him.</p> <p>The media didn\u2019t disperse; meanwhile, Captain Bob, Jimmy, Tyler and the interns managed to move the crate while Amanda continued to talk to the press. Jon hovered behind her, listening closely for what she might say. It was actually an amusing spectacle, Kat thought.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you open the crate?\u201d one of the reporters asked Amanda.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll open it when the conditions are right\u2014and the film crew is there to document every step,\u201d Jon corrected.</p><p>\u201cQuite a show, quite a show!\u201d Captain Bob said. He\u2019d finished his work with the crane and had come to stand by her. \u201cBy the way, someone left a cell phone in the galley. Is it yours? Or maybe one of your coworkers\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see. Thanks, Bob.\u201d</p><p>Kat hurried down to the galley. The phone on the table wasn\u2019t hers, which she\u2019d known; hers was in her bag. When she turned it on, the picture on the screen was of King Tut\u2019s death mask.</p><p>It was Amanda\u2019s phone.</p><p>She scrolled through the numbers called recently but none of them meant anything to her.</p><p>Then she paused. Looking at Amanda\u2019s phone like this wasn\u2019t legal.</p><p>Of course, it was in plain sight. Kat told herself that she was only taking it to return to its rightful owner. Any information gleaned from it without a warrant couldn\u2019t be used in court, but...</p> <p>They were searching for a killer.</p><p>She took out her own cell phone and started snapping pictures of the numbers called over the past few days. But then she heard voices. She quickly checked Amanda\u2019s last few emails, and snapped pictures again, then hurried up the galley stairs in time to innocently hand the phone to Amanda.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness it was here!\u201d Amanda said, accepting the phone. She was flushed with pleasure from her moments in the spotlight. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>With the crate packed in the van and on its way to the center, the media finally scattered.</p><p>\u201cShall we go back to the hotel?\u201d Tyler asked Kat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to let that van out of our sight,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Tyler grinned. \u201cNot to worry.\u201d He pulled out his cell, calling Logan. When he ended the call a minute later, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be met by one of our people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to be part of a team, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She smiled wearily. \u201cI am so ready for a hot shower!\u201d</p><p>They returned to the hotel and split up, agreeing to meet in thirty minutes. Kat was greeted by Bastet at the door to her room and stopped to give her some attention. \u201cI wish you could speak,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you knew it wasn\u2019t a mummy coming after your master!\u201d</p><p>Showered and changed, she met Tyler across the hall in the suite as planned. \u201cHave you spoken with Logan again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the center himself. He said we have a few hours. Amanda won\u2019t let anyone touch the crate until the film crew\u2019s there, which could be two hours. And I\u2019m just here to serve. What do you want to do while we wait?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, removing her cell phone with a flourish. \u201cIn her enthusiasm over the press, Amanda forgot her phone. I took pictures of her recently called numbers and some of the emails she\u2019s received. I\u2019d like to see who she\u2019s been calling and emailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Kat connected her cell to one of the laptops on the table. Then she brought up the photos on Tyler\u2019s screen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to win any photography contests,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey! I was in a hurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the phone numbers. You can work on the emails.\u201d</p><p>They set to work. Kat was disappointed. Amanda had written to her cousin in Phoenix, to a superior on the board at the Preservation Center to assure him that she was following protocol and to someone she\u2019d met at an online dating site, telling him she\u2019d be too busy to see him for the next few months.</p><p>The next email written, however, was intriguing. \u201cListen to this,\u201d she said to Tyler.</p><p>Tyler looked up.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Please be advised,\u2019\u201d Kat read, \u201c\u2018that legal action will be taken with the State of Illinois should either of your companies seek to investigate the Jerry McGuen, find artifacts or in any way hinder the efforts of the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center. We will prosecute any interference to the full extent of the law.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she writing to?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cLandry Salvage and Simonton\u2019s Sea Search,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Tyler nodded grimly. \u201cStrange. She\u2019s still on speaking terms with someone at Landry Salvage\u2014she\u2019s made calls to their switchboard every day for the past two weeks. Guess who else she\u2019d been calling? Austin Miller.\u201d</p><p>Will and Sean went back down to the wreck to adjust the position of the remote camera, trying to make sure it wouldn\u2019t be caught in any debris and that it would focus on the hold. Earl had rigged the mechanism so the divers could see up to the control station on the security boat, while anyone at the desk could view the dive site.</p><p>Will held up a thumb to Earl Candy. Earl grinned and raised a thumb in return. Sean moved to Will, and they both waved at him in approval. Earl seemed pleased with his success; he had all the training and equipment he needed but didn\u2019t customarily film in the depths.</p><p>Before ascending, Sean studied the wreck again. He could look all the way over to the starboard side, since so much of the massive steel hull had been ripped out. Of course, it was astonishing that the ship had gone down in one piece. It appeared to have sunk quickly\u2014with greater speed than the Titanic!\u2014and flooded evenly. If one section of the ship had filled with water first, it was likely that the Jerry McGuen would have broken in two. As it was, she lay with her port side jagged and exposed, at a slight angle, the aft section with the storage holds almost ten feet deeper than the deck and the grand salon.</p><p>Sean tapped him on the arm. Time to surface. The two of them did so, following safety procedures.</p><p>On deck, Alan King was pacing anxiously. \u201cWe need to get back to town. How did I ever become associated with someone like that woman?\u201d He groaned, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Amanda Channel. She\u2019s got ants in her pants. She can\u2019t stand waiting. God, the woman doesn\u2019t have an off switch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a board of directors,\u201d Earl said. \u201cWe could go to them with our complaints.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI have video to show them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Bernie suggested, \u201cwe could take the high road\u2014at least for now.\u201d He explained to Will and Sean. \u201cAmanda just called Alan. The crate\u2019s at the center. They\u2019ve removed the outer tarp, and the wooden box inside seems to have withstood the wreck, the water and the ravages of time. She sounds as if it\u2019s all her doing. Yep, it\u2019s all her doing. Anyway, she knows she can\u2019t go any further without us, but she\u2019s threatening to do exactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone in the Krewe must be there,\u201d Sean said, frowning.</p><p>Bernie nodded. \u201cOh, yeah. Your man Logan, and he\u2019s keeping her down. But we need to head back immediately.\u201d</p><p>Will and Sean looked at each other. He wasn\u2019t sure how they were getting back, because the security boat had just been rigged to maintain the remote camera.</p><p>\u201cWe have help coming,\u201d Bernie told them. \u201cCaptain Bob and Jimmy should be here in about five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at the computer, see how our remote\u2019s doing,\u201d Will said.</p><p>The brawny young security guard on duty gladly relinquished his chair at the computer to Will. \u201cBoring, really,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. We know our jobs.\u201d</p><p>Will sent him to take a break, to the guard\u2019s evident relief.</p><p>Once the guy had left, Will studied the footage and understood what he meant\u2014the camera was focused solely on the hold. Then, unexpectedly, something in the corner of the screen caught his attention. He could just see the grand salon and, for a moment, it seemed that ghostly images danced by him. He blinked; they were still there. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was seeing with his eyes and what with his mind, but he saw the water in a horrible maelstrom. There were women in beautiful long dresses and men in tuxedos and suits, scrambling, fighting the roiling rush of the water, spinning and turning....</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>Will almost jumped. He\u2019d been so intent he hadn\u2019t heard Sean behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I had an image of the ship wrecking. I wish we could learn more about what happened that night. As far as I know, there wasn\u2019t even a Mayday sent out. The Jerry McGuen had reported her estimated time of arrival the next day\u2014and then she was never heard from again. That\u2019s the way I understand it, anyway. I\u2019ve got to do more reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went through all the files, too,\u201d Sean said, \u201cand that\u2019s my understanding, as well. Nothing. She was coming in and then she disappeared. A terrible storm had struck, with blinding snow and sleet. Search parties went out as soon as possible, but nothing was found. Not so much as a floating deck chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have gone down really fast\u2014as if a plug was pulled on her,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cHalf the port side is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d almost think she was rammed by something like an icebreaker,\u201d Will mused.</p><p>\u201cSay there was an icebreaker out on the lake... Wouldn\u2019t they have tried to save any survivors or at the very least reported what happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019d hope so,\u201d he said.</p><p>Earl took a step into the cabin. \u201cTransport is here,\u201d he told them.</p><p>Will had no idea how Captain Bob and Jimmy managed to stay calm while working with Amanda, but they were pleasant and ready to move with their usual speed and competence when they picked up the film crew, plus Sean and Will. Two of Alan King\u2019s security guys remained on the control boat, including the young man who\u2019d resumed watching the screen.</p> <p>Will stood with Captain Bob as he took the helm.</p><p>\u201cPress has gone wild.\u201d Bob rolled his eyes. \u201cThe dock was a zoo when we came back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019ll be frenzy for a while. This is pretty momentous. Finding a ship in one of the Great Lakes would be enough, but the Jerry McGuen held a mummy,\u201d Will said. \u201cI assume the crate made it safely off the dock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make sure things like that happen, you know. This is our living,\u201d Captain Bob said with a grin. \u201cAnd your friend, Mr. King, pays very nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Will said, grinning back.</p> <p>Thirty minutes later, he and Sean were dropped off at the hotel. Will\u2019s cell rang as they left the elevator\u2014Kat, saying that she and Tyler had just reached the center, and Amanda and her team were waiting for the documentary crew to arrive. Kat spoke quietly, and he knew she didn\u2019t intend to be overheard.</p><p>\u201cWill, I got some interesting information off Amanda\u2019s cell phone. Tyler and I have been checking out her recent communications. She sent a threatening email to both of the major salvage companies who had contact with the Sand Diggers. But she also called Landry Salvage\u2014every day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she speaking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe switchboard. We can\u2019t track calls to specific extensions, only to the main number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something...fishy about that woman,\u201d Will said drily. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to look into it. Does Logan have a report on anyone who might have a diving motor device?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth Landry and Simonton have one. He found a few others that were privately owned, but he\u2019s already gotten alibis on those. Oh, and a few companies up in Wisconsin have them, but from what he can discover, they can\u2019t be connected to what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, thanks. Sean and I will be there in about thirty minutes. Don\u2019t start the party without us.\u201d</p><p>The crate was going to be opened in a climate-controlled clean room and everyone present had to be suited up\u2014face masks, booties, hair in a gauze cap.</p><p>The area was kept cool to avoid degradation that might set in with any kind of heat. Even a speck of dust could harm certain instruments or damage artifacts that had been underwater for years. They wore masks to avoid contaminating the objects...and to protect themselves from any ancient bacteria or microorganisms that might have survived.</p><p>There were sterile stainless-steel tables to receive the treasures in the crates, but everything, including the crowbars, had been sterilized first. Earl\u2019s camera and the microphone and boom had to be cleaned and covered, as well. If she wasn\u2019t consumed by the fact that they were looking for a murderer, Kat would have found the whole procedure fascinating.</p><p>She was already gowned and masked when Will and Sean showed up, but Will came right over to her. She raised a brow and he grinned behind his mask. \u201cAt last\u2014all shall be revealed.\u201d And although she couldn\u2019t forget the murders for a second, Kat suddenly felt excited.</p><p>Despite all the precautions and the machinery, pure brawn was needed at times. Will, Sean and Tyler were called upon to help as the giant crate was dismantled. There was layer after layer of packaging, which was in itself a historic find. Canvas and wood chips had been used for waterproofing inside the crate and under the tarp; another box was beneath those, and it took well over an hour to get through the packing to the real treasure. But then they reached it.</p><p>The outer sarcophagus was the size of a coffin and a half. It had been carved out of granite and was staggeringly heavy. Even with the use of robotic arms, winches and small cranes, it took real effort by all the men to maneuver it.</p><p>Jon Hunt was as much in awe as Amanda, remarking on the preservation of the sarcophagus, the beauty, the design.</p> <p>Extremely carefully, the seals were broken, and the lid was finally removed.</p><p>Beneath it lay another sarcophagus.</p><p>Earl moved the camera close, and Bernie wielded the microphone while Amanda explained the intricate designs and what they signified. Amun Mopat had seen himself as perhaps greater than the pharaoh he\u2019d served, and that pharaoh had been one of the most powerful ever to rule. She spoke briefly about the New Kingdom and the glorious reign of those pharaohs and their priests. Toward the end of her talk, she pointed to hieroglyphics on the coffin depicting creatures who\u2019d had so much significance in Egyptian life, such as the cobra, the jackal and the cat.</p><p>Then it was time to open the inner sarcophagus. There was silence when the lid was lifted.</p><p>Kat almost gasped aloud.</p><p>Amun Mopat wore a gold and bejeweled death mask, which depicted him in the prime of life.</p><p>His face, on the mask, was the face she\u2019d seen in her dreams.</p><p>Will knew that he and every member of the Krewe tried not to stare at Kat.</p><p>But, of course, they\u2019d all seen the picture Jane had drawn from Kat\u2019s description, and now...there he lay.</p><p>In death.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t move; she barely blinked. She didn\u2019t give away a thing in front of the others. Will was impressed by her lack of reaction. Eyes were the most telling feature on the human face, and her eyes were all that was truly visible.</p><p>Amanda noticed nothing at all wrong. She marveled at the discovery for the camera and the microphone and went on to say how they wouldn\u2019t disturb the mummy further until it had been CAT scanned, X-rayed and all the noninvasive work possible was done. At the end, she preened for the camera, Earl Candy shot the mummy from all angles and Amanda announced that they were done for the day.</p><p>But when Earl turned off the camera, she was still staring at the mummy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon asked her.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t lifted the mask,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut...I thought the scepter would have been in the sarcophagus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda, are you ever happy?\u201d Jon burst out. \u201cWe\u2019ve found the mummy. The mummy, Amanda. And it\u2019s in excellent shape, and all the outer trappings are just about perfect. I\u2019m going out for a drink to celebrate. Who\u2019s coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d Earl exclaimed. \u201cI am so in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of these bunny suits and take a little time to relax,\u201d Bernie agreed. He appeared to be extremely happy.</p><p>Will glanced at Alan King.</p><p>Alan was more cautious, but he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s late, no one\u2019s eaten since lunch, and I\u2019d say we owe ourselves a celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bottle of fifty-year-old tequila in my office. I bought it off a Mexican. I\u2019m not stealing any treasures!\u201d Jon said. \u201cShots all around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the clean room\u2014and out of the bunny suits!\u201d Amanda said, joining in, if rather belatedly.</p><p>Will stayed close to Kat as they exited first into the alcove, where they removed their \u201cclean\u201d covering, and then into the lobby. Jon Hunt led the way to the conference room and excused himself while he went to get the tequila. One of the interns entered, bearing platters of snacks, and the receptionist hurried in, too. She was looking at her watch, however\u2014anxious to leave for the day. Will had the feeling that momentous discoveries didn\u2019t mean as much to her as the fact that she was already in for massive overtime.</p><p>\u201cI am one of the few who loathe tequila,\u201d Kat whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cJust raise the glass!\u201d he told her.</p><p>Soon, they were assembled and the shots passed around. Earl balanced his while he held the camera; he wanted the celebration on film.</p><p>\u201cTo Brady Laurie and his vision. May he rest in the heaven of his choice! Brady, we are so grateful to you. Wherever these treasures may go, your name will be held in high esteem,\u201d Alan said.</p><p>\u201cTo Brady!\u201d the others chorused.</p><p>For a while, the group remained seated around the table, chatting. Will asked Jon Hunt about the security they had for the center.</p><p>\u201cWe have a state-of-the-art alarm system,\u201d Jon said. \u201cAnd a guard on duty at the reception desk through the night.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped over to join them. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a team from the Chicago office of the FBI watching the building tonight, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Chicago police are aware of the discovery\u2014and the risk of fortune-seekers breaking in.\u201d He looked at Jon. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s time to get it all locked down for the night.\u201d</p><p>Everyone seemed to agree. The visitors were ushered out, waiting in front while the center employees closed the offices. Will met with the guard who came in for his shift. The man tried to seem assured, but he obviously hadn\u2019t expected to be guarding a place that might be under siege.</p><p>As they stood on the lawn in front of the center, Will stepped over to Logan. \u201cShould one of us stay here through the night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Logan sighed. \u201cNot you or Kat. She\u2019s the key on this, and you\u2019ve been working with her. You two need the rest. Like I said, we\u2019ve got a couple of local agents who are going to be watching, but I\u2019ll have Tyler and Jane on lookout for a while. Kelsey and I will hold it down while they get some dinner, and then they can take over. I believe there\u2019s a break in the diving tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cAmanda wants to play with her new toy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Logan drew closer. \u201cKat\u2019s vision was of Amun Mopat himself.\u201d He spoke in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t believe the ancient ghost of a priest caused a ship to sink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think the storm caused it to sink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Today I studied the way she went down. My guess is she was rammed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunk on purpose?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that might have something to do with what\u2019s happening now?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how or why, but yes.\u201d</p> <p>Logan didn\u2019t argue with him. \u201cWe have to find the connection, but we\u2019re not going to do that tonight. People have to sleep. We\u2019ll meet tomorrow and figure out where we\u2019re going. Get Kat back to the hotel, and both of you...get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Will was glad to do as ordered. Kelsey and Logan stayed out front; he left with Jane, Tyler, Sean and Kat, so that they could all grab something to eat before Tyler and Jane started their nighttime stakeout.</p><p>They returned to the hotel, having grown accustomed to the restaurant there. Not only was it a comfortable place, the other diners had already finished due to the lateness of the hour, so the group could speak freely. But as they sat down, Will found himself remembering that it was only a few days ago that someone\u2014someone in the hotel\u2014had been prowling around their floor.</p><p>Leaving authentic mummy wrappings smudged on the wall.</p><p>He made a mental note to ask Logan if the guest roster had been thoroughly checked out for the night in question. One thing was certain; their visitor had not left the hotel after being on their floor that particular night.</p> <p>\u201cSteak!\u201d Jane said. \u201cA steak. I\u2019m starving. And Chicago is known for its steak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cItalian food, too,\u201d Tyler reminded her.</p><p>Kat had been quiet. Jane placed a hand over hers and Kat started, looking at her friend. \u201cKat, I\u2019m not surprised that the image you\u2019ve seen is that of Amun Mopat. When I was researching today, I came across similar images. But, according to what I read, the priest wasn\u2019t popular with one of Ramses\u2019s descendants, the boy king, Tutankhamun. During that era, his images and statues were all broken or marred. But, of course, his image does remain in places where those who came after him didn\u2019t know who he was. You must have seen it somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIcebreaker,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cIcebreaker?\u201d Tyler glanced at him. \u201cYou want a drink?\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed. \u201cNo. Will thinks that an icebreaker rammed the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Kat said, \u201csomeone didn\u2019t want the Jerry McGuen making it to Chicago,\u201d she said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cInteresting concept.\u201d Will looked at the others thoughtfully. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ve been going at it from what would seem to be the obvious angle\u2014someone out there ready to kill for the treasure. But what if someone is killing others so the treasure won\u2019t be found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who believes in the curse of Amun Mopat,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAfter a hundred-plus years?\u201d Tyler asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cThat brings us back to the Preservation Center itself, the Egyptian Sand Diggers or perhaps one of the two salvage companies.\u201d Jane counted them off on her fingers. \u201cThe connection is what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Will said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the library tomorrow and look at their newspaper archives for 1898,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cWe can find out who was in business with icebreakers at the time, too,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be important,\u201d Will said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cHow does an icebreaker fit with my...vision of a giant Amun Mopat coming to swallow up the Jerry McGuen?\u201d Kat mused aloud.</p><p>Will noted that Tyler squeezed her hand. They were good friends; they\u2019d known each other a long time.</p><p>He envied Tyler.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Will said again.</p><p>Kat was silent for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019re all quite accustomed to the fact that souls can stay around. We try to make contact. There are rare occasions when the dead saw what happened, when they can help an investigator uncover clues that can prove the truth. So...would it be so ridiculous for Amun Mopat to be...somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, what? His soul\u2019s been haunting the lake for all these years? And before that, his soul was haunting...his own tomb?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Kat shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I do know that I saw his face\u2014or the mask of his face\u2014before we saw him.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere was something odd about the face. It had no animation. Now I know that\u2019s because it was a death mask.\u201d She smiled ruefully at Will. \u201cUsually, when we meet a ghost, even a new ghost, there\u2019s an animation about him or her. Austin Miller, for instance\u2014I could see him just as he must have been before he died. But he was animated. He was like he\u2019d been when he was...alive.\u201d</p><p>They finished their meals, Kat managing to eat a Greek salad, while Will ate English-style fish and chips.</p><p>Jane, done with her steak, yawned and stretched, then eased her chair back. She tapped Tyler on the shoulder. \u201cWe should go spell Logan and Kelsey. We need to let them get back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBut, come on\u2014we\u2019re taking it until six in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens at six?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>Tyler grinned broadly. \u201cYou come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then, excuse me, I\u2019m going to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right behind you. I\u2019ll just sign for dinner,\u201d Will said.</p><p>The others waved. As Will smiled and made a motion in the air to indicate he needed the bill, he saw that Kat was still frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and managed a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019m just being obsessive. Now I have it in my head that there\u2019s something wrong with the face I see coming to devour the ship.\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm around her. \u201cOne thing Logan is right about\u2014we need some sleep. Maybe it\u2019ll all seem clearer in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>And going to the room with her was so natural, so easy. Kat had to be exhausted; he was, too. His muscles were sore from all the diving he\u2019d done and from straining as he hauled the crate.</p><p>But when they entered his room together and the door was closed, he suddenly felt a new surge of strength. She turned into his arms, and they were entangled in a long, hot kiss. He pulled back and looked into her eyes. \u201cAnd I thought you\u2019d be tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worked harder than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hurting all over, but now...\u201d</p><p>They lunged toward each other again, and their clothing began to fly around the room. As his shirt landed on the bed, they were startled by a plaintive meow. They paused, staring at each other, and then laughing. Will walked over to the bed and lifted the shirt.</p><p>A very indignant Bastet lay beneath it.</p><p>\u201cAh, poor kitty!\u201d Kat laughed again as she stroked the sleek head. \u201cShe\u2019s got food?\u201d</p><p>Will checked on the bowls. \u201cThe cat is fine. Water and plenty of food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, Bastet, I promise you more attention in the morning. For now...well, it looks like you have your own room for the night.\u201d She turned away from the cat and leaped into Will\u2019s arms. \u201cActually, it\u2019s not a good use of government money,\u201d she said, \u201ca cat having a room of her own.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Kat and kissed her, then carried her through the connecting door, still kissing her. They\u2019d scattered their clothing throughout the two rooms by the time they reached the bed, and they were breathless when they fell on top of it. The thrill of being together was so new. He was in awe of the delicate, pale beauty of her skin and the blond silk of her hair as it fell over the bronze of his chest and arms. Whatever was happening between them was something he\u2019d remember all his life. They had a bond, he knew, that was deep and real and unforgettable. But where it would take them he didn\u2019t know. Still, he wondered if any children they had would be dark or light, or light with his dark eyes and her sunlit hair or...</p><p>He stopped wondering as her kisses ran down his chest and below, and all he could think of was the desire burning fiercely through every part of him. He brought her close, found her lips again, rolled with her on the expanse of the bed\u2014and then paused, despite the urgency of his passion. His fingers curled over hers as she gazed into his eyes. She smiled at him, and he trembled. He lowered himself, thrusting into her, and in minutes they were so entwined they were nearly one.</p><p>Climax came with a shattering impact and they lay together in silence. She nestled against him, and his fingers brushed the curve of her hips. They didn\u2019t speak. It was so easy to be together and\u2014even better\u2014it was easy to wake together. He turned to her, and he saw that while he was feeling the sizzle inside once again, her lashes were closed. Her breathing was even.</p><p>She was sound asleep.</p><p>He smiled, lay back and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>There was nothing as sweet as the comfort of deep sleep.</p><p>Kat drifted in that sphere for hours. When she dreamed, it wasn\u2019t of the current time or place. She felt safe and secure, and she thought she was at home. She\u2019d had wonderful caring parents who had worked hard. Her father, naturalized when he was ten, hadn\u2019t forgotten his own family, and as aunts and other relatives came over from Russia and Soviet Bloc countries, they were made welcome in their home.</p><p>While her dad had quickly become a chef to help support the family, her uncle Nick had gone through medical school, and he was the one to open the world of medicine to her. When she was young, he and others were often at the house. She\u2019d loved it; the kitchen would smell delightfully of pastry baking, and when she came home from school, she\u2019d curl up on the couch and watch television, listening to them in the kitchen. Her aunt Olga often visited her mom in the afternoons to teach her Russian. Kat would hear them greet each other, and then her aunt would say, \u201cOkay, now. In Russian. Privet!\u201d</p><p>Talk to me. It was an all-around greeting. I pray you. How are you doing? What would you like?</p><p>Home was a good, safe place to be.</p><p>She missed her parents. Her mom had moved to Florida after her father\u2019s death. Of course, her mom had become part of her dad\u2019s family so sometimes everyone still gathered for reunions in San Antonio, reunions filled with delicious food, with conversations and laughter and love and so much warmth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But all at once she went from that place of warmth and safety to another, somewhere else. It was as if she\u2019d suddenly been drawn to the television screen, and then into it.</p><p>She was part of The Mummy\u2014now in living color.</p><p>It really didn\u2019t frighten her at first. It was so silly! The mummy moved slowly\u2014all anyone had to do was outrun it!</p> <p>She\u2019d often thought so. Only silly girls screamed, did nothing and fell down while staring at the mummy and walking backward.</p><p>But now, she wasn\u2019t in a movie anymore, and it wasn\u2019t a movie mummy lurching awkwardly toward her. Instead, there were dozens of mummies, and when she turned to run, there were more of them, behind her and on either side.</p><p>There was nowhere to run.</p><p>She was suddenly fighting them, smashing at them, kicking them, wrenching and tearing. She was an M.E., for God\u2019s sake, and she could make them all fall apart. In the early days of Egyptology, she knew, mummies had been so plentiful they\u2019d been used as fuel for home and cooking fires. She could beat them.</p><p>But they were strong....</p> <p>So many...</p><p>And coming through them, one who wasn\u2019t a mummy, one who seemed to be a living, breathing human.</p><p>Amun Mopat.</p><p>\u201cNot in my name,\u201d he cried out to her. \u201cNot in my name!\u201d he said again. \u201cDon\u2019t they understand? You put something in a man\u2019s mind, and he believes it. But I will have it no more. Not in my name.\u201d</p><p>She stopped because she was so astounded. And then she could feel the things, closing in on her, touching her. She twisted and turned, and saw that Amanda Channel was walking toward her from one direction and Amun Mopat from the other.</p><p>And then, her strange realm was pierced by a loud shrieking.</p> <p>It was Amanda. She was screaming in terror.</p><p>Kat woke with a start.</p><p>At her side, Will instantly woke, as well. Alert to danger, he sat up, reaching automatically into the drawer at the side of the bed, as if he\u2019d forgotten they were in her room. It didn\u2019t matter, though. That was where she kept her service Glock, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. His voice was thick; he\u2019d been sleeping soundly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDid you hear a scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She jumped out of bed, racing around to find fresh clothing.</p><p>\u201cKat?\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed panties and a pair of jeans from her drawer. \u201cWill, come on! We have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Preservation Center. Something\u2019s happening there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, it\u2019s not even six. Tyler and Jane are in a car, watching the place. There are two other agents and the cops are going by constantly. Are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure? Yes, positive. Will, something is happening there. Please come with me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask again. He was out of bed, hurrying to his own room to dress and retrieve his weapon.</p><p>There was very little traffic. They parked directly in front of the center in a no-parking zone, but Will didn\u2019t care and neither did she. Tyler got out of his rental as she ran toward him.</p><p>\u201cKat! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anything? Has Amanda come back here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing. Those are the other feds right over there and the police have been around every fifteen minutes, like clockwork,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Jane, looking slightly disheveled from sitting up in the car all night, was beside them a moment later.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that guard to let us in,\u201d Kat said urgently.</p><p>She led the way, almost running as they all followed her.</p><p>At the door, she paused. Beyond the plate-glass doors, she could see the guard.</p><p>He lay on the floor in a pool of blood, his gun in his outstretched hand.</p><p>11</p><p>The center\u2019s glass front doors were still bolted shut.</p><p>Although the guard, lying by the shadow of the reception desk, appeared to be dead, they couldn\u2019t wait. If there was a chance he was alive, they had to get in.</p><p>Will tried ramming his shoulder against the door to smash it, joined by Tyler, but the heavy safety glass didn\u2019t break. \u201cStand back,\u201d Will said. He raised his Glock and shot out the glass. He noted in the back of his mind that the center\u2019s alarm didn\u2019t go off. He heard the sound of glass shattering and emergency sirens approaching the center, which meant someone had called 9-1-1.</p><p>He wrapped his hand in his jacket and reached in, undoing the bolts. They were inside the center in a matter of seconds. Kat immediately went to the man on the floor, feeling for a pulse. She looked up. \u201cHe\u2019s got a pulse\u2014it\u2019s faint, but he\u2019s got a pulse!\u201d</p><p>Will hunkered down by her side. \u201cGunshot wound to the chest,\u201d she said. \u201cMissed the heart...we need an ambulance...like ten minutes ago.\u201d She had taken off her jacket and used it to apply pressure to the wound. She nodded at Tyler, who\u2019d had some paramedic training. He got down on his knees and listened to her quick words of instruction, taking over from her, applying pressure to stop the bleeding while she ripped off the man\u2019s tie and wrenched open buttons. She looked over at Will. \u201cGo\u2014someone is in here. Amanda\u2019s here for some reason...I just know it. Please, Will, go.\u201d</p><p>Will indicated that Jane should take the conference room while he moved toward the climate-controlled area. The two agents who\u2019d watched the center from a distance had entered behind them. The older of the two, a tall, dark-haired man of about forty, nodded at him and then at his partner. The older agent accompanied Will, while the younger man followed Jane.</p><p>Will and the other agent passed the entry and turned to the left. They paused at the first workroom, positioned themselves on either side of the door. The agent counted off three with his fingers and Will kicked it in.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to see that the room was empty, except for a statuette on the work stand in the process of being cleaned.</p><p>They went down the hall and reached the climate-controlled room. Heavy plastic barriers guarded the area where the \u201cbunny\u201d suits were kept; steel racks held boxes of gloves, masks and booties. The plastic barriers could have hidden a person, and the two men held back again, communicating silently. The agent pulled back one of the plastic slats while Will stepped forward, Glock tightly gripped in both hands.</p><p>Will passed through the dressing area and came to the next plastic barrier, just before the entry to the clean room. The other agent was behind him.</p><p>A double sheet of plastic hung in front of the clean room itself. He moved it, looking in, thinking of the care they\u2019d taken that day and aware that he wasn\u2019t at all clean. The preservation of history, however, had to take a backseat to the protection of the living.</p><p>The giant outer sarcophagus lay as they\u2019d left it twelve hours before; the inner sarcophagus was on the stand, also exactly as they\u2019d left it.</p><p>There was nothing else in the room other than the steel racks of sterile equipment and the two giant sarcophagi.</p><p>Will stepped carefully forward to look in both. The first was empty.</p><p>He went to the second, where the death mask lay over the mummy of Amun Mopat.</p><p>And that was where he found her.</p><p>Dr. Amanda Channel\u2014wedged next to the fragile mummy, eyes closed, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>The paramedics arrived in less than three minutes.</p><p>Still, Kat knew the guard had suffered a great deal of blood loss. Without causing further trauma, the best she could do while waiting was staunch the flow of blood and ease his breathing and that, with Tyler\u2019s help, she\u2019d accomplished. When the emergency techs rushed in, she told them her findings and stepped back. Tyler stood at her side.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, she saw Jane returning from a search of the conference room to the right of the entry. A young FBI man in a suit was with her.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jane shook her head.</p><p>Kat heard the med techs talking to one another, their voices quiet as they assessed the victim and worked on him before transferring him to a portable gurney. Then she saw that Will and a second FBI man were walking toward them.</p><p>Will looked tense.</p><p>\u201cAmanda Channel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead? No pulse, nothing?\u201d Kat asked. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She pushed past him before he could stop her.</p><p>\u201cThe clean room, Kat. And she is dead. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>She believed him; still, she had to check for herself. The guard stood a small chance of surviving, so, even knowing that Will was probably right, she hurried to find Amanda.</p><p>Giving no thought to dust or germs, Kat rushed through the layers of protection to get to the clean room.</p><p>\u201cThe sarcophagus,\u201d Will called from behind her.</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt, staring in shock at Amanda tucked into the sarcophagus with her beloved mummy. The woman had been as slim as a reed, which was the only reason she fit. She was wedged beside the preserved remains of the long-dead priest. No ancient linen wrap covered her, but her arms were crossed in the typical fashion of ancient Egyptian burial. Kat took a shaky breath and ran over to check for a pulse or a sign of breath. She felt Amanda\u2019s cooling flesh and knew, before using any instruments, that the woman was far beyond medical help.</p><p>Will came to stand by her side. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cCore body temperature drops at an estimated rate of 0.8K every hour from the time of death,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there are variables, this room being one of them. A number of factors can be part of determining the exact time\u2014humidity levels, air movement and, in Amanda\u2019s case, the fact that there are very few fat cells in her body. Rigor mortis has just started to set in, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRigor mortis can set in soon after death, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. In half an hour or less. We\u2019ll know more at the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell how she died?\u201d he asked.</p><p>There were no visible signs of trauma on the body. Kat examined her eyes for petechial hemorrhage, then shook her head. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t strangled. I\u2019m assuming it has to be from some kind of toxin in the body. I\u2019m not seeing any blood or signs of outer damage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, the guard shot himself and Amanda crawled into a sarcophagus to die?\u201d Will asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to look like,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Will moved away from her, speaking into his cell. Cops and emergency medical personnel had arrived in numbers now. They stood outside and she heard him directing officers to guard the perimeter but to let the crime scene detectives in to do their work. She remained by the corpse, staring at Amanda. Had the woman been part of what was going on? Or had she and Will misjudged her entirely?</p> <p>She stood in the clean room, wishing that Amanda or Amun Mopat would appear in the mist around her. Or that she could look down and imagine Amanda\u2019s eyes opening, and that she\u2019d hear what her soul was saying that her lips could not.</p><p>She was in a clean room, now compromised by dust motes and germs. The environment around here still seemed pristine, but she knew it wasn\u2019t. The noise rose as conversations sifted through to her, as she heard footsteps and the sounds of the investigation beginning.</p><p>She waited, feeling a little numb, until the crew from the morgue showed up. She was glad to see that Cranston Randall was there to represent the coroner\u2019s office. He stood by her side for a moment, gazing down at Amanda and then turning to Kat.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe curse. Those who disturb the dead and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who practice a \u2018curse\u2019 are living,\u201d Kat responded.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe papers will have a heyday, however. I can assure you of that. So, Dr. Channel is lying here dead, but the guard might survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took him to emergency. I believe his vital organs were missed. I didn\u2019t stop to look for the shell, although I\u2019m almost certain the bullet went all the way through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pray the young man makes it,\u201d Dr. Randall said. He beckoned to someone, and she saw that police and forensic photographers were waiting to do their work.</p><p>Randall smiled grimly at her. \u201cSo, will you accompany me to the morgue?\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded, glancing around. Will and Logan were talking to the Chicago homicide detective who\u2019d come in with the crime scene crew. She stood back, still feeling that oddly numb sensation while work went on around her. At some point, Jon Hunt was called in; she could hear him crying hysterically\u2014in both grief and terror. He kept wailing Amanda\u2019s name and talking about his own fear that he\u2019d be the next to go.</p><p>It was hours before she and Randall were ready to leave. And when they did, Chicago had woken up. Traffic clogged the streets, horns blared and people were on their way to work.</p> <p>As they drove along Lake Michigan, Kat contemplated the beauty of the sunlight on the water. Early sailboats caught the breeze, and it looked as if they were dancing across a horizon studded with diamonds.</p><p>But she knew how treacherous the water could be....</p><p>Will had been the first person on the case, so he wasn\u2019t surprised when Logan asked if he\u2019d act as their spokesman and speak with the press. It was now almost two in the afternoon.</p><p>Standing before the mob that thronged in front of the Preservation Center, he gave a brief overview of what they\u2019d discovered. Then the questions bombarded him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find the guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it bizarre that it happened the first night the mummy was at the center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the \u2018curse\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is dead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone hear the shot?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand; he didn\u2019t say a word but waited, and in time, his silence brought them all to silence, too.</p><p>\u201cA curse did not shoot a man,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cWe\u2019re praying first and foremost that the guard survives. Perhaps when he\u2019s conscious, he\u2019ll be able to help us. At this stage, we don\u2019t know the cause of death in the case of Dr. Amanda Channel. As to the curse? Once again let me say that not one of us believes that a curse kills. People kill. Whoever has perpetrated this heinous crime is flesh and blood and after something\u2014and that murderer will be found. We\u2019re following up various leads in the city now, and we\u2019ll report more as soon as we have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill salvage on the Jerry McGuen continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shipwreck and it\u2019s now been discovered. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll lie there without further effort being made to retrieve the treasures and eventually provide divers with another tourist location,\u201d he added drily.</p><p>\u201cEveryone will want to dive it now!\u201d one reporter mumbled. \u201cPeople are such ghouls!\u201d</p><p>He was probably right. Will went on to field more questions, being very careful and circumspect in his answers. They had information, and they had clues that suggested certain avenues of research, but at the moment, they weren\u2019t prepared to point a finger in any one direction.</p><p>He was glad when it was over. He\u2019d spent much of the past few days and nights diving and investigating, but the press conference was the most exhausting thing he\u2019d done. The early-morning hours had passed quickly at the Preservation Center. Then they\u2019d gathered what they could find before the forensics team began their work\u2014and now the press conference.</p><p>Afterward, he was able to meet with the Texas Krewe at the police station. Logan was busy writing on another one of those white boards he was so fond of, listing what had been discovered by the forensics team.</p><p>The guard, Abel Leary, had survived surgery, but was still unconscious. Jane was maintaining a vigil at the hospital should he awaken. The shot wouldn\u2019t have been heard by any of the police who happened to be driving by for two reasons: the small caliber of the bullet and the fact that it had been fired directly against the guard\u2019s body. Thus far, fingerprints in the reception area had led them to no one but employees and board members. The alarm had been disconnected, possibly by Amanda herself when she\u2019d returned to the center. She hadn\u2019t been seen entering because she\u2019d used a back entrance that had supposedly been sealed off long ago.</p><p>Logan was irritated; he\u2019d asked about other entrances and Amanda had told him there were none, that the only other one had been closed off maybe fifty years before. Jon Hunt had reported, in his hysteria, that it wasn\u2019t considered an \u201centrance\u201d at all anymore. To the best of his knowledge, it had been sealed.</p><p>But Amanda had lied to them about its being sealed, probably because she knew it was still a viable entry. Jon couldn\u2019t tell them why Amanda had sneaked inside in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we know,\u201d Logan said. \u201cAt some point during the night Amanda Channel went back into the Preservation Center through a delivery door in the back\u2014a door that hadn\u2019t been used in years. Evidently she\u2019d found a way to open it. She turned off the alarm system to get in and someone must have followed her, although I think it\u2019s supposed to look as if the guard shot himself and Amanda crawled into the sarcophagus to die, unlikely as all of that sounds. Whether the guard\u2019s shooting is meant to resemble an accident, we can only speculate. I spoke very briefly with Kat before she and Dr. Randall accompanied the body to the morgue. They both figure it\u2019s some kind of poisoning because there\u2019s no outward sign of trauma. Whoever entered the museum did so through the same hidden entry as Amanda, since no one was seen anywhere near the front entrance and police were patrolling every fifteen minutes. Plus we had our agents watching the front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to know about the rear delivery entrance,\u201d Will said. He stood up to join Logan, who handed him the marker. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone with the ability to dive, who\u2019s familiar with the lake and has an interest in the treasure\u2014or in the Jerry McGuen itself. This person knew Austin Miller, his house and his habits very well, just as he was familiar with the Preservation Center. It seems to me that as far as suspects go, we\u2019ve always felt we needed to investigate Landry Salvage and Simonton\u2019s Sea Search. We know that Amanda was communicating with someone at Landry, and we know that both of those companies have access to motorized diving devices. We\u2019re certain that someone other than the center\u2019s people, the film crew and our own team members have been out to the site. While the local police might have initially doubted conspiracy or murder when they had a drowning victim and an elderly man dead of a heart attack, the city\u2019s law enforcement is now fully involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can investigate the preservation company\u2019s computers,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have any difficulty getting access now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sean, that\u2019s perfect,\u201d Logan said. \u201cJane will wait at the hospital. Kat\u2019s at the morgue, but I expect she\u2019ll be ready to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up,\u201d Will said. \u201cI think we should pay the Egyptian Sand Diggers a visit. I\u2019d also like to stop by both salvage companies again with what we know. And, after that, we should try to find out more about the Jerry McGuen, perhaps at Austin Miller\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey said, \u201cI\u2019ll go over to the library and keep going with the research on Lake Michigan shipping, travel and icebreakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library is going to close in a couple of hours,\u201d Logan noted. \u201cI\u2019ll make arrangements for you to have extra time there this evening,\u201d he said, \u201cif you feel you need it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe research on Chicago and the lake at the turn of the twentieth century is monumental. Tyler, you want in with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019ll handle communications here and work with the local authorities. Everyone\u2014\u201d he began, but his team finished his sentence en masse.</p><p>\u201cReport anything, even if you think it\u2019s minor!\u201d they chorused.</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s it,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSo...get going!\u201d</p><p>Like Brady Laurie, Amanda Channel had been in excellent physical condition\u2014until she died. Her autopsy was duly carried out, and when it was complete and they were stripping out of their gowns and washing up, Dr. Randall said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait for the toxicology reports. She reacted to something, and I know they\u2019ll find it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat thanked him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected Amanda to speak to her in the middle of a Y incision, and Amanda hadn\u2019t. Dr. Randall\u2019s diener was sewing up the incision. Amanda might speak to her in the days to come, but Kat didn\u2019t expect it.</p><p>She was worn-out when she left the morgue, and stunned to see that dusk was falling.</p> <p>Before she left the building, she called Will, who said he\u2019d come and get her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll just grab a cab,\u201d she told him. \u201cThere are dozens on the street. I think we should head straight over to see what\u2019s going on with the Egyptian Sand Diggers tonight.\u201d</p><p>Will agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I had in mind, too. Today\u2019s events must be really traumatic for them. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a gathering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come\u2014\u201d Will said.</p> <p>\u201cWill, I\u2019m staring at three cabs!\u201d She hung up before he could protest; she didn\u2019t want to waste time.</p><p>Still, she paused before walking out to the street.</p><p>The city was moving into nightfall, which brought a beauty of its own. There were lights on in abundance, and the place seemed to sparkle. From somewhere she could hear jazz music, and people meandered along the streets, laughing and chatting.</p><p>Kat looked back at the morgue, then hailed a cab, anxious to get on her way.</p><p>She gave the driver the address for the Egyptian Sand Diggers. As they moved through the traffic, she gazed out at the city in its evening finery.</p><p>Once she\u2019d arrived and paid the cabdriver, she glanced around for Will\u2019s rented Honda. She didn\u2019t see it.</p> <p>She stared up at the exquisite\u2014and exquisitely maintained\u2014Colonial Greek manor. While she waited for Will, she decided to walk around the building.</p><p>Kat could hear the low murmur of voices coming from the parlor. Slipping around the side of the house, she saw that there was a summer room in back and that, for modern Chicago, the yard was large. She immediately noticed a small entrance guarded by two sphinxes\u2014an entrance leading into some kind of maze. A sign in English and hieroglyphics warned Enter If You Dare!</p><p>A rustle in the trees startled her and she turned quickly. She wasn\u2019t afraid of the living, not while she was armed and alert. Her service Glock was in the holster beneath her jacket, and she could draw it in a second.</p><p>However, she couldn\u2019t see anyone. She didn\u2019t really want to announce herself, since she was wandering around private property, uninvited and unaccompanied.</p><p>She was definitely intrigued by the maze, but with darkness descending, taking a stroll there wouldn\u2019t be wise.</p><p>Hearing a car door, she walked around to the front. Will had arrived, and she hurried forward to meet him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said, greeting her with a hug. There was tension in his muscles; she lowered her head, smiling, because she knew he worried about her when they were apart. It was natural. She did the same thing.</p><p>Kat liked the way he treated her, concerned but with respect, and always deferring to her now when he knew that her knowledge of a particular subject was greater than his.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd Amanda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to wait for the tox reports.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a maze in back,\u201d she told him. \u201cVery cute. High bushes, Egyptian sculptures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out in the back alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just took a look. It\u2019s private property and I\u2019m well aware that we need imminent danger or a search warrant to prowl.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, offering her a half smile. \u201cYou were prowling around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not a lot. I was admiring the landscaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t stand up in court. Anyway, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Side by side, they climbed the steps and Will rang the bell. Nothing happened. They knew there were people inside, so he banged on the door. When nothing happened then, either, he tried the handle. The door was unlocked.</p><p>They entered the grand old mansion off Michigan Avenue.</p><p>The hallway itself was empty. Will shrugged and they moved toward the parlor. A few members, two men and a woman, were sitting there, deep in discussion. They were all clad in loose white robes, as if they were acolytes getting ready for a religious ceremony.</p><p>The discussion stopped as soon as they noticed Kat and Will.</p><p>The woman rose. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked coolly.</p><p>Kat introduced herself and Will by their names only\u2014not mentioning the FBI. \u201cWe were hoping we might see Dirk. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. She glanced at the men and forced a smile to her lips. \u201cI\u2019m Samantha Willard, and these are Bill Bartholomew and David Gleeson. Dirk is up in the study. Are you prospective members?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends of Dirk\u2019s,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you upstairs.\u201d Samantha waved at the two men. \u201cBe right back!\u201d</p><p>As they headed for the stairs, Will exchanged a quizzical look with Kat. There had to be a number of people in the mansion at the moment; they could hear voices coming from the kitchen and dining areas, as well as the parlor.</p><p>At the upstairs landing, Samantha led them to the first door on the left. She tapped on it lightly, and Dirk Manning called, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He was sitting by the fireplace, also clad in one of the white robes, reading from a journal. He looked sad and drawn, but if he was surprised or dismayed to see them, he didn\u2019t reveal it. He rose, smiling. \u201cWelcome. Welcome back. Sorrowful times, I\u2019m afraid, but of course that\u2019s why you\u2019re here. Can you tell me what happened? Amanda Channel killed herself and a guard shot himself? Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of it, not for a minute, and that\u2019s not what I said at the press conference,\u201d Will told him.</p><p>Dirk Manning studied him for a minute and then smiled. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what you said. Some of the stations actually showed you talking. Most of them only used a few words of what you said and added their own commentary. So...someone is killing off anyone connected to Amun Mopat\u2019s treasure and the salvage of the Jerry McGuen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a mess, Mr. Manning,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou threw a party to get people interested. Brady Laurie was the most excited because he believed he had the answer\u2014which he did. But Brady\u2019s dead, and so is Amanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she die of?\u201d Manning asked her.</p><p>\u201cWe think it was some type of poison,\u201d Kat said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know what. There was nothing obvious, but I\u2019m positive that with the tests we\u2019ve ordered, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrady Laurie was drowned, Austin Miller was sent into heart failure, a guard\u2019s been shot. And now Amanda is dead, apparently by poisoning,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there is a curse.\u201d Manning sank back into his chair before the fire. \u201cMaybe there really is a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe the curse is greed,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>Manning shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of greed would cause someone to kill like that? Maybe, when it was just Brady, it could have been greed. Someone who wanted to get the treasures for him- or herself. But the location of the ship is now well-known. However, Amanda died at the Preservation Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we need your help.\u201d Will sat in one of the chairs by the fire, facing the old man. \u201cFor starters,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Manning raised his hand absently. \u201cA farewell to our dear friend Austin Miller. A ceremony to say goodbye. The morgue has told us that they don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll release his body. These people, all of us, loved him. We will give him an Egyptian ceremony that is intended for the comfort of those left behind. We offer up food and gifts at the altar in the center of the maze. Nine of us will speak, each to a certain god of the ancient world, asking for Austin\u2019s speedy flight to the heavens above. It\u2019s a memorial,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Mr. Manning. That\u2019s fine. Will other people, nonmembers, be here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Manning nodded. \u201cEveryone who was on our invitation list the night we had the party\u2014the night Brady Laurie told us he thought he\u2019d found the location of the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p><p>Will looked over at Kat. \u201cMay we attend, Mr. Manning?\u201d</p><p>Manning was silent for a moment. \u201cYou want to attend our ceremony?\u201d he asked, astonished. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know him,\u201d Kat said, deciding she shouldn\u2019t tell Manning that, in a way, she had met Austin, just not when he was alive. \u201cBut we want justice for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow involved do you want to be?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs involved as you\u2019ll let us be,\u201d Will replied.</p><p>Manning shook his head again, a look of confusion in his eyes. \u201cI...I can\u2019t believe we might have brought this about, that I might be responsible for the death of my best friend. For all these deaths... Is it possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Kat said firmly. \u201cYou are not responsible for the depravity of another person, Mr. Manning, not at all. But we\u2019re pretty certain that someone who\u2019s been here is responsible for these deaths.\u201d</p><p>Manning straightened his shoulders. \u201cYou seem to think I\u2019m acquainted with a killer. But I will not help one! Yes, you must stay and be involved, if you believe I can assist you any way\u2014or if you think you might get a shred of information from being here. Absolutely!\u201d He stood. \u201cCome along,\u201d he commanded. \u201cIt\u2019s time to prepare.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the Egyptian Sand Diggers\u2019 clubhouse mansion was filling up.</p><p>Will was impressed by the number of Egyptologists, scholars and old friends who arrived for the special tribute to Austin Miller.</p><p>He was equally impressed that he and Kat were dressed and ready for the evening. They, too, were clad in long white robes; they had brass torches to resemble the wooden ones that would have been used during the time of the New Kingdom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat was to read a passage as Mut, or Maut. The Egyptian word for mother had come from her name, and she was the daughter of the sun god, Ra\u2014the all-seeing, vengeful eye of Ra. Kat had been given the Mut headdress, which was that of a vulture, one of the forms in which Mut could sometimes be seen.</p><p>\u201cCool, huh?\u201d she whispered to Will, holding a glass of wine as they stood casually in the dining area, meeting others as they came in.</p><p>\u201cI think Mut is also sometimes depicted as a cow,\u201d he told her, grinning.</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not reading as a schizophrenic god,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>He was reading a passage for Aker, an ancient earth god honored in the New Kingdom and often depicted as two lions facing away from each other. Aker was the god of the horizon\u2014day to night, and night to day.</p><p>Kat\u2019s phone rang. She glanced at Will, fumbled through the robe to find the phone in her pocket and started to answer it.</p><p>Samantha walked by, frowning. \u201cNo cell phones once the ceremony starts!\u201d she chastised.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kat murmured.</p> <p>She turned away from the crowd and spoke so softly that not even Will could hear. When she turned back, she touched his cheek, as if in a gesture of affection. Of course, he hoped it was real, but she was gesturing for him to bend down.</p><p>\u201cSaxitoxin,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaxitoxin,\u201d she said a little louder. \u201cIt\u2019s a toxin from shellfish. Amanda must have had an allergy\u2014and someone must have known it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what killed her?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut...how did she get in the sarcophagus with Amun Mopat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He looked away, and took a sip from his glass of \u201cceremonial\u201d wine. He set the wineglass down and, to Kat\u2019s surprise, took hers, as well.</p> <p>He raised a brow and saw the comprehension in her eyes.</p><p>Nothing to eat or drink here!</p><p>Hearing someone greet a new visitor, Will stepped into the parlor and saw Andy Simonton. He was alone, but he seemed to know most of the people there.</p><p>Samantha walked toward him. Her stride had changed; it was suddenly sultry, her hips swaying beneath the robe. \u201cAndy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, so glad you could make it,\u201d she gushed.</p><p>Andy shrugged. \u201cHey, Austin was a good guy. If this is how he\u2019d want us to say goodbye, so be it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat awful business at the center today\u2014boy, I\u2019m glad I stayed away from that ship. It sure looks like it\u2019s cursed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops claim someone else had to have been in there\u2014at least that\u2019s what I saw on the news,\u201d Sam said. \u201cPersonally? I think Amanda was a flake. She was in love with that mummy. She probably offed the guard herself, then climbed into the sarcophagus.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Simonton shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I had nothing to do with that damn ship. It\u2019s scary\u2014Brady Laurie, Austin...and now Amanda and a guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guard isn\u2019t dead,\u201d Samantha said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the poor guy will survive to tell the tale.\u201d Simonton looked past Samantha and saw Dirk Manning. \u201cDirk!\u201d he called, walking past Samantha. He set a hand on Manning\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, I\u2019m so sorry. I know what good friends you and Austin were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Andy, thank you. Samantha, I do believe just about everyone\u2019s present, is that correct?\u201d Dirk asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting on just one more\u2014Landry. He\u2019s on his way with a date or a friend or something,\u201d Samantha said.</p><p>As she spoke, the door opened in the hallway; Stewart Landry was there. He was accompanied by his attractive receptionist, the blonde Sherry Bertelli. She smiled vaguely when Dirk Manning came forward to greet them. \u201cThank you, thank you for coming. It would have meant a lot to Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were still reeling from the news of his death when we heard about Amanda,\u201d Landry said.</p><p>\u201cShe really wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d Sherry noted.</p><p>Manning cleared his throat. \u201cYes, well, it\u2019s very sad, all the same.\u201d</p><p>Andy Simonton had been standing still, watching Landry and Sherry. Landry noticed Simonton and seemed slightly surprised. \u201cSimonton, how are you?\u201d He strode forward, offering his hand.</p><p>Simonton took it. They behaved in a cordial manner, but both men seemed tense. \u201cHello, um, Ms. Bertelli,\u201d Simonton said.</p><p>\u201cSherry. Yes, hello, Mr. Simonton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndy, please,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe have our nine to read in honor of our friend Austin Miller. We shall begin. If everyone will gather in the yard?\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Simonton caught sight of Will and Kat. He seemed curious, but not dismayed. \u201cHello.\u201d He walked over, gesturing at their robes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you were members or associates of the Sand Diggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here because of Dirk,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHe was with us when we found Austin Miller, so...I guess we have something of a bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be busy at the Preservation Center,\u201d Simonton said. \u201cThat\u2019s all very tragic, but...\u201d He grimaced. \u201cBoth Brady and Amanda were obsessed. I feel bad for poor Jon Hunt, though. He must be suffering big-time. I mean, they have a guard, a receptionist...interns, but those three were the ones who really held the fort down, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jon isn\u2019t coping too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor boy!\u201d Simonton shook his head. \u201cWell, I guess we should get into the yard.\u201d</p><p>He joined the stream heading out. Will held his reading in one hand and took Kat\u2019s hand with the other. He almost walked into Sherry Bertelli. She looked up at him and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI know you!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, hello, Ms. Bertelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the agent. Oh!\u201d She\u2019d noticed Kat beside him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the other agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Kat told her, \u201cwe\u2019re just mourners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Mr. Miller?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly in death.\u201d Kat smiled. \u201cBut he was a lovely man.\u201d</p><p>Sherry seemed perplexed; at her side, Landry paused, frowning as he saw Will and Kat.</p><p>\u201cGood God! Do you people hold nothing sacred?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cActually, we hold a man\u2019s life sacred above all else,\u201d Will said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Manning called from the back door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way, Dirk, on our way!\u201d Landry called, frowning again as he looked at Will.</p><p>They continued out.</p><p>In a long trail, they began the procession through the winding maze. Will knew that, alone, he\u2019d find it difficult to orient himself. But Dirk Manning, at the head of the line, was sure of every step.</p><p>\u201cI speak for Ra!\u201d he intoned, waving an incense burner in front of him as he walked. \u201cAlthough our brother Austin lived in a different time and place, we pray that in his new life he may forever know the warmth and nurturing power of the sun.\u201d</p><p>Samantha had the next reading. \u201cI speak for Isis,\u201d she said. \u201cIsis, who represents healing of all that hurts and bears down upon a laden soul. Austin, may you be relieved of the pain that is the lot of man. May you feel the grace of freedom, the health of the soul, in your new life.\u201d</p><p>By the time Samantha finished speaking, they\u2019d come to the center of the maze. There was an altar guarded by two stone lions; in the center was a large obelisk.</p><p>Will was touched to see that many of the mourners had brought flowers, which they laid on the altar.</p><p>Other members of the group read as their assigned gods or goddesses. The first of the two men he\u2019d met in the parlor, Bill Bartholomew, read thoughts as Khepra, god of creation and change, and talked about the new life. David Gleeson spoke words of wisdom from Seker, god of light, and the god who protected souls as they passed from this world to the next. It was while Gleeson was speaking that Will saw Kat staring hard at the altar. He focused in the same direction. After a moment, he could see the vague image of an elderly man, and then, bit by bit, Austin Miller, became more visible to him.</p><p>He stood next to Dirk Manning, his hand on his old friend\u2019s shoulder. If Dirk felt his hand in any way, he didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>Next it was Kat\u2019s turn to speak. She said the words written for her as Mut, telling the soul of Austin Miller that a mother\u2019s love would guide him. She looked straight into his eyes as she spoke. The spirit of Austin Miller looked back at her, smiling, his eyes a little moist.</p><p>Will heard Austin so clearly when he said, \u201cThank you, my dear,\u201d that he was certain others must have heard him, too. But they hadn\u2019t. Other speakers, including Will, read their speeches and the service continued.</p><p>\u201cTell my friend, please, that my old meerschaum pipe he so admired is in the pocket of the smoking jacket I left in the closet here. I want him to have it. I want him to have the pipe and to take care of himself, and I don\u2019t want him at my house or at this house alone. Tell him I fear he is in danger. There is a curse. I saw the mummy.\u201d</p><p>Will glanced around, wondering if anyone else could possibly see and hear Austin Miller. He seemed so clear and strong and loud. But they were all paying attention to the next speaker.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Kat said softly.</p><p>Austin Miller was still next to Dirk Manning when he brought the ceremony to a close. \u201cAncient Egypt is my passion,\u201d Dirk told the crowd solemnly. \u201cChristianity is my religion, but mine is a God of love and kindness, and He understands what we did here tonight. Some scholars now consider the polytheistic beliefs of the old Egyptians as the practice of seeing one god in many ways. And as we all know, methods of worship changed over the fifty centuries that passed within the many kingdoms and periods of the people we study. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for this send-off to our dear friend. Mortal remains, we know, mean nothing. Austin\u2019s soul is with us tonight.\u201d</p><p>Will was startled when Kat walked forward, tiny but so regal, to speak to Dirk Manning across the altar. \u201cDirk, Austin really is with us tonight. He is truly appreciative of all that you did. He wants you to know that his meerschaum pipe is in his smoking jacket, in the pocket.\u201d She stopped speaking and turned around, looking at the gathered guests. \u201cHe says there is no curse. He reminds you that you love Egyptology, but you\u2019re not superstitious fools.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will watched her with curiosity, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cBut he warns that you are all in danger because of a psychotic human being, so he wants you to be careful,\u201d Kat finished.</p><p>What the hell is she doing? Will wondered.</p> <p>The ghost of Austin Miller was staring at Kat. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, my dear. I told you\u2014the mummy did it!\u201d</p><p>She turned again to look straight at Austin Miller. \u201cSomeone here tonight knows what happened\u2014what\u2019s been happening,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Stewart Landry\u2019s secretary suddenly gasped. \u201cOh! She sees him! She sees Austin\u2019s ghost! I think...oh, there\u2019s something there, Dirk, right by you!\u201d</p><p>Dirk Manning twitched, turning with a frown.</p><p>Obviously, he saw nothing.</p> <p>\u201cHe is! He is with us!\u201d Samantha said, raising her arms to the night sky. \u201cWe have given this ceremony in his honor, and he has become like a living god!\u201d</p><p>Andy Simonton started laughing. \u201cOh, please! What a crock of shit!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m going to honor old Austin, all right. I\u2019m going to have a Scotch and toast to his honor. Join me inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019ll join you!\u201d Stewart Landry said. \u201cWe\u2019ll honor the old fellow in the way he would\u2019ve liked!\u201d</p><p>He turned. Others, confused, turned to follow him, as well. People were ready to go back to the house.</p><p>Dirk Manning looked at Kat with tears in his eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing, say such things\u2014make a mockery of our ceremony?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMr. Manning, I wasn\u2019t mocking you, but I\u2019ll admit I was using you tonight. Someone here does know what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019m hoping I managed to unnerve that person. I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you.\u201d She inhaled a deep breath. \u201cI used you, yes, but I do have a...way to hear the dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re an M.E.,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I also have a strange sixth sense.\u201d She shook her head, smiling. \u201cWhat I said about the pipe was true. Austin Miller loved you like a brother. He wants you to have his pipe and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it where I said you would.\u201d</p><p>His expression was troubled. But whether he believed her or not, they would never know, because they suddenly heard shouts coming from the maze.</p><p>\u201cHey! Manning, how the hell do we get out of here?\u201d</p><p>It was Andy Simonton calling to him.</p><p>\u201cHere, Andy, follow my voice. I can get you out!\u201d</p><p>That was Samantha, calling back.</p><p>But before anyone else could shout that they, too, were lost, there was a desperate scream and Sherry Bertelli began to sob.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me, help me, oh, God, help me! It\u2019s...it\u2019s the mummy!\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Kat turned to stare at Will. He was already pulling his robe over his shoulders, yanking it off, ready to go in search of Sherry Bertelli.</p><p>Landry was shouting in desperation, calling her name over and over again.</p><p>Kat instantly got out of her own robe and asked Dirk Manning, \u201cWhich way? Which way would have gotten her lost?\u201d</p><p>Manning pointed to one of the paths. Kat tore down it and crashed straight into Samantha, who looked at her with wide, terrified, eyes\u2014speechless for once.</p><p>\u201cGet back to the house!\u201d Kat said, pushing her aside. People were shouting from all over the maze, and it was impossible to get a bearing on Sherry\u2019s location. At last, she went silent.</p><p>Kat envisioned the worst, but she kept running through the darkness and the shadows, guided by the moonlight that filtered down and the occasional flash of a torch carried by one or other member of the group.</p><p>She made a hurried turn to the left\u2014and practically tripped over Sherry. The woman was lying on the ground. Kat fell to her knees just as Will reached her, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord!\u201d he exclaimed, hunkering down beside her. \u201cIs she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a strong pulse and she\u2019s breathing evenly. I think she just passed out,\u201d Kat said, relieved.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her to the house.\u201d Will slipped his arms beneath the woman, cradling her before rising carefully to his feet. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came from that direction.\u201d Kat pointed behind them. \u201cIf we can just get to the altar...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry, Sherry!\u201d they heard Landry cry in anguish. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have her! She\u2019s all right!\u201d Will shouted in reply.</p><p>They could hear Landry babbling his relief as they approached the altar. Dirk was still standing there, as if stunned. When he saw them, he came to life again. \u201cThis way. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>He led them out of the maze. Will carried Sherry past Landry, who tried to stop him and touch Sherry.</p><p>\u201cMr. Landry, let\u2019s just get her inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA doctor, we need a doctor!\u201d Landry said.</p><p>\u201cShe probably scared herself after all that ridiculous ghost talk,\u201d Andy Simonton muttered. \u201cShe needs a whiskey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Landry, I am a doctor,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah! A doctor for the dead!\u201d Simonton snorted.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I finished my residency in a hospital working with the living,\u201d Kat told him. \u201cMs. Bertelli will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t a man to be stopped easily; he\u2019d barely slowed when Landry accosted him and he continued his long strides, carrying Sherry back to the house. He brought her to the parlor, where he placed her on the sofa. Her eyes were already opening as he did.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she gasped, her lashes fluttering.</p><p>\u201cSherry, Sherry!\u201d Landry rushed to her side and fell to his knees, taking her hand. He smoothed her hair. \u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019m fine, Stewart. I\u2019m just scared and shaken and\u2014\u201d She broke off. By then, everyone had come in and they were all staring at her. Her voice was tremulous. \u201cI swear to you, there was a mummy in the maze. It walked toward me. It was terrifying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for the whiskey!\u201d Simonton said.</p><p>\u201cThey need to stop. They need to stop right now,\u201d Samantha exclaimed. \u201cHonestly, someone should make them throw that mummy back in the lake and forget the Jerry McGuen was ever found. Three people are dead and one more may be dying...because there\u2019s a curse. Such things can exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d Will said, \u201cthat once a discovery is made\u2014it\u2019s made. I sincerely doubt the mummy will be cast out to sea. And surely you know there\u2019s no curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was a mummy in the maze,\u201d Sherry insisted.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll search the maze,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cWhoever might\u2019ve been there is probably long gone. Sherry might even have been startled by running into one of us in the darkness. Still, we\u2019ll search the entire maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no! We\u2019re not going back out there,\u201d Landry said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to, Mr. Landry. We\u2019ll have the authorities do the search,\u201d Will told him.</p><p>Andy Simonton grinned. \u201cI thought you were the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Kat said in an aloof voice. She pulled out her cell phone. \u201cAnd we will investigate the maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you can\u2019t. You...can\u2019t!\u201d Sherry cried. \u201cThere was a curse. It was written on Amun Mopat\u2019s tomb. Just because it was unspoken doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d</p><p>Simonton shook his head and laughed. \u201cUnspoken? It\u2019s all anyone talks about, writes about or puts on the news. And Ms. Bertelli, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be cruel, but there is no mummy in that maze. We all scared ourselves\u2014she scared us!\u201d he said, pointing at Kat. He walked over to her. \u201cYou may be all kinds of gorgeous, honey, but you\u2019re a freak!\u201d</p><p>Kat could feel Will\u2019s tension; it would have made her smile if she hadn\u2019t been afraid he was ready to deck Andy Simonton.</p><p>She rose swiftly to her own defense. \u201cIt\u2019s Special Agent Sokolov, not honey, Mr. Simonton. Or Dr. Sokolov, if you prefer. I\u2019ll be happy to answer to either. And I wasn\u2019t creating an illusion or a freak show. Dirk, would you be so good as to find out if I\u2019m right or not?\u201d</p><p>Manning hurried to the closet. It was a big walk-in closet and it took him a few minutes to rummage through the many jackets there.</p><p>He stepped out of the closet and stared at Kat in utter disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Simonton demanded.</p><p>Dirk produced the exquisitely carved meerschaum pipe.</p><p>There was an audible gasp.</p><p>\u201cShe planted it there,\u201d Simonton said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d The whisper of incredulity in Dirk\u2019s voice made those around him fall silent.</p><p>Kat looked around the room, letting her eyes settle on Stewart Landry first, and then on Andy Simonton. \u201cThe dead do speak to me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd someday soon, one of the dead will tell us who was behind all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sherry gasped.</p><p>Simonton scowled at her. \u201cShe\u2019s pretending she talks to ghosts!\u201d he said.</p><p>Kat smiled. \u201cActually, I was referring primarily to the fact that I\u2019m a medical examiner. And the dead speak through their remains. They speak to me,\u201d she said again. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a killer out there who doesn\u2019t make a mistake, and a dead body will eventually tell us just what that mistake was. There\u2019s so much we can learn.\u201d Of course, they hadn\u2019t learned much on the scientific front yet, not from Austin or Amanda, but none of these people knew that.</p><p>Sherry let out a little sob. \u201cPlease, Stewy, I want to go home now!\u201d she said.</p><p>Her words began the exodus. Most of the crowd looked warily at Kat as if they were more than a little afraid of her, but no one approached her or said a word.</p><p>The fact that Will was standing behind her\u2014tall, broad-shouldered and fierce\u2014might have had something to do with that.</p><p>At last they were alone with Dirk Manning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Manning,\u201d Will told him, \u201cwe are concerned for your safety.

I\u2019d like you to stay at the hotel with us.\u201d</p><p>To Kat\u2019s astonishment, Manning didn\u2019t blink an eye. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you can get me a room? I can be on the same floor with you agents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can arrange it.\u201d Will pulled out his phone and turned aside. Kat could hear him speaking with Logan, but she gave her attention to Dirk.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Manning, I need you to think hard. If any of your associates have behaved strangely in the last while, if any of them have seemed either uninterested or too interested in what\u2019s going on, we need to know.\u201d</p><p>Manning groaned. \u201cI\u2019m numb right now. I can\u2019t seem to think of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Maybe after you\u2019ve had some sleep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really saw him\u2014Austin. You really saw him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cSo there is something more!\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Will walked over to them. \u201cWe\u2019ll have other Krewe members here in a few minutes. Kat, you want to stay with Mr. Manning until then? I\u2019ll get started in the maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know where you\u2019re going,\u201d Manning protested. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything out there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything out there that would hurt me, it\u2019s human\u2014and I have a gun,\u201d Will assured him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Dirk said when Will had gone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out,\u201d Kat told him. They would; she just prayed it would be before anyone else died.</p> <p>\u201cSherry Bertelli must have imagined she saw a mummy,\u201d Dirk mused. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Kat broke in, \u201cmaybe Andy Simonton\u2019s idea wasn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019m going to get you a drink. What\u2019s your preference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotch,\u201d Dirk said. \u201cA good shot of Scotch!\u201d</p><p>She went to the kitchen and fixed him a drink. When she returned to the parlor with it, she sat across from where he perched on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI do miss Austin. So much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to run this place, plan events, bring in speakers, write out invitations....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakers? Do you have other people involved\u2014other than the list of forty members you gave us?\u201d Kat asked him.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have what we call \u2018associates\u2019\u2014when they allow us to call them that,\u201d Dirk replied. \u201cScholars, people in the field...people we find interesting. Adding names like that helps when you have events or you\u2019re fundraising,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe hold events to raise money for children\u2019s charities. We\u2019re quite a humanitarian organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But could you get me a list of those associates? Before we leave tonight?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. She rose, certain that she\u2019d heard a car door.</p><p>She had. Opening the front door, she saw that Logan and her Krewe had arrived.</p><p>\u201cWe need to search a maze?\u201d Logan asked. They\u2019d come prepared; everyone carried a high-beam flashlight.</p><p>She quickly explained much of what had happened. \u201cI\u2019ll show you out,\u201d she said, looking at Logan and indicating Dirk, who still sat on the sofa.</p><p>Kelsey walked past her. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Mr. Manning,\u201d she said. Entering the parlor, she greeted Dirk, reminding him that they\u2019d met under sad circumstances. Kelsey was charming, as always, and Dirk seemed fine.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you out to the maze. Will\u2019s already there.\u201d</p><p>In the yard, she shouted so Will would hear her and know that the others had come. \u201cI\u2019m almost at the end to the right. So far, nothing!\u201d he called back.</p><p>\u201cWe should be sticking together,\u201d Logan said. \u201cTyler, you\u2019re with me. Kat, hang with Sean.\u201d</p><p>She followed the two men. It was hard going in the dark, and a little eerie, since at practically every turn there was a statue of a god or goddess in the form of whatever creature was usually linked with him or her.</p><p>She almost walked past a life-size marble Bastet. But something about it caught her eye and she walked back.</p><p>There was a pale smear at the base of the tail. She trained her flashlight on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sean asked, circling back to her.</p><p>She dug in her pocket for an evidence bag and removed what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>\u201cMore of the gauze\u2014or real mummy linen. Like the stuff we found on the wall at the hotel\u2014and at Austin Miller\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing else in the maze. There was no real proof that the gauze was disintegrating fabric from thousands of years ago, but since the other pieces had proven to be just that, Will had little doubt that they\u2019d found more of the same.</p><p>The night grew long. Because Chicago Homicide was now involved, Logan felt that they needed to at least report the evening\u2019s strange events to Sergeant Jenson and the detective who\u2019d been at the Preservation Center. Both officers arrived at the Egyptian Sand Diggers\u2019 mansion and added notations to their records. Will meant to keep control of the piece of mummy evidence, and he was glad the officers were appreciative of being in the know\u2014despite not being in control.</p><p>Jenson told Will, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019d investigate even if you handed it over to us. A woman who thinks she saw a mummy in the middle of a whacked-out memorial? Or a shred of mummy fabric at a clubhouse for Egyptian scholars?\u201d</p><p>Jane called in a report to Logan from the hospital. Abel Leary, the guard who\u2019d been shot, was still unconscious. He had fallen into a coma. Doctors were encouraged that his vital signs seemed stable, but he wasn\u2019t yet capable of providing them with any information.</p><p>The crime scene techs had retrieved gunshot residue from Abel Leary\u2019s hands, but that fact was being withheld from the public for the time being, as were the results of Dr. Amanda Channel\u2019s toxicology report.</p><p>When they returned to the hotel, the Krewe members were exhausted. There was no meeting. Will and Kat had taken Dirk to his home to collect an overnight bag, and a room was found for him on the same floor as the agents. Then everyone retired for the night.</p><p>Kat seemed small and fragile, and when she headed for the shower, Will thought she might want to be alone. He drew out his notes, thinking that if he studied them for a while, it might lead to a better night\u2019s sleep. He was surprised when Kat appeared outside the bathroom, clad only in a towel. \u201cToo tired to join me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked at her and smiled. \u201cMaybe one day. When we\u2019ve weathered a few more very long days and nights together,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut not yet.\u201d</p><p>There was something about being together in the heat and steam of the shower that erased exhaustion. Maybe it was the wonder of life itself, the excitement of the sensations and feelings that could arise between two people.</p><p>Maybe it was finding a woman who was stunning and complex and beautiful beyond measure. A woman who\u2019d found him, too. Making love in the shower seemed so natural, and when they were finally out and dry and in bed, sleep came quickly and easily. He woke up hours later, and she was cradled in his arms. He held her, just watching her. Watching her breathe and the rhythmic motion of her heartbeat. He felt her warmth, and he lay there for long moments savoring the feel of waking with her beside him, suddenly and perhaps ridiculously certain that this was the way he\u2019d like to wake every morning of his life.</p><p>Then the alarm rang, and it was time to start the day.</p><p>They didn\u2019t go down to the hotel dining room that morning; Logan had ordered food for the suite.</p><p>He stood by his boards, going through points he\u2019d written down. \u201cSaxitoxin\u2014that\u2019s the poison that killed Amanda Channel. But she should have suffered before she died. She should have shown some signs of trauma. In short, she shouldn\u2019t have been able to crawl into a sarcophagus, curl up with her favorite mummy and die. And, once again, we\u2019re left with a dilemma. This is a poison she might have acquired herself from eating shellfish. But, according to Jon Hunt, Amanda knew she was allergic to shellfish, so why would she have eaten it? There were trace elements of lobster in her stomach contents so, somehow, the woman ate lobster. East-coast ocean seafood.\u201d He paused. \u201cOf course, it could have been concealed in a stew or a soup...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have tricked her into eating it,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cYes. It takes effect quickly, so I believe beyond the shadow of a doubt that someone was in the Preservation Center with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda probably wanted to get back into the center, even after it closed for the day,\u201d Kat said. \u201cShe was obsessed with that mummy. I don\u2019t think it would be difficult for anyone to guess she\u2019d go back.\u201d</p><p>Will glanced up; he\u2019d been reading the invitation lists of \u201cassociates\u201d Dirk Manning had given them before they\u2019d left the Sand Diggers\u2019 mansion the night before.</p><p>\u201cThe Preservation Center doctors are on this list. All three of them\u2014Brady, Amanda and Jon Hunt,\u201d he told the others. \u201cThe heads of both salvage companies\u2014Stewart Landry and Andy Simonton\u2014are on it, as well.\u201d He looked at Kat. \u201cThere\u2019s also a name I wasn\u2019t expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Alex McFarland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost. Who is McFarland?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Alex McFarland is the medical examiner Kat and I met when we went to the morgue to view Brady Laurie\u2019s remains,\u201d Will answered.</p><p>\u201cMcFarland?\u201d Kat repeated. \u201cHe did know all about the ship, the lakes and a lot about the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t at the ceremony last night,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Kat began. \u201cSo suppose Sherry Bertelli did see someone in a mummy suit last night, someone carrying around one of those swatches of real mummy cloth. McFarland wasn\u2019t there, so he could\u2019ve slipped in before us, ready to \u2018haunt\u2019 someone in the maze once everything broke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould McFarland have access to real mummy wrapping?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who worked at the center might have,\u201d Kat said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on the Jerry McGuen and Amun Mopat.

If Dr. McFarland is one of their \u2018associates\u2019 and a reputable pathologist, he might have had access to a mummy at sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotive,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWhat would McFarland have wanted?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMotive seems to be the main problem with all our suspects,\u201d Kat pointed out. \u201cYes, the Jerry McGuen holds untold riches. So, if someone was trying to throw off the salvage\u2014in killing Brady Laurie\u2014that would make sense. But it\u2019s not going to matter how many people die, or how many times someone shouts \u2018curse.\u2019 That treasure has been discovered. The world at large won\u2019t forget. If the center pulls out, if the film crew pulls out\u2014someone else will go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither Landry Salvage or Simonton\u2019s Sea Search could be the company given the right to go in,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cSo how would that involve a Chicago M.E.?\u201d Tyler mused.</p><p>\u201cWe figured that more than one person has to be in on this,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIt looked like Amanda might be part of it, but Amanda is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcFarland was the M.E. who wanted to sign off so quickly on Brady Laurie\u2019s death. He was adamant that it had been an accident,\u201d Will explained. \u201cMaybe he knew exactly what happened to Brady Laurie. And maybe he knew that whether or not he pulled the Miller autopsy, a heart attack was a heart attack, and no one could prove otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds like a stretch,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should pay him a visit,\u201d Tyler suggested. \u201cShake him up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should go a step further.\u201d Kat looked at Logan. \u201cHave the police go and get him. Bring him down to the station and ask him questions there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill gave the man a hard time at the morgue, right?\u201d Logan said. \u201cThen Will should interrogate. With Tyler. You can play desperate lawman needing information, Tyler. And Will, you continue knocking his ability.\u201d Logan took out his phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Sergeant Riley bring him in, since he was the first one called in on the accidental death. Will, Tyler\u2014get down to the station. See what we can get out of the man...if anything. He could just be a pompous jerk, but at this point, we need to start real interrogations. Kelsey, spell Jane at the hospital so she can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to bring Dirk Manning the files we took from Austin Miller\u2019s house and return there with him,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI still think that we\u2019re missing something we should be seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Logan made a note. \u201cSean will go with you two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another thing,\u201d Will said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it means anything or not.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThe filming has stopped, if only temporarily. Dives to the wreck have stopped. If that\u2019s what someone wanted, it\u2019s happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>Logan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cWill, call Alan King. Tell him that tomorrow you\u2019ll dive to get more footage of the entire ship. We\u2019ll assure the Chicago authorities and the Preservation Center\u2014that\u2019s Jon Hunt now, unless we go to their board\u2014that nothing will be touched until an Egyptologist is back down with us. But, Will, you\u2019re right. The diving has stopped. And we shouldn\u2019t let that happen. There\u2019s still something down there that someone wants. Either that, or it\u2019s at the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t help believing the clues are at Austin Miller\u2019s house,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Dr. Alex McFarland seemed to believe he\u2019d been brought down to the police station to be helpful; after all, he was an M.E.</p><p>He sat in one of the interrogation rooms, idly looking around, then playing with his cell phone, slamming it down when it didn\u2019t work. Will and Tyler watched for a while with Sergeant Riley.</p><p>Riley shook his head. \u201cThe man may have medical degrees up the wazoo, but he doesn\u2019t seem that sharp to me. I mean, he doesn\u2019t strike me as the mastermind behind three deaths and an attempted murder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe might still be part of this,\u201d Will said. He glanced at Tyler. \u201cWant to show him that list of \u2018associate\u2019 Sand Diggers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m moving in.\u201d</p><p>Although Tyler was imposing\u2014tall and Texan, with his service pistol visible at this side\u2014he introduced himself to McFarland in a friendly fashion. The two chatted for a while. Tyler explained that he\u2019d been with the Texas Rangers before joining a unit of the FBI. He complained about the amount of training he\u2019d had to do all over again, drawing McFarland\u2019s sympathy.</p><p>Then he showed him the roster.</p><p>McFarland looked startled. He thrust the roster back at Tyler. \u201cThose Sand Diggers think they can put anybody on their list! I didn\u2019t attend their \u2018raise the Jerry McGuen party.\u2019 I like Egyptology, but if I was going to support anything, it would be the Chicago Ancient History Preservation Center. Those folks know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Will chose that moment to go in. McFarland was immediately hostile, getting to his feet when he saw Will.</p><p>\u201cThose folks did know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Will said with a smile. \u201cBut they\u2019re mostly dead now, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even dive!\u201d McFarland protested. \u201cI did nothing to harm anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. It seems to me that you might have been involved somehow. You wanted to put Brady Laurie\u2019s death down as accidental, but it\u2019s starting to look like you were way off base with that.\u201d</p><p>McFarland leaned forward. \u201cYou still don\u2019t know that\u2019s true. There are a bunch of could-bes with what you tried to sell, Agent Chan. And there\u2019s still a bunch of maybes. I didn\u2019t do the autopsy on Austin Miller but I read the reports. There was a bruise on the back of Miller\u2019s arm. As if he\u2019d warded someone off. But he could have gotten that bruise anywhere. And even with Amanda Channel\u2014hell, I\u2019ve seen way too many people die under similar circumstances. She could have died of anaphylactic shock from shellfish at any time.\u201d</p><p>Will had taken a seat across from him. Listening, he turned a pen over and over in his fingers. McFarland had realized he wasn\u2019t at the station as an expert witness, after all. He was looking intimidated, but Will figured Logan had bargained on that.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Amanda, and I don\u2019t even know that much about Brady. But I do know about Austin Miller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d McFarland asked.</p><p>\u201cI know he was sitting in his den, relishing the idea that the Jerry McGuen and Amun Mopat\u2019s treasures were about to be found. And while he sat there, about to turn on his alarm and go to bed for the night, someone walked through the patio doors and approached him\u2014someone dressed as a mummy. I know that when Austin reached for his pills, that so-called mummy slammed them from his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d McFarland demanded, his face growing red.</p><p>\u201cBecause Austin told us,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cAustin is dead!\u201d McFarland screamed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, ain\u2019t that a bitch?\u201d Tyler asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You talked to a dead man?\u201d McFarland jeered. \u201cYou people are just as big a bunch of loonies as those Sand Diggers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dr. McFarland,\u201d Will told him. \u201cYou think it\u2019s only the body that can tell us what happened. What you don\u2019t see is that there\u2019s so much more. We study a man\u2019s habits\u2014and his home. And the evidence tells us that he was visited by someone dressed up as a mummy.\u201d</p><p>McFarland looked as if he was about to explode and, at that moment, Will agreed with Riley that McFarland was no mastermind. The people behind these deaths weren\u2019t afraid of a curse and didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. They would\u2019ve been startled that the Krewe had worked out exactly what happened, but wouldn\u2019t have given themselves away so easily.</p><p>But McFarland was somehow involved.</p><p>\u201cLook, I swear to you, I don\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s going on. The only time I\u2019ve ever been to that society was when I gave a lecture on ancient embalming techniques. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking abruptly.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Will snapped.</p><p>McFarland let out a breath. \u201cWe, uh, talked about the mysteries of Ancient Egypt. How some of the pharaohs and other high-ranking people died. The kinds of things that wouldn\u2019t have been obvious to the medical field a century ago. Tooth decay, poison, allergic reactions...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...shellfish allergies?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>McFarland nodded. \u201cIt was just a lecture. People give lectures like that all the time. To police units, criminology students, clubs and societies. Look, I didn\u2019t tell anyone how to do it! And if someone used that information, it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><p>Kat stood in Austin Miller\u2019s office. A number of the files and journals the man had kept lay open on his desk, but she\u2019d become fascinated with a picture on the wall. She\u2019d been in the room with Dirk Manning for a while, reading. Sean Cameron, who\u2019d accompanied them, had brought along the computers belonging to Brady Laurie and Amanda Channel. He was to crack all their codes and passwords, find out if either had been doing business or communicating with anyone of interest\u2014current suspect or not.</p><p>He worked near the entry. The patio doors were locked; the alarm had been set.</p><p>As Sean worked, he kept an eye on the house itself, watching over Kat and Dirk Manning. He\u2019d told them that the alarm was functioning perfectly, but promised to remain on guard.</p><p>Manning had been nervous about the whole idea, but she and Sean had managed to reassure him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ship in the painting rode the high waves with majestic beauty.</p><p>\u201cThe Jerry McGuen,\u201d Dirk Manning said, standing behind her.</p><p>\u201cShe was a beautiful ship,\u201d another voice said.</p> <p>Kat turned. Manning looked at her, and she smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s here, Dirk. Austin is here. I can\u2019t explain how to see him or feel him, but he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Dirk sat down in the chair behind the desk, hard.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t see me, can he?\u201d Austin asked her sadly.</p><p>\u201cNo, not now, but he may,\u201d she said. \u201cLater on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe who?\u201d Dirk asked, his expression lost. \u201cMe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But Dirk, I swear to you, he\u2019s here with us.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung Dirk Manning\u2019s eyes. \u201cMy old friend. My good friend!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful.\u201d Austin set a hand on Dirk\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou be careful, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Manning trembled. \u201cI feel...something. Like a little chill,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAustin\u2019s standing right behind you,\u201d Kat told him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you felt, Dirk. His presence.\u201d</p><p>Austin frowned at Kat. \u201cAnd you, young lady! You repeat my words just as I say them, do you understand? What were you up to last night? You said things I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Miller, I\u2019m trying to lure your killer into the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have gotten a young woman killed!\u201d he said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cIf that young woman and the others hadn\u2019t rushed off in such a fright, nothing would have happened. All right now, both of you\u2014what can you tell me about the sinking of the Jerry McGuen?\u201d</p><p>Dirk gave her a half smile. \u201cI\u2019m old\u2014but not that old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you two know so much. What do you think of this? Will Chan believes the ship might have been purposely sunk\u2014rammed by an icebreaker on the lake. Have you ever heard such a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn icebreaker...\u201d Dirk murmured. \u201cOf course, many shipping companies were using icebreakers on the Great Lakes by the turn of the century. So was the Coast Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would an icebreaker have been used to sink the Jerry McGuen?\u201d Austin muttered with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you two,\u201d Kat said.</p> <p>\u201cIs Austin speaking?\u201d Dirk asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see him? You can have conversations with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you can feel him. I see that you do,\u201d Kat said. \u201cOkay, listen. This is what we think. Whoever is doing this isn\u2019t after treasure. Any treasure belongs to the State of Illinois, or probably to the Egyptian people. Our theory is that the person or persons behind this followed Brady\u2019s steps and actually reached the Jerry McGuen first, but they didn\u2019t go down to get various little pieces or even big pieces that they might put on the black market. I believe they\u2019re after something specific for reasons that have nothing to do with money or with Egyptology, per se. Someone purposely sank the Jerry McGuen because of whatever this object might be. And someone is killing now, with the express purpose of recovering that object. Someone or several someones,\u201d she added.</p><p>Dirk stared at her blankly. Then he said, \u201cAsk Austin. He has a book somewhere with pictures of ships from the late 1800s, including the icebreakers of the time. Maybe you can find what you\u2019re looking for there.\u201d</p><p>Kat wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d discover by studying the ships, but it was worth a try.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the book, Austin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUnder the golden jackal in the display case,\u201d Austin told her. He walked to the case and pointed. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Kat pulled it out and brought it to the desk, sitting in the guest chair across from Dirk. She began to flip through the pages, wondering what she could see in a photograph.</p><p>Then she froze. The picture had been taken more than a hundred years ago and it was grainy and unclear, but it gave her what she wanted.</p><p>She turned the book to face Manning and shoved it toward him.</p><p>\u201cShe was called the Egyptian,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ve seen pictures of her. But she went down, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Kat grabbed the book back.</p><p>\u201cThe same year the Jerry McGuen went down, but she was discovered decades ago. She\u2019s in deep water, below two hundred feet. And she\u2019s completely wrecked\u2014pieces scattered all over the lake bed,\u201d Manning said.</p><p>\u201cBut she was an icebreaker, right?\u201d</p><p>Manning tapped the book impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s what it says, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at her closely. What\u2019s that on the bow?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cA figurehead. Ships back then had figureheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it closely,\u201d Kat insisted.</p><p>Manning bent over the book. \u201cThe figurehead\u2019s an Egyptian man. It\u2019s a myth, really, that all figureheads were female. I\u2019ve seen stunning examples of figureheads that were carved as males. That one is of\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Kat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Amun Mopat,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cThat\u2019s the exact image of the death mask on the mummy.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Will was eager to speak with Dirk Manning. Now that he knew the medical examiner had given a speech that was, for all intents and purposes, on ways to kill without being detected, he wanted to know precisely who among the Egyptian Sand Diggers and their so-called associates had been at the lecture.</p><p>But when Kat answered his call, he noticed that her tone was odd, and before he could make his request, she told him what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cSo, there really was an icebreaker, and it was named the Egyptian and it went down the same year,\u201d he summarized.</p><p>\u201cYes, and the figurehead was Amun Mopat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it explains your dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking up more information on it now,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Find out anything you can. And tell Dirk Manning what I need the names of all those who were at Dr. McFarland\u2019s lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him to write up a list for me,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, ask him if Stewart Landry and Andy Simonton attended. I think it\u2019s time to bring them in for questioning, as well.\u201d</p><p>He heard Kat speaking with Dirk; a moment later she came back to the phone. \u201cYes, Will. Both men were there. The lecture was presented at a barbecue luncheon at the Sand Diggers\u2019 mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kat. I\u2019m going to see that both men are now invited down to the station for a bit of discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t have any proof,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but those two are looking more and more suspicious. They both have small boats that would work well as dive boats. Both men own diver motor devices, and both have been with the Sand Diggers. If they were connected with Brady Laurie or Amanda in any way, they\u2019d know about the facilities at the Preservation Center, and if Amanda had relationships with either of these men, she might have thought she was encouraging help while she was giving away information she shouldn\u2019t have been. I don\u2019t know how it all fits together yet, but I feel we\u2019re making progress. And questioning the men in a police station might get more out of them, just as it did with Dr. McFarland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go for it,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted on whatever you learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Oh, anything from Jane or Kelsey about the guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Will replied.</p><p>They rang off a minute later.</p><p>\u201cWho should we bring in first?\u201d Tyler asked him. \u201cLandry or Simonton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we bring them both in,\u201d Will said. \u201cMake sure each knows the other is there, and then we\u2019ll see if any accusations fly.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Riley to send out escorts with our invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather would have been a talented journalist,\u201d Kat told Austin Miller.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather?\u201d Dirk asked her blankly.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Austin\u2019s grandfather,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAustin, can you show me which of these might have been written after the Jerry McGuen went down?\u201d</p><p>Austin tried to push the journals toward her, but his spectral fingers went right through them. Impatiently, he tried again.</p><p>A book moved half an inch.</p><p>Dirk Manning jumped to his feet, staring at the journals and then at Kat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really here. I mean...really,\u201d he said, his voice a mere breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I think this is the book I want,\u201d Kat said, picking up the journal he\u2019d indicated. It was dated late February, about two months after the sinking of the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Since the two men were with her, she read aloud.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Egyptian was lost today\u2014the news was terrible. Twenty-two men on board, and not a survivor among them. But then, I always thought Captain Ely was more of a fanatic than any man on a dig. He was a believer. His wife told me once that he adhered to spiritualism and that he had an intense belief in magic, in ghosts\u2014and in curses. I spoke to him once, soon after the loss of the Jerry McGuen. He told me that men were fools if they did not believe in a higher power. I assured him that I was a good and active member of the Episcopal Church. He shook his head and said I did not begin to understand all the powers we could not see. He told me that day that the Jerry McGuen had gone down because of the curse, that no man should have interfered with the tomb of Amun Mopat. I should\u2019ve known, he told me. Amun Mopat had been a powerful sorcerer. He had maintained vast power through his scepter. Of course, I had seen the scepter\u2014I was there the day it was found in the tomb. It was a beautiful piece, a rod or staff of the most valuable ebony, carved with vultures and lions and cobras and topped with the largest, most fantastic ball of crystal I have ever seen. I knew, from what hieroglyphics I could decipher in the tomb and the painting within, that Amun Mopat had used the scepter in his ceremonies. He had raised it to the sun, and when the sun caught the crystal, it seemed that the entire sky lit up, and whenever it did, people kneeled before him. I held the scepter myself, and I tried to explain to Captain Ely that it was a beautiful artifact, nothing more. But legend claimed that it was the scepter that gave Amun Mopat the power of the gods. He could save lives with it, and he could take lives away. The power was so great that he was beloved of Ramses II. Riches came to him, and people bowed to the ground when he walked by, as if he were himself a god or a pharaoh. Captain Ely seemed to believe that I was the crazy one. I do not understand precisely why he was so determined to retrieve the scepter, whether his intent was for good or ill. They say that after the sinking of the Jerry McGuen, he became worse and worse, more and more deluded. Men were afraid to sail aboard his ships, and on the night his Egyptian went down, many had warned him that was not a night for even an icebreaker to be out on the water.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat set the book down. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI believe that whoever is doing this is after the scepter, and that\u2019s why the center was broken into, why Amanda is dead and why the guard was shot. But the scepter wasn\u2019t in the sarcophagus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course not,\u201d Dirk said, frowning. \u201cYou just read from the journal. Austin\u2019s grandfather was there when it was discovered in the tomb. It must have been packaged and crated separately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIt\u2019s still down in Lake Michigan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Captain Ely went down to the bottom of Lake Michigan, too,\u201d Dirk said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHe did die because of the curse,\u201d she said, and when both men looked at her, she said, \u201cIt was in his head. He let himself believe in the evil of it, and he brought it to life. Curses are only real when we allow them to be.\u201d</p><p>As Will and Tyler watched from their vantage point behind the glass, Landry and Simonton met each other in the hallway leading to the interrogation rooms.</p><p>Both men came to a sudden halt. Landry spoke first. \u201cSimonton. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as you, I imagine.\u201d Landry shrugged. \u201cTrying to help them figure out what\u2019s going on with the salvage on the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Simonton said. \u201cThey asked me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink we were really invited?\u201d Landry drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make? We\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><p>Will remained behind the one-way glass of the interrogation room. As arranged, Tyler came up to the two men. \u201cMr. Landry, if you will? The room right here. Mr. Simonton, can you accompany me down the hall, please?\u201d</p><p>Landry sat at the table in the small interrogation room, and Will decided to let him wait there for a few minutes.</p><p>Landry drummed his fingers on the scarred wooden table, leaned back in his chair, then sat forward again.</p> <p>He looked impatiently at his watch and fidgeted some more.</p><p>Finally, Will went in to join him, dropping his file on the desk between them.</p><p>Landry frowned. \u201cYou? I thought the cops wanted to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite what you might see on TV, the FBI and the police are after the same outcome, Mr. Landry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at a total loss as to what you want from me. An idiot diver drowns, and an old man has a heart attack. Then that crazy Egyptologist at the center tries to kill a guard or whatever and offs herself\u2014and you think I might be involved?\u201d</p><p>Will smiled. \u201cMr. Landry, you were very upset last night when you believed Ms. Bertelli was being attacked by a mummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy some fake mummy, yes. Not by me!\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t reply.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you could see me almost every second\u2014and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t dressed up as a mummy.\u201d</p><p>Will pushed the folder forward. \u201cMr. Landry, you own an Aquasport Explorer and an Osprey, along with two Sea Ray boats. You also own a UPD\u2014an underwater propulsion device. And you attended a lecture given by Dr. Alex McFarland on ways to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That lecture was on Egyptian embalming!\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cAccording to Dr. McFarland, he also talked about poisons that weren\u2019t easily detected\u2014or that might be accidentally ingested.\u201d</p><p>Landry waved a hand in the air. \u201cI attended that lecture for the lunch!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what the hell\u2014I like the Sand Diggers. You people are so busy looking for evil, you don\u2019t look at the good that group does for the community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the Sand Diggers, too,\u201d Will said pleasantly. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. Let me show you one more document.\u201d</p><p>Landry stared down at the paper. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda Channel\u2019s phone log. You\u2019ll see the number for your company multiple times over the past few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho runs your company, Mr. Landry?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what Mr. Simonton said,\u201d Will threw in.</p><p>\u201cSimonton! He\u2019s probably guilty!\u201d</p><p>Will ignored that. \u201cWould you know if any of your possessions\u2014personal or corporate\u2014were being used?\u201d</p><p>Landry leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve had my UPD under cover at the boat dock on my private property. It hasn\u2019t been used this year. I haven\u2019t been out on the water at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting old? That\u2019s tough, when you\u2019re in love with a sweet young thing like your receptionist.\u201d</p><p>He straightened in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m married, Agent Chan,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cI care about Ms. Bertelli and she attends many business functions with me. I\u2019m not getting old\u2014I\u2019m a CEO and I have staff to do the day-to-day work. But guess what? None of them have used my UPD. It\u2019s in the boat hangar, along with my private pleasure boats. You want to go see?\u201d</p><p>Will rose. \u201cI think that would be a great idea, Mr. Landry. I\u2019d very much like to see the inside of your hangar and your boats.\u201d</p><p>It was late afternoon when Logan called Kat. He told her quickly that Jane had slept for a while and had awakened and was back at the library, researching the icebreaker Egyptian and her captain.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m really calling you about our shooting victim\u2014Abel Leary. Kelsey just phoned me. The doctors say he\u2019s taking a turn for the better. They believe he\u2019ll wake up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go over there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave Sean drop you at the hospital and then bring Manning to me. He\u2019ll be safe. Kelsey can keep an eye on him, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll entertain each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head out right now.\u201d</p><p>Manning didn\u2019t want to leave the house; he wanted to believe that eventually he\u2019d see Austin Miller.</p><p>But even more than that, he didn\u2019t want to be alone where a mummy had stalked his friend, so he was willing to go with Kat and Sean. He clearly felt relieved that Sean would stay with him until he could deliver him to the safety of more agents.</p><p>Kat liked Dirk Manning, and she liked the ghost of Austin Miller. She assured Manning she\u2019d be with him as much as possible and would see him later. He watched her as she got out of the car at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful!\u201d he told her anxiously.</p><p>She found her way to the floor where Kelsey had been sitting outside Abel Leary\u2019s room, reading a book on Egyptology.</p><p>\u201cDecided I should do some research,\u201d she said. \u201cI always thought of Ramses II as the Yul Brynner character in the old movie. And I hated him, of course, because he was enslaving people. But this is a fascinating book. We\u2019re looking at millennia. Most people believe that Ramses II was king at the time of Moses, but it\u2019s not really certain, and it\u2019s not specifically stated in the Bible. And all the evidence says that Ramses II was truly a great ruler. Egypt prospered under him. So, if Amun Mopat was one of his priests, maybe he wasn\u2019t as evil as he\u2019s been portrayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Kat agreed, but she told Kelsey about the icebreaker, the Egyptian, and how it had carried a figurehead of Amun Mopat. \u201cWhich sounds crazy. Apparently, Captain Ely, who had Amun Mopat for a figurehead, believed in the curse. Why have the man as a figurehead if you thought he was capable of such evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he felt evil warded off evil?\u201d Kelsey suggested. \u201cOr maybe he was avenging what was done to Amun Mopat\u2019s tomb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think the man would have been crazy enough\u2014or obsessed enough\u2014to ram the Jerry McGuen?\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cYes. I believe he had his icebreaker ram the ship and that\u2019s why she went down, not because of the storm. There was a storm, of course, but the Jerry McGuen was an impressive ship. It would have taken an impact like that of an icebreaker to tear out her hull.\u201d</p><p>The door to Abel Leary\u2019s room opened and his doctor stepped out. Kelsey introduced the young man as Dr. Gilliam, and she introduced Kat as Dr. Sokolov instead of Agent. Kat grinned; when the title worked, they used it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s conscious and he\u2019s stable, but...five minutes,\u201d Dr. Gilliam said. \u201cHe\u2019s still floating in and out, and on top of his injuries, we\u2019re pumping him full of medication, several of them for pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he said anything to you?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tried, but I honestly have no idea what he\u2019s babbling on about. Perhaps he\u2019ll make more sense to you. Five minutes,\u201d he repeated emphatically.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>She slipped into the room, aware that Kelsey had followed and stood just behind her.</p><p>Abel Leary was probably in his late twenties. There was an IV in his arm, heart monitor attached, the instrument panel at his side humming its watchful rhythm. His eyes were closed when they entered, and Kat said his name very softly. His lids flickered for a moment, then his eyes opened and he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d His eyes closed and he winced. He slowly opened them again. \u201cAre you an angel?\u201d he asked in a raw, husky voice.</p><p>\u201cMr. Leary, I\u2019m Kat Sokolov and I\u2019m with the FBI. This is my colleague, Kelsey O\u2019Brien. We\u2019re trying to catch whoever did this to you. We\u2019re desperate for any help you can give us.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed once more.</p><p>\u201cI shot myself,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see? I shot myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you shoot yourself, Mr. Leary? Did you see Amanda Channel when she came in?\u201d</p><p>He winced again, obviously in pain.</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see Amanda Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see, Mr. Leary? What did you see that caused you to shoot yourself?\u201d</p><p>He was silent again for a minute. \u201cNo one will believe me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll believe you, Mr. Leary. We\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said it was cursed,\u201d he murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened? We\u2019re open to anything you have to say, I swear,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>He looked at her again and seemed to really focus on her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not an angel? Hey, if I get out of here, do you want to have dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Kat said. \u201cWe need to be serious.\u201d</p> <p>He looked away, gazing at the heart monitor. \u201cI heard something and I got up. I was stunned. It was coming from the climate-controlled room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was coming?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was coming. It\u2014it didn\u2019t stumble.... It came toward me, moving slowly. Steadily. I got up from the guard desk. I just stared at it. And then I drew my gun, but not fast enough. It was on me, and was strong...so strong. It got hold of my hand and the gun and I was trying to shoot it...but it was stronger. It twisted the gun. I remember the pain....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it, Mr. Leary?\u201d Kat persisted.</p><p>He curled his lips in a sardonic expression as if mocking himself. \u201cThe mummy. It was the mummy. Old Amun Mopat must have crawled right out of his coffin thing. It was the mummy, and it made me shoot myself. It was the mummy.\u201d</p> <p>Before they could leave the station, Will received a call from Earl Candy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Will asked, bracing himself.</p><p>\u201cThe remote. The guys called in from the security boat. They were watching the remote and the screen went dark\u2014and then it cleared again. But there was no movement, and one of the bozos finally realized that nothing was changing down there. Like, like the fish were in the same spot forever. They played with the lens but didn\u2019t get anything. Someone was down there, Will. Someone was down at the wreck site, and they destroyed my remote!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if anyone knows. The guys didn\u2019t. And the time on the film footage was stopped. They realized it about twenty minutes ago, called me and I\u2019m calling you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get down there and check on it in the morning,\u201d Will said. \u201cCan\u2019t do it any earlier than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s almost dark. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone dying over a remote, but what the hell? Someone\u2019s been down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get on it first thing, Earl,\u201d Will promised again.</p><p>He speculated as he watched Landry. The man didn\u2019t act as if he was afraid he might have been the object of a conversation. Of course, Will had been careful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Will said. He collected Tyler, who\u2019d finished with Simonton and let him go. As they drove to the dock, he tried to calculate the timing. The remote camera could have been disconnected hours ago. That would have given Landry all morning to be out at the wreck.</p><p>At the dock in the boathouse, Landry seemed almost impatient to bring Will and Tyler over to his underwater propulsion device. On the way to the heavy steel shelving where he kept a number of his diving toys, they passed Landry\u2019s various pleasure boats.</p><p>He could see water on one of the Sea Ray speedboats, Lake Shark.</p><p>It looked as if the boat had been out\u2014and not long ago.</p> <p>But Landry didn\u2019t even notice it; he was leading them to the steel shelving.</p><p>\u201cThere. It\u2019s right there. Where it\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped dead, his hand reaching toward the motorized device.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wet,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t using it! I\u2019m telling you, I haven\u2019t had the damned thing out all season. Look, I don\u2019t even keep this boathouse locked. There are always too many people working in and around here who need access. I mean, we lock up at night, but during the day...\u201d</p><p>He stared at the faces around him.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to go back to the station,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to call my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He can meet us down there.\u201d</p><p>Kat returned to the hotel with Kelsey; it was seven o\u2019clock and they were due to gather in the suite, where Logan had arranged for room service.</p><p>Dirk Manning seemed happy. He had a room adjacent to the suite, so he knew that Kelsey or Logan or both could reach him in less than a minute if necessary. He was in bed by the time they got back to the hotel.</p><p>Only Will and Tyler hadn\u2019t shown up yet. Seated together, the others went over the events of the day.</p><p>They realized by then that a search warrant had been executed on Stewart Landry\u2019s home, his office, car and property.</p><p>Strips of ancient linen had been hidden in a secret compartment of his glove box. That seemed the clincher, despite the fact that Landry continued to bitterly disclaim all knowledge of anyone using his UPD or his boat. Or, for that matter, his car. What they\u2019d found had nothing to do with him, he said.</p><p>He had never killed anyone. He\u2019d never caused anyone to suffer an accidental death, and he was completely innocent.</p><p>But he was being held overnight while charges were prepared against him.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t feel relieved, but when Will returned with Tyler Montague, she saw that he didn\u2019t seem particularly relieved, either.</p><p>While they ate, the conversation revolved around Landry.</p><p>\u201cHow did he get hold of linen wrapping used for mummy preparation that was thousands of years old?\u201d Kat murmured. \u201cEven if he claims he didn\u2019t know anything about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that he was in on it with Amanda,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe know she called his company countless times during the past month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we think Amanda supplied him with Brady\u2019s information regarding his search for the Jerry McGuen?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cShe really didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Sean told her. \u201cI studied his social networks and his website today. Not long after that party the Sand Diggers had, Brady published his reasons for believing the ship could be found. He\u2019d used weather reports from the era and pertinent weather and lake information throughout the following decades. In other words, he made his theories public. And, using what he wrote, someone who knows the lake\u2014like a salvage diver\u2014could have gone through his calculations and come up with the same approximate findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us back to Landry,\u201d Will said thoughtfully. \u201cThe guy must be one hell of an actor, though. He really looked shocked when we found his gear wet\u2014and that his boat had been out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go with Andy Simonton?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cSimonton was forthright and told me he\u2019d been at the lecture and that it was \u2018tremendously interesting\u2019\u2014his words. He said, though, that Dr. McFarland was a jerk, pompous and full of himself,\u201d Tyler replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, Landry\u2019s being held overnight,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what a night in lockup will do. Maybe we\u2019ll learn more tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone tampered with the remote camera today,\u201d Will reported. \u201cI\u2019m going back down in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Kat frowned. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t see. All right, so say Amanda was Landry\u2019s Egyptologist and that she got him the mummy wrapping, which she must have had access to at various points during her career. Then he starts to worry about her for some reason. He gets into the center because she lets him in. He kills her, and then goes for Abel Leary, the guard. But, according to Abel, the guy who made him shoot himself\u2014the supposed mummy\u2014was strong. Landry isn\u2019t that young. Could he be that strong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he\u2019s got lots of stamina,\u201d Tyler said in a wry voice. \u201cHe has a wife\u2014and he\u2019s apparently having an affair with his young receptionist. Although how he thinks he\u2019s hiding it from his wife, I don\u2019t know. Hey, has anyone talked with Mrs. Landry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I spoke with her this afternoon,\u201d Logan said. He shrugged. \u201cShe figured out that her husband worked the hours he worked because he was having an affair with Sherry. She\u2019s ready to throw him to the wolves. She said that nothing she knew pegged him for a murderer, but she couldn\u2019t alibi him for any time period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just something that doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d Kat looked at Will. \u201cIf you\u2019re going down tomorrow, I am, too.\u201d</p><p>She talked to them about the icebreaker, the Egyptian, and how the captain had believed that Amun Mopat\u2019s scepter had been the source of his power. He might well have rammed the Jerry McGuen with his ship and suffered a bout of madness before setting out on another stormy night soon after\u2014and meeting his own demise.</p><p>\u201cStill...could anyone believe that today? That an object could be the source of incredible power?\u201d Kelsey asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cHey, could anyone believe that a mummy\u2014rotting for thousands of years\u2014could possibly attack them?\u201d Tyler countered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the scepter did have power, but not the way ancients Egyptians thought it did,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThat kind of crystal could catch sunlight. It could even have been used to start a fire on a bed of dried tinder. The thing is, Captain Ely accepted it. And I have to conclude that the scepter is what our killer considers the greatest treasure of the Jerry McGuen.\u201d She paused. \u201cPrecisely why, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>They discussed that and various other possibilities, then broke for the night.</p><p>Kat and Will didn\u2019t even pretend they were doing anything other than going to one room.</p><p>Kat wanted to spend a little time with the cat, but Bastet was no longer in either of their rooms. Before she could worry, Logan appeared at her door to tell her he\u2019d come to fetch the cat and her equipment earlier. Bastet seemed to bring Dirk Manning a measure of comfort, so he was letting the cat stay with him for now.</p><p>When Logan was gone, Kat grinned at Will. She didn\u2019t have to speak. They showered together, made love and lay still, talking quietly. The next day would be a long one.</p><p>Stewart Landry was being held in jail. They\u2019d found his UPD and his boat wet\u2014both had been out on the lake. It fit; someone had tampered with the remote that day. And mummy wrappings had been recovered from his car. All signs seemed to point to him. She should have rested well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>The dream began, but this time, when the wall of darkness turned into the face of Amun Mopat, he was real, and he spoke to her again.</p><p>Even in her dream she paused to wonder how an ancient Egyptian spoke English so well.

They\u2019ll eventually be returned to the Egyptian people.\u201d</p><p>The water was still coming.</p><p>\u201cI have tried. I have prayed,\u201d he said. \u201cMy scepter was nothing but a way to keep the laws of a good man, perhaps harsh at times, in a different world.\u201d</p> <p>The water poured over them.</p><p>Kat heard screams, and realized she was the one screaming.</p><p>Will was at her side, holding her, shushing her, whispering that she needed to breathe.</p><p>As she felt his warmth and his strength, she looked into his dark, concerned eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not over, Will,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cThe mummy told me.\u201d</p> <p>14</p><p>The next morning, Will and Kat went out to the dive site with Sean and Tyler. They met Earl, Alan and Bernie at the dock, where they boarded Captain Bob\u2019s boat.</p><p>The night Amanda was killed, Jon Hunt had been in such a state that he\u2019d been sedated for the past few days. He didn\u2019t ever want to go back to the wreck, he insisted. He didn\u2019t know what would happen now, but he wasn\u2019t going back down.</p><p>Bernie, too, seemed depressed. On the way out to the site he told Will, \u201cI love Alan. He\u2019s a great guy. He likes to film and preserve history. But all these people dying\u2014I can\u2019t take it. I think I need to go back to working on frivolous comedies, the kind full of silly fart jokes and sexual innuendoes.\u201d</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t sure what to say to him, so he just patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>At the site, they all went down together, including Jimmy Green. Will noted that Kat paused at the salon, but when she saw that he was waiting for her, she shook her head, eyes enormous behind her mask.</p><p>They dived deeper, and he joined Earl and Sean at the remote camera. Earl was maneuvering it, irritated as he showed Sean and Will the switch that had been jammed, freezing the image of fish swimming around the hold.</p><p>Will motioned to him to fix the switch and leave the camera there. Earl frowned, but then shrugged.</p> <p>Will realized that Bernie had taken over with one of the underwater cameras while Earl worked on the remote.</p><p>It might all be worthy of a documentary, although not the one that had originally been planned. He had a feeling that the documentary was no longer going to focus on ancient treasure.</p><p>Instead, it would focus on the lust for power.</p><p>Kat was hovering in the hold, barely moving, and staring at one of the doors. He swam toward her, and she pointed, but he wasn\u2019t sure what she saw.</p><p>They swam to the door. There, with the power of the water, the door had been solidly wedged shut. It seemed to fascinate Kat, however, so he worked at it. A moment later, Tyler and Sean came to help.</p><p>Between them, they shoved the door open against the force of the water and the rusted hinges. They could hear the creaking, even in the water, as it moved.</p><p>Tyler flashed his headlight into the hold room that was now open as Will gave a slight kick and eased himself in. At first, he saw nothing other than more crates, piled on top of each other.</p><p>Then he saw something that gleamed beneath the light.</p><p>He swam down to retrieve it. He turned the object over in his hands. It was no great artifact from the age of the pharaohs.</p><p>It was a dive knife, shiny and new.</p><p>They might have had difficulty with the door, but it had been opened before\u2014and then closed, jammed tight against the hold. He gestured at Tyler, and they returned to the others just as Jimmy Green tapped his wrist, indicating that they\u2019d run out of time.</p><p>They surfaced, using the same care they\u2019d taken with their descent.</p><p>Back on the boat, Will produced the knife and they all studied it. Even Captain Bob came over to look. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a local manufacturer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an Everstone.\u201d Everyone stared at him. \u201cEverstone Dive Accessories. They\u2019re just off Lake Shore Drive, near the park,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sell spear guns, compasses, suits, regulators\u2014you name it. They manufacture for the entire lake region. See\u2014there\u2019s their little insignia on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think we found out how Brady Laurie was \u2018helped\u2019 to drown,\u201d Kat murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get over there as soon as we\u2019re back,\u201d Will said in an equally quiet voice.</p><p>Later, as they were on their way to shore, they sat near the bow, where they had at least a little privacy.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She gave him a lopsided grin. \u201cOkay, even for us, this sounds crazy. Last night I told you about Amun Mopat being in my dream? Now, none of us is really sure we\u2019ve hit the mark with Stewart Landry, and that kind of worry could cause a dream\u2014or a nightmare. I know that. But today, when we were down there...I could swear I saw him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim? Amun Mopat, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s not some ugly wizened creature with an evil look on his face, the way he was portrayed in the movies. He was relatively young when he died, or young for us\u2014about forty. He has the face you see on his death mask. Intense dark eyes...\u201d She paused. \u201cA bit like yours, really, although he wears much more makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. I don\u2019t wear makeup at all!\u201d he protested.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know. You have a similar dark coloring\u2014but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not seeing you as his reincarnation or anything. I\u2019m seeing him, I think, because he wasn\u2019t evil, he didn\u2019t bring about death. He just found his place at the pharaoh\u2019s side, and tried to serve him and their people. Anyway, he was trying to make me see the door. That\u2019s why I knew there had to be something behind it.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cThis is one thing that makes me crazy. You know how in movies about aliens they\u2019re always familiar with English? Well, either that or they\u2019ve come down to kill us all. The thing is, I understand him when he speaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe language doesn\u2019t matter when we\u2019re dealing with the sixth sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But I feel that the real Amun Mopat has been hovering around my sixth sense from the beginning. Maybe I only saw him in nightmares because after our experience with the movie version of Amun Mopat, I thought he had to be purely evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel he\u2019s trying to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he will do so,\u201d Will told her, \u201cwhen he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>He rose; he was still in his swim trunks but he could hear his phone ringing from the helm, where he\u2019d left it.</p><p>\u201cLandry is out,\u201d Logan told him, not bothering with a greeting.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Sherry Bertelli. She came into the office, tearful and swearing that he couldn\u2019t have been out in his boat or using any kind of device yesterday morning. He was closeted with her, working on...work,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone else verify that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Landry swore he\u2019d been working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he give Sherry as his alibi before?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he thought his wife really didn\u2019t know. Maybe Landry thought it was better to be held on murder charges than to admit to a very angry wife that he was having an affair,\u201d Logan said. \u201cOr...maybe he was waiting for Sherry.\u201d</p><p>Will gritted his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s lying for him. She\u2019s sleeping with the guy, and he\u2019s probably paying her to lie for him. Logan, they found the mummy wrap in his car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe swears it was planted there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way back,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and told Kat the news.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re lying. They\u2019re obviously lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at the moment\u2014despite the mummy wrap\u2014everything we\u2019re looking at is circumstantial evidence. Remember, a district attorney, or a federal attorney, has to prove the accused party\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So far, it seems evident to us that Brady was drowned, and while we know that Amanda was poisoned, she could simply have eaten shellfish without being aware of it. And Austin Miller did die of heart failure. The only witness we have is going to sound crazy, because he says a mummy made him shoot himself, and he has Landry\u2019s wide-eyed mistress to back him up on that because she believes she saw a mummy at the Sand Diggers\u2019 maze. Which, of course, we believe, too\u2014though we don\u2019t think it was an actual mummy,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cContinuing to investigate.\u201d Will hesitated. \u201cAnd, probably, now that two of the center\u2019s experts are dead and the third is an emotional wreck, the board of directors will have to hire new experts and arrange for serious equipment to move forward with the salvage. Unless they choose to give up their bid to work the site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will do that,\u201d Kat said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cSo, we keep looking,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe just go back over all of it until we find out what we\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...we find the scepter.\u201d</p><p>At the hotel, the divers showered. Logan and Kelsey were at the police station reviewing all the information that had been gathered, and Jane was at the hospital, keeping watch over their gravely injured eyewitness.</p><p>Dirk Manning was with Kelsey and Logan, refusing to be left alone. He sat in their borrowed office, calmly reading the paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat had to wonder what would happen with Dirk if they were forced to give up their investigation before the case was completely solved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get started on the research,\u201d she told Will. \u201cI still think there\u2019s something from the past that we\u2019re missing. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to Everstone Dive Accessories to find out about our knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d love to know who bought it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was decided that Tyler would stay at the hotel, ready to move in any direction when needed, and Sean and Will would go to Everstone to learn who\u2019d purchased the knife.</p><p>Kat leafed through more of the journals and read about Austin Miller\u2019s grandfather\u2019s adventures, but she felt restless and couldn\u2019t concentrate.</p><p>Tyler was reading over the many computerized sheets matching up who\u2019d been where and who could\u2019ve had access to Egyptian knowledge or the Preservation Center when Kat looked up. \u201cI\u2019m spinning my wheels here. Let\u2019s go to Landry Salvage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Landry will welcome us?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cWe need something else if we want to bring him back in or even talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Kat smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go after Landry. I want to go after Sherry Bertelli.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying. She\u2019s lying through her teeth,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cGee, you don\u2019t believe they really spent the morning working\u2014or shacked up together?\u201d Tyler asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cCome on, what can they do? Kick us out? People rarely do, not when we go in with Federal shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll just tell Logan where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>They drove out to Landry Salvage with Logan\u2019s blessing. When they entered, Sherry, who was at her desk, saw them and immediately stiffened. \u201cMr. Landry is not available,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to speak to him. We came to speak to you,\u201d Kat told her.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re lying to protect your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you people are terrible!\u201d Sherry said. \u201cI\u2019m not lying. I wouldn\u2019t protect anyone involved in this. You forget, the mummy came after me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to call all the employees out here,\u201d Tyler said, leaning on the reception desk. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll find out if anyone can vouch for the fact that you two were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the staff is out now,\u201d Sherry said regally, tossing back her hair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave him alone? He\u2019s innocent. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s guilty, then, Sherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo after that Andy Simonton!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s a creep! And he\u2019s rude and obnoxious, too.\u201d</p> <p>As they spoke, Kat heard the sound of a floorboard creaking and turned to see a door opening.</p><p>Someone was sneaking out the back.</p><p>She drew her gun and hurried through the hallway, with Tyler close behind her. When they dashed out the door, they found themselves at the boathouse.</p><p>\u201cHey, careful!\u201d Tyler warned. \u201cWe don\u2019t have what we need on Landry.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded, but she clicked off the safety on her Glock. \u201cMr. Landry, if you\u2019re innocent, why are you running from us?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She moved past the speedboat called Lake Shark, and as she did, a bullet whistled by her.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d she shouted to Tyler.</p><p>She ducked low herself, trying to determine where the shooter was. Landry had to be hiding behind a cabin cruiser, she decided. She carefully made her way over there.</p><p>Another bullet whizzed by, but she was low and the aim was terrible. She fired back in the direction of the shot.</p><p>\u201cPut down your weapon! Throw it out here! Come out with your hands high!\u201d she ordered. \u201cCome on, Landry! You don\u2019t want to die here!\u201d</p><p>Another shot exploded. Kat bent low and inched around the speedboat.</p><p>Then she stopped.</p><p>\u201cKat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d she called to Tyler.</p><p>He ran over to her. Landry was on the ground, bleeding out from a hole in his forehead. Eyes wide open, he stared into space.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Tyler said, turning to her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hit him.\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked at her incredulously. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t shoot him...\u201d He paused, studying the scene. \u201cThere\u2019s his gun...beside his hand. He shot himself in the forehead rather than speak with us?\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head, scrutinizing Stewart Landry where he lay, eyes open, blood pooling beneath his head. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. The angle is impossible.\u201d She frowned. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot himself, Tyler. Someone else was out here with us. Someone who killed him and wanted it to look like we did\u2014or like he killed himself.\u201d</p><p>Will knew he didn\u2019t have the right to feel upset. Kat Sokolov was fine. She\u2019d done the necessary training, passed the tests, and she had the skill to handle a firearm.</p><p>He and Sean found out about Landry\u2019s death as they returned from the dive store, when Logan called to inform them. Instead of going back to the hotel, he and Sean drove straight to Landry\u2019s and the boathouse. Tyler and Kat were there, speaking with one of the local agents, giving their reports of the incident. Neither of them was suspected; the bullet that killed Landry had come from his own gun, a 57-Magnum. But a man was dead, and that meant paperwork. Lots of paperwork.</p><p>The body had yet to be picked up, and Dr. Cranston Randall had been called to the scene. Perhaps because of his seniority\u2014or perhaps because he\u2019d pissed off a superior\u2014it seemed they now had Dr. Randall on all the deaths associated with the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Will paced near the body. He couldn\u2019t help realizing that there\u2019d been a lot of bullets, and Kat could easily have been hit. He tried to reason with himself.</p><p>\u201cPoor bastard should have stayed in jail,\u201d Logan said. He was close to the activity, ready to step in if a team member needed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess he should have.\u201d Will sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re falling deeper and deeper into this quagmire.\u201d He stopped pacing and looked at Logan. \u201cI forgot to tell you\u2014Stewart Landry bought the knife we found in the Jerry McGuen. The salesman remembered him perfectly, even though he bought it about a year ago. Landry bought a lot of his dive gear there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now Landry is dead. He didn\u2019t kill himself and we\u2019re running out of suspects,\u201d Logan said. He nodded at Will. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a caged tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to explain,\u201d Logan told him, smiling. \u201cExcept that you\u2019ll have to get used to it. Usually, it won\u2019t be this bad. In this case, Kat seems to be the catalyst. Naturally when she\u2019s the one out there the most, you\u2019ll worry about her. It\u2019s not a bad thing\u2014it\u2019s instinct. But, trust me, if you want any kind of a future...well, you can\u2019t change what someone is, what she wants to be, and what she wants to do with her life. Kat isn\u2019t going to sit home, ever, while you take off to chase evil. She\u2019s not the delicate creature the he-man protects. Under our current circumstances, every member of the team will rally around her. She is the one in greatest danger on this case. So, yes, go ahead and worry. But if I were you, I\u2019d keep that worry to myself. She is what she is, and she\u2019d never understand that you\u2019d want to take risks that you feel she shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Will looked at Logan for a minute, recognizing the wisdom of his words. \u201cCan it work?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Logan smiled again. \u201cSo far, it works for me. I just keep remembering that we have one another\u2019s backs at all times. That helps. You never walk into danger if you don\u2019t have to, and when you do, you use your training. And you trust all your team members to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that trying to stop people from what they feel they need to do is a mistake. And,\u201d Will said, shrugging, \u201cI know that because I found where I was meant to be\u2014with the Krewe of Hunters. If you took that feeling from me, from anyone, a relationship would be doomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to live with sometimes,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBut...yeah.\u201d</p><p>However, when they finally gathered back at the hotel, Will asked as evenly as he could how Kat and Tyler had ended up at Landry Salvage when he\u2019d left them doing research at the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI was sure that Sherry Bertelli was lying to save her boss. I\u2019m still sure of it. Except that Landry is dead now,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou came out to talk to Sherry, but Stewart Landry wound up dead?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were at the reception desk, talking to Sherry, and saw someone slipping furtively out the back door\u2014Landry,\u201d Kat explained. \u201cWe followed to find out why he was running away. He started shooting. We started shooting. But someone else was out there. Someone who\u2019s growing careless, because the position of the bullet hole\u2014the angle of entry\u2014would have been almost impossible for him to achieve on his own. The idea was for us to find Landry and either believe we\u2019d killed him, which means the killer didn\u2019t pause to think about different weapons, bullets and shell casings, or that he killed himself. But a bullet dead center in the forehead isn\u2019t logical because of the way our thumbs and fingers fit on a trigger. There\u2019s always an angle.\u201d She hesitated, looking around at the Krewe. \u201cI\u2019ll go in when Dr. Randall does the autopsy tomorrow, but imagine the length of your hand and a gun. Imagine manipulating your fingers and taking straight aim. Also, if he\u2019d killed himself, there would\u2019ve been a darker stain of gunpowder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re back to square one,\u201d Jane said. \u201cEverything points to Landry. Except that now Landry is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Kelsey shook her head. \u201cWe have one survivor who swears a mummy tried to kill him. We have four dead. And two of them, Landry and Amanda, might have been involved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBack to the drawing board,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe also have the Sand Diggers, most of whom wouldn\u2019t have any inner knowledge of the Preservation Center. But would that matter if Amanda had been the liaison? With Landry dead, the next closest salvage company is Simonton\u2019s Sea Search\u2014whose owner attended lectures about the ship and Dr. McFarland\u2019s discussion on methods of death. Including methods that aren\u2019t easy to trace.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll get a search warrant for Simonton\u2019s home, boats, car and place of business,\u201d Logan said. He looked at Will. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we continue the dive, whether Jon Hunt\u2019s with us or not. Because the film crew\u2019s documentation of the wreck is all we have left. Everyone, get some rest now.\u201d</p><p>When they were together later that night, lying in bed, half-asleep and half-curled together, Will rose up on his elbow, stroking the sleek line of Kat\u2019s back.</p><p>She rolled over, touching his face. \u201cYou seem different,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cShaken,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWill, I know how to duck,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cI have to get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWill you always feel as if you have to protect me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to ignore that impulse, Kat, but will I try? Yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no different, really,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI feel the same about you. But I trust you not to take unnecessary or foolish risks. I know you can look after yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you not worried if you found out someone sent a hail of bullets my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hail of bullets,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt only takes one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes in the dim glow of a night-light and reached out for him, bringing his lips down to hers. The kiss began as something very simple, something to seal the words between them. It grew far more impassioned and he found himself wide-awake again, sliding along her body to caress her with his tongue. Soon they were breathless, writhing in each other\u2019s arms, and later lay spent and exhausted, ready for much-needed rest.</p> <p>In the morning, Kat answered a call from the morgue; as she\u2019d hoped, she was invited to join Dr. Randall for the autopsy.</p><p>Will left with Tyler and Sean, keeping his thoughts to himself.</p><p>He had to accept the fact that bullets could fly at either one of them, but for today he was glad she\u2019d be safe among the dead at the morgue. The wreck of the Jerry McGuen seemed like a very dangerous place to be.</p><p>\u201cSo many healthy people dead,\u201d Randall said as he and Kat worked on the corpse of Stewart Landry. \u201cWhat a beautiful heart. The man was fit, toned and other than having a brain that\u2019s just about turned to mush...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever shot him was only a couple of feet away,\u201d Kat said. She shook her head. \u201cWhy did he run from us? There was no reason for him to do that. He had his lawyer on the case, he\u2019d been released....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he believed that since you showed up at his place again, some other evidence had been found against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible,\u201d Kat agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see anyone else in the boathouse at all?\u201d Randall asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, just Landry. I stayed with the body while Tyler searched. When the police arrived, they searched, too, but...there were at least a dozen ways of getting into or out of the boathouse. You\u2019re on the water, there are entrances in front and on either side.... The killer could have been waiting in the boathouse or come in after we chased Landry.\u201d She paused, looking at the corpse. Landry wasn\u2019t speaking to her; she hadn\u2019t expected that he would.</p><p>There was nothing else Kat could do at the morgue, so she cleaned up and called Logan. He and Kelsey, she discovered, were with the police executing the search warrant on Andy Simonton\u2019s property. Sean and Tyler were diving with Will, and Jane was at the main branch of the public library with Dirk Manning, researching Captain Ely and the Egyptian.</p><p>Kat put a call through to Jane, telling her she\u2019d join them at the library. She found the two of them sitting side by side at library computers, and she drew up a chair at the third.</p><p>Jane passed her a piece of paper with a website address scrawled on it. \u201cTry this one. There\u2019s an article on Ely. His full name was Josiah Brentwood Ely. He joined the Union navy at the age of seventeen, near the end of the Civil War, and when the war was over, he did a lot of traveling\u2014including some time on ships coming and going from Egypt. He was a strange man who got involved in the spiritualist craze of the late-nineteenth century. And later, he became a fundamentalist Christian. There\u2019s more on him. I haven\u2019t gotten to all the links yet.\u201d</p><p>Kat thanked her and started on the computer herself. It wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d connected to the site Jane had suggested. One of the links took her to an article discussing \u201cthe strange case of Captain Josiah Brentwood Ely.\u201d Ely, according to the article, preached against dabbling in the occult, mysticism and other uses of \u201cmagic.\u201d He told friends, family and followers that he knew of objects, physical objects, in the world that were Satan\u2019s tools, capable of destroying entire civilizations.</p><p>He claimed that among those objects was the scepter that had belonged to the Egyptian priest Amun Mopat. Mopat had used it to countermand the plagues that hit Egypt, and to help the godless survive when Moses led his people to Israel. If it hadn\u2019t been for Mopat and his scepter, Ely said, the New Kingdom of Egypt would have dissolved, and the Egyptian people would have been free to become believers in the one true God.</p><p>\u201cPretty crazy, huh?\u201d Jane said to Kat.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it makes me even more convinced that whoever is doing this is after the scepter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone really believes the scepter could control the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard crazier beliefs or, at least, just as crazy,\u201d Kat said. She shut down the computer and stood. \u201cThe police are still at the Preservation Center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019s still under lock and key, and surrounded by crime scene tape,\u201d Jane said, turning off her computer and rising, too. \u201cI\u2019ll check in with Logan. We can go there if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the center?\u201d Dirk Manning asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to come with us,\u201d Kat replied.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stay here alone?\u201d</p><p>Kat smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you with one of Chicago\u2019s finest,\u201d she told him. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll let you turn on the siren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, young lady,\u201d Manning said. \u201cBut, yes! I will sit outside in a police car.\u201d</p><p>Just before going down to the wreck, Will called Kat.</p><p>The autopsy had been completed, he learned; they\u2019d discovered nothing they hadn\u2019t expected. But they\u2019d confirmed that Landry couldn\u2019t possibly have shot himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity the boathouse isn\u2019t a more confined space,\u201d Kat complained. \u201cWhoever was in there took off before we realized there was anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think that one or more of the dead had to be involved,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cYes. But the only one talking is Austin Miller, and Austin can\u2019t tell us anything except that he believes a mummy killed him. Anyway, Jane and I are going to the Preservation Center. I want to prowl around there some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are still plenty of cops out front. I\u2019ll be with Jane, and we\u2019ll be very careful,\u201d Kat promised.</p><p>They said goodbye, and Will told himself that this was her job. He reminded himself again that he couldn\u2019t stop her from doing it.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Tyler asked him.</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cKat and Jane are heading over to the Preservation Center. They\u2019re going to start tearing the place apart, since we haven\u2019t got anything to move forward with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll find something,\u201d Tyler said with a shrug.</p><p>Sean walked over to him. \u201cKat has worked with cops in law enforcement for a long time. She\u2019s smart as a whip and she knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame you for worrying, though,\u201d Tyler put in. \u201cWe always worry most about the key person on any case.\u201d He pointed at Will. \u201cThat\u2019s you as well as Kat, so stay close by when we dive, huh?\u201d</p><p>Will grinned. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they were down at the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>Will instinctively paused near the grand salon and looked in, trying to imagine what Kat had seen there. The ship at sea\u2014the realization that a storm was coming and worse....</p><p>They were about to be rammed by an icebreaker.</p><p>But the salon held nothing for him. He joined the film crew and Sean and Tyler in the hold. They were inspecting the darkened space behind the hold door, searching for anything that might tell them another diver had been down there. Will hovered in the main section, looking at the crates. He turned, hearing something, and was startled to see what appeared to be a wavy image in the water. He blinked.</p><p>There, before him, was the shape of a man.</p><p>An Egyptian with handsome sculpted features and a look of dire warning in his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak; he lifted his arms to Will and seemed to form a single word with soundless lips.</p><p>Danger.</p><p>The image was that of Amun Mopat.</p><p>And Will wasn\u2019t in danger.</p><p>Kat was.</p><p>He stared at the image, about to rise as quickly as possible to the surface, but the figure of Amun Mopat seemed to be gesturing at him, beckoning him to the wall. Wedged between one of the massive crates and the wall was a slender, narrow box, perhaps six feet long. As he struggled with it, he saw that Earl was filming his movements and Bernie was trying to attract the attention of the other men. A moment later, Tyler and Sean swam over to help him. Together, they managed to ease the heavier, larger crate far enough back to free the tarp-covered box. Will gestured at the surface and they agreed to go up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On board, they took off their dive gear and studied the box, now removed from its tarp. Alan King was the one who suddenly exclaimed, \u201cLook at the markings on it! There are lions and jackals and\u2014Will, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s got to be the scepter of Amun Mopat. The source of all his power!\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>Dirk Manning was happy to sit with the police.</p> <p>The Preservation Center, empty of life and sound, with the auxiliary lights burning, seemed an eerie place as they walked in.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s happening with the rest of the employees,\u201d Jane said. \u201cFrom what I understand, the place is actually governed by a board, but Amanda Channel was the boss. Brady and Jon reported to her, and there was a receptionist, the guards hired on by the center, and a bunch of interns coming and going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt any of the interns are eager to get back in. And Jon Hunt is a total basket case, so who knows if he\u2019s even returning to work?\u201d Kat responded.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we start?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Brady\u2019s office and I\u2019ll take Amanda\u2019s,\u201d Kat suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAnd at this point, we\u2019re looking for absolutely anything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>They parted ways in the hall, going to the separate offices. Kat began to rummage through Amanda\u2019s drawers. She was surprised and somewhat saddened to see that Amanda had stashed away a bag from a chic lingerie shop, together with gift wrap and an unsigned card that read \u201cTo my Best Friend.\u201d Kat didn\u2019t have time to consider the pathos of that. Because behind the bag, as if caught there when the drawer was opened and closed, she found a crumpled piece of paper. Kat straightened it. The paper had a phone number on it and a quick notation: \u201c7:30 p.m. S.B.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Kat studied it. She dialed the number, using her cell phone.</p><p>She had a suspicion as to whose number it might be, and she was right. Landry Salvage. Her call was answered by an automatic message that said the offices were closed.</p><p>Kat set the paper down and tapped her fingers on the desk.</p> <p>S.B.</p><p>Sherry Bertelli?</p><p>Landry was dead; he\u2019d been killed by someone who had known or guessed why she and Will wanted to talk to him again\u2014that they still had unanswered questions. Sherry had seen them run after Landry. She must have assumed they\u2019d discovered something else that would implicate Landry, and perhaps Landry had been ready to point the finger at her.</p><p>Sherry had access to everything that was Landry\u2019s. Landry was madly in love with her, and would have never questioned anything she did.</p><p>And now he was dead.</p><p>She automatically tried Will on her cell phone but, of course, he didn\u2019t answer. He was down on the dive to the Jerry McGuen.</p><p>She should call Logan, and she did that next. He answered on the first ring. \u201cWe need to pick up Sherry Bertelli,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe receptionist?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Logan, it makes sense. We didn\u2019t find anyone in the maze when she was supposedly attacked by the so-called mummy. I\u2019m positive she was the one who left that swath of wrapping. She was definitely dealing with someone at the Preservation Center\u2014I just found a note in Amanda\u2019s desk with her initials and a time on it. Plus Amanda was calling Landry Salvage constantly. I think that Amanda was involved with Sherry, maybe hoping to be her friend, and Sherry had access to this place because of her. She was with Landry when Dr. McFarland gave his lectures.\u201d She paused to take a breath. \u201cWe didn\u2019t look at her because we were too busy looking at Landry. And, frankly, she didn\u2019t seem bright enough to carry out this plan. Talk about stereotyping, huh?\u201d</p><p>She paused again; she thought she\u2019d heard movement down the hall, although she and Jane should have been the only ones there. Unless it was Jane, coming to talk to her about something she\u2019d found.</p><p>\u201cLogan, get someone to bring in Sherry Bertelli. We\u2019ll finish up here and meet you at the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll send out some officers to find her right now.\u201d</p><p>There was no further sound in the hallway. Kat stood up, about to head into Brady\u2019s office and find out what Jane was doing and share her suspicions. Her phone rang; she saw it was Will and answered quickly. \u201cHey! You\u2019re out of the water fast.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and she knew he was about to say that he was worried about her.</p><p>But he managed not to. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Will. I\u2019m with Jane at the center. Listen, I just talked to Logan. Will, I think Sherry Bertelli had something to do with all this. She was everywhere with Landry, and Landry would do anything in the world for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve got to bring her in\u2014now. She may realize that with Landry dead, she\u2019d be next on the suspect list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan has detectives going for her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hey, I\u2019ve got news for you, too. We found the scepter. Amun Mopat\u2019s all-powerful scepter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding! You sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlan is certain of it. He read what could still be seen on the box...but we didn\u2019t take it out. None of us knows a thing about preservation, but...anyway, we\u2019re coming in. I\u2019ll drive over and meet you and Jane at the center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they\u2019ve brought Sherry in, maybe you should be the one to interrogate her,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen her, talked with her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it should be you. A woman might react more honestly with another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s give them a chance to bring her in first,\u201d Kat murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, feeling hopeful. Sherry Bertelli. Right. Naturally, the men\u2014the CEOs of the salvage companies\u2014would be the initial suspects. And now that Landry was dead, anyone who might have known of her involvement was out of the way.</p><p>But what had she wanted? The scepter?</p><p>Kat stood, remembering how she\u2019d thought for a moment that she\u2019d heard Jane in the hallway. She stepped out. It was empty, just as it should have been. Then she walked down to Brady Laurie\u2019s office and looked inside.</p><p>Jane wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Kat decided not to shout out her name, even if that would more easily assuage her sudden fear. If her colleague was in any kind of danger, Kat could amplify that danger by spurring someone into action.</p><p>Silently, she moved along the hall in the other direction. She passed the empty conference room and stopped, drawing her Glock and clicking off the safety. She peered through the plastic sheets that led to the clean room.</p><p>Someone was there. Someone was standing over the sarcophagus of Amun Mopat.</p><p>While the film crew had been perplexed by Will\u2019s determination that they surface before their time was up, Tyler and Sean had been willing to follow his lead.</p><p>He apologized to the others as the boat motored in.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is getting to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I saw Amun Mopat down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you did see something\u2014a vision of the past,\u201d Tyler told him. \u201cWe now know that Captain Ely was a quack\u2014with a ship that had Amun Mopat for a figurehead\u2014and we\u2019re pretty sure that he used his ship, guided by that figurehead, to ram the Jerry McGuen.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cI thought he was warning me of danger. In fact, it almost seemed that he said the word. I was afraid he meant Kat was in danger, but I talked to her. She and Jane are at the center. She found some evidence there that incriminates Sherry Bertelli.\u201d</p><p>He explained the situation while they completed the return trip to the dock. He was still puzzled. \u201cI see where we might have missed something with Sherry. She could definitely be part of it. But whoever killed Brady Laurie was strong\u2014probably very strong. Sherry may be fit, but judging by her size, I don\u2019t see how she could have had the strength to kill Brady. And the guard, Abel Leary\u2014he struggled with his attacker. With the \u2018mummy.\u2019 Maybe they were in it together. Maybe Sherry took care of Amanda and managed to befriend her for access to the Preservation Center, and Landry was the muscle behind it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a theory,\u201d Tyler said slowly, \u201cand maybe her involvement was with\u2014and because of\u2014Stewart Landry. Maybe he was the one who wanted to destroy the center\u2019s involvement in hopes of being next on the list of companies to salvage the wreck. Or maybe he wanted a specific object that was on the ship. Sherry just did what he asked to her to, but when it looked like he might put the blame on her, she felt she had to kill him. Amanda was already dead, so if everything pointed to Landry, then she\u2019d be an innocent bystander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so Sherry befriended Amanda,\u201d Will said. \u201cShe then had access to the center, and she might have met with Amanda before she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case,\u201d Sean continued, \u201cshe could have somehow gotten Amanda to eat the shellfish. She must\u2019ve known Amanda was allergic but she could have slipped it into something else Amanda was eating. Of course, they\u2019d have had to get to the museum really fast after their meal\u2014that kind of poison can act quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they met at the Preservation Center for dinner, and when Amanda was dead and the guard taken of, she took whatever plates she\u2019d used and escaped out the back, the same way she and Amanda both entered,\u201d Will said.</p><p>When they arrived at the dock, Will decided he\u2019d go straight to the center. Sean and Tyler would make their way to the police station and help out if they discovered that Sherry Bertelli hadn\u2019t been brought in yet.</p><p>As he drove, Will kept thinking about Sherry Bertelli, Stewart Landry and the strange night they\u2019d spent with the Egyptian Sand Diggers at the memorial service, when Sherry had been screaming in the maze. Landry had seemed truly devastated that something might have happened to his mistress. Was he really that good an actor?</p><p>Someone other than the petite woman had been involved. And someone other than the very slight Amanda Channel, as well.</p><p>Landry. That was where it all pointed.</p><p>Except for that one night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So who else? Simonton? The police had spent the morning searching his home and office, boats, car. Will had heard nothing back. Simonton was big; he had the necessary strength. If not Simonton, then...Dirk Manning? No. Manning was in decent shape for his age, but he was in his late seventies. Not as old as Austin Miller, but not young enough to take down a guard in the prime of life.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to him that many people could be excellent actors. And there\u2019d been a great deal of knowledge about the ship and Egyptology associated with recent events....</p><p>He stepped on the gas, anxious to reach the center.</p> <p>When he got to the entrance, he saw that a police car was stationed in front, just as it was supposed to be. He should have felt at ease.</p><p>But as he got out of his car and approached the entrance, he felt the chill of fear. Before going in, he called Logan\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, please,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been missing one suspect all along.\u201d</p> <p>Kat saw the figure bending over the sarcophagus of Amun Mopat that lay on the steel table. At first it was impossible to tell who it was; the person was dressed in a bunny suit, gloves, booties, hair cover and mask.</p><p>After everything that had gone on here, Kat figured a clean suit was probably pointless and she wasn\u2019t going to bother with one herself. Fingers curled around her Glock, she moved through the different layers of plastic, walking into the clean room.</p><p>The figure looked up at her. She recognized Jon Hunt.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. Then he frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing here without a suit on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, period?\u201d Kat asked him.</p><p>\u201cWorking. I work here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cJon, I thought you were taking time off. You were a mess after we found Amanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, yes. But work is good therapy. And when I was at home, I remembered that we never lifted the mask\u2014or examined the mummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, Amanda was found dead in the sarcophagus. It\u2019s still considered evidence,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Jon walked around the sarcophagus, looking down at the death mask and the mummy. He seemed especially intrigued. She couldn\u2019t see what had so thoroughly attracted his attention, but he seemed protective.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The scepter is here somewhere. Everything hinges on the scepter. There\u2019s some kind of power in the crystal head. Men bowed down before the priest because of the scepter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey bowed down before him because otherwise he could have them killed,\u201d Kat said. \u201cLook, it was the way they governed. Jon, I\u2019m shocked that you\u2014a scientist\u2014can put that kind of belief in an object. Anyway, you\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d Kat told him. \u201cThe place is closed until the deaths are solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can be here, but you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to find the scepter. I will find the scepter.\u201d</p><p>The deaths of his colleagues seem to have unhinged him, Kat thought.</p> <p>\u201cJon, the scepter isn\u2019t in the sarcophagus with the mummy. The divers found it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, spinning to face her.</p><p>\u201cI just talked to Agent Chan. He and two other agents were down with the film crew. They believe they\u2019ve brought up the scepter.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in horror. \u201cNo!\u201d he said.</p><p>She holstered her Glock, walking over to him. \u201cJon, you need to go home. You need to get some rest. You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off; she had reached the sarcophagus and she saw what had attracted his interest.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>Jane lay in the sarcophagus just as Amanda had, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>Kat sprang into motion, terrified that she wouldn\u2019t find her friend\u2019s pulse, but when she pressed her fingers to Jane\u2019s throat, she felt the beat of her heart. She stared at Jon. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name\u2014help me! Help me get her out of here!\u201d</p><p>Jon stepped back. Kat ignored him and reached in for Jane, trying to discern what had made her lose consciousness. She had to get an ambulance quickly. Watching Jon, she searched for her cell phone, but she\u2019d left it on the desk in Amanda\u2019s office.</p><p>She struggled with Jane\u2019s body, getting her out of the sarcophagus and onto the floor, then stood, realizing that Jon\u2019s mind was far gone. She leveled the gun on him. \u201cJon, move away from Jane and the sarcophagus. Give me your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her, a puzzled expression on his face. She shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill Brady Laurie, did you? It couldn\u2019t have been you or Amanda, because you were the ones who were supposed to discover him. But, Jon, you did dress up as a mummy, didn\u2019t you? You caused Austin Miller\u2019s heart attack, and you caused the guard to shoot himself. Did you kill Amanda? Or did Sherry Bertelli do it?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve read everything there is, and if you know the proper rites and incantations and you possess the scepter, you can rule the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your cell phone,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Jon stood there smiling at her. She realized that he was looking past her, and there was someone else with them.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cSherry, welcome to this little truth-telling get-together,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s over. The police are coming for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d Sherry screamed. \u201cHow the hell\u2014never mind. Drop the gun. Do it now, or I\u2019ll shoot you in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shoot Jon, you know,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Sherry told her.</p><p>\u201cSherry!\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, quit whining, will you?\u201d Sherry snapped. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to shoot you in cold blood. You\u2019re not even armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be careful, Sherry. If I\u2019m in danger, I just might shoot Jon. And don\u2019t forget\u2014you\u2019ve already turned him into a killer. He could turn on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. I\u2019m the killer,\u201d Sherry said. Her voice was like ice. \u201cI watched people. I studied people. I knew their habits and schedules. I climbed up the wall and walked right through those open doors and into his office and gave that old bastard Austin Miller the scare of his life. When he went to get his pills, I smacked them right out of his hand. Actually, I didn\u2019t mean to lose any mummy wrapping there, but that happened when I was climbing back over the wall\u2014when I dropped that statue. I was going to plant it in Landry\u2019s office...oh, well. I did mean to lose some of the mummy wrapping when you two were in the hotel that night, because I wanted to warn you that you\u2019d be dead real fast if you messed around with Laurie\u2019s death. Do you know how easy it is to get false identification and dress up as someone else and check into a hotel? Of course, I wanted to do more.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t totally suck as an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, thanks. What about Brady Laurie? He did die from drowning. He was just helped. But that wasn\u2019t you, was it? You\u2019re not that good a diver,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good enough,\u201d Sherry insisted. \u201cBut, no. Landry was so easy to manipulate. He wanted the salvage rights on that dive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do I understand this correctly? Landry came at Brady with some kind of weapon. He scared him half to death, then held Brady, tore his regulator from him and kept him down there until he drowned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cI was waiting for him on the boat. I\u2019d already become friends with Amanda. Good friends. The best of friends. She called me for everything. What a loser. She didn\u2019t have any real friends, big surprise, and, of course, she was so obnoxious it sure could look like she was guilty of everything. Ah, well, information. That\u2019s what I got from Amanda. Silly, naive, pathetic woman! She thought everyone just loved history! She fell for everything I said. Obviously. In case you were wondering, we ate here, and I dropped lobster pieces into her salad. I knew she\u2019d have a severe reaction. Happened almost immediately. And no one knew she\u2019d been with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, someone out there saw you. Someone will always see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was in disguise,\u201d Sherry told her. \u201cI told Amanda I liked to dress up\u2014that I\u2019d be on stage one day. She totally believed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery move you make, you give something away. You leave something behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, prove it. Oh! You aren\u2019t doing very well with that, are you?\u201d Sherry taunted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, you pulled all those histrionics at the Sand Diggers\u2019 mansion to look like an innocent woman in terror of the mummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did look like a terrified victim, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Sherry asked, preening a bit. \u201cMaybe I should go on stage. I was really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to those who enjoy overacting.\u201d Kat rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha. Very clever. Now drop the gun or I\u2019ll shoot you,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cPut it down and kick it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I drop the gun, Sherry, you\u2019ll shoot me in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how about if I shoot your friend in the heart?\u201d</p><p>Kat could hear her coming closer. She spun around, aiming at her. \u201cSo, which of us is the better shot?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve had extensive training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t aim for you. I\u2019ll aim for concussion girl on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. The cops are onto you, Sherry,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Sherry stared at her, still pretending absolute assurance. But she hesitated; she had to know that Kat had training and that she was a crack shot.</p><p>Kat heard Jon move behind her just a second too late. Something suddenly hit her in the head. Turning slightly before the lights seemed to go out, she saw that Jon had wrenched the precious death mask from the mummy.</p><p>And that he had slammed it over her head.</p><p>She managed to squeeze the trigger on her Glock as she went down, and she thought she heard Sherry cry out in rage and pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will got to the center and saw where Jane and Kat had slit the crime scene tape to slip through to the door. When he opened it, he stood still, listening.</p><p>He walked as silently as he could, looking into the conference room and then the offices, his sense of alarm growing with every footstep.</p><p>He could find no one.</p> <p>He turned and hurried back across the entry toward the climate-controlled room. Squinting through the ribbons of plastic, he saw nothing except for the sarcophagus. It lay on the steel table, as it always had, and the larger outer sarcophagus hadn\u2019t moved, either.</p><p>He started to walk by, but then waited. He made his way through the layers of plastic and found himself striding toward the sarcophagus. His heart seemed to rise in his chest as he did.</p><p>He almost tripped when he reached the other side of the table.</p><p>The mummy of Amun Mopat lay on the floor\u2014on top of Jane Everett.</p><p>In the sarcophagus itself lay Kat.</p> <p>He began to reach in for her, desperate for her to be alive. The sound of gunfire startled him; he heard and felt the thunk of bullets as they hit the wood of the sarcophagus. He ducked down low, skittering around to the other side of the table. For a split second, he was distracted. The way the mummy had fallen, it was almost as if the wrapped eyes were looking right at him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell the direction of the gunfire, except that it seemed to come from the far side of the climate-controlled room, from behind other layers of plastic. He noticed then that there was a trail of blood.</p><p>And Kat\u2019s Glock lay on the floor.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten a shot off! He stared at the plastic, searching for movement.</p><p>\u201cI see you,\u201d he said. \u201cI see you through the eyes of Amun Mopat. I have held the scepter, and it has given me visions you cannot imagine.\u201d</p><p>He heard a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s got the scepter!\u201d</p> <p>The plastic moved.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot! He doesn\u2019t have the scepter. We saw him come in.\u201d</p><p>Another shot shattered the silence, this bullet burying itself in the sarcophagus, as well.</p><p>Will rose and shot back; he didn\u2019t dare do anything else. He didn\u2019t know if the women were alive or dead. If alive, they needed help. He didn\u2019t dare think about the way Kat lay, like the dead....</p><p>There was a scream of pain. Suddenly, the plastic went flying outward. Sherry Bertelli, her face set in a mask of hatred, came at him, gun blazing. Will ducked and then straightened to return her fire, emptying his cartridge into the woman who came after him so hell-bent on murder.</p><p>He caught Sherry dead center in the chest. Still, she whirled as she went down, screaming all the while, more in rage, it seemed, than in pain.</p><p>Before he could reload, he heard Jon Hunt screeching in fury. He turned; the man had gotten his hands on Sherry\u2019s cast-aside pistol and was rising to one knee to shoot.</p><p>He heard something...from the sarcophagus. It was Kat, struggling to rise.</p> <p>She gripped the edge, crying out, \u201cJon! Turn around. He\u2019s here, do you see him? Amun Mopat is here, and he\u2019s furious with you. He wasn\u2019t evil, he wasn\u2019t evil at all. He never used his scepter for evil purposes. He used it to pray that the rains would come and that people would live.\u201d</p><p>Jon Hunt just stared at her. Then, slowly, he turned. He stared at the figure Kat began to describe.</p><p>\u201cHe was young by our standards, Jon. He wasn\u2019t even forty when he died. He spent his life trying to feed those who had nothing, and trying to guide the pharaoh to rule justly. He urged others to help the lepers and the sick and the lame. He never wielded that scepter in cruelty. Can you see him, Jon? He\u2019s walking toward you and he\u2019s so angry. He\u2019s furious with you!\u201d</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t sure if Jon saw what he saw, or if Kat\u2019s description created the illusion, or if the ghost of Amun Mopat, historically wronged, had stepped through the veil between life and death to save him and Kat. He saw the priest, tall and straight, slim and regal, walking toward Jon. He saw him reach for the man\u2014and send him sliding across the slick tile of the floor.</p><p>Will jammed a new cartridge into his service Glock. He rose and walked over to Jon, pulling the gun from his hand. He\u2019d never realized until he\u2019d seen him in a rage just how powerful Jon might have been.</p><p>He hunkered down beside him. \u201cThe cops will be on their way soon, Jon. Now, I\u2019m going to go tend to my friends. If I were you, I\u2019d stay there. I\u2019d stay very still. Because do you know what\u2019s real? The human soul\u2019s quest for justice. You thought you could have all the power you ever hoped for in your strange, sick mind. I\u2019m pretty sure Sherry was in it for the money. That doesn\u2019t matter anymore. What does matter is that if you move, Amun Mopat will strangle the life out of you, slowly and with malice.\u201d He gritted his teeth and managed a shrug. \u201cAnd if not, may you rest in a urine-stained mental ward for the rest of your life!\u201d Taking out his phone with one hand, he dialed 9-1-1, his eyes still on Jon Hunt. It seemed that he\u2019d hardly hung up when the police came rushing in and he knew they must have heard the shots.</p><p>He and Kat, they were going to be all right. Jane, too.</p><p>He rose, jerking the cartridge from Sherry\u2019s gun and breaking it on his knee, then throwing the gun to a far corner of the room.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it; he rushed to Kat first. He helped her crawl from the sarcophagus and, before he could let her go to aid Jane, he held her for a second. \u201cYou had my back,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you had mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cConcussion,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needs an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit me with the death mask. It wasn\u2019t really hard enough to do much damage,\u201d she told him. She pulled away, kneeling by Jane. Even as she did, Jane groaned. Her eyes began to flutter open and, in a minute, she was looking at Kat.</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIt\u2019s really over.\u201d</p><p>Will found that he was studying the mummy that lay discarded and broken on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said quietly. He could hear sirens blaring through the streets of Chicago. He thought they might sleep well that night, neither of them troubled by visions or dreams.</p><p>\u201cCreepy, creepy, really creepy!\u201d Kelsey said. She still shuddered when she heard Kat talk about having been laid out in the sarcophagus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a box, nothing more,\u201d Kat pointed out. She pulled a loose thread off the robe that Kelsey was wearing. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI should run around in Egyptian robes every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice,\u201d Kat told her. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it for Dirk Manning. Come on, he can\u2019t live with us forever, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everyone prepared?\u201d Dirk Manning came into the parlor area of the Egyptian Sand Diggers\u2019 mansion. He seemed rested and relaxed for the first time in weeks. \u201cTonight, we set free a soul so that it may soar with the wind and ride the sun in the heavens,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everyone will follow me.... Those of you who will speak as the Egyptian gods and goddesses, please be ready.\u201d</p><p>They walked through the maze again.</p><p>Samantha was ahead of Kat in the procession; Kat had the feeling that she\u2019d be taking on a bigger role with the society. She read her part in a clear, dramatic voice.</p><p>Others read, too, including Will. He winked at her as she recited her part. Kelsey, drafted into the ceremony at the last minute, did well, too.</p><p>\u201cWe, the Egyptian Sand Diggers of Chicago, wish peace and comfort to a man much maligned by history. A man who seems to have proven to all of us that he had nothing but a devout desire to help others. Around him, there were men, misled or filled with greed, who sought to steal his riches\u2014riches they thought meant power, but his power was really the strength of his soul. Tonight, we swear to do the research to right his reputation in history. And we pray that his soul will find the heaven he has always sought.\u201d</p><p>Will came to stand by Kat, placing his arm around her. \u201cLook!\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt that my imagination?\u201d</p><p>Kat squinted, looking past the altar and the obelisk, just behind Dirk Manning.</p><p>It seemed that Amun Mopat was indeed there, watching with approval. And at his side was Austin Miller. As if he was a guide, trying to explain the modern world to the ghost who\u2019d been silent for centuries. Whose body had lain at the bottom of the lake for all these years.</p><p>Dirk Manning lit an incense burner, and smoke and scent rose into the air.</p><p>The Egyptian and the elderly American seemed to disappear in the smoke.</p><p>If they\u2019d ever really been there...</p><p>They stayed and enjoyed the after-party at the Sand Diggers\u2019 manor for a while, but then Will and Kat slipped out early.</p><p>They had tickets to Second City, and then planned to enjoy some really great jazz.</p><p>The show was hilarious, and they were treated to an hour of the wonderful music for which the city had long been famed.</p><p>They drove back along the lake and stopped to look out on the water. \u201cOne day we\u2019ll come back and dive the wreck,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>He stood behind her, wrapping her in his arms. \u201cHmm, one day. But Simonton\u2019s Sea Search is now going to work with the new experts brought in by the Preservation Center\u2019s board. The filming will continue. But since the research and salvage will be managed by Andy, we may not be welcome for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he was that angry. In fact, he seemed fine when I spoke to him a couple of days ago.\u201d Kat reached up to stroke his face. \u201cThey were all in on it\u2014Amanda, Jon, Landry and Sherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d Will nodded. \u201cJon was the least involved, I think\u2014but, of course, he was the craziest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObsessed,\u201d Kat agreed. \u201cTo the point of insanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Amanda was kind of a patsy. She wanted a real friendship\u2014and she wanted glory. Her relationship with Sherry seemed to be something she needed in a sad kind of way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, Sherry just wanted money. From what she said that night, I believe she\u2019d watched what was going on for a long time\u2014and that she was the \u2018brains\u2019 behind the operation, if that\u2019s the right word. I\u2019m sure Landry thought he was in charge. Sherry might have been a better actress than I gave her credit for,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI agree, Sherry was in it for the money\u2014and she played sweet, innocent and dumb extremely well. I think she learned a bit about high living when she went places with Landry, and that meant she needed cash to support the lifestyle she aspired to. Landry wasn\u2019t going to divorce his wife and Sherry wasn\u2019t going to play second fiddle forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Landry wanted the rights to dive the wreck,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIt all worked for them\u2014for a while.\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cMurder does make for the strangest associations, not to mention bedfellows!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMurder and greed,\u201d Will added. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they actually wanted anyone to die. What they wanted was the Jerry McGuen. I just don\u2019t think they cared who had to die so they could get what they were after. Brady Laurie was so passionate about the ship and his work\u2014he\u2019s really the one who was in the way. Knowing the truth now, it\u2019s easy to see how they created their plan. Amanda and Jon provided what was needed on the research end. Landry killed Brady, while Sherry played the mummy every time\u2014and poisoned Amanda when she was afraid Amanda might start breaking because of our investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Sherry told me, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, she\u2019s the one who makes me shiver the most. She was stone-cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Kat agreed. \u201cShe shot her lover without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad, truly sad. So many dead...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd, remarkably, it\u2019s over,\u201d Will said. \u201cBastet has a home with Dirk now. The research work will go on, and so will the documentary. There\u2019ll be pieces to pick up, and some people will still insist it was the curse written on Amun Mopat\u2019s tomb. In a way it was\u2014a curse carried out through the living.</p><p>\u201cEnough of that for tonight...\u201d He swung Kat around to face him. \u201cYou know what we haven\u2019t done yet? The Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum. The Field Museum, which has a really good Egyptian display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing me, and I know it! But guess what? Tomorrow, I think we should do a whirlwind shopping spree down Michigan Avenue, visit the Shedd Aquarium\u2014and, okay, the Field Museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually acquired a fondness for mummies!\u201d she told him.</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cAnd tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the hotel. I\u2019ve actually acquired quite a fondness for you, as well,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI thought I might show you just how fond I am.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up. \u201cNice. Because I\u2019ve acquired an adoration for you.\u201d He grew serious. \u201cYou do know I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd you do know we\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, turning away.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, come on, then! Let\u2019s start working it out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and followed him.</p><p>The breeze was warm. The lake was sparkling like a sea of diamonds beneath the moon and the stars.</p> <p>God, she loved Chicago! </p> </body></html>"]
