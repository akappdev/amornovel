Rich Manning, who was sitting across the kitchen table from her, held out a fresh one. \u201cI trusted Tony, and he\u2019s nothing more than a...jerk.\u201d</p><p>She yanked the tissue from Rich\u2019s hand and ingloriously blew her nose. That tissue took the same path as the previous one. \u201cI feel like the biggest fool who ever lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony who\u2019s the fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right. Then why am I the one sitting here crying my eyes out?\u201d Jamie really didn\u2019t expect him to answer. Calling Rich at an ungodly hour, sobbing out her tale of woe, wasn\u2019t the most considerate thing she\u2019d ever done, but she had to talk to someone and he was the first person who\u2019d come to mind.</p><p>He was the kind of friend she felt comfortable calling in the middle of the night. The kind of friend who\u2019d immediately drive over if she needed sympathy or consolation. They\u2019d been close ever since they\u2019d worked together on their yearbook in high school. Although they didn\u2019t see each other often, Jamie had always felt their relationship was special.</p><p>\u201cAt least crying\u2019s better than getting drunk, which is what I did when I found out Pamela was cheating on me,\u201d Rich admitted with a wry twist of his mouth. He got up and poured them each another cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her since, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I have. I wouldn\u2019t want her to think I was jealous.\u201d</p> <p>Despite everything, Jamie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re still dating her? Even after you learned she was seeing another guy behind your back?\u201d</p><p>Rich shrugged carelessly, as though the entire situation was of little consequence, something Jamie knew not to be the case. Although he\u2019d been devastated, he\u2019d worn a nonchalant facade. He might\u2019ve fooled everyone else, but not Jamie. His flippant attitude couldn\u2019t camouflage the pain.</p><p>\u201cI took her to a movie a couple of times,\u201d Rich continued. \u201cI played it cool. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, it was over the minute I heard about that other guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over with me and Tony, too,\u201d Jamie murmured. Just saying the words produced a painful tightening in her chest. She was truly in love with Tony and had been for nearly a year. They\u2019d often talked about getting married and raising a family together. Jamie wanted children so badly. The weekend before, they\u2019d gone shopping for engagement rings. Her mother, who was crazy about him, had been thrilled. Since Jamie was over thirty her mom tended to worry about her marriage prospects, but even she said that waiting for a man like Tony Sanchez had been time well spent. Sharing the bad news with her widowed mother had been almost as upsetting as learning about the betrayal itself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure the other woman\u2019s baby is his?\u201d Rich asked, reaching for her hand. \u201cShe could be stirring up trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t bother to deny it.\u201d In the beginning, Jamie had hoped the woman was lying. She\u2019d searched Tony\u2019s face, praying it was all some malicious joke. His beautiful dark eyes had turned defensive, but gradually the regret, the doubt, had shown, and he\u2019d slid his gaze away from hers. It had been a mistake, he\u2019d told her, a momentary slip in judgment. A one-night fling that meant nothing. He felt terrible about it and promised nothing like this would ever happen again.</p> <p>Tony was cheating on her before they were even married, and Jamie didn\u2019t need a crystal ball to know that pattern would almost certainly continue.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time,\u201d she admitted, biting her lower lip to control the trembling. \u201cMargie, in New Accounts, mentioned seeing Tony with a blonde a month or so ago. He\u2019d told me he was out of town and I ... I was sure it was just a case of mistaken identity. I should\u2019ve known then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself,\u201d Rich said, bending to brush a wisp of dark brown hair from her temple. \u201cThere were plenty of signs that Pamela was playing me for a fool, too, but I was so taken with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBust line. Which was always your primary interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why I never dated you,\u201d he countered, grinning.</p><p>Jamie smiled. The joke was an old one between them. When they\u2019d first been assigned to work together on the yearbook, Rich had been a popular football player and she\u2019d been a nondescript bookworm. They\u2019d clashed constantly. One day, after a particularly nasty confrontation, she\u2019d shouted that if she had a bigger bust, he might actually listen to her. Rich had gone speechless, then he\u2019d started to laugh. The laughter had broken the ice between them and they\u2019d been friends ever since. The best of friends.</p><p>\u201cI hear there\u2019s help in the form of surgery,\u201d he teased, leveling his gaze at her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly.\u201d Her breasts weren\u2019t that small, but it was comfortable and easy to fall into their old banter. Focusing on something other than what a mistake Tony had turned out to be provided her with a good\u2014if momentary\u2014distraction. She\u2019d wasted an entire year of her life on him. An entire year!</p> <p>Rich reached for his coffee, then leaned back in the chair and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if anyone\u2019s faithful anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the last person you should be asking that,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her coffee. She didn\u2019t blame Rich for having doubts. Relationships all around her seemed to be failing. Friends, whose marriages had appeared strong and secure, were divorcing. At work affairs were rampant. Casual sex. Jamie was sick of it all.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mark Brooks cheated on my sister Taylor, she took that teaching position in another state,\u201d Rich went on to say. \u201cYou know, I never much liked Mark. From the first I felt there was something off about him. I wish I\u2019d spoken to Taylor about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt so bad for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole family was worried. Then she moved to the backwoods of Montana and a few months later, she married Russ Palmer. Everyone was sure she\u2019d made a terrible mistake, marrying a cowpoke on the rebound, but I\u2019ve never seen her happier. And now Christy\u2019s married to Cody Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy\u2019s married to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Custer County sheriff. She\u2019s living in Montana, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought she was engaged to James Wilkens! Good grief, I was at her engagement party just a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, but James is out of the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy dumped James?\u201d It was hard to believe. Jamie had assumed they were perfect for each other. They\u2019d acted like the ideal couple at the engagement party, sipping champagne and discussing wedding dates with their families.</p><p>Rich chuckled. \u201cIf you\u2019re surprised by that, wait until you hear this. While Christy was still engaged to James, she was married to Cody.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was shocked. She didn\u2019t know Rich\u2019s youngest sister well, but she would never have imagined Christy doing anything so underhanded. \u201cI am surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were mitigating circumstances and it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, but Christy is yet another example of how fickle women can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen?\u201d Jamie protested. \u201cMen are notoriously untrustworthy\u2014they always have been.\u201d</p><p>It looked as though Rich wanted to argue. He straightened and opened his mouth, then shook his head. Sighing, he drank the last of his coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to think commitment means nothing these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to be so cynical, but I agree.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Rich carried his mug to the kitchen sink. \u201cAre you going to be able to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, although she wasn\u2019t convinced. However, she\u2019d taken enough of Rich\u2019s time for one night and didn\u2019t want to keep him any longer.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he whispered softly.</p><p>Jamie smiled and got up, too. He slipped his arms around her and she laid her cheek against his shoulder. It felt good to be held. Rich\u2019s comfort was that of a loving friend, someone who truly cared about her without the complications of romance or male-female dynamics.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. But she hadn\u2019t been confident of that until she\u2019d talked to Rich. How fortunate she was to have him as her friend. \u201cWe both will,\u201d she added.</p><p>A sigh rumbled through Rich\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you wish life could be as simple now as it was in high school?\u201d</p><p>That remark gave Jamie pause. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally said, then laughed. \u201cI was so shy back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShy?\u201d Rich argued, releasing her enough to cast her a challenging look. \u201cYou were a lot of things, Jamie Warren, but shy wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you had been, then you might\u2019ve done things my way without so much arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still upset that I didn\u2019t use your picture on the sports page, aren\u2019t you? We\u2019ve been out of high school for thirteen years and you haven\u2019t forgiven me for using that shot of Josh McGinnes instead.\u201d</p><p>Rich chuckled. \u201cI could be upset, but I\u2019m willing to let bygones be bygones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d She led him to the door of her condo. \u201cSeriously, though, I really am grateful you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The worst of it was over. She would pick up the pieces of her life and start again, a little less trusting and a whole lot more wary.</p><p>Two months later, Rich was sitting in his office at Boeing when the image of Jamie Warren\u2019s tear-streaked face drifted into his mind. It was as if their conversation had taken place just the night before\u2014even though he\u2019d talked to her two or three times over the holidays, and she\u2019d sounded good. Cheerful, in fact. Certainly in better spirits than he\u2019d been himself.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t made any attempt to fool him. Tony had hurt her badly. From what she\u2019d said, he\u2019d made several attempts to resume their engagement, but she\u2019d rejected the idea in no uncertain terms. It was plain to Rich that Tony Sanchez didn\u2019t really know Jamie Warren. The woman was stubborn enough to impress a mule. Once she made up her mind, that was it. Oh, she appeared docile and easygoing, but Rich had collided with that stubborn streak of hers a time or two and come away battered and bruised.</p><p>It bothered Rich that Jamie had never married. She\u2019d always loved children, and he\u2019d fully expected her to have a passel of kids by now.</p><p>Most men, he realized, passed Jamie over without a second glance. That bothered him even more.</p><p>The problem, not that he\u2019d call it a problem, was that she didn\u2019t possess the looks of a beauty queen. She wasn\u2019t plain, nor was she unappealing. She was just\u2014he hated to admit it\u2014ordinary. Generally, there was one thing or other that stood out in a woman. A flawless face. Cascades of shining hair, blond or gold or black... Jamie\u2019s wasn\u2019t blond and it wasn\u2019t brunette but somewhere in between. And it wasn\u2019t long, but it wasn\u2019t short either. Some women had eyes that could pierce a man\u2019s soul. Jamie had brown eyes. Regular brown eyes. Not dark or seductive or anything else, just brown eyes. Nice, but average. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was about five-five, and a little on the thin side. Giving the matter some consideration, Rich noted that there didn\u2019t seem to be any distinguishing curves on her. Not her hips, and certainly not her breasts. He could be mistaken of course, since he hadn\u2019t really looked at her that way.... To be honest, he\u2019d never looked at her in any way other than as a friend.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a body that would stop traffic. The thing was, a woman could have an ordinary face, but if she had curves, men fell all over themselves. Rich hated to admit something so derogatory about his fellow men, but he felt it was true.</p><p>What few took the time to see was Jamie\u2019s warm heart and generous spirit. He\u2019d never known a more giving woman. What she\u2019d said about being shy was true, even though he\u2019d denied it. Yet she had spunk and she had spirit. Enough to stand up to him, which was no easy thing.</p><p>Pushing against the edge of his desk, Rich rolled back his chair and stood up. He headed down the hallway with determination.</p> <p>\u201cBill,\u201d he said, striding purposefully into his friend\u2019s office. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Rich had never played the role of matchmaker before, and he wasn\u2019t sure where to start. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bill didn\u2019t look too enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWidowed or divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle.\u201d</p><p>Bill\u2019s brows arched toward his receding hairline. \u201cYou mean a leftover girl.\u201d</p><p>Rich wasn\u2019t comfortable thinking of Jamie as leftover, but this wasn\u2019t the time to argue. \u201cWe went to high school together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh school? Exactly how old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-one.\u201d Her birthday wasn\u2019t until April. Their birthdays were both in April, and Jamie loved to point out that she was a whole week older.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s never been married?\u201d Bill asked, his voice rising suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She\u2019s one of the nicest people you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d</p><p>Bill reached for his In basket and took out a file, flipping it open. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times friends\u2014\u201d he paused and glanced up \u201c\u2014good friends, have set me up. They always claim the girl\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ll ever meet. No thanks, Rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks? You haven\u2019t heard anything about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d It was hard to keep the irritation out of his voice. Bill was thirty-five and twenty pounds overweight, not to mention the receding hairline. Frankly, Rich didn\u2019t think his friend had any right to be so damn choosy.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to remarry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Someday, when I find the right woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might well be passing her over this minute,\u201d Rich said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you\u2014she\u2019s no Miss America, but she\u2019s not ugly, if that\u2019s what concerns you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her out yourself, then?\u201d</p><p>The question took Rich by surprise. \u201cWell, because...because it would be like dating one of my sisters.\u201d</p><p>Bill released an impatient sigh. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you said anything about her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was involved with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Bill shook his head emphatically. \u201cForget it. You\u2019re a good friend and all that, but I\u2019ve been set up too many times in the past few years. Frankly, your friend\u2019s everything I want to avoid in a woman. She\u2019s over thirty and never been married. It doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s just out of a relationship, either. I\u2019m sorry, Rich, I really am, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Rich found Bill\u2019s attitude downright insulting. Before he could stop himself, before he could analyze his actions, he reached for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bill wanted to know when Rich pulled out two tickets.</p><p>\u201cThese are for the Seahawks play-off game against Green Bay. The scalpers are getting three hundred bucks each for these. If you agree to call Jamie for a date, they\u2019re yours.\u201d His older brother would have his hide for this, but Rich would deal with Jason later.</p><p>Bill\u2019s eyes rounded incredulously. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re willing to give me two tickets to the Seahawks play-off game if I go out with your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>Even then Bill hesitated. \u201cOne date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne date.\u201d But once his fellow engineer got to know Jamie, he\u2019d realize how special she was. In a few weeks, Bill would be looking for ways to repay him for this. Rich would keep that thought in mind when he told Jason he\u2019d given away their play-off tickets.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace nice, too. No pizza in a bowling alley, understand?\u201d</p><p>Bill\u2019s hand closed over the tickets. \u201cDinner at the Space Needle followed by an evening at the ballet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Just don\u2019t ever let Jamie know about this.\u201d</p><p>Bill laughed. \u201cDo I look that stupid?\u201d</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t reply, but in his opinion, any man who\u2019d turn down the opportunity to meet Jamie Warren wasn\u2019t exactly a candidate for Mensa.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s her phone number,\u201d he said, writing it on a slip of paper. \u201cI\u2019ll give her a call, clear the way, but the rest is up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Bill said, pocketing the tickets.</p><p>Rich felt downright noble as he returned to his own office. Jamie was one hell of a woman and it was about time someone figured that out. Bill Hastings wasn\u2019t nearly good enough for her, but he was an amiable guy. Without too much trouble Rich could picture Bill and Jamie a few years down the road, raising two or three kids.</p><p>He felt good about that, better than he\u2019d felt about anything in quite a while.</p><p>That evening, Rich went to Jason\u2019s apartment on his way home and was relieved to find his brother was out. That meant he could delay telling him what had become of the play-off tickets. It was definitely something he had to do in person, he told himself.</p><p>After killing an hour or two at his own apartment, Rich decided to drive over to Jamie\u2019s. He rang her bell and waited. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that she might not be home. He was ready to turn away when he heard activity on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cThe big bad wolf.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her laugh was followed by the click of the lock. She opened the door and Rich saw that he must have gotten her out of the tub. She\u2019d hastily donned a white terrycloth robe that clung to her damp skin.</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d she said, surprise elevating her voice, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d As she spoke, she finished knotting the belt around her waist.</p><p>The robe fell open below that, revealing a glimpse of thigh. Rich was having trouble taking his eyes off it and didn\u2019t answer right away. His gaze followed a natural progression downward, and he was momentarily astounded to see what long shapely legs she had. Funny, he\u2019d never noticed them before. He grinned, thinking Bill was in for a very pleasant shock.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and finish your bath,\u201d he said casually, walking into her kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll make myself at home while I wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he called out. He stuck his head inside the refrigerator and helped himself to an apple. He\u2019d just taken his last bite when Jamie returned. As best he could tell, she\u2019d run a brush through her hair and put on slippers. But that was it. The robe rode over her slender hips like a second skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any plans tonight?\u201d Generally he went out on Fridays, but there wasn\u2019t anything he particularly felt like doing that evening.</p><p>\u201cGot anything in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA movie. I\u2019ll even let you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to make me pay my own way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d He grinned, pleased with himself for coming up with the idea. The suggestion that they attend a movie had been as much of a surprise to him as it obviously was to Jamie. As much of a surprise as offering Bill the play-off tickets...</p><p>Actually, it was a damn good idea. This way he could lead naturally, casually, into the subject of Bill. The last thing he wanted Jamie to think was that he\u2019d arranged anything.</p><p>The movie was indeed a stroke of genius, Rich decided as they drove to the theater. He\u2019d always enjoyed Jamie\u2019s company and never more so than now. An evening with her was an escape from the games and pretenses involved in taking out someone new\u2014and it was exactly what he needed to settle his nerves. He didn\u2019t like to say much, particularly to his family, but Pamela had hurt him badly. He no longer trusted his judgment when it came to women. Oh, he dated. Often. But he was tired of all the games. Pamela hadn\u2019t just broken his heart; the damage she\u2019d inflicted went deeper than that. She\u2019d caused him to doubt himself.</p><p>Rich pulled into a movie complex in the Seattle suburbs, close to Jamie\u2019s condominium. He bought their tickets, but she insisted on buying the popcorn and the chocolate-covered raisins.</p><p>He was just thinking how nice it was to be with a woman who wasn\u2019t constantly worrying about her weight when she leaned over and whispered, \u201cYou ate more than your share of the raisins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to buy more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just remember you owe me.\u201d</p><p>It took him several minutes to realize he had no reason to be grinning the way he was, especially since the film was actually quite serious.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do this often enough,\u201d Rich said as they left the cinema two hours later. He meant it, too. He\u2019d been at loose ends for a couple of months but hadn\u2019t thought about contacting Jamie. Now he wondered why.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed, buttoning her coat. She wore jeans and a pale pink sweater. The color looked good on her. He was about to say as much when he remembered the reason for his impromptu visit.</p><p>\u201cHow about a cup of coffee?\u201d he suggested, linking his arm with hers. There was a coffee shop in the same complex as the theater, and he steered them in that direction.</p><p>He waited until they were seated and looking over their menus before he brought up the subject of Bill. \u201cThere\u2019s someone at work I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t raise her eyes from the menu. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill Hastings. You\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he tall, dark and handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like my kind of man,\u201d she joked, setting aside the menu. The waitress filled their mugs with coffee and Jamie stirred in a liberal measure of cream. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s best to avoid the handsome ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He could guess what was coming. He wasn\u2019t conceited, but Rich knew he was easy on the eyes\u2014a fact that hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed from the time he was in his early teens. Rich had never lacked for female attention, some he\u2019d sought and some he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe handsome ones can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho says?\u201d Rich demanded, feigning outrage.</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Jamie returned without a pause. \u201cThey\u2019re too impressed with themselves. Or so I hear.\u201d</p><p>Rich chuckled and, motioning for the waitress, ordered a chef\u2019s salad. He felt like having a decent meal for the first time in weeks. He didn\u2019t even complain when Jamie stole his olives, claiming it was the least he could do for hogging the chocolate-covered raisins.</p><p>Tuesday morning, Bill marched into Rich\u2019s office, pulled out a chair and plunked himself down. His face was creased with a heavy frown. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Rich tried to figure out which project Bill was referring to and came up blank. They were both part of an engineering team working on a Boeing defense contract. Rich had volunteered for this job, knowing it would entail plenty of overtime hours. The challenge was something he needed at this point in his career\u2014and his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked Bill.</p><p>\u201cShe turned me down flat.\u201d</p><p>Bill couldn\u2019t possibly be talking about Jamie. He\u2019d paved the way for him! He\u2019d managed to casually drop his name into the conversation at least three times. Enough to pique her curiosity, but not so often that she\u2019d suspect he was setting them up.</p><p>\u201cShe turned you down?\u201d Rich echoed, still unable to believe it. \u201cObviously you didn\u2019t try all that hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d tried any harder, I would\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d Bill muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I called her Saturday afternoon, just like you suggested. I mentioned your name right off and told her we worked together and have for several years. I wanted her to feel comfortable talking to me.\u201d He hesitated as though he was still trying to understand what had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d Rich could feel himself losing patience. He\u2019d risked his brother\u2019s wrath by giving up those tickets and he wasn\u2019t about to let Bill off so easily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. Nothing happened. We must\u2019ve talked for ten or fifteen minutes and you\u2019re right\u2014she sounds nice. The more we talked, the more I realized I wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know her. She said you two were on the yearbook staff together.... She even told me a few insider secrets about your glorious football days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing talking about me?\u201d Rich demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI was establishing common ground.\u201d</p><p>Rich brought one hand to his mouth in an effort to hide his irritation. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much more to tell. After several minutes of chitchat, I asked her out to dinner. Honest, Rich, I was beginning to look forward to meeting her. I couldn\u2019t have been more shocked when she turned me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Bill admitted, his frown deepening. \u201cJust that she\u2019d given up dating and although she was sure I was a perfectly fine guy, she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take that sitting down, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I sent her a dozen roses Monday morning, hoping that would convince her. Red roses, expensive ones. I didn\u2019t get them in any grocery store, either. These were flower shop roses, top quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t do it, either. She phoned and thanked me, but said she still wasn\u2019t interested. Said she felt bad that I\u2019d gone to the expense of sending her flowers, though.\u201d</p><p>Rich muttered under his breath. Bill had just encountered that stubborn pride of hers. Rich knew from experience that once she\u2019d made up her mind, nothing was going to change it. Not flowers, not arguments, nothing.</p><p>Bill sighed unhappily. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make me return the Seahawks tickets, are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Two</p><p>Jamie was sitting at her kitchen table, reading the application from the adoption agency, when the doorbell rang. A long blast was immediately followed by three short, impatient ones. By the time she\u2019d stood and walked to the door, whoever was on the other side was knocking loudly.</p><p>She checked the peephole. Rich. And from the look of him, he was furious. Unbolting the lock, she opened the door.</p><p>Without a word, he marched into the center of her living room, hands deep in the pockets of his full-length winter coat. Damn, but the man was attractive, Jamie noted, not for the first time. Much too handsome for his own good. His blue eyes were flashing, which only added to his appeal\u2014even if they were flashing with annoyance, not laughter or warmth.</p><p>\u201cYou turned down Bill Hastings\u2019s dinner invitation and I want to know why,\u201d he said without preamble.</p><p>Jamie sighed. She should\u2019ve realized Rich would be upset about that. He\u2019d obviously gone to a lot of trouble to arrange the date and even more trying to conceal it from her. The seemingly impromptu visit Friday night, the movie and coffee afterward, had all led up to his singing Bill Hastings\u2019s praises. He\u2019d listed Bill\u2019s apparently limitless virtues at length and actually seemed to think he was being subtle about setting her up.</p><p>To be fair, she\u2019d enjoyed talking to Bill. He\u2019d seemed cordial enough, and he had sent her the roses, which really were lovely. But he hadn\u2019t said or done anything to change her mind. It did seem rather harsh to turn him down sight unseen, but she was saving them both future heartbreak and disappointment. Bill accepted her decision with good grace, but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case with Rich.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Rich demanded. He walked around her couch, as though standing still was impossible, but if he didn\u2019t stop circling it soon, he was going to make her dizzy.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s perfect for you,\u201d Rich argued, gesturing toward her. \u201cI match the two of you up and then you turn him down. I can\u2019t believe you refused to even meet him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne date,\u201d he cried, waving his index finger at her. \u201cWhat possible harm could there be in one lousy dinner date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cListen, do you intend to stay long enough to take off your coat, or are you just dropping in to argue with me on your way to someplace else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let Tony do this to you?\u201d he challenged, disregarding her question. He plowed his fingers through his hair, something he\u2019d done often today if the grooves along the side of his head were any indication.</p><p>\u201cTony has very little to do with this.\u201d Rather than discuss the man who\u2019d wounded her so deeply, Jamie moved into the kitchen and poured them glasses of iced tea, which gave her a few minutes to compose her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cObviously Tony has everything to do with this, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have told Bill you\u2019d given up dating. Which, by the way, is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d He shrugged off his coat and draped it over the back of a kitchen chair.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Leaning against the kitchen counter, she added sugar and ice to her glass, stirred, then sipped from her tea. Rich ignored the glass she\u2019d poured him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, is it?\u201d</p><p>He glared at Jamie as though he expected her to deny everything. But she couldn\u2019t see any reason to lie. \u201cAs a matter of fact it is.\u201d</p><p>Rich\u2019s jaw sagged open. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really need to ask?\u201d Jamie said with a light laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow can you deny that Tony\u2019s responsible for this?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cIn part he is, but this decision isn\u2019t solely due to what happened with him. It\u2019s just one more disappointment. If anything, I\u2019m grateful I found out what kind of man Tony is before we were married.\u201d</p><p>The timer on her oven dinged. Setting aside her tea, Jamie reached for a pot holder and took out a bubbling chicken potpie. The recipe was one she\u2019d come across in a women\u2019s magazine and it had looked delicious. True, the meal was large enough to feed a family of four, but she intended to freeze half of it.</p><p>\u201cHave you had dinner? Would you like to join me?\u201d She extended the invitation casually as she set the steaming pie on top of the stove to cool.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rich answered starkly. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me you\u2019ve lost weight. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to discuss my weight,\u201d he barked, \u201cwhich hasn\u2019t changed since high school, I might add.\u201d</p><p>His attitude was slightly defensive, but Jamie decided to ignore it. He had lost weight; she\u2019d noticed it soon after he\u2019d broken off the relationship with Pamela. Jamie had never met the other woman and it was all she could do to think civilly of her. If anyone was ever a fool, it was Rich\u2019s former girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d Rich said. His voice had lowered and he seemed less persistent now. Jamie suspected he\u2019d spent the day seething over her decision not to date his friend.</p><p>\u201cWhich question didn\u2019t I answer?\u201d she asked, putting the pot holder back in the top drawer.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to give up dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pulled out a chair and sat down. Rich did, too. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t something I did lightly, trust me. It was a gradual decision made over the past few months. I honestly feel it\u2019s the right one for me. I feel better than I have in years.\u201d She tried to reassure him with a warm smile. He was frowning at her as though he wanted to argue. Rich had always been passionate when it came to people he cared about. \u201cI\u2019m nearly thirty-two years old,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cthere aren\u2019t many eligible men left for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bill Hastings? He\u2019s eligible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to like her answer, but Jamie wouldn\u2019t be less than honest. \u201cI\u2019ve dated plenty of divorced men over the years. My experience may not be like anyone else\u2019s, but I\u2019ve discovered that if their wives left them, there\u2019s generally a damn good reason. And if there isn\u2019t, they\u2019re so traumatized by the divorce they\u2019ve become emotional cripples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! And furthermore, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are exceptions. I just haven\u2019t found any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you wouldn\u2019t date Bill because he\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...exactly. It\u2019s more than that. I don\u2019t want to date anyone right now, divorced or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about single men? You\u2019re only thirty-one, for heaven\u2019s sake. There are lots of single men out there who\u2019d give anything to meet a woman like you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had to swallow a sarcastic reply. If there were as many eligible single men as Rich seemed to think, she certainly hadn\u2019t met them. \u201cObviously I haven\u2019t had much luck with that group, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to burst your bubble here, but single men aren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be. If a man\u2019s in his thirties and not married, there\u2019s usually a reason for it. Besides, single men over thirty are so set in their ways, they have problems adjusting to the natural give-and-take of a healthy relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s downright insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it to be.\u201d She stood up to get two plates. \u201cYou\u2019re having dinner with me, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you and claim Tony had nothing to do with this,\u201d she went on. \u201cHe hurt me, and it took me weeks to work through the pain. As strange as it may seem, I\u2019m actually grateful for what Tony taught me. He helped me reach some sound, honest decisions about my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf this no-dating stand of yours is one of them, then I\u2019d do some rethinking if I were you.\u201d Rich opened the silverware drawer and took out two knives and forks. Without glancing at the adoption papers, he placed them to one side and had the table set by the time she brought over their plates. Jamie couldn\u2019t help being pleased that he\u2019d agreed to join her for dinner.</p><p>\u201cMy biggest, and probably most significant realization,\u201d she said while smoothing the napkin across her lap, \u201cwas that I like my life the way it is. I don\u2019t need a man to feel complete.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed before Rich spoke. \u201cThat sounds healthy, but to lock the door on any chance of a relationship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not locking the door,\u201d she interrupted, eager to correct that impression. \u201cI\u2019m just not looking for one. I\u2019ve wasted years trying to fulfill my dream of being married and raising children.\u201d</p><p>Rich took a bite of the chicken potpie and raised his eyebrows. \u201cHey, this is great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She tried it herself and was satisfied with her culinary efforts. Taking the time to cook real meals instead of throwing together a sandwich or resorting to frozen entr\u00e9es had been another decision she\u2019d reached. It might seem silly, but cooking gave her a feeling of permanence and purpose. She was doing something healthy for herself, and she felt good about it.</p><p>\u201cEverything you\u2019ve said makes sense,\u201d Rich admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve always pictured you with kids....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that covered,\u201d she said enthusiastically, removing the top sheet of the papers Rich had stacked on the other side of the table. \u201cI intend to adopt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they let single people adopt children now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut two-parent families are better for kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIdeally, yes,\u201d Jamie agreed. \u201cBut sometimes there\u2019s no alternative. Anyway, from what I\u2019ve read, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy or anytime soon, especially if I want a newborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you do?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. If she was only going to be a mother once, then she wanted as much of the experience as she could have, including midnight feedings, teething and changing diapers. \u201cI have an appointment with a counselor at an adoption agency tomorrow afternoon. I haven\u2019t been this excited about anything in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t told your mother.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rolled her eyes at the thought. \u201cIt\u2019s better if I don\u2019t say anything, at least for now. Mom\u2019s wonderful, but she\u2019d never understand this.\u201d</p><p>Rich chuckled, but as the laughter drained from his features, his eyes took on a faraway look. \u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve basically come to the same conclusion about dating. I\u2019m sick to death of the games and women whose only interest is getting me in the sack. I never knew women could be so aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>Intrigued, Jamie could only nod. She would never have believed Rich was experiencing the same difficulties she had. For years she\u2019d been expecting him to marry, but she\u2019d never felt comfortable enough to ask why he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent ten years looking for a woman who believes love lasts longer than an hour,\u201d he added grimly. \u201cAs for commitment and honesty, I don\u2019t think they exist anymore. Or if they do, then I can\u2019t seem to find anyone who believes in them. After Pamela cheated on me I realized I\u2019m a self-reliant adult\u2014and if I never married, it wouldn\u2019t make my life any less worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI just never thought that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a look\u2014a look wrought with understanding and empathy. They\u2019d been friends for years and Jamie had never known how much they actually had in common.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea it was happening to you, too,\u201d she whispered. She felt as though she was deprived of oxygen. Everything in the kitchen seemed to fade from view. Everything except Rich. If anything, his dark good looks came into sharper focus. As she had a thousand times before, Jamie acknowledged how very handsome Rich Manning was. But there was much more there, more than she\u2019d ever noticed. This was a man of character and strength. A man of substance. He looked older; the years had marked their passage. There were wrinkles on his forehead and shadows beneath his eyes. The well-defined angles of his cheeks as well as the lines bracketing his mouth only made his face more masculine, more appealing.</p><p>The silence between them stretched to embarrassing lengths. It was Jamie who pulled her eyes away first. With a weak smile, she picked up her fork and managed to swallow a bite of her dinner.</p><p>\u201cThis turned out well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d she said in a casual voice.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He seemed equally intent on putting their conversation back on an even keel. He attacked his dinner as though he\u2019d entered a speed-eating competition.</p><p>They chatted for several more minutes, teased each other, exchanged the banter that was so familiar to them. Rich insisted on helping her clean up, but as soon as the last dish was put away, he made his excuses and left.</p><p>Jamie felt weak afterward. As weak and trembly as the first time she\u2019d stood on the high dive. The feeling wasn\u2019t any more comfortable now than it had been all those years ago.</p><p>Hard though he tried over the next few days, Rich couldn\u2019t forget the look he\u2019d shared with Jamie at her kitchen table on Tuesday evening. He\u2019d tried to define it, decipher its meaning. It was the kind of look longtime lovers exchanged. The kind he\u2019d witnessed between Taylor and Russ, as though they didn\u2019t need words to say what was in their hearts.</p><p>But he and Jamie had never been lovers. To the best of his knowledge, they\u2019d never even kissed. Really kissed. A peck on the cheek now and then. A friendly hug, perhaps. That was it. Their relationship had always been strictly platonic. It was the way they\u2019d both wanted it. Anything else would have destroyed the special closeness they shared.</p><p>Rich shook his head in an effort to banish the disturbing thoughts that had taken up residence there. Until Tuesday, he\u2019d seen Jamie as ordinary. Not anymore.</p><p>Still, nothing had changed, not really. At least nothing he could put his finger on. Jamie Warren was the same person she\u2019d always been.</p><p>Not so, he corrected. Her eyes had been different.</p><p>To think he\u2019d once believed her eyes were an average shade of brown. He\u2019d never seen eyes the precise color of Jamie\u2019s. They were a blend of green and brown; some would call it hazel, he supposed. That night they\u2019d been more green, reminiscent of the mist rising off a moss-covered forest floor....</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t her eyes that had intrigued him. It was something more profound than that. Something more baffling, too.</p><p>His musing was interrupted by the phone. Rich grabbed the television remote and muted the volume. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d bothered to turn it on\u2014from habit, he guessed. For the past hour he hadn\u2019t heard a single word of the local or national news. He\u2019d been too busy analyzing what had happened between him and Jamie.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answered briskly. Pamela sometimes phoned him, and he braced himself in case it was her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d came the soft feminine voice he recognized immediately as Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d He felt a bit ill at ease, which he\u2019d never experienced with her. It was as though they hadn\u2019t found their stride with each other yet, which made no sense. Perhaps he was taking his cue from Jamie. She didn\u2019t sound quite like herself; she sounded tense, as if it had taken some courage to call him.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about you.\u201d He probably shouldn\u2019t have admitted that, but it had slipped out.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was going to give you a call later and find out how the appointment with the adoption agency went.\u201d</p><p>She paused, and he heard her take a deep breath. \u201cActually, that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m calling you. Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. What do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I came by for a few minutes? There\u2019s something I need to talk over with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you\u2019re welcome anytime.\u201d He glanced around the apartment to see what kind of shape it was in. Not bad. Not especially good, either, but he\u2019d have time to pick up the newspapers and straighten the cushions.</p><p>As it turned out, he had time to wipe down the kitchen counter, as well, and stick his dirty dishes in the dishwasher. The best meal he\u2019d had in weeks had been the chicken potpie at Jamie\u2019s place. He didn\u2019t remember her being such an accomplished cook. She certainly seemed full of surprises lately.</p><p>Jamie arrived about ten minutes after her phone call. She wore jeans and the same pink sweater she\u2019d had on the night they went to the movies. He was about to tell her how nice she looked, but stopped himself. Curiously, his heart stopped, too. Just a little.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take long,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>\u201cNo... But we only live four or five miles from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He led the way to the sofa and sat down, resting one ankle on the opposite knee and draping his arm along the back. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Jamie sat down, too, but he noticed that she sat on the very edge of the cushion and rubbed her hands nervously down her arms. He wondered if she was cold.</p><p>That prompted him to say, \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said eagerly.</p><p>Rich couldn\u2019t shake the impression that she was interested in the coffee more as a delaying tactic than out of any real desire for something to warm her.</p><p>He made a pot of coffee, and a few minutes later, brought two steaming mugs into the living room. He had to look around for coasters, but once he found them, he sat down on the recliner across from her and resumed his relaxed pose.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the appointment with the adoption agency go?\u201d he asked, when she didn\u2019t immediately launch into her reason for the visit. She hadn\u2019t really answered his question earlier.</p><p>Her hands cradled the mug and she stared into its depths. \u201cNot very well, I\u2019m afraid. Naturally, the agency prefers to place newborns with established families. Besides, the waiting list is years long, and I don\u2019t feel I have all that time to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it.\u201d Rich could feel her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to have a child, I want to be young enough to enjoy her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr him,\u201d she amended quickly, briefly glancing his way.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>For a long time she didn\u2019t say anything. Rich might have grown impatient with anyone else, but he found himself more tolerant with Jamie. He watched the emotions move across her face and tried to read her thoughts. It was impossible to know what she had on her mind, but whatever it was seemed to burden her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a candidate for intensive counseling when I tell you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019ve made an appointment with my gynecologist. I want to discuss the possibility of being artificially inseminated.\u201d</p><p>Rich was relieved that his mouth wasn\u2019t full of coffee, otherwise he would\u2019ve choked to death. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do what?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood abruptly and walked around the back of his recliner. She braced her hands against the sides as she stood behind him. \u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I plan to have a child, and if I can\u2019t adopt, this was the best idea I could come up with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about checking with another adoption agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Five others, and the story\u2019s the same. If I want an infant, it\u2019ll mean years on a waiting list. Two of the agencies wouldn\u2019t even talk to me. The others tried to persuade me to become a foster parent with the hope of adopting at some point in the distant future. I want a baby. Is that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he assured her gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nearly thirty-two years old, and my biological clock is ticking. Not so loud it keeps me awake nights, but loud enough. If I\u2019m going to do this, it\u2019s got to be soon.\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes filled with tears, but she was too proud and too stubborn to let them fall. Her gaze met his without wavering. Did she regret being honest because it forced her to reveal her deepest secrets?</p><p>\u201cWhat about the father?\u201d he mumured.</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve read everything I could find on the subject, which isn\u2019t all that much. I understand there\u2019s a sperm bank in our area. I don\u2019t know what else to tell you, since I haven\u2019t been to the doctor yet. I\u2019ll have more answers once I\u2019ve had a chance to talk it over with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Rich could hardly believe they were even having this discussion. \u201cYou\u2019re positive you want to go through with this?\u201d The minute he asked, he knew he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>Steely determination shone from Jamie\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this, Rich, so don\u2019t try to talk me out of it.\u201d</p><p>Her warning wasn\u2019t necessary; he was well aware that any attempt to dissuade her would be pointless. \u201cAre you worried about what people might say?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs that what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cA little. The biggest hurdle will be my mother, but I\u2019m not too worried. It\u2019s my life. Besides, she\u2019s been after me to have children for years. Of course, she\u2019d prefer it if I were married, but I\u2019ve decided against that.\u201d Her eyes met his again. She seemed nervous, edgy. Rich couldn\u2019t remember Jamie being either. Until tonight.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re just about the best friend I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have several close girlfriends. I\u2019ve been a maid of honor twice and a bridesmaid three times. But when I found out about Tony, it was you I turned to. You\u2019re the one I felt I could wake up in the middle of the night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel the same way about you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was genuine, if a little shaky. \u201cThat pleases me more than you know. We\u2019re good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood friends,\u201d Rich echoed. Good enough for him to hand over two fifty-yard-line play-off tickets on the off-chance she might find happiness with Bill Hastings. He\u2019d done it without pause, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do just about anything for you,\u201d she said, eyeing him closely.</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t know why he felt that was a leading statement, but he did. The door was wide open for him to echo the sentiment. \u201cYou\u2019re special to me, too. Do you mind telling me exactly where this conversation is heading?\u201d</p><p>Jamie came around the chair and sat on the sofa again. She leaned forward and rubbed her palms together, as though she was outside in below-freezing temperatures. She seemed more sure of herself now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a handsome guy.\u201d</p><p>Rich frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come from a wonderful family.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tall. What I wouldn\u2019t give for an extra two inches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She stood up, still rubbing her palms. Once more she positioned herself behind his recliner. \u201cI ... I was having dinner when it dawned on me exactly what I\u2019d decided to undertake. I want a child and because I do, I\u2019m willing to be subjected to heaven knows what kinds of medical procedures. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s a small sacrifice, and I\u2019m amenable to whatever it takes. The only aspect of this entire scenario that disturbs me is giving birth to a stranger\u2019s child. A man I\u2019ve never met, never even seen. Then it came to me. There\u2019s one person, a man I admire and trust above all others. It didn\u2019t make sense to go through all this and have a stranger\u2019s baby when...when there\u2019s already someone in my life who\u2019s tall, dark and handsome. Someone with excellent chromosomes who might be willing to contribute to this project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Maybe she didn\u2019t mean what he thought she meant. Maybe this was all a dream and he\u2019d wake in the morning and have a good laugh. Maybe Jamie wasn\u2019t wrong about the counseling. There seemed to be a hundred maybes in this. Rich didn\u2019t like the answer to a single one of them.</p><p>Jamie looked into his eyes and smiled, the softest, sweetest smile he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to be the sperm donor for my baby.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cNaturally, I don\u2019t expect you to make a decision tonight,\u201d Jamie added, walking around the recliner and sitting down again. She leaned back and crossed her legs, striking a relaxed pose.</p><p>Rich frowned. She sounded so casual, so comfortable with the idea. Mentioning it had obviously demanded courage, but now that her baby plan was out in the open, she seemed completely at ease.</p><p>But Rich wasn\u2019t. His thoughts were in chaos.</p><p>\u201cI ...don\u2019t know...what to say,\u201d he stammered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the whole thing comes as a shock,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was some way I could\u2019ve led up to it with a little more tact, but I couldn\u2019t think how to say it other than flat out. I didn\u2019t want there to be any room for misunderstanding between us.\u201d</p><p>Rich was standing now, although he couldn\u2019t remember getting to his feet. \u201cNo...this is the best way.\u201d He paced back and forth in front of the coffee table. \u201cA baby,\u201d he muttered, needing to hear himself say it aloud. He was trying to assimilate exactly what it was Jamie had suggested. He paused, waiting to be overwhelmed by objections, but apparently he was too numb to think clearly. Not a single protest occurred to him. Not one.</p><p>Questions. There were plenty of those. A few doubts and a whole lot of shock, but no real opposition. Although he\u2019d thought there would be. Should be.</p><p>\u201cOur baby,\u201d she said, her smile serene\u2014as if she was already pregnant and counting the days before their child\u2019s birth.</p><p>Her attitude, the calm way she was watching him, unnerved Rich more than anything. He stalked into the kitchen, emptied his coffee mug and then refilled it. When he returned, he saw that Jamie was studying him closely.</p><p>\u201cSay something.\u201d Her confidence seemed to be shaken, and for his own peace of mind, Rich was relieved to see it. She\u2019d been taking this in stride a little too easily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he admitted bluntly.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds preposterous to you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he nearly shouted. Preposterous was putting it mildly. She was talking about creating a new life, one that would link them forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d even ask such a thing. \u201cYou want me to father your child. A baby\u2014any baby\u2014is a huge responsibility and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that responsibility would be mine,\u201d she said quickly, interrupting him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t ask for any support, financially or emotionally.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sit well with Rich, either. He put down his coffee, sank into the chair again and leaned forward, pressing his elbows to his knees. He needed to think but couldn\u2019t seem to form a single coherent thought. \u201cLet me see if I understand this correctly,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything from me other than a...biological contribution. I\u2019d father your child, and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this to work, you\u2019d\u2014we\u2019d both need to separate ourselves emotionally from the procedure. The baby would technically be yours, but only because of his or her genetic makeup. For all intents and purposes, the pregnancy and the child shouldn\u2019t be any different than if I\u2019d gone to a sperm bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words all you really want from me is my genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding emphatically. Her eyes briefly met his, and she appeared to have immediate second thoughts. \u201cI know I\u2019m making it all seem so callous, but that\u2019s not my intention. There\u2019s no one I trust more than you, no one else I feel comfortable approaching with this idea. If the doctor were to line up ten guys\u2014ten strangers\u2014and ask me to choose one of them to father my baby, I\u2019d pick you instead. Knowing you and trusting you means so much to me. We\u2019ve been friends since high school and that adds a whole other dimension to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I considered seducing you.\u201d</p><p>This time, Rich was unfortunate enough to be in the process of swallowing a mouthful of coffee. It stuck halfway down his windpipe and completed its course only after a bout of violent coughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly considered seducing me?\u201d That idea was even more ludicrous than the first one she\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cBriefly,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut sex between us would upset everything, don\u2019t you think? Your friendship\u2019s far too valuable to me to ruin it over something physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d So she\u2019d considered luring him into her bed. Jamie Warren was certainly full of surprises this evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not sure I could\u2019ve done it,\u201d she said as she lowered her gaze to her hands, which were tightly clenched in her lap. \u201cI mean...well, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rich wasn\u2019t convinced he did, but he pretended otherwise and simply nodded.</p><p>Jamie reached for her coffee and took one tentative sip. \u201cDo you have any questions? I mean, I\u2019m sure you do, and I want to reassure you in any way I can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He couldn\u2019t seem to think clearly, let alone form sensible questions. \u201cYou say you\u2019re not looking for emotional or financial support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not supposed to feel anything toward this child?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI ...don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms. If it would make things easier for you, I could move out of the area after the baby\u2019s born, or...before. Whichever you prefer.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t like that strategy at all. \u201cWhat about our parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d She seemed puzzled.</p><p>Rich couldn\u2019t speak for Jamie\u2019s mother, but he knew his own, and she\u2019d give him an earful the minute she heard about this craziness. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect our parents to accept this sitting down, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to tell them.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cWhat do you intend to do? Run off and have the baby and then go home and present our parents with a surprise grandchild?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother, yes, but not yours. I don\u2019t intend to tell anyone you\u2019re the baby\u2019s father. That\u2019ll be between you and me. No one else needs to know. As far as my mother\u2019s concerned, all I\u2019m going to say is that I was artificially inseminated, but not by whom. That would only complicate matters, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t work any better for Rich than Jamie\u2019s other ideas, especially the one about moving away. He rubbed his face, hoping that would help him sort out his thoughts. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll want a few days to think this over?\u201d She eyed him speculatively. It was apparent she\u2019d like her answer as quickly as possible, but that was just too bad. This was too important a decision to be made quickly. He needed to weigh all the concerns carefully, think through the pros and cons.</p><p>He found the whole situation unsettling. Sure he\u2019d like to be a father, but he\u2019d prefer that it happened in the traditional way. His first instinct was to reject her suggestion outright, but Jamie was staring at him with those big, round eyes of hers, obviously doing her best not to sway him. To his regret, Rich discovered that he couldn\u2019t turn down her request without at least considering it. Their friendship was worth that much.</p><p>\u201cGive me a week,\u201d he said after a strained minute or two.</p><p>\u201cA week,\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cShould I call you or will you call me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stood up to leave, pausing at the front door. \u201cBefore I go, there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I truly believe we\u2019d have a beautiful child, but if it isn\u2019t meant to be, then I can accept your decision. I\u2019m going to have a baby. I\u2019d just rather it was yours than some stranger\u2019s.\u201d With that, she was out the door.</p><p>After she\u2019d left, Rich resumed pacing, unable to stand still. His thoughts were a tangle of confused reactions, and part of him was laughing at the absurdity of Jamie\u2019s proposition.</p><p>Their baby! Their baby?</p><p>They\u2019d never even kissed, and she was proposing they create a child together.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she expected nothing from him, other than the pregnancy. Although he was sure she hadn\u2019t meant to sound so cold and calculating, that was exactly what Rich felt. She\u2019d made it seem so...impersonal. Even that parting shot about having a beautiful child got to him. With those hazel-green eyes of hers and his height... He forcefully pushed the idea from his head.</p> <p>Although he\u2019d asked for time to make his decision, Rich already knew what his answer would be.</p><p>He wanted no part of this craziness.</p><p>Jamie made a genuine effort not to think about Rich for the next few days. She\u2019d stated her case, explained what needed to be explained without resorting to emotions.</p><p>A hundred times since their talk, she\u2019d thought of all the things she might\u2019ve said to get him to agree....</p><p>Her mind was muddled with regrets. Rich was a good friend. Too good to risk ruining their relationship because she was determined to have a child.</p><p>She\u2019d insulted him. She\u2019d known, from his stunned look, that his immediate instinct had been to say no. Good grief, who wouldn\u2019t? It was only because of their friendship that he\u2019d been courteous enough to consider her proposal.</p><p>Not for the first time, Jamie repressed the urge to call him and withdraw the suggestion. With everything in her, she wished she hadn\u2019t said a word. And in the same instant she prayed with all her heart, with all her being, that he\u2019d say yes.</p><p>If only she\u2019d approached him differently.</p><p>If only she\u2019d told him how much his child would mean to her, how she\u2019d love that child her whole life.</p><p>If only she\u2019d assured him what a good mother she was going to be.</p><p>If only...</p><p>Rich had made plans to go to his brother Jason\u2019s apartment on Sunday afternoon to watch the Seahawks football game. Since Rich had given Bill Hastings their fifty-yard-line tickets, the least Rich thought he could do was bring the beer.</p><p>Close to one, nearly an hour late, Rich arrived at his brother\u2019s with a six-pack of Jason\u2019s favorite beer in one hand and a sack full of junk food in the other.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got here,\u201d Jason muttered when he opened the front door. \u201cThe kick-off\u2019s in less than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought a peace offering,\u201d Rich announced, holding up the six-pack. It wasn\u2019t like him to be late, and he half expected an interrogation from his brother. He was grateful when it looked as though he was going to escape that. If Jason did grill him, Rich didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d say. Certainly not the truth. That he\u2019d been so consumed with indecision over Jamie\u2019s proposal, he\u2019d lost track of the time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a whole lot more than a few beers to make up for the loss of those tickets, little brother,\u201d Jason complained as he led Rich to the sofa. \u201cLast I heard, scalpers were getting three hundred bucks for this game, and my brother gave ours away.\u201d There was more than a touch of sarcasm in Jason\u2019s voice. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how Bill Hastings ended up getting our tickets.\u201d</p><p>Rich had been purposely vague about the exchange. \u201cHe did me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have bought him dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t help to tell Jason that the big favor Bill was supposed to have done him had fallen through.</p><p>Damn, Jamie was stubborn. Stubborn enough to go ahead and have her baby without him.</p><p>That stopped him in his tracks. It was her decision. What bothered Rich, what caught him so completely by surprise, was the rush of resentment he felt at the thought of her having another man\u2019s child.</p><p>\u201cHey, you all right?\u201d Jason asked, claiming the seat next to him on the overstuffed sofa.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m all right. Why shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you got this funny look all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>Rich dropped his gaze to the can of beer he clutched in his hand. He offered his brother a weak smile and then relaxed on the sofa. It was a few minutes before his heart rate returned to normal. But he kept thinking about Jamie. She\u2019d have a stranger\u2019s child. Yes, she would. She\u2019d do it in a second. More than once Rich had collided with that pride of hers, and there wasn\u2019t a doubt in his mind.</p><p>She\u2019d do it!</p><p>\u201cYou ever thought about being a father?\u201d Rich found himself asking his older brother. He attempted to make the question sound casual but didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d succeeded or not.</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d Jason teased. \u201cI\u2019m not even married, and frankly I don\u2019t ever plan to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d This was news to Rich. Jason dated as often as Rich did\u2014although, come to think of it, Rich might have implied that his social life was more active than it really was. Jason never seemed to lack for gorgeous women. The only time he\u2019d gotten serious, the relationship had turned out badly, but that was years ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the marrying kind,\u201d Jason said, tearing open a bag of potato chips with his teeth. \u201cAll women think about is reforming me. Hell, if I want to kick off my shoes and watch a football game on a Sunday afternoon, I don\u2019t want to feel guilty about it. Most married men are henpecked. I prefer my freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Rich agreed. Marriage wasn\u2019t for him, either. Or for Jamie. He valued his independence. So did she. Jason apparently felt the same way\u2014marriage was too much trouble.</p><p>\u201cIf I want to dry my socks in the microwave, there\u2019s no one around to yell at me,\u201d Jason added, then took a deep swallow of his beer.</p><p>\u201cYou dried your socks in the microwave?\u201d</p><p>Jason shrugged. \u201cI forgot to put the load from the washer into the dryer the night before. I needed a pair for work. So it was either that or pop them in the toaster.\u201d</p><p>Rich chuckled. That sounded exactly like something his brother would do. Jason was right: A woman would\u2019ve been horrified had she known about his method of drying socks.</p><p>For the next ten minutes they were both engrossed in the game. At the commercial break, Jason propped his ankle on his knee and turned to Rich.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you bring up this marriage thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. I was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time you thought about settling down and fathering a houseful of kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Rich asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. Mom knows any future Mannings will have to come from you and Paul. She\u2019s thrown up her hands in disgust at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get married, either.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes widened with disbelief. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You, Richard Manning, are definitely the marrying kind. Women flock to you.\u201d</p><p>Plainly his older brother had an inflated view of Rich\u2019s sexual prowess, and Rich couldn\u2019t see any reason to disillusion him. \u201cTrue, but not one of them, in all these years, has appealed to me enough to want to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Pamela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Rich decided not to say it. \u201cPut it this way. We don\u2019t have much in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were still seeing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do occasionally.\u201d He took a swig of his beer and set it down, then reached for a bowl of popcorn. Leaning back, he rested his feet on the coffee table, crossing his ankles. \u201cThis is the life.\u201d He made a point of changing the subject, growing uncomfortable with the topic of marriage, although he\u2019d been the one foolish enough to introduce it.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than this,\u201d Jason said enthusiastically.</p><p>Once again their attention reverted to the television. The Seattle football team, the Seahawks, was playing the Green Bay Packers in a heated contest for the National Football Conference title. The winner would go on to play in the Super Bowl. All of Seattle was excited about the game. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about kids?\u201d Rich wanted to kick himself the instant the question left his lips. What the hell was the matter with him? He\u2019d had no intention of talking to Jason about any of this.</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d Jason\u2019s attention didn\u2019t stray from the game. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan to marry, how do you feel about not having a child of your own?\u201d This bothered Rich the most. He really would like a son or a daughter. Or both.</p><p>Jason took a long time answering, as though the question had caught him unprepared. \u201cI don\u2019t know... I hadn\u2019t given children much thought. I guess I\u2019d like a couple of kids someday, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t want to get married in order to have them. But then\u2014\u201d he hesitated \u201c\u2014there\u2019s no need to marry...not these days. We live in an enlightened age, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot marry the woman pregnant with my child?\u201d Rich gave his brother a sour look. \u201cI don\u2019t care what age we live in. We both know better than that. A word of advice\u2014don\u2019t let Mom or Dad ever hear you say such a thing.\u201d</p><p>Jason exhaled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, that was a stupid idea.\u201d He reached over to the bowl of popcorn Rich was holding and grabbed a handful. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot telling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s something on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d Rich said, picking up his beer. \u201cFootball. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re down by seven points and Green Bay\u2019s got the ball on the fifteen-yard line.\u201d He laughed, but his brother didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jason asked a few minutes later. \u201cThe score\u2019s the only thing bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Rich assured him, feigning a smile. A man didn\u2019t tell his older brother, especially one who assumed women flocked to him, that he was thinking about becoming a sperm donor.</p><p>Six days had passed, and if Rich didn\u2019t call her soon, Jamie was convinced she\u2019d have a nervous breakdown. Every time the phone rang, her heart shot to her throat and she started to tremble like an October leaf.</p><p>Rich had made a point of saying he\u2019d be the one to call her, and he\u2019d promised to do so within a week\u2019s time. Nevertheless, the wait was killing her, and each day that passed seemed to increase her anxiety.</p><p>She\u2019d just put a casserole in the oven when the doorbell chimed. Jamie\u2019s gaze flew apprehensively toward the door. Even before she answered it, she knew it was Rich.</p><p>Inhaling a deep breath, she walked unsteadily across the carpet and opened the door.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Rich.\u201d</p><p>His eyes refused to meet hers, and her stomach twisted into a tight knot as he entered her home. He removed his coat and hung it in the closet as though he intended to stay for a while. Jamie didn\u2019t know whether she should take encouragement from that or not.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s in the oven. Will you join me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, although she suspected he hadn\u2019t heard what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new recipe.... I seem to be in a cooking mode lately. Tamale pie\u2014I found the recipe on the back of a cornmeal box. I\u2019ve always liked Mexican food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care for some coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He followed her into the kitchen and sat down at the table. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019ve decided,\u201d he said when she brought him his coffee.</p><p>It was all she could do not to demand he tell her right then and there. Waiting even one more minute seemed too long. She pulled out the chair across from him and sat down. She was so anxious, her hands were trembling and she clasped them in her lap, not wanting to give herself away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of thinking since the last time we spoke,\u201d he began.</p><p>If the lines around his eyes and mouth were any indication, his thoughts had been serious indeed. It didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d slept much in the past week. For that matter, neither had she.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t been an easy decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cBefore I say anything else, there are a few things I\u2019d like to get straight. Once I do, you may change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that,\u201d Jamie said confidently.</p><p>His eyes held hers. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. First and foremost, I want full parental privileges. This child will be as much a part of me as he or she is of you.\u201d He spoke forcefully, as though he anticipated an argument.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what exactly do you mean by parental privileges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a say in how the child will be raised, as much of a say as you. That means when it comes time to choose a preschool, I\u2019ll expect you to confer with me. I don\u2019t want you moving out of the area, either. At least not without me being informed and in full agreement, but I can tell you right now, I won\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said hesitantly. The only reason she\u2019d even brought up the subject of moving was to simplify the situation for him. It wasn\u2019t what she wanted at all. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting started. If we go ahead with this, I want visitation rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I have no intention of hiding the child from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I understood earlier,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI ...know. I should have thought this through more carefully before I approached you. I\u2019d come up with the idea of you being the baby\u2019s father the same night I talked to you. When I showed up at your place, the idea was only half formed.\u201d</p><p>Rich seemed cold and distant. It was almost as if they were negotiating something highly controversial and there was no room for friendliness. No room for personal feelings.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...no, just that I hadn\u2019t worked everything out as extensively as I should have before I came to you. It hadn\u2019t dawned on me that you\u2019d care one way or the other about the child. I realize now how insensitive that was of me. I apologize for that, Rich, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d care about the child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. If you want full visitation rights, and a say in how the child\u2019s brought up, then that\u2019s only fair. I have no objections. None whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also going to insist you accept child support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Rich, that really isn\u2019t necessary. I make a decent wage and\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly at the way his eyes hardened.</p><p>\u201cThen the deal\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to compose herself. \u201cSince that\u2019s clearly an important issue to you,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll be willing to accept whatever monetary support you deem necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotional support, as well. I don\u2019t want you walking the floors at night with a colicky baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone me.\u201d</p><p>He was making everything so much more complicated than it needed to be. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to call you over every little thing, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cI want all the arrangements between us clear as glass before the blessed event. We\u2019ll share the responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he asked, \u201cHaving second thoughts yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...really. Is this everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d He stood and opened the oven, checking the casserole that was baking inside. He let the door close slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne small item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne small item,\u201d Jamie repeated, assuming she wouldn\u2019t have any more trouble with this than his other demands.</p><p>\u201cIf we do decide to go ahead and have a child together...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think we should,\u201d she said, smiling over at him.</p><p>\u201cFine. Great. Wonderful. If you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. In that case, I insist we get married.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Jamie was too confused to think clearly. Surely Rich didn\u2019t mean what he\u2019d just said. It made no sense. \u201cMarried...but...you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rarely been more serious in my life,\u201d Rich answered, stalking to the far side of her kitchen. He removed two dinner plates from her cupboard and set them on the table. \u201cNaturally, this wouldn\u2019t be a conventional marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jamie echoed, still too bewildered to understand his reasoning. \u201cThen...why are you insisting on a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the child to have my name. I don\u2019t care if that no longer matters to most people. It matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to maintain our separate residences. For all intents and purposes, nothing will change, at least not outwardly. Except that we\u2019ll be sharing the care and custody of a child.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood in front of the silverware drawer and closed her eyes, trying to force her heart to stop pounding so hard. Rich had made it plain this wasn\u2019t any love match\u2014not that she\u2019d ever suspected it would be. Nevertheless, her heart had reacted fiercely to his insistence on a wedding. Because she couldn\u2019t help associating marriage with love, despite a great deal of evidence to the contrary.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the pregnancy? I mean...how do you think I should get pregnant?\u201d By the time the question was complete, her voice had dwindled to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou could always seduce me.\u201d</p><p>Furious, Jamie whirled around and glared at Rich. She could feel the hot blush warming her cheeks, \u201cI should never have admitted that. You\u2019re going to throw it in my face at every opportunity, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he denied, but his eyes were sparkling with the blue light of laughter. \u201cI agree with you. Sex between us would ruin everything. I don\u2019t want to risk our friendship any more than you do.\u201d</p><p>The tension eased from between Jamie\u2019s shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to keep the marriage a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d If their child was to have his name, they\u2019d eventually have to tell their families. Jamie wasn\u2019t keen on facing her mother with a surprise marriage to go along with a pregnancy. Doris Warren wouldn\u2019t take kindly to being cheated out of a wedding any more than Rich\u2019s mother would.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d only stay married until the baby\u2019s born,\u201d Rich explained, revealing no hint of indecision, and certainly no doubts. He apparently had the whole situation worked out to his own satisfaction.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d completely unsettled Jamie. She\u2019d had everything organized and none of her plans included marriage, even a marriage of convenience. The questions were popping up faster than she could ask them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to say after the baby\u2019s born?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie felt the sudden need to sit down again. \u201cThat we\u2019re getting a divorce?\u201d she repeated. Already she could imagine her mother\u2019s shock and dismay. Not only would Jamie have married without telling her, but she\u2019d be obtaining a divorce.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense once you think about it,\u201d Rich continued with matchless confidence.</p><p>Maybe it did to him, but Jamie felt as though she were wandering through the dark, lost and confused, bumping into walls she didn\u2019t know were there. It had all seemed so simple the night she\u2019d approached Rich.</p><p>He pulled out a chair and placed his foot on the seat, resting his right elbow on his knee. \u201cWe\u2019ll get married at the courthouse as quietly as possible. There\u2019s no reason for anyone to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat much I understand.... I\u2019m just not convinced it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said adamantly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d she muttered, swiping one hand through her hair. What had seemed such an uncomplicated idea had suddenly taken on more twists and turns than a country road.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll agree to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the ink\u2019s dry on the marriage certificate, we can make an appointment with the gynecologist....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, what are we going to tell him?\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t relish that task. If Rich wanted to explain why two healthy, normal, married adults who wanted a baby would choose such an unconventional method, then more power to him.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t tell him anything. He\u2019s a professional\u2014he isn\u2019t going to ask a lot of questions. It\u2019s none of his business, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich... I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you have doubts, then I suggest you spill them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure getting married is the right thing. We don\u2019t have to go through a wedding ceremony for the baby to have your name. Couldn\u2019t you legally adopt him or her after the birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy complicate everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd marriage isn\u2019t going to do that?\u201d Jamie cried.</p><p>\u201cMarriage will accomplish the same thing now without the legal hassles of adoption later. As I said, it\u2019ll be in name only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...\u201d She hesitated, trying to shape her objections in the form of a reasonable argument. When she spoke, her eyes met his. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m terribly old-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who asked me to be a sperm donor? Hardly!\u201d</p><p>Jamie had the feeling it would take a long time to live that down. \u201cYes,\u201d she said vehemently, \u201cI suppose it has to do with my upbringing, but I\u2019ve always considered marriage sacred. Somehow, it just doesn\u2019t feel right to sneak off and get married and...and then arrange for a divorce nine months later.\u201d</p> <p>Rich was quiet for a moment. \u201cI agree,\u201d he finally said, \u201cbut this isn\u2019t a normal marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat marriage is?\u201d Jamie asked, thinking of all the friends she\u2019d known over the years who\u2019d married. Each relationship was different from the others. She\u2019d stood by and observed how some couples had grown closer in their love and commitment. Others had drifted further and further apart until it was too late.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to change, at least not outwardly,\u201d Rich tried to reassure her once again. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the child\u2019s sake. And for yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor mine?\u201d</p><p>Rich\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and when he spoke his voice was cold. \u201cI won\u2019t allow your reputation to be damaged by an out-of-wedlock pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>That was all well and good, but it was her reputation and if she had no objections, then he needn\u2019t be concerned. \u201cBut Rich\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d he said, interrupting her. \u201cI refuse to allow my son or daughter to be born a bastard.\u201d He raised his hand. \u201cBefore you argue with me, I feel the same way about this as I do about the baby having my name. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s important to anyone else. It is to me. Besides, why make a kid\u2019s life any harder than it has to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cStill, I can understand your hesitation.\u201d</p><p>Jamie lowered her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I expect you\u2019ll want to marry someday. Sooner or later a woman\u2019s going to come into your life and this marriage is going to complicate everything for you. What are you going to tell her about me\u2014and the child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Rich\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. If I believed I was eventually going to marry, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>Any doubts Jamie entertained were wiped out with the certainty of his smile.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jamie nodded. She still wasn\u2019t convinced it was the right thing to do, but he\u2019d insisted on it so she felt she had no choice.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Rich said, placing his foot back on the floor.</p><p>There was more? Jamie\u2019s head was still reeling from his last announcement. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re important to me. Our friendship\u2019s important. For the sake of that friendship, I think we should have everything drawn up legally. I don\u2019t want any misunderstandings later on.\u201d</p><p>This seemed logical to Jamie. \u201cOkay, but most of the lawyers I know through work handle real estate and wills and business mergers. This isn\u2019t their kind of contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know an attorney who\u2019ll do it. One I trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames Wilkens, Christy\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>James Wilkens\u2019s office reminded Rich of his youngest sister, Christy. She used to work here, and he\u2019d stopped by a couple of times over the past year to take his sister to lunch. He half expected her to come around the corner at any moment.</p><p>Christy was married to Cody, however, not James. Sheriff Cody Franklin. Rich wasn\u2019t likely to forget how he\u2019d interrupted their wedding night, nor was Cody going to let him forget it. Rich had arrived at her apartment soon after he\u2019d found out about Pamela\u2019s little fling. He\u2019d been disgusted and disheartened, convinced women didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word faithful. He hadn\u2019t included Christy in that, though. Not his little sister; she\u2019d always been so sweet and virtuous. Then, not knowing they were married, he\u2019d stumbled upon her in bed with Cody, and his opinion of women had fallen to an all-time low.</p><p>Sitting in the plushly decorated waiting room next to a five-foot potted philodendron brought back an abundance of memories. The plant was on one side of him, with a fidgeting Jamie on the other.</p><p>He glanced at her. She was flipping through the pages of a magazine so fast she\u2019d created a draft. She was on her third issue of Good Housekeeping and they hadn\u2019t been seated for more than five minutes.</p><p>She remained ambivalent about the idea of marriage, but she wanted the child enough to agree to his terms.</p><p>Unlike Jamie, Rich felt comfortable with the plan, for all the reasons he\u2019d given her. He wasn\u2019t sure what anyone else would think, especially his family\u2014if they ever found out\u2014but frankly that was their problem. He was doing his best friend a favor.</p><p>Rich had the almost overwhelming urge to laugh. Never had he thought he\u2019d agree to anything like this. According to Jason, women gravitated naturally toward him. In some ways that was true, but they were usually the wrong women. What he wouldn\u2019t give to have fallen in love with a woman as genuine and compassionate as Jamie.</p><p>The need to touch her, to reassure her, even in the smallest of ways, was as strong as the urge to laugh had been a few minutes earlier. He reached for her hand, entwining her fingers with his own.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I can\u2019t seem to sit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t at the courthouse, you know. This is a meeting with James. He\u2019s a decent guy, and a darn good attorney. He isn\u2019t going to laugh or make snide remarks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.... It\u2019s just that...\u201d She let the rest of the sentence fade.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why, exactly, but my stomach\u2019s in knots and I can\u2019t seem to read, and I keep thinking of everything that could go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned from him and stared down at the open magazine in her lap. \u201cI ... You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. I know I\u2019ve said that before, but I can\u2019t seem to explain it in a way that you\u2019ll understand. Something happens to a couple when they marry\u2014even when it\u2019s only a marriage of convenience. Something...spiritual. I know you don\u2019t agree with me, but we\u2019re both going to be affected by this. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that deep down we\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to have a physical relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all that,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change what I feel.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was trembling in his, and he could tell from the way her voice quavered that she was close to tears. \u201cDo you want to call it off?\u201d Rich would accede to Jamie\u2019s wishes, but he hoped she wouldn\u2019t back out now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the crazy part,\u201d she said, her expression even more anguished than before. \u201cI want this marriage and our child more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Rich admitted, realizing how true it was. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d James greeted him as he came into the waiting room. Rich stood and they exchanged handshakes. \u201cIt was a pleasant surprise to find your name on my appointment calendar this morning.\u201d The attorney looked from Rich to Jamie, and he smiled warmly.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jamie Warren,\u201d Rich said.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met briefly...a while back,\u201d she said, suddenly biting off her words. She cast an embarrassed glance at Rich, as though she\u2019d made a dreadful blunder. Fortunately James didn\u2019t react at all. It wasn\u2019t until they were inside James\u2019s office that Rich remembered the two of them had been introduced at James and Christy\u2019s engagement party.</p><p>\u201cCome on in and sit down,\u201d James said, motioning toward the two upholstered chairs positioned on the other side of his desk. James, who was of medium height with broad shoulders and a hairline just beginning to recede, had a rather formal manner and a natural reserve.</p><p>Rich knew from mutual acquaintances that he\u2019d taken the broken engagement hard. He\u2019d loved Christy and been deeply wounded when she\u2019d married Cody instead. Rich had heard that James rarely dated. If so, that was a shame. James had a lot to offer a woman. He was a junior partner with the firm these days and his talents were in high demand. It would take one hell of a woman to replace Christy, and Rich could only hope that James would find someone just as special. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d James said, reaching for his pen and a yellow pad, \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Rich leaned back in his chair. \u201cJamie and I would like you to draft a prenuptial agreement.\u201d</p><p>The attorney\u2019s gaze flew to Rich\u2019s. \u201cCongratulations! I\u2019m delighted to hear it. I didn\u2019t know you were engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t...exactly,\u201d Jamie said hurriedly. When James focused his attention on her, she shifted in her chair and gestured at Rich. \u201cYou\u2019d better explain...everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis will be a marriage of convenience,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cA marriage of convenience,\u201d James echoed, as though he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard correctly.</p><p>\u201cThere are...extenuating circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby,\u201d Jamie inserted, then as she realized what she\u2019d implied, her eyes grew wide. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant, at least not yet, but if everything goes according to schedule, I will be in the next couple of months.\u201d</p><p>James lowered his pen. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like a marriage of convenience to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to destroy a perfectly wonderful friendship by having sex,\u201d Jamie declared vehemently, slicing the air with her hands. \u201cWe agreed on that first thing.\u201d</p><p>The pen was carefully placed on the polished mahogany desk. James frowned at Rich, then cleared his throat. \u201cLet me see if I understand this. You plan for Jamie to become pregnant, but there isn\u2019t going to be any sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we go any further, I want the details of the divorce clearly spelled out,\u201d Jamie added, sliding to the edge of her cushioned seat. She slipped her hands under her thighs, but continued to fidget, crossing and un-crossing her ankles. \u201cThey should be as explicitly drawn up as the particulars of the marriage. And by the way, we won\u2019t be living together. But that shouldn\u2019t matter, should it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning the divorce now?\u201d This time, James made a few notations on the pad, frowning again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t expect us to stay married after the baby\u2019s born, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d James gave him a stern look. \u201cWould you kindly explain what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married, having a baby and getting a divorce. A, B, C. Points one, two, three. It\u2019s not nearly as complicated as it sounds.\u201d Rich found he was enjoying this. James, however, obviously wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cA prenuptial agreement\u2014okay, fine. We have several forms already drawn up that you can read over. The two of you can decide which one suits you best and amend it as you see fit. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the baby and the divorce?\u201d Jamie asked nervously. Turning to Rich, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think James understands what we\u2019re planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. The marriage I understand\u2014at least I think I do. Unfortunately it\u2019s everything else that\u2019s got me confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a logical explanation for all this,\u201d Rich assured him.</p><p>\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d Jamie said sharply. \u201cRich insists we marry and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary, but nothing I say will convince him. If I didn\u2019t want a baby so much, I\u2019d never agree to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d Once again, James looked at him, clearly more baffled than ever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as confusing as it seems,\u201d Rich told him a second time. \u201cA bit unconventional, perhaps, but not confusing.\u201d He spent the next ten minutes explaining their plans and answering a long series of questions from the attorney.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds crazy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jamie said when Rich had finished. \u201cYou probably think we both need appointments at a mental-health clinic. I don\u2019t blame you, I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>James took his time answering. He continued making notes, then raised his head to look pointedly at Rich. \u201cAre you sure this is what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Rich shared few of Jamie\u2019s concerns regarding the marriage. It was merely a formality. She kept talking about it as though it were a deep spiritual experience. For some couples, marriage might well be that. But not for Jamie and him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Her head came up sharply.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded emphatically. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>James paused, rolling the pen between his open palms as he collected his thoughts. \u201cDoes your family know about your plans?\u201d The question was directed at Rich.</p><p>He gave a short, scoffing laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking. I don\u2019t intend to let them find out, either. At least not right away. They\u2019ll learn about the marriage and the baby eventually\u2014that much is inevitable. But the longer I can keep this from my parents, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that, I can agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll write up an agreement for us?\u201d Rich asked. He hadn\u2019t missed the subtle note of concern in James\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have one drawn up within a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Rich took Jamie\u2019s hand. They both stood, and she tucked the long strap of her purse over her shoulder. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go off to the courthouse now and apply for the wedding license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I offer you two a bit of advice?\u201d James asked, standing himself. He rubbed the side of his jaw as if he hadn\u2019t decided exactly what he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Jamie\u2019s tone suggested that she hoped someone would talk her out of this scheme. If that was the case, Rich would be the first to remind her that she was the one who\u2019d started the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write up whatever you want me to,\u201d James said thoughtfully, \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any reason to rush into anything. You\u2019ve both waited this long to have a family\u2014a few more months isn\u2019t going to make any difference.\u201d</p><p>Rich looked to Jamie for confirmation, but he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d he promised.</p><p>James nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call later in the week and you can stop by and read over the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Rich steered Jamie toward the door, although she didn\u2019t need any encouragement. She seemed downright eager to escape. \u201cI\u2019ll be talking to you soon then,\u201d Rich said over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d James promised.</p><p>Jamie was quiet on the way to the parking lot. For that matter, so was he. Although James Wilkens hadn\u2019t explicitly stated his misgivings, they were all too apparent\u2014from the questions he\u2019d asked and the hesitation Rich had heard in his voice.</p><p>Rich unlocked the passenger door and held it open for Jamie. He waited until she was inside, his hand on the frame. \u201cDo you want to take some time to think this over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said instantly. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and held until they were both smiling broadly.</p><p>Rich woke early Tuesday morning, before the alarm went off. He turned on the shower and stepped under the plummeting spray, enjoying the feel of it against his skin. He was whistling cheerfully when the tune slowly faded, one note at a time.</p><p>He quickly finished showering, reached for a towel and headed directly from the bathroom to the phone at his bedside. He punched out the number from memory and waited impatiently for Jamie to answer.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d came her groggy reply.</p><p>\u201cYou know what today is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. It isn\u2019t every day a woman gets married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird and fourth if you want the truth, but now that I\u2019ve had a chance to think it over, I\u2019m more certain than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He\u2019d grown anxious in the shower, convinced Jamie would change her mind at the last minute. He had to be assured one final time, although they\u2019d talked of little else in the past week.</p><p>James had contacted him Friday afternoon, and Rich had stopped at the attorney\u2019s office on his way home from work. The agreement was several pages long, but when he asked for the bill, James had insisted it was a wedding present. The gesture took Rich by surprise. James was the only person who knew what they intended, and he was acting as though this was a conventional marriage. Of all people, James was well aware exactly how unconventional it was going to be.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re nuts, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James had responded with a wry grin. \u201cI think you\u2019re both in love and just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s comment had caught Rich off guard. He would never have taken the attorney for a romantic.</p><p>I think you\u2019re both in love and just don\u2019t know it yet. On this, the morning of his wedding, Rich tested James Wilken\u2019s theory once again. Sure, he loved Jamie, but not in the sense James implied. They were friends. Pals. Not lovers. Not soulmates. Just friends.</p><p>\u201cHave you arranged for a witness?\u201d Jamie asked, pulling Rich out of his reverie.</p><p>\u201cA witness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich\u2014\u201d she groaned \u201c\u2014don\u2019t you remember? When we applied for the license, we were told we\u2019d each need to bring a witness. What do you plan to do, drag in someone from outside the judge\u2019s chambers?\u201d</p><p>Rich thought about it for a moment. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the ring,\u201d she said, beginning to sound nervous.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the ceremony\u2019s over, I\u2019ll return it.\u201d Rich intended to use a small diamond that had once belonged to his grandmother. Jamie had objected, until she\u2019d hit upon the idea of returning it after the ceremony. Wearing a diamond would raise too many questions, she\u2019d decided. The only reason they even needed one was for the exchange of vows.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to be your witness?\u201d</p><p>Jamie paused. She couldn\u2019t very well ask any of her friends. \u201cI ... I\u2019m not sure yet. I was thinking of Margie from New Accounts. Margie can keep a secret. But then I thought it might not be a good idea if anyone from the bank knew I was getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d he asked, mimicking her words. \u201cDrag in someone from outside the judge\u2019s chambers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d she returned, and laughed. It had been at least a week since Rich had heard her laugh. It encouraged him, and he chuckled, too.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>Their biggest concern was that one or more of their family members would somehow find out that they\u2019d applied for a marriage license.</p><p>In his worst nightmare Rich could envision his mother sobbing hysterically, interrupting the ceremony. She\u2019d be furious that he was marrying Jamie without the large church wedding she\u2019d looked forward to having for Taylor and Christy. Both of Rich\u2019s sisters had chosen small private weddings without any family present. For that matter, so had Paul. And he was doing the same thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The family honor now rested in Jason\u2019s hands.</p><p>Jason.</p><p>\u201cRich.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice cut into his thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll have a witness.\u201d</p><p>Rich got dressed in a hurry, his movements filled with purpose.</p> <p>He grabbed his raincoat on his way out the door and found himself whistling once more as he unlocked his car. He checked his watch and realized he had plenty of time. More time than he knew what to do with.</p><p>He drove to his brother\u2019s veterinary hospital in the south end of Seattle. There he saw three people in the waiting room. Two in the section marked Dogs and one little old lady clinging tightly to her cat on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cIs Jason in?\u201d he asked the receptionist.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with a Saint Bernard, but he\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Jason appeared five minutes later. He wore a white lab coat, but underneath, Rich knew he had on jeans and a T-shirt.</p> <p>\u201cRich, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you take an hour off later today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou buying me lunch?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I need you to be the best man at my wedding.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Jamie was at the courthouse at the agreed-upon time, pacing the corridor outside Judge Webster\u2019s chambers. Ten to two.</p> <p>She was there, but Rich wasn\u2019t.</p><p>If he left her standing at the altar\u2014so to speak\u2014she\u2019d personally see to his tar and feathering.</p><p>She called his cell phone. No answer.</p><p>For the tenth time, she checked her watch.</p><p>Seven minutes late. The man would pay for this.</p><p>A woman Jamie assumed was the judge\u2019s secretary stepped into the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s almost two. The judge can see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...hello,\u201d Jamie said, giving the middle-aged woman her brightest smile. \u201cMy... The man I\u2019m going to marry seems to have been detained. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She glanced at her watch as though to say the judge was a busy man.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here,\u201d she repeated. A slow death would be too good for Rich Manning if he wasn\u2019t. \u201cI was wondering...when Rich does arrive, would it be possible for you to be my witness?\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have left it to the last minute like this, but she hadn\u2019t known who to ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The gray-haired woman returned Jamie\u2019s smile. \u201cLet me know as soon as your young man shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie tried his cell again, and again he didn\u2019t answer. She resumed her pacing. She\u2019d made the mistake of asking for the whole day off. If she\u2019d only taken half a day, she wouldn\u2019t have all this time to contemplate what she was doing. In the last five minutes she\u2019d vacillated between thinking marriage was the best solution and feeling convinced that it was the most foolish decision she\u2019d ever made.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d Breathless, Rich came around the corner at a half run.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she cried, her voice cracking under the strain. She was caught halfway between abject relief and total fury. Halfway between hope and despair, trapped in a world of nagging questions and second thoughts.</p><p>Rich pulled her into his arms and hugged her close. His breathing was labored, as though he\u2019d raced up several flights of stairs. \u201cI got stuck in traffic.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was about to chastise him for not allowing enough time, but she swallowed her irritation. What did it matter? He was there now. Suddenly she felt a relief so great all she wanted to do was wrap her arms around him and weep.</p><p>\u201cJudge Webster\u2019s secretary said we should go into his office as soon as you arrived,\u201d she said, composing herself.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. We have to wait for my witness,\u201d Rich said, smiling down at her. His beautiful blue gaze was filled with a teasing light.</p><p>\u201cYou actually brought someone with you? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Jason Manning said, hurrying around the same corner Rich had a moment earlier. He, too, was out of breath. \u201cRich left me to park the car,\u201d he said, pressing his hand over his heart. \u201cSaid if he was late for his wedding, you\u2019d skin him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was right, too.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze flew to Rich, whose expression was both tender and amused. He\u2019d brought family! They\u2019d discussed the subject at length and had agreed not to let any of their immediate relatives in on their plans. Not until it was necessary, which they\u2019d calculated would be when Jamie entered the fifth or sixth month of her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cBringing Jason seemed like a good idea at the time,\u201d Rich said with a chagrined look. \u201cHe spent half the morning arguing with me. According to Jason, we\u2019re both candidates for the loony bin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to tell anyone, remember?\u201d They\u2019d decided that the fewer people who were in on this, the better. But at the rate Rich was telling people, Jamie wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see her picture splashed across the front of a grocery-store tabloid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jason inserted smoothly, \u201cI\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything later,\u201d Rich promised in a low voice. He draped his arm over her shoulder and inhaled noisily, as though he still needed to catch his breath. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019ve got a wedding to attend.\u201d</p><p>Jamie knew the ceremony itself wouldn\u2019t last more than a few minutes; she\u2019d taken comfort in that. They\u2019d be in and out of the judge\u2019s chambers in five minutes, ten at the most.</p><p>They stood before Judge Webster, their backs stiff and straight. The judge attempted to reassure them with a smile.</p><p>Jamie needed to be reassured. Her knees were shaking, her hands trembled and she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to go through with this.</p><p>When it came time to repeat her vows, she hesitated and raised her eyes to Rich. How could she promise to love him and honor him for the rest of their lives, knowing full well their marriage wouldn\u2019t last the year?</p><p>Rich must have read her confusion and her fears. Some unfathomable emotion flickered in his eyes, and she wondered if he was experiencing the same doubts. When his hold on her hand tightened, Jamie was grateful. She felt the need to be close to him. She didn\u2019t know why, any more than she understood the reason she\u2019d agreed to go through with this wedding ceremony.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice shook, then steadied and grew strong. Her heart was pounding, then gradually returned to a normal, even beat. She realized that the calmness she felt, the serenity, had come from Rich. His eyes didn\u2019t leave her, and his own voice was confident and sure.</p><p>They exchanged rings, his hand holding hers as he slipped the delicate diamond that had belonged to his grandmother onto Jamie\u2019s finger. He revealed no hesitation. Once the ring was secure, her gaze slowly traveled up to his face. She stopped at his eyes, so blue and clear. They were just as steady as his hand.</p><p>The judge pronounced them husband and wife, and with a naturalness Jamie didn\u2019t question, Rich drew her into his embrace. Her hands gripped his shoulders as he lowered his mouth to hers. To the best of Jamie\u2019s memory, this was the first time they\u2019d kissed, really kissed.</p><p>Rich made it worth the wait.</p><p>His mouth slid possessively over hers, coaxing open her lips. His own were warm and moist, gentle and teasing, giving and demanding.</p><p>Jamie was overwhelmed by the variety of sensations he evoked. She felt light-headed and giddy. Appreciated and adored. It seemed that her entire world had been inadvertently turned upside down and she was groping to find her balance.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t feel this way, she told herself. She shouldn\u2019t be feeling any of these sensations. Rich didn\u2019t love her\u2014not like this. Nothing like this. One kiss, and he made her feel as though she\u2019d never been kissed before, as though she\u2019d never experienced love before.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t. Maybe this was all in her imagination, her mind creating a warm romantic fantasy in order to appease her conscience. Maybe this was a subconscious effort to wipe out the ambivalence she\u2019d felt during the ceremony.</p><p>The sound of Rich\u2019s older brother clearing his throat brought Jamie back to reality. Rich\u2014her husband\u2014reluctantly let her go and just as reluctantly turned his attention to Judge Webster. The two men exchanged handshakes.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for being my witness,\u201d Jamie said to Judge Webster\u2019s secretary. She never did catch the woman\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI was pleased to do it,\u201d the secretary told her. She stepped forward and gave Jamie an impulsive hug. \u201cThe judge marries a number of couples every year, but I have a good feeling about you and your young man. I think you two are going to be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t know what to say. She felt like the biggest phony who\u2019d ever lived. It was happening already\u2014the very thing she\u2019d tried to warn Rich about. The feeling of connection. She\u2019d sensed it during the ceremony and even more so with his kiss. But their marriage wasn\u2019t supposed to be about any kind of spiritual or emotional connection. It was supposed to be a convenience, a legal shortcut to giving Jamie what she wanted\u2014a child.</p><p>They were making a mockery of everything marriage was meant to be. Jamie had never felt more like crying in her life.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to convince herself they were doing the right thing. Rich was so confident, so certain, and she believed him because...because she\u2019d always believed him.</p><p>But if they were doing what was right, why was her stomach in knots? Why did she feel as though she was going to burst into tears? And why, oh why, had Rich kissed her the way a husband kisses his wife\u2014the most cherished wife in the world?</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Jason said, moving toward her.</p><p>She tried to smile, but her mouth started quivering and tears fell from the corners of her eyes, running down the sides of her face.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d Jason asked, giving her a hug. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t know how Jason managed it, but within minutes they were out of Judge Webster\u2019s chambers and Rich was at her side, his arm around her middle.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said gently, guiding her down the hall, \u201cwhy the tears?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed her hand across her cheeks, suspecting she\u2019d smeared mascara over her face in the process. She\u2019d dressed so carefully in her new pale pink suit. Like a romantic fool, she\u2019d had her hair styled and nails manicured\u2014and for what? So she could stand before God and man and say vows they\u2019d never be able to keep.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly want to know what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she wailed, snapping open her purse and rummaging around for a tissue. She found one, tucked her handbag under her arm and noisily blew her nose. \u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t guessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I feel dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rich looked completely bewildered.</p><p>\u201cBecause I just lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He sounded even more confused.</p><p>\u201cHow can you justify what we did? We stood before Judge Webster and said vows. Vows! Vows are serious. We made promises to each other, promises neither one of us intends to keep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for you, but I certainly intend to honor my vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Jamie muttered sarcastically, rubbing her hand beneath her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love me in...in sickness and health and everything else you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rich didn\u2019t so much as blink.</p><p>\u201cHow...can you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue, this might not be a traditional marriage. Nevertheless, it is a marriage. And like I said, I fully intend to honor every promise I made for the full duration of the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she asked on the tail end of a sniffle.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I suppose so. It\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t thought about it like that. I do love you, you know...as a friend.\u201d</p><p>As Rich walked her toward the elevator, his hands were clasped behind his back and his head was bent. Ever diplomatic, Jason remained a few steps behind them. \u201cThe problem,\u201d Rich said, \u201cis that we\u2019ve each put years of effort into finding the perfect mate. We\u2019ve spent years looking for that special person\u2014someone we\u2019d be willing to commit the rest of our lives to\u2014but neither of us found what we were looking for. So when we stood before Judge Webster...\u201d He hesitated as though he\u2019d lost his train of thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we were pledging...the seriousness of our decision hit us hard,\u201d Jamie finished for him.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Rich agreed, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThen you felt it, too?\u201d She stopped walking and turned to face him, her heart in her throat. Rich had experienced the same reaction she had while they were repeating their vows. He, too, had felt the solemnness of it all.</p><p>\u201cI did...very much,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA wedding ceremony is a sobering affair. If you didn\u2019t understand it before, I want to make it clear now. I\u2019m committed to you, Jamie. That commitment will be the same for the baby once he\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she,\u201d Jamie murmured, gnawing on her lower lip. Rich had said as much before, only she hadn\u2019t understood it. He planned to provide financial support for their child and emotional support for her. He\u2019d also insisted they marry so the child would bear his name. But she hadn\u2019t thought of that as a commitment until he\u2019d put it in those terms. A sense of contentment stole through her.</p><p>They continued walking side by side, toward the elevator, which was at the far end of the corridor. Rich matched his stride to hers. He was several inches taller than Jamie, and every once in a while, his shoulder would brush against her. His touch felt intimate and special. Jamie was sure he didn\u2019t intend or expect her to feel anything at his touch, but she did. She couldn\u2019t help herself.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked when they stopped to wait for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cNot if our parents find out, it won\u2019t be,\u201d Jason answered for Rich.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t anytime soon unless you tell them.\u201d There was a clear warning in Rich\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jason said, raising his right hand. \u201cI\u2019ve already promised not to say a word\u2014to anyone. Mom and Dad would have to torture it out of me.\u201d</p><p>Rich chuckled and slowly shook his head. \u201cAll Mom would need to do is offer you homemade bread fresh from the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so. But be aware that the fur\u2019s gonna fly once she learns she missed out on another one of her kids\u2019 weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll adjust,\u201d Rich said, looping his arm over Jamie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you as full as I am?\u201d Rich asked, leaning back against the upholstered circular booth. His hands rested on his flat stomach and he breathed in deeply.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t eat another bite if I tried.\u201d</p><p>Rich had made reservations for their wedding dinner at the restaurant on top of the world-famous Space Needle. He\u2019d planned every aspect of their wedding-day celebration, from the matinee tickets he\u2019d purchased for a musical at the Fifth Avenue Theater, to a special dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Jason mean when he said you kidnapped him?\u201d she asked. Not that it really mattered, she thought, basking in the pleasures of the most memorable day of her life.</p><p>Rich reached for the wine bottle and replenished both their glasses. \u201cTo be honest, I did kidnap him. Why...is another story. I\u2019m not sure myself, especially when I knew he\u2019d try to talk me out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did try, didn\u2019t he?\u201d That went without saying.</p><p>\u201cNot at first.\u201d Rich arched a brow as though he was still a bit surprised by that. \u201cHe actually seemed excited\u2014until he heard the full details.\u201d</p><p>Jamie groaned. \u201cYou told him...everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d Rich picked up his wineglass and sipped. \u201cWhen I first told him about you and me, he was thrilled. He said he\u2019s always admired you and felt I couldn\u2019t have made a better choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d Jamie couldn\u2019t help feeling a little incredulous. She barely knew Rich\u2019s older brother. Oh, they\u2019d met on several occasions, but the longest conversation they\u2019d ever had was at Christy\u2019s engagement party, and that couldn\u2019t have lasted more than five minutes. Jason had been miserable in a suit and tie, and kept edging his finger along the inside of his collar. Actually, Jamie had spent more time that night talking to Jason than she had to Rich. Her now-husband had escorted some blonde to the elegant affair, and the woman had stayed glued to his side all evening.</p><p>A surge of irritation flashed through her. She\u2019d never been keen on Rich\u2019s choice of girlfriends. She swore he could spot a bimbo a mile away.</p><p>He attracted them\u2014and he attracted her.</p><p>That was a brand-new perception, a brand-new awareness.</p><p>Until he\u2019d kissed her in the judge\u2019s office, Jamie had never thought of Rich in a physical way. He\u2019d always been attractive, too handsome for his own good. But what she\u2019d experienced earlier that afternoon had nothing to do with his looks. Instead, it had a whole lot to do with sensuality.</p><p>Rich made her feel vulnerable. Exposed. Powerless. And yet...powerful, too. Everything, all the emotion, all the sensations, had come rushing toward her at once.</p><p>Afterward, he\u2019d been so concerned. So understanding. Allaying her fears, answering her doubts. He\u2019d dried her tears and made her laugh. He\u2019d turned this into the most special day of her life.</p><p>What he\u2019d said about how they\u2019d each searched for someone to love was true. Jamie had wanted to be married for so many years. She\u2019d hungered for that special relationship and all that went with it, only to be disappointed time after time.</p><p>Their dinner check arrived, and while Rich dealt with that, Jamie finished her wine. As she raised the glass to her lips, her gaze fell on the diamond ring on her left hand. It was a simple design, a small diamond set in the center of an antique gold rose. When Rich had first mentioned it, she hadn\u2019t felt right about wearing it, but the fit was perfect, and now that it was on her finger she wished she didn\u2019t have to take it off.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should drive you home.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s heart soared at the reluctance she heard in his voice. She wasn\u2019t any more eager for this day to end than he was.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she said with an equal lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou have to work tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, too.</p><p>They stood, and Rich helped her on with her coat. His hands lingered on her shoulders, and he drew her back against him and breathed in deeply. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Jamie twisted around, and the restaurant noises that surrounded them\u2014the laughter and conversation, the clinking of silverware on china\u2014seemed to fade away.</p><p>\u201cFor marrying me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor agreeing to bear my child.\u201d</p><p>Jamie pulled the straight skirt over her hips and clipped it to the hanger. She hung it in her closet along with the jacket, then wandered into the kitchen as the teakettle whistled.</p><p>Sitting at the table in her full-length slip, she propped her nylon-covered feet on the opposite chair and cradled the mug of hot tea in both hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married,\u201d she said aloud, testing the words.</p><p>They came back sounding hollow, as hollow as she felt. She hadn\u2019t wanted Rich to leave\u2014not so soon. It was barely ten. But when she\u2019d offered him an excuse to stay, he\u2019d turned her down.</p><p>So this was her wedding night. In her dreams she\u2019d created a magical fantasy of champagne and romance. See-through nighties and wild, abandoned passion. If this was a traditional marriage, she\u2019d have all that. Instead, she\u2019d chosen something else. Something far less.</p><p>She should be happy. Excited. In love.</p><p>She was all those things\u2014in a manner of speaking. Then why, she asked herself, did the aching loneliness weigh so heavily on her heart?</p><p>Rich bent the thick goose-down pillow in half and bunched it beneath his head. Rolling over, he glanced at the clock radio and sighed. Nearly one. The alarm was set for five-thirty and he had yet to fall asleep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t every day a man got married, he reminded himself. It wasn\u2019t every man who spent his wedding night alone, either.</p><p>Rich had dropped Jamie off at her condo, and although she\u2019d suggested he come in for coffee, he\u2019d refused. He didn\u2019t even know why he\u2019d turned her down. Coffee had sounded good.</p><p>\u201cBe honest,\u201d Rich said aloud. It wasn\u2019t the coffee that had enticed him, it was Jamie. She wasn\u2019t the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever met. But she was lovely. It seemed impossible to him that he\u2019d missed it all these years. Was he blind?</p><p>He\u2019d had beautiful. Pamela was beauty-queen gorgeous\u2014and so empty inside, so lacking in values and morals, that he had to wonder what had attracted him in the first place. She\u2019d appealed to his vanity, no doubt.</p><p>Rich rolled onto his back, tucked his hands beneath his head and stared up at the dark ceiling. It hadn\u2019t felt right to leave Jamie. With real disappointment, he\u2019d turned around and walked to his parked car. He\u2019d paused halfway down the steps, resisting the urge to rush back and tell her he\u2019d changed his mind, he\u2019d take that coffee, after all.</p><p>Instead he\u2019d returned to an apartment that had never seemed emptier and a bed that had never felt so cold.</p><p>The phone on Rich\u2019s desk rang, and he automatically reached for it. \u201cEngineering.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes from the drawings he was reviewing.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d came the soft feminine reply.</p><p>Rich straightened. \u201cJamie? You\u2019re back from the doctor\u2019s already?\u201d He checked his watch and was surprised to discover it was nearly four.</p><p>\u201cI just got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the eagerness out of his voice. They\u2019d already had one appointment to see Dr. Fullerton. Rich had gone in with Jamie for the initial visit. They\u2019d sat next to each other in Dr. Fullerton\u2019s private office and held hands while the gynecologist explained the procedure in detail.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Jamie said quietly, confidently, \u201cwe\u2019re going to try for this month.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis month,\u201d Rich repeated. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know, I\u2019ve always been fond of March. March is one of my favorite months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. It...it might not take, it generally doesn\u2019t with the first try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril, then. April\u2019s a good month. Another one of my all-time favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could easily be three or four months,\u201d Jamie said with a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cJune, July, August. Who can argue with summer?\u201d Rich found himself smiling, too. He was calculating what month the baby would be due if Jamie got pregnant in March.</p><p>\u201cDecember,\u201d she said, apparently interpreting his silence. \u201cHow would you feel about a December baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJubilant. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be January or February.\u201d She sounded hesitant, as though she was afraid to put too much stock in everything going so smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll happen when it happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was profound!\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctor gave me a chart. Every morning, I\u2019m supposed to take my temperature. It\u2019ll be slightly elevated when I ovulate. As soon as that happens, I\u2019m to contact his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich, that really isn\u2019t necessary. It\u2019s very sweet of you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew better than to argue with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should,\u201d she said with mock exasperation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married nearly a month and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve won a single argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder married life agrees with me.\u201d He kept his voice low, wanting to be sure no one in the vicinity could overhear him. Only Jason knew he was married and he wanted to keep it that way as long as possible. \u201cCall me in the morning,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair, \u201cI want to keep my own chart.\u201d</p><p>The following morning, Rich was in the shower when his phone rang. He turned off the faucet, grabbed a towel and raced across the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d he yelled into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cNinety-eight point six.\u201d</p><p>He pulled open the drawer on his nightstand and searched blindly for a pen. Water was raining down from his hair, dripping onto the bed. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p> <p>Wednesday morning, Rich waited in bed until he heard from her.</p><p>\u201cNinety-eight point six.\u201d She sounded discouraged.</p><p>\u201cHey, nothing says it has to happen right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep trying to visualize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Think yourself pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me tomorrow.\u201d He reached for his chart and made the notation.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Thursday showed no difference, but Friday, Rich knew from the tone of her voice that something was up, and he hoped it was her temperature.</p><p>\u201cNinety-eight point seven... I think. Darn, these thermometers are hard to read. But it\u2019s definitely higher.\u201d</p><p>Rich could envision her sitting on the edge of her bed, squinting, trying to read the tiny lines that marked the thermometer. He made a mental note to buy her a digital one.</p><p>\u201cCall Dr. Fullerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich, I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s elevated. It could be wishful thinking on my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He hung up the phone and headed toward the shower, whistling.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until later that afternoon that the idea of taking her out to dinner occurred to him. Although they\u2019d been married a month, they didn\u2019t see each other often. It had been a conscious decision on Rich\u2019s part following their wedding day. In light of how he\u2019d felt when he kissed her, it seemed the safest thing to do. He\u2019d taken her to a movie the weekend after their wedding, and they\u2019d both been ill at ease. Foolish as it seemed, it was almost as if they were afraid of each other. Not once during the entire movie had they touched. Jamie didn\u2019t invite him in for coffee afterward. Even now he wasn\u2019t sure what he would\u2019ve done had she offered.</p><p>Still, they talked every day. Only last weekend he\u2019d changed the oil in her car while she sewed a couple of loose buttons on his shirts. It was a fair exchange and afterward they\u2019d gone out for hamburgers. Nothing fancy. The tension between them didn\u2019t seem to be as great as when they\u2019d gone to the movie.</p><p>It was time to try again. There could well be a reason to celebrate, and a night on the town appealed to him. Someplace special. It wasn\u2019t every day his wife\u2019s temperature was elevated by one tenth of one percent.</p><p>Jamie was on her lunch break, and Rich didn\u2019t leave a message. He\u2019d call her later.</p><p>When he did, she was tied up with a customer. The next time he tried, the bank was closed, so he left a message for her at home.</p><p>\u201cThis is Prince Charming requesting your presence for dinner. Don\u2019t eat until you talk to me. I\u2019m on my way home now. Call me there.\u201d</p><p>Rich expected a message from Jamie to be waiting for him when he arrived at his apartment. There wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He tried her again at six, six-fifteen, six-thirty and six-forty-five, leaving a message all four times.</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock, he was worried. A thousand possibilities crowded his mind, none of them pleasant. He paced the living room in an effort to convince himself he was overreacting, then dialed her number one last time. He listened to her recording yet again, and seethed anxiously during the long beep.</p><p>\u201cJamie, where the hell are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Six</p><p>Jamie checked her watch, keeping her wrist below the table, hoping she wasn\u2019t being obvious. Eight-thirty! She\u2019d been trapped listening to the endless details of Floyd Bacon\u2019s divorce for three solid hours.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d he asked, looking over at her.</p><p>She nodded, although she had no idea what she was agreeing to. A yawn came and she attempted to swallow it, didn\u2019t succeed and tactfully pressed her fingers to her lips. Floyd was such a nice man and she was trying hard to disguise her boredom.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, look at the time,\u201d Floyd said.</p><p>It had all started so innocently.</p><p>Jamie had dated Floyd about five years ago. He was a regular customer at the bank and they\u2019d seen each other off and on for a six-month period. Nothing serious, nothing even close to serious. Then he\u2019d met Carolyn and the two of them had fallen in love and married. Jamie had attended their wedding. She remembered what she bought them for a wedding gift\u2014a set of stainless steel flatware with rosebuds on the handles. He and Carolyn had bought a house a few months later. Jamie had handled the loan application for them, but when they\u2019d moved, they\u2019d switched their account to a branch closer to where they lived. In the past three years, Carolyn had quit work to stay home with their two young children.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am the marriage didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Jamie said, wondering what could possibly have gone wrong between two people who so obviously loved each other. She would never have suspected this would happen to Floyd and Carolyn, of all people. Of all couples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d Floyd said. His dark eyes touched her with their sadness. He\u2019d moved into an apartment and had stopped at the bank to open a checking account. But a new account was only a pretext, Jamie soon learned; for airing his frustration with Carolyn, his marriage, his two preschool children and life in general.</p><p>Floyd had arrived just before closing time, lingered until he was the last customer in the bank and then asked Jamie to join him for a drink. She\u2019d hesitated, but he\u2019d looked so downtrodden and miserable that she\u2019d gone against her better judgment. A drink soon turned into two and then Floyd suggested they have something to eat. At the time, it had seemed reasonable, but that was an hour and a half ago.</p><p>\u201cI really should be going home,\u201d she said, reaching for her purse. It was Friday night and the work week had seemed extra-long and she was tired. Keeping track of her temperature and charting it was draining her emotional energy.</p><p>No, she decided, talking to Rich every morning was responsible for that. Speaking to him first thing, discussing the intimate details of her reproductive system, hearing his enthusiasm...talking about their child. Nothing had prepared her for the effect all this was having. She lived for those brief two-minute calls. It was almost as if he were in bed beside her...almost as if he were holding her in his arms. This closeness she felt toward him frightened her. The magnitude of what they\u2019d done, of what they were planning, the child they\u2019d conceive together, had brought subtle and not-so-subtle changes to their relationship.</p><p>Earlier in the day she\u2019d hoped and planned to have a relaxing Friday night\u2014to soak in a hot bath and cuddle up in bed with a good book. She might have given Rich a call and invited him over for dinner. There was a new recipe she wanted to try and he seemed to enjoy her home-cooked meals. She\u2019d only seen him twice in the past month, and it didn\u2019t seem enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you home,\u201d Floyd said, breaking into her thoughts. He tossed some money on the table for the waitress.</p><p>It would be too late to call Rich now. Tomorrow was her Saturday morning to work, but she could call him then and ask him over for dinner on either Saturday or Sunday. Friday nights were probably busy for him, so it wasn\u2019t likely he would\u2019ve been home anyway.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My mind was a million miles away. There\u2019s no need for you to see me home, Floyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019d feel better if I knew you got there safely.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Floyd really was a nice man, and she did feel sorry for him. If lending an ear had helped him, she shouldn\u2019t complain. The time would come soon enough when she\u2019d need a shoulder to cry on herself. Once the baby was born, she\u2019d be filing for divorce. The thought was a cheerless one.</p><p>Jamie lived less than fifteen minutes from the bank and it was on Floyd\u2019s way to his new apartment, so she didn\u2019t object strongly when he insisted on following her.</p><p>When she pulled into her assigned parking space, he waited until she was out of her car. She waved to let him know she was safe and sound.</p><p>Floyd lowered his car window and said, \u201cI appreciate being able to talk to you, Jamie. You\u2019re a good friend to both Carolyn and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy if I was any help.\u201d</p><p>The sadness returned to Floyd\u2019s eyes. \u201cI really love her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. She believed him. Divorce was usually so ugly and there was so much pain involved. Jamie had seen several of her friends traumatized by the breakup of their marriages.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you really want this divorce?\u201d she asked impulsively. Surely if two people deeply loved each other, they could work something out, couldn\u2019t they?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI never did want a divorce. Carolyn\u2019s the one who...well, you know.\u201d His shoulders rose in a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Floyd hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure. When I told her I was moving out, she didn\u2019t say a word to stop me. The way I figure it, if she really loved me, she would\u2019ve asked me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she assumed that if you really loved her, you\u2019d never want to move?\u201d</p><p>Floyd stared at her. \u201cYou think that\u2019s what she might\u2019ve thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s worth asking, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah... I do,\u201d Floyd said, his voice revealing the first enthusiasm she\u2019d heard all evening. He raised his car window, then quickly lowered it again. \u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She was halfway toward the outside stairs that led to her second-floor condominium.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I used your phone? My cell\u2019s dead, and I\u2019d like to give Carolyn a call to see if she wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Smiling, she opened her purse and took out her key. If she\u2019d mentioned this earlier she thought wryly, she might\u2019ve been home two hours ago.</p><p>Floyd parked his car, then hurried up the stairs with her. He resembled a young boy, he was so eager. She unlocked the door and flipped on the light switch. Floyd immediately headed for her phone.</p> <p>Jamie made herself scarce for a couple of minutes, going into her bedroom to remove her shoes. She hung up her jacket and eased her gray blouse from her waistband. Before leaving her bedroom, she slipped her feet into her fuzzy open-toed slippers. Then she went into the kitchen and put the kettle on the burner. As soon as Floyd was gone, she planned to relax with a cup of herbal tea.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn agrees we should talk,\u201d Floyd announced triumphantly as he replaced the telephone receiver. \u201cShe sounded pleased to hear from me. Do you think she\u2019s lonely? I doubt it,\u201d he answered his own question before Jamie had a chance. \u201cCarolyn always did have lots of friends, and she isn\u2019t one to sit home and cry in her soup, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cI hope this works out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I\u2019ll be heading out now,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a sitter for the kids and she\u2019s going to meet me for a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed then, in long impatient bursts. Floyd\u2019s gaze swung to Jamie. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d be arriving this late.</p><p>She walked past Floyd and opened her door. No sooner had she turned the lock than Rich raced in as though he was there to put out a fire.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve been half out of my\u2014\u201d He stopped midstep and midsentence when he caught sight of Floyd and the color drained from his face. His eyes widened with shock, disbelief and...could it be pain? Slowly he turned toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cFloyd, this is Rich Manning,\u201d she said, gesturing from one to the other. \u201cRich, Floyd Bacon.\u201d</p><p>Floyd held out his hand, and for a moment, Jamie feared Rich wasn\u2019t going to take it. He did so, but with ill grace. \u201cI take it Jamie didn\u2019t mention me,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cAh...no,\u201d Floyd said, rubbing his palms together. He eyed the front door. \u201cListen, I was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to rush,\u201d Rich said, sitting down on the sofa and crossing his long legs. He stretched his arm against the back of the cushions, giving the impression that he had plenty of time to sit and chat. \u201cI\u2019m interested in hearing how the two of you spent the evening.\u201d His smile lacked warmth or welcome.</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d Jamie said, stepping forward. She\u2019d never seen him like this, so sarcastic and ill-mannered.</p><p>One look from him cut her to the quick. Rarely had anyone looked at her with such...disdain. He studied her, from her slippers to the blouse she\u2019d pulled free from her skirt, and his eyes narrowed, damning her.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2019s an old friend,\u201d Floyd explained. \u201cI was in the bank this afternoon and...well, you see, my wife and I have separated, and Jamie\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re married, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo?\u201d Frowning, Floyd turned to Jamie for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rich said in a deceptively calm voice. \u201cJamie and I\u2019ve been married...what is it now, darling, a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d she warned him under her breath. He might be her legal husband, a man she\u2019d known and respected for more than a decade, but seeing him behave like this, talk like this, he seemed like a total stranger.</p><p>\u201cJamie. My goodness,\u201d Floyd said, sounding astonished. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say a word about being married. Congratulations! I wish you\u2019d said something earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Rich added caustically.</p><p>Once again Floyd glanced at the door. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay and chat, but I really should leave. My wife and I are going to meet and talk... Jamie was the one who suggested it. Well, actually, I came up with the idea of calling Carolyn, but Jamie helped me see that it was the right thing to do.\u201d He spoke rapidly, the words coming out so fast they tumbled over one another. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Jamie held the door for him. \u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d she said as graciously as the circumstances allowed.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d Rich mimicked derisively as Floyd went out the door.</p><p>Jamie felt a storm threatening. One of anger and frustration. The thundercloud was sitting directly behind her, and she did her best to restrain her indignation. After taking a moment to compose herself, she turned around. \u201cIs something bothering you, Rich?\u201d she asked in a level voice.</p><p>He leapt off the sofa as though he\u2019d been sitting on a giant spring. \u201cIs something bothering me?\u201d he repeated coldly. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, dating that joker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you thank him for dinner.\u201d He spat out the words as though to have to say them was a detestable task. \u201cAt least you could\u2019ve returned my phone calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...haven\u2019t checked my messages. Good grief, I didn\u2019t get home until five minutes ago.\u201d Moving across the room, she went to her phone to listen. Six messages, all from Rich, played back, each sounding progressively less patient and increasingly anxious. The last one had been to demand to know \u201cwhere the hell\u201d she was.</p><p>\u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t stand waiting for you to call, I drove over here to wait for you. Lo and behold, your car was in your parking space and you were here\u2014with Floyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand your concern,\u201d Jamie said calmly, willing to grant him that much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife, dammit! How am I supposed to feel when you turn up missing?\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair and stalked to the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Jamie drew in a long, soothing breath, determined not to let this escalate into a full-fledged argument. \u201cI was never missing. I\u2019m sorry I worried you, Rich, but you\u2019re overreacting, and frankly, it\u2019s beginning to annoy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoy you? I\u2019ve been pacing the floor for the past three hours....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought a man home with you!\u201d He made it sound as though that was grounds for divorce.</p><p>\u201cFloyd\u2019s an old friend.\u201d</p><p>The kettle whistled, and Jamie hurried into the kitchen and turned off the burner, all thought of tea forgotten. The boiling water bubbled from the spout, nearly scalding her. Rich had followed, stalking into the room behind her.</p><p>\u201cApparently you don\u2019t have a problem letting old friends take you out to dinner,\u201d he accused her, his words inflamed with impatience.</p><p>Jamie gritted her teeth, biting back an angry retort. \u201cHe needed someone to talk to, someone who\u2019d listen to his problems. You\u2019re making it sound as though I did something underhanded. I was just being a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a married woman,\u201d Rich bellowed. He slammed his fist on the counter. \u201cMy wife. How do you think it makes me feel, knowing you chose to go out to dinner with another man instead of your own husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t choose Floyd over you! Good heavens, how was I supposed to know you wanted to take me to dinner? I\u2019m not a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d come home after work the way you\u2019re supposed to, you would have heard the first of my six messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! I can\u2019t run my life according to your whims.\u201d She\u2019d managed to keep her temper intact, but she didn\u2019t know how much longer her precarious hold would last.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were different.\u201d A spark of pain flashed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve trusted you with my life, but you\u2019re like every other woman I\u2019ve ever known. The minute my back\u2019s turned, you think nothing of seeing someone else.\u201d</p><p>The emptiness in his voice cut at Jamie\u2019s heart. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, and even that didn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d His eyes accused her of\u2014what? Being unfaithful? That was completely irrational!</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a real marriage and you know it,\u201d she said heatedly. Her voice was shaking with the effort to keep from shouting. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who insisted on the ceremony, but it was for convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you have no right to storm into my home and insult my guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have no right to bring a man home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Jamie couldn\u2019t believe they were having this conversation. \u201cOur marriage is in name only for...for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe said our vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d The promises they\u2019d made to each other continued to haunt her.</p><p>\u201cClearly someone has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-h-h,\u201d Jamie seethed. Tightening her fists at her sides, she exhaled sharply and resisted the urge to bang her cupboard doors to vent her frustration.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better leave before we say something we\u2019ll regret.\u201d Instinct had told her that getting married wouldn\u2019t work, and she\u2019d ignored it. Now she was suffering the consequences.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my home,\u201d Jamie cried, quickly losing her grip on her rage. She\u2019d never known Rich could be so unreasonable, so rude, so...impossible.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like every other woman I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Rich repeated in unflattering tones.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just like every other man, so wrapped up in your own ego that it\u2019d take a whack on the head with a two-by-four to see what\u2019s right in front of your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who went out behind your back,\u201d he shouted. He leaned against the kitchen counter and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care if I had dinner with a dozen men?\u201d she demanded. \u201cIt never bothered you before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t married before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your possession,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no right, husband or not, to tell me who I can see and who I can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jamie squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cI knew this wasn\u2019t going to work...

She hadn\u2019t done anything so childish since junior high. \u201cLook at us,\u201d she cried, her voice shaking with anger. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m not even pregnant yet and already we\u2019re fighting. We\u2019re going to ruin everything fighting over something so...stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFloyd is just a friend. For heaven\u2019s sake, he\u2019s married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you keep your part of the bargain and I\u2019ll keep mine. That shouldn\u2019t be so difficult.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d she said, walking around the table and leaning on the back of a chair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more involved in this arrangement than I ever knew about or agreed to and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...like your caveman attitude toward me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaveman? Because I don\u2019t want my wife dating another man\u2014another married man?\u201d He glared across the room at her. \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m wrong, but I seem to remember a phrase or two in the wedding vows that state\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Jamie pointed an accusing finger at his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI never wanted to go through with the wedding, and you knew it. Using it against me now is the height of unfairness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, Jamie, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, I hate it. I hate everything about it\u2014this is the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d Unable to bear any more arguing, she whirled around and covered her face with her hands. If there was any decency left in him, Rich Manning would go. He\u2019d leave her alone.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s nerves were raw, and the hair at the nape of her neck bristled as she heard Rich walk toward her. The clipped pace of his steps did nothing to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cDid he kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, furious that he\u2019d ask such an outrageous question.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m going to.\u201d His hands moved over her shoulders, clasping them, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She made one weak protest, but she didn\u2019t know who she was talking to, Rich or herself. He\u2019d kissed her once, the day of their wedding, and it had obsessed her ever since. She couldn\u2019t allow him to destroy her equilibrium again, destroy her peace of mind.</p><p>Although she resisted, Rich turned her around to face him. Jamie was on fire, and he\u2019d barely touched her.</p><p>Rich took hold of her chin, his fingers firm, yet oddly gentle. Without another word, he bent down and covered her mouth with his own. Jamie knew she shouldn\u2019t let him do this. Not in the heat of anger. Not when they were fighting. Not when his kiss would only create a need for more.</p> <p>He tasted so good, so wonderful. It wasn\u2019t fair. Nothing about this so-called marriage was fair.</p><p>He moved his mouth over hers, shaping her lips with his own until she moaned. It seemed to be what he was waiting for. The instant her lips parted, his tongue swept inside.</p><p>Shock waves vibrated through her at the small, ruthless movements of his tongue. Jamie could feel herself melting against him. The need continued to build within her, licking at her senses, growing hotter and stronger and fiercer....</p><p>Not satisfied with her lips alone, he kissed her eyes, her throat, until Jamie felt as if she was about to ignite.</p><p>A frightening excitement exploded inside her, going beyond mere pleasure and quickly advancing to a demand so intense there would be no turning back for either of them.</p><p>\u201cRich...no.\u201d She braced her hands against his chest, wanting to use that leverage to break away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he countered with a groan. His arms circled her waist, and he lifted her effortlessly from the floor, adjusting her hips against his own so she was aware of what she was doing to him\u2014of the need she\u2019d created in him.</p><p>Jamie slipped her arms around his neck, inclined her head and kissed him back. She felt sensual, wanton...and a little scared.</p><p>A low, rough sound rumbled from deep within his throat.</p><p>\u201cRich...please, oh, please, we\u2019ve got to stop.\u201d Her heart was reeling with excitement but she was terrified of where this might lead. Terrified that, after tonight, she\u2019d never be able to live with a marriage that wasn\u2019t a marriage.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He pressed his lips to her neck, running the tip of his tongue across the smooth skin of her throat and up the underside of her jaw. Jamie threw back her head. A ribbon of warm pleasure braided its way down her spine.</p><p>She buried her fingers in his hair and sighed, feeling breathless and hot. So breathless she could barely gulp in enough air. So hot. Hotter than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>He lifted her higher, leaning her against the kitchen counter. His hands worked the buttons of her blouse, sliding it from her shoulders. Her bra closed in the back, and he reached for and found the clasp.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d he whispered, caressing her thighs, stroking them as he spread delicate, moist kisses across her neck.</p><p>\u201cI ...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I do,\u201d he countered with a lazy, sexy laugh. \u201cYou want me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie couldn\u2019t disagree. She could barely speak as a powerful coil of need tightened within her.</p><p>\u201cDeny it.\u201d His tongue moistened a trail from the hollow at the base of her throat to her trembling chin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He swept her from the counter, shifting her weight until she was completely in his arms. He carried her as if she weighed nothing at all and headed out of the kitchen. He paused to turn off the light.</p><p>\u201cRich.\u201d She had to say something before it was too late. \u201cWe\u2019ll regret this in the morning.\u201d Even as she spoke, she wound her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to deny it, but it didn\u2019t stop him, either.</p><p>Her bedroom was dark. Moonlight splashed through the open drapes, and Rich slowly lowered her onto the bed.</p><p>There was no turning back now.</p><p>Seven</p><p>They were silent afterward, their breathing labored, their chests heaving. Rich wished Jamie would say something. Anything. She didn\u2019t, and slowly reality returned, inexplicably linked with the glory of what they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Rich kissed her softly, gently, with none of the urgency he\u2019d felt earlier. He slid his fingers into the silky length of her hair and sighed with satisfaction. He kissed her again, reveling in her warm, sweet taste. He longed for her to tell him she experienced no remorse over their lovemaking. He\u2019d been so angry, such a jealous idiot, and one thing had led to another. Before he could stop it, they were making love. She\u2019d warned him, claimed they\u2019d be left with regrets, but he felt none. Only a powerful sense of honesty.</p><p>Rich realized his weight was too much for her, but when he tried to move, she resisted, tightening her hold on him, hooking her ankles over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had no intention of doing so. \u201cBut I\u2019m too heavy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me like this. Please.\u201d She stroked his back, her touch featherlight.</p><p>He would stay like this because she asked, but only for a little while. They both needed sleep and the thought of waking up beside her thrilled him almost as much as the memory of everything they\u2019d done together in the last hour.</p><p>The silvery moonlight illuminated her face. He noticed that her eyes were languorous, her face flushed with pleasure. Her lips were turned up slightly in a secret smile. A serene, womanly smile. Just watching her, loving her, brought him peace. Because he did love her, and he was astonished that he hadn\u2019t recognized it earlier. Astonished at his own lack of perception. The love he felt for her burned within his chest, literally burned. The depth of emotion he felt had everything to do with this woman, and the profound pleasure he\u2019d experienced was only part of that.</p><p>Her skin felt like silk beneath his hands as he brushed his fingertips down the side of her face. She sighed, and her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Rarely had Rich experienced such contentment. The magnitude of it left him feeling weak and humble. Tucking his arms securely around Jamie\u2019s waist, he rolled onto his back, taking her with him. She made a small sound of surprise, then smiled peacefully, nestled her head on his chest and closed her eyes. Within minutes, she was asleep.</p><p>Slumber didn\u2019t claim him as quickly. He remained in awe of the emotions crowding his heart. For years he\u2019d been blind and deaf when it came to his feelings for Jamie. Others had seen it. James had immediately recognized the love Rich felt for her and said as much. Rich had been quick to laugh and deny what was obvious to everyone but himself.</p><p>It had taken an argument to push him over the edge, push them both past the point of no return. If he had any regrets, it was that this discovery had come so late\u2014and on the heels of a heated exchange.</p><p>He sighed and watched Jamie in the moonlight. She slept, utterly tranquil, and his heart swelled with a love so strong it was all he could do not to wake her and tell her what he was feeling. He wanted to, but it would be selfish not to let her sleep. He kissed her temple and closed his eyes, content to keep his wife secure in his arms.</p><p>Sometime toward dawn, Rich woke. Jamie was sleeping on her side and he was cuddling her, their bodies pressed intimately together. He smiled, a smile that came from his heart. They were like a long-married couple, completely comfortable with each other, as though they\u2019d been sleeping together for years.</p><p>This was exactly what Rich intended, to continue sleeping with Jamie night after night for the rest of their lives. They\u2019d grow old that way, gracefully, together. God willing, they\u2019d raise several children, who\u2019d be sheltered by the love their parents shared.</p><p>Rich stirred once more a little after six. Yawning, he stretched his arms above his head. He\u2019d been working a lot of extra hours on a contract Boeing had with the government and he needed to get to work soon, despite the weekend.</p><p>He slipped out of bed and gazed down on Jamie, then leaned over and gently kissed her forehead. Hurrying to the shower, he whistled a cheerful tune.</p><p>In a joyous mood, Rich sang at the top of his lungs. He expected Jamie to be awake when he returned to the bedroom, but was disappointed to discover she was still asleep. He dressed and went out the door. He\u2019d phone her later, as soon as he had a chance. He tended to get involved in his work and forget about the time, but he\u2019d try not to let that happen. They had to talk.</p><p>Jamie woke at eight. Although she was sleeping on her side, facing the wall, she sensed almost immediately that Rich had gone.</p><p>He\u2019d left without a word. Abandoned her to deal with the emptiness of the morning. Alone.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she bit her lower lip. The feeling of betrayal, of total isolation, was unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their argument played back in her mind, over and over. Every ugly word they\u2019d said, the accusations, the hurt, echoed in her mind, taunting her again and again.</p><p>His reaction the night before made perfect sense in the bright light of morning. It must\u2019ve been more than his pride could take to find her with Floyd. Something inside Rich had cracked.</p><p>Her evening with Floyd, no matter how innocent, must\u2019ve been like a slap in Rich\u2019s face. He\u2019d reacted in anger and pain, not because he cared. The reason for his outburst was directly related to his male ego. What had started out as an argument had eventually progressed to a physical exchange.</p><p>Rich had kissed her. First in anger. Then in need. A need fed by frustration and jealousy. He might not want a real marriage, but his pride demanded at least the pretense.</p> <p>The image of her husband standing in her kitchen was unforgettable. He\u2019d been furious with her. Although she\u2019d had her back to him at the time, she knew she\u2019d outraged him when she\u2019d said that their marriage was the biggest mistake of her life.</p><p>A terrible tension had followed, so impenetrable that Jamie doubted she could\u2019ve said or done anything to relieve it. Sitting up in bed, she pushed her tangled hair away from her face.</p><p>Rich hadn\u2019t kissed her for any of the right reasons. He\u2019d done it because he hadn\u2019t believed her. He assumed Floyd had kissed her, and he couldn\u2019t tolerate another woman cheating on him\u2014even if it was only in his imagination.</p><p>During all the years of their friendship, Jamie had seen Rich as distinct from the other men she\u2019d known. That had been the first of several mistakes. Rich was exactly like them, competitive and territorial.</p><p>A few weeks earlier, he\u2019d attempted to set her up with his engineering friend, Bill whatever-his-name-was. Now Rich couldn\u2019t stand her speaking to another man, even someone as blameless as Floyd Bacon. Good grief, Floyd was married! Did Rich honestly think she\u2019d stoop to that level? Apparently he did, which didn\u2019t say much for his opinion of her.</p> <p>She\u2019d never seen Rich act more irrational. He\u2019d refused to listen to her explanation, had been rude and arrogant in the extreme. And for what reason? None! At least none she could understand.</p><p>What he\u2019d said about their being married was true enough\u2014on paper. But their relationship wasn\u2019t any different now than it had been before the ceremony.</p><p>Except that it was. Everything she\u2019d feared was coming to pass.</p><p>They\u2019d been married a month, and look what had happened. It wouldn\u2019t depress her quite as much if Rich hadn\u2019t left her to face the morning alone. The questions tormented her, eroding her pride and self-confidence.</p><p>If only he\u2019d said something afterward.</p><p>If only she\u2019d said something.</p> <p>It had all been so beautiful. Their lovemaking had captured her heart, her soul.</p><p>Jamie had longed to tell him everything she was feeling, but she\u2019d been afraid. Afraid he hadn\u2019t experienced the same wonder. Afraid he\u2019d be embarrassed. Afraid he had regrets. She couldn\u2019t have borne knowing that, not when everything had been so perfect for her.</p><p>Evidently he\u2019d had second thoughts, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have abandoned her, slipping away like a thief in the night.</p><p>Reluctantly, Jamie climbed out of bed and into the shower. The pulsating spray struck her skin like dull needles. The need to release her anguish in the form of tears left her throat aching and raw, but she refused to cry. She didn\u2019t have the time. It was her turn to work the Saturday morning shift at the bank. She was already behind schedule.</p><p>Wrapping a towel around herself, she went back into her bedroom\u2014and came to a sudden stop. She covered her cheeks with her hands, mortified to find her carelessly discarded clothes from one end of the room to the other. The memory of how eager they\u2019d been for each other added to her shame and humiliation.</p><p>Jamie dressed quickly, then hung last night\u2019s clothes in the farthest reaches of her closet and hurried out the door, not bothering with more than a cup of instant coffee.</p><p>Rich tried phoning Jamie at quarter to ten. Surely she\u2019d be up and about by then. The phone rang three times before he was invited to \u201cleave a message.\u201d He hung up. Later, he promised himself. He\u2019d try later.</p><p>It was noon before he had a chance to call again. When she still didn\u2019t answer, he became irritated and set the receiver down harder than he\u2019d intended.</p> <p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Bill Hastings asked, walking into Rich\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He did his best to appear nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to kid me,\u201d Bill said, sitting on the corner of Rich\u2019s desk, his left foot dangling. \u201cI know the look when I see it\u2014I\u2019ve worn it often enough myself. You\u2019ve got woman problems.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t do any good to deny it, so he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cPamela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>Bill\u2019s eyebrows shot upward. \u201cSomeone else? You\u2019ve been lying low lately. I didn\u2019t know you were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not...exactly.\u201d It was a half-truth, which also made it a half lie. He wasn\u2019t seeing anyone. He was a married man, only Bill didn\u2019t know that and Rich wasn\u2019t in any mood to announce it now. Not when he didn\u2019t know what was going on between him and Jamie.</p><p>Last night had been good for them. Every time he remembered their lovemaking, his head spun and he felt warm inside. It wasn\u2019t a sensation he was familiar with, since he\u2019d never experienced anything like it in other relationships.</p><p>He\u2019d thought, at least he\u2019d hoped, that Jamie had shared in the magic they\u2019d created, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>At two, Rich decided to try Jamie one last time. He might be reading more into her not answering the phone than she intended. Maybe she simply wasn\u2019t there to answer it. After all, Saturdays were often busy with errands.</p><p>He\u2019d phone again and if there still wasn\u2019t any answer, the hell with it. A man had his pride.</p><p>He\u2019d wait until she called him.</p><p>The phone was ringing when Jamie, struggling with a bag of groceries, tried to remove the key from her purse and unlock her front door. Once she\u2019d thrown open the door she raced across the room, praying with everything in her that it was Rich.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she cried breathlessly after making a leap for the phone. Whoever it was had apparently just hung up, and a buzz droned in her ear.</p><p>She knew the caller couldn\u2019t have been Rich. He\u2019d left six messages the night before. He wouldn\u2019t be shy about leaving another.</p><p>On the off chance he had, she listened impatiently through all the messages she hadn\u2019t yet erased.</p><p>Nothing new from Rich. Nothing.</p><p>The emptiness around her seemed to swell. Her heart felt like a lead weight in her chest as she walked across her living room and closed the door. She\u2019d dropped her bag of groceries on the sofa as she dashed for the phone. The apples had tumbled out, along with a box of cold cereal and a bottle of imported wine.</p><p>Like a romantic fool, she\u2019d gone and purchased an expensive bottle of wine. Her morning had been hectic\u2014Saturdays at the bank generally were. But no matter how many customers she served, or how many loan applications she reviewed, Jamie hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about Rich.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong\u2014he wasn\u2019t like other men she\u2019d known. She\u2019d loved him too long to condemn him on such flimsy evidence. There were any number of reasons he might\u2019ve had to leave. She was a sound sleeper, and for all she knew, he could\u2019ve tried to wake her. By the time she\u2019d left the bank at a little after one, Jamie was confident she\u2019d hear from Rich. Confident enough to rush out and buy a bottle of wine and a small sirloin tip roast just so she could invite him over to dinner\u2014so they could talk.</p><p>There was a lot to say.</p><p>Rich stared at the phone accusingly, willing it to ring. He\u2019d arrived home late Saturday afternoon. He was in such a rush to listen to his messages that he didn\u2019t even stop to check his mail. He bounded up the stairs to his apartment, taking two and three steps at a time, sure there\u2019d be some word from Jamie.</p><p>The blinking red message light made him feel almost cocky with relief. Until he discovered it was Jason who\u2019d phoned. Jason, not Jamie. His brother, not his wife.</p><p>So this was what it meant to be married, to wear his heart on his sleeve and mope around like a besotted fool. So this was how it felt to truly love another person. To care so much that his whole life hinged on a single phone call.</p><p>Rich was through with waiting. He\u2019d already ruined one night pacing the floors like a madman, yearning to hear from Jamie. He\u2019d be damned before he\u2019d do it again anytime soon.</p><p>Furthermore, he mused darkly, he was through with allowing a woman to rule his heart. Apparently he hadn\u2019t learned his lesson, after all.</p><p>Pamela had strung him along for weeks. He\u2019d been duped by one woman and he wasn\u2019t going through that again.</p><p>If Jamie was foolish enough to throw away the best thing that had ever happened to either of them, then so be it. The choice rested entirely with her and he wasn\u2019t going to say a word to persuade her. Not a single word.</p><p>Clearly she felt none of the beauty of their night together. None of the wonder and the magic. It stung his pride that he could have misread her so completely.</p><p>Rather than dwell on his marriage, Rich reached for the phone and viciously punched out his older brother\u2019s number. Jason answered on the second ring, and they made plans for the evening. Nothing fancy. Paul, their oldest brother, had invited them over for a round-robin of pinochle. A card game sounded a lot more inviting than sitting home all night waiting for a silent phone to ring.</p><p>Call him. Jamie had never spent a more restless Saturday afternoon and evening in her life. Pride, she soon discovered, made poor company.</p><p>For all she knew, he could be just as eagerly waiting for her to call him. But that didn\u2019t make sense, especially since he\u2019d been the one to slip away in the early morning hours. Even so, she was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. More than willing.</p><p>Although her stomach was in knots, she\u2019d gone about cooking an elaborate dinner, just in case Rich did phone. The roast and small red potatoes gave her a perfect excuse to invite him over. Now the meal sat on her stove untouched. Unappreciated. Forsaken. Just like her.</p><p>When she could bear the silence no longer, Jamie walked over to the phone. Her hand was trembling and she paused to clear her throat twice while she was dialing. She forced herself to smile, determined to sound as cheerful as a robin in springtime when Rich answered the phone.</p><p>Only he didn\u2019t.</p><p>After four rings, his machine came on.</p><p>Jamie was so stunned, she listened for a couple of seconds, then reluctantly hung up. For several moments, her hand remained on the receiver as the futility and the discouragement overwhelmed her.</p><p>She was being silly. Naive. But it had never occurred to her, not once, that Rich wouldn\u2019t be home.</p><p>Apparently he\u2019d gone out for the evening. No doubt he was having fun, laughing it up with his friends, enjoying himself while she sat home alone.</p><p>There were places she could go, people to see, fun she could have, too. She contacted three friends and suggested a movie. It was a sad statement on her life that the most exciting entertainment she could think of was a movie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All three of her friends already had plans for the evening. Which was just as well, since Jamie wasn\u2019t all that keen to go out anyway. It was the kind of night for watching reruns on television with a box of crackers in her lap and a six-pack of diet soda at her side.</p><p>Rich had a great time Saturday night. They\u2019d played cards into the early hours of the morning and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. There\u2019d been whole stretches of time when he didn\u2019t think of Jamie at all. Five- and ten-minute blocks of time.</p><p>Things would\u2019ve gone well if it hadn\u2019t been for Jason. His brother seemed to like walking close to the edge, Rich thought with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the marriage of inconvenience working out?\u201d Jason had asked on the drive home. He made it sound like a joke, but Rich wasn\u2019t in a laughing mood.</p> <p>Rather than go into any of the details, Rich gave an unintelligible reply.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jason pressed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drop it, Jason.\u201d Rich was serious and he made sure his brother knew it. He didn\u2019t want to discuss his relationship with Jamie. What she\u2019d said the night before about their marriage being the worst mistake of her life was beginning to have the ring of truth to it.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jason added after a few minutes, \u201cmarriage isn\u2019t exactly a bed of roses, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never claimed it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she pregnant yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d Rich repeated the word as though he\u2019d never heard it before. \u201cPregnant,\u201d he said again, his voice dropping. Vividly he recalled their conversation Friday morning and how excited he\u2019d been when he learned her temperature had been slightly elevated. They\u2019d spoken every morning for several days running, discussing the chances of pregnancy. It was the reason they were married! Only, they\u2019d planned to conceive the child by nontraditional means....</p><p>Twenty-four hours following his conversation with his brother, Rich continued to mull over the possibility of a pregnancy.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard from Jamie all day Sunday, either. He\u2019d decided he probably wouldn\u2019t. That woman was so stubborn. Fine, he\u2019d wait her out. If she didn\u2019t contact him, it was her loss.</p> <p>He changed his mind Monday afternoon. It was either call her or resign from his engineering job. He\u2019d made one mistake after another all day. Every time the phone rang, he felt as though an electrical shock had gone through him and nearly leaped off his chair. Although he strove to sound cool and collected, he couldn\u2019t keep his heart from speeding like a race-car engine.</p><p>Obviously Rich would have to be the one to call. It felt like blackmail, which did little to improve his mood. He stood and closed the door to his office.</p><p>He walked all the way around his desk twice, then sat heavily in his chair and picked up the phone.</p><p>The bank\u2019s receptionist answered almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cIs Jamie... Warren available?\u201d He stopped himself from asking for Jamie Manning just in time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll transfer your call,\u201d the woman said, cutting him off. The phone rang three times, frustrating Rich even more.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jamie Warren\u2019s office. How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Rich had expected Jamie would answer. \u201cIs Jamie available?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s home sick today. May I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Jamie was home sick? She\u2019d seemed in perfect health Friday night. Perhaps she was ill. Too ill to call him.</p><p>\u201cSir? May I help you?\u201d the woman repeated</p><p>\u201cNo...no, thanks. I\u2019ll phone later.\u201d</p><p>But first he was going to find out exactly what was wrong with Jamie.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Jamie felt wretched. Not only had she spent the most miserable weekend of her life, but late Sunday afternoon she\u2019d come down with a ferocious case of the flu.</p><p>Monday morning she\u2019d phoned in sick. For most of the day she\u2019d stayed in bed, trying to convince herself that it was a twenty-four-hour virus and she\u2019d be fine by Tuesday morning.</p><p>Her head throbbed, her muscles ached and she was sure she had a fever. If she wasn\u2019t so sick, she\u2019d get out of bed to take her temperature. The only times she\u2019d risked leaving the comfort of her warm cocoon had been to make trips to the bathroom.</p><p>The phone at her bedside rang and she reached for it blindly, nearly toppling a glass of liquid flu medication left from the night before.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she croaked. It was probably some salesman hoping to sell her a cemetery plot. The timing couldn\u2019t be better.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d Naturally he\u2019d phone her now, when her defenses were down and she was too weak to react. She\u2019d waited three painful days to hear from him. Nightmare days.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d called, Jamie experienced absolutely no emotion. Certainly not relief. Or anger, although she\u2019d spent most of Sunday furious with him, and so hurt it was all she could do not to simply give in to self-pity.</p><p>\u201cI phoned the bank and they told me you were home sick,\u201d he explained, as though he needed a reason to call her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the flu.\u201d</p><p>A slight hesitation followed. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? Have you been to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too sick for that.\u201d She found his concern laughable. He\u2019d walked out on her. Ignored her. Hurt her. And now he was upset because she hadn\u2019t seen a doctor over a twenty-four-hour flu bug?</p><p>Once again Rich hesitated. \u201cI think you should make an appointment with Dr. Fullerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Fullerton?\u201d she echoed. Rich wasn\u2019t making sense. \u201cWhy would I see a gynecologist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause what you have might not be the flu,\u201d he returned, his words sounding as though they were spoken from between clenched teeth.</p><p>Maybe she was being obtuse, but she didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s the flu. I\u2019ve got all the symptoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t it dawn on you that it might be something else?\u201d His voice rose with impatience.</p><p>\u201cNo. Should it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>It hit Jamie like a bolt of lightning. Rich thought she might be pregnant! If it wasn\u2019t so ludicrous she\u2019d cry. He actually seemed worried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell,\u201d she said in her most formal voice, as if she were relaying the bank\u2019s decision regarding a loan application. \u201cBut it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour temperature was elevated, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that much. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>His angry sigh told her that either he was exasperated or furious\u2014Jamie didn\u2019t know which.</p><p>When would she learn? Time after time she\u2019d foolishly handed her heart to a man, and the outcome was always the same. Within a few months her heart would be broken, shattered, and she\u2019d be limping away. Some women were meant to find love, but apparently she wasn\u2019t one of them. Some women were destined to have forty or fifty years of contented marital bliss. She\u2019d be lucky if her marriage lasted two months.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Rich asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She made her reply as clipped as she could. If he really cared, he wouldn\u2019t have left her on Saturday morning. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why weren\u2019t you at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got the flu,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cThen you aren\u2019t perfectly fine, are you?\u201d</p><p>How like a man to argue about semantics. \u201cOther than the flu, I\u2019m feeling wonderful.\u201d She tried to sound as if she\u2019d practically be running the bank single-handed if it weren\u2019t for this virus. There certainly wasn\u2019t any problem in her life\u2014other than an almost-husband who had no regard for her feelings.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Rich suggested after an awkward moment. The silence between them was strained\u2014as strained as their marriage.</p><p>\u201cI ...think that might be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Jamie stalled for a few seconds. She didn\u2019t want to see him anytime soon, considering the pitiful way she was feeling. If she looked remotely as dreadful as she felt, Rich would drag her bodily into Dr. Fullerton\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWednesday night?\u201d Rich said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWednesday...sure.\u201d By then she should be well on the road to recovery.</p><p>\u201cThe Cookie Jar?\u201d</p><p>The restaurant was one they\u2019d frequented in high school. A little hole-in-the-wall diner with a polished linoleum floor and an old-time jukebox in the corner. Jamie hadn\u2019t thought about the place in years. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were still in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to be driving down Forty-third recently and I saw it. It brought back a lot of old memories. If you\u2019d rather meet somewhere else...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, The Cookie Jar sounds like fun. I\u2019ll meet you there at...how about seven? Right after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Seven. I\u2019ll buy you a chocolate sundae for dessert.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything she\u2019d been through in the last three days\u2014the anxiety, the disappointment and the pain\u2014Jamie found herself smiling. A few words from Rich had wiped it all away. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSomehow I knew you would.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Jamie replaced the receiver and nestled back on her pillows. She\u2019d been thoroughly chilled earlier and had piled on every blanket in the house. Suddenly she was feeling much better. Good enough to climb out of bed and make herself something to eat.</p><p>Wednesday, Rich arrived at The Cookie Jar an hour early, figuring he might as well have dinner there. He slipped into the booth with its tattered red vinyl upholstery and reached for the menu, tucked between the napkin holder and the sugar container. The menu offered four or five varieties of hamburger, in addition to sandwiches and a wide range of ice-cream desserts. He noted the picture of the chocolate sundae, the ice cream swimming in a pool of chocolate, smothered in whipped cream and crowned with a bright red cherry. Jamie\u2019s favorite.</p><p>He\u2019d made light of discovering The Cookie Jar, claiming he happened to be driving down Forty-third when he caught sight of it. That was a lie.</p><p>He\u2019d almost gone crazy when he hadn\u2019t heard from her by Sunday evening and he\u2019d gone out for a drive in an effort to collect his thoughts. Going past their old high school and the nearby restaurant had been no accident. He would\u2019ve gone inside The Cookie Jar, but the restaurant had been closed. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he\u2019d suggested they meet there. Nostalgia? A chance to remember simpler times? To relive the beginning of their friendship?</p><p>An impossibly young waitress arrived with a glass of water and a small pad, ready to take his order. Rich asked for a cheeseburger, a strawberry milkshake and an order of fries. He glanced around at the other customers, but the high school crowd had gone home and the few people there were older.</p><p>He strolled over to check out the jukebox, thinking it might be fun to hear some of the songs he\u2019d loved in his teens. He was surprised to find he didn\u2019t recognize a single tune. Not even one. He fingered a few quarters in his pocket, but after a couple of minutes he decided not to bother and returned to the booth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was getting old. He hadn\u2019t really noticed it before but he did now. When the waitress didn\u2019t look any older than twelve and he didn\u2019t recognize a single Top 40 hit, he couldn\u2019t deny it\u2014he was past his prime.</p><p>The cheeseburger was sinfully delicious. The French fries were just the way he liked them\u2014hot and salty. He savored the sweet, thick shake and couldn\u2019t remember a meal he\u2019d enjoyed more.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>No point in trying to fool himself. Any meal with Jamie would\u2019ve been better. He missed her. He missed their early-morning conversations and the sound of her laughter. He missed the intimacy they shared as they talked about their child.</p> <p>Their child.</p><p>Paul\u2019s three-year-old twin sons had been up and about for part of Saturday night, racing around the house in their Spider-Man pajamas. For an hour or so, Jason had played cards holding Ryan on his lap, while Rich held a squirming Ronnie. Rich had always enjoyed being with his young nephews, but he hadn\u2019t truly appreciated them until that evening. If all went well, within a year\u2019s time he\u2019d be holding a son or daughter of his own. That had filled him with an electrified anticipation. He\u2019d managed to contain those feelings, not knowing what was happening between him and Jamie. But he\u2019d know soon. They were going to clear the air.</p><p>When he\u2019d first mentioned marriage, Jamie had been afraid, full of dire predictions that sex would ruin their friendship.</p><p>He\u2019d agreed with her then, and he did now. They were in danger of ruining everything unless they acknowledged their feelings in a mature, honest manner. Their night together had redefined their relationship, taking them from friends to lovers.</p><p>What a discovery they\u2019d made.</p> <p>What a mess they\u2019d made.</p><p>He knew he should never have made love to her, but try as he might, Rich couldn\u2019t make himself regret it. If he suffered any remorse, it was that it had taken an argument to realize how much he cared for Jamie.</p><p>He\u2019d been in love with her for years, only he hadn\u2019t known it. They\u2019d had a special friendship all that time, and they now had a chance to have even more. Rich didn\u2019t want to say or do anything that would jeopardize their marriage or their friendship.</p><p>Things hadn\u2019t gone well when he\u2019d phoned her Monday afternoon. The tension during that call still made him wince. Rich had said none of what he\u2019d wanted to say, nor had he done anything to assure her of his love. Jamie had sounded stilted and uncertain. The conversation was over almost before it started\u2014although at least it had ended on a lighter note. Thank goodness for ice cream.</p><p>He\u2019d been tempted to call her again several times since, but decided it would be best to wait until they could meet face-to-face. There was less likelihood of misunderstandings that way.</p><p>Rich had done a lot of thinking about what he needed to tell her. First, they had to put aside any pettiness, let go of any jealousy, vanquish any fears. Then they\u2019d discuss their feelings. If the conversation went the way he hoped it would, he\u2019d go home with her and spend the night.</p> <p>Why not?</p><p>They were married. It didn\u2019t make sense for Jamie to get pregnant by artificial means when they were fully capable of doing it naturally.</p><p>Capable and eager.</p><p>He didn\u2019t plan to bring that up right away, of course, but he planned to let her know it was what he wanted.</p><p>During the remaining time he spent waiting for her, Rich entertained several ways of handling their discussion. Furthermore, he felt they should seriously consider moving in together. Since Jamie owned her place, it would be sensible for him to make the switch, but they\u2019d eventually buy a house.</p><p>He was mulling over which neighborhood would suit them when Jamie walked into The Cookie Jar, wearing a full-length navy blue coat.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d she asked, slipping into the seat opposite him.</p><p>She looked so good. Rich had trouble keeping his eyes off her. \u201cNo...no.\u201d He summoned the waitress and asked Jamie what she\u2019d like.</p> <p>\u201cHot tea, please,\u201d Jamie said, smiling up at the teenager.</p><p>\u201cCoffee for me,\u201d he told the waitress.</p><p>\u201cYou want your chocolate sundae now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jamie shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m still recuperating from the flu.\u201d She folded her hands primly in her lap, her gaze avoiding his.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t as promising as Rich had hoped. \u201cSo you\u2019re still battling the bug?\u201d Now that she mentioned it, she did look pale.</p><p>She nodded, her gaze following their waitress.</p><p>\u201cThey sure are young these days, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he said, his eyes following hers.</p><p>She glanced at him as though she didn\u2019t understand what he meant. Rich motioned toward the teenager.</p><p>Jamie nodded, her eyebrows raised. \u201cPretty, too.\u201d</p><p>Rich hadn\u2019t noticed. A sixteen-year-old in braces did nothing for him. Jamie on the other hand sent his senses into orbit. All he had to do, he reminded himself, was be honest with her. Honesty led to intimacy\u2014which led to the bedroom.</p><p>The girl brought their coffee and tea, smiling demurely. Jamie returned her smile and picked up the sugar container, shaking some into her tea and stirring it briskly. Rich couldn\u2019t remember her using sugar before, but this wasn\u2019t the time to mention it.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk about what happened Friday night,\u201d he said, leaning forward, cupping the warm mug in both hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, because...\u201d He sipped his coffee before answering. Her question had caught him off guard. \u201cIt\u2019s brought another dimension into our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-how do you feel about...our relationship having another dimension?\u201d Once again she cast her gaze around the room, looking everywhere but at him.</p><p>\u201cI think it has the potential to be good,\u201d he said, striving to sound matter-of-fact. If he let on too quickly that he was crazy in love with Jamie, he might scare her off.</p><p>\u201cThe potential to be good,\u201d she repeated, her voice so low he had to strain to hear her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to discuss it Saturday morning.\u201d Rich watched as Jamie went stiff. He realized she hadn\u2019t liked him leaving and wondered if she\u2019d misinterpreted the situation. He\u2019d do his best to make amends now. \u201cI apologize about heading out early. It might have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She raised her hand.</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize. None. The last couple of days at home I\u2019ve had plenty of time to think.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in relief. Apparently Jamie had come to the same conclusions as he had. He sipped his coffee and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded again. A man always likes to hear the truth.</p><p>\u201cHaving dinner with Floyd was an error in judgment on my part, although it was completely innocent. After your experience with Pamela, I should\u2019ve understood your feelings. As your friend... I should\u2019ve been able to hear what you were really saying. If there\u2019s any blame to be placed over...over what happened, I want you to know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame,\u201d Rich repeated. The word fired his anger, and adrenaline shot into his veins.</p><p>\u201cYes, I just wanted you to know I\u2019m willing to accept the blame.\u201d</p><p>Hearing it a second time didn\u2019t improve his disposition. Rich set his mug back on the table with enough force to slosh coffee over the edges. \u201cNo one said anything about placing or accepting blame. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re here to do, I suggest we end this discussion right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze fell to her mug of tea, cradled between her hands. From the rise and fall of her shoulders, Rich could see how hard she was trying to avoid another argument.</p><p>He was too angry to make the effort. Blame. She wanted to allot blame for the most fantastic night of his life. Hers, too, but she was too proud to admit it.</p><p>Everything he\u2019d hoped to accomplish\u2014making this marriage real, moving in together, buying a home and creating a child, a son or daughter who\u2019d be born from their love\u2014seemed to disappear before his eyes. He\u2019d longed for this meeting, hoped it would give them a way to move naturally from being friends to being lovers. Married lovers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDone what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade you mad.\u201d</p><p>He knew it hadn\u2019t been her intention to offend him. Judging by the bewildered look in her eyes, she didn\u2019t understand why he felt angry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happened already, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Her words were so shaky, Rich half expected her to break into tears. \u201cWe\u2019ve killed our friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d She looked pale, and here he was, furious with her, when all he wanted to do was take her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would happen,\u201d she said with sigh. \u201cMarriage just isn\u2019t going to work. Our feelings are all muddled up...we hardly know how to act around each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rich sat silent and morose. What she said was true.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d he asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know. I thought I knew what I wanted. Now I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t know, either. He wanted her as his wife, but he needed to be positive that she shared his feelings. What man didn\u2019t need that type of reassurance? It had all seemed so straightforward earlier. Now he was floundering.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel up to walking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His question obviously surprised Jamie, but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Rich reached for their tab, then left some money on the table.</p><p>They were in the old neighborhood now. The brick two-story high school they\u2019d once attended was two blocks over. By tacit agreement they headed in that direction. Jamie wrapped a scarf around her neck and buried her hands in her pockets. Rich did the same, but he would rather have held hands with her.</p><p>They\u2019d gone a block before either of them spoke.</p><p>\u201cI used to think you were the handsomest boy at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Rich laughed. \u201cYou certainly didn\u2019t let me know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. You were vain enough.\u201d</p><p>Rich smiled. \u201cI used to wish I had as easy a time with grades as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy?\u201d she repeated with a short, mocking laugh. \u201cI worked my tail off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember our ten-year reunion?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cYou were with some blonde. You always went for blondes, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her remark. \u201cYou were with that guy who looked like David Letterman,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRalph was a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice and dull.\u201d Rich didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d bothered to bring Elaine. He\u2019d much rather have spent the evening with Jamie. As it was, they\u2019d danced nearly every dance together.</p><p>\u201cAt least all of Ralph\u2019s brains weren\u2019t located below his neckline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Rich said, grinning boyishly.</p><p>Jamie whirled around to face him, her eyes spitting fire. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare bring up the size of my bust. Don\u2019t...you dare.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rich couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever mention the karate lessons I took? I learned how to disarm a man in three easy moves. Don\u2019t tempt me, Manning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tempt me.\u201d Rich didn\u2019t know what made him say it, but now that it was out, he wasn\u2019t sorry. Jamie went still at his side, unmoving in the dim light from the street lamp. Rich raised his hand and glided his fingertips over her face. Her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cI ...don\u2019t think this is a good idea....\u201d</p> <p>He stopped her, tracing the outline of her lips with his index finger. He circled once, twice, three times....</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained closed, and she swayed toward him. Rich reached for her, pressing her close.</p><p>\u201cThere...was something I wanted to say,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He buried his face in her hair, inhaling its sweet scent. Rich didn\u2019t know how they could be at odds with each other when the attraction between them was this strong.</p> <p>\u201cYou...you shouldn\u2019t distract me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d His lips grazed the underside of her jaw. She tilted her head.</p><p>\u201cNot yet....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It was all the encouragement he needed. He brought his mouth to hers and wrapped his arms around her, nearly lifting her from the sidewalk. Her arms crept up his chest, pausing at his shoulders. The kissing was even better than it had been before, something Rich hadn\u2019t thought possible.</p> <p>His mouth moved hungrily over hers, and when she sighed and parted her lips, he swept her mouth with his tongue. Jamie reacted with a swift intake of breath, winding her arms around his neck.</p><p>Rich had never intended to kiss her like this. Not on a public street half a block from where they\u2019d attended school. He wanted her soft and yielding in his arms. And in his bed. Soon.</p><p>The salty taste of tears shocked him. She was crying. He pulled his mouth from hers. \u201cJamie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything...nothing.\u201d She kissed him back, her open mouth over his. It was as sensuous as anything he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re making everything so difficult.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow am I doing that?\u201d She remained in his embrace, his hand pressing the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cKissing me... You weren\u2019t supposed to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...but don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to.\u201d Rich didn\u2019t need further encouragement. His kiss was urgent, filled with unleashed desire. They\u2019d wasted precious days, hiding behind their fears. All along, they could\u2019ve been rejoicing in the discovery of their love.</p><p>\u201cRich...\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he broke off the kiss, his chest heaving. He took her hand, folding it in his own, and started back toward The Cookie Jar. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...suppose we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that or make love to you in the middle of the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love to me?\u201d</p><p>Surely it was what she expected. A man didn\u2019t kiss a woman like that without her knowing what he had in mind, especially if that woman was his wife!</p><p>\u201cBut...we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d His steps were brisk. The sooner he got back to his apartment, the sooner he could kiss her again. He didn\u2019t want to give her the opportunity to change her mind.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something we should talk over first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t it wait?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI would\u2019ve said it earlier.... I planned to, but then you suggested the walk and...we started kissing and now I\u2019m more confused than ever.\u201d</p><p>He stopped at his car, unlocked the passenger door, then turned to face her. Resting his hands on her shoulders, he met her gaze, relieved to see the hunger in her eyes. \u201cAll right, Jamie, tell me whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>She brushed the tears from her cheeks, and drew in a deep, steadying breath. \u201cBecause of Friday night.\u201d</p><p>That again! \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you might want to...you know?\u201d</p><p>Rich thought he did. She was about to suggest what he\u2019d been considering for the last few days\u2014that they take this marriage seriously and move in together.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, it\u2019s what I want,\u201d he said, brushing the hair from her face, his fingers lingering on the softness of her skin.</p><p>Her eyes closed, and she bit her trembling lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want anymore...and I don\u2019t think you do, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he countered. He wanted her.</p><p>\u201cI think we should give serious consideration to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA divorce.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Rich jerked away from her as though he\u2019d received an electric shock.</p><p>\u201cA divorce!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what Jamie preferred, but she felt honor-bound to offer Rich the option. They\u2019d broken their agreement, the promises they\u2019d made to each other before the wedding.</p><p>The decision to make love had been mutual; nevertheless everything had changed, and they couldn\u2019t continue pretending it hadn\u2019t. Their lovemaking was so powerful, so moving, Jamie would treasure the memory all her life. Every time she thought about falling asleep, nestled against Rich, she went weak.</p><p>\u201cA divorce,\u201d Rich repeated.</p><p>Jamie shuddered. He\u2019d never know what it had cost her to make the offer. Jamie prayed Rich would give her some indication that Friday night had been as meaningful and as beautiful for him as it had been for her.</p><p>\u201cSo you want a divorce?\u201d he said, slamming the passenger door of his car.</p><p>\u201cI ... I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you suggest it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...well, because things are different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t even know you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jamie chose to ignore his outburst. \u201cWe\u2019d agreed this was to be a marriage of convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly fight me off, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s cheeks exploded with scalding color. \u201cNo... I didn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t alter the fact that we breached our agreement\u2014and before we go on with our plans, I feel we should reevaluate our options and our commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like a banker. Cold and calculating. What\u2019s the matter? Are you afraid of a little emotion?\u201d His eyes were seething with anger.</p><p>If Jamie thought he was furious when he\u2019d confronted her with Floyd, his anger on Friday night paled in comparison to the fury she saw now.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not teenagers anymore,\u201d she said as calmly as her voice would allow. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible, mature adults who can make decisions based on something other than hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Friday night was nothing more than a roll in the hay for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Jamie was growing angry herself. \u201cYou\u2019re purposely misconstruing everything I\u2019ve said. Friday night happened. Good or bad, it happened. We can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no intention of forgetting it or ignoring it or anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did it take you until Monday afternoon to call me?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy did you sneak away in the middle of the night without a word? I woke up feeling like...like a one-night stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who was disappointed,\u201d Rich said loudly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have hurt you to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you feel like a one-night stand?\u201d Rich paced the sidewalk. He rammed his fingers through his hair. \u201cA one-night stand? That\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d she argued. \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the papers to prove it. Talk about denial! A wedding is a wedding, so don\u2019t try to add a list of qualifiers to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose qualifiers were added before the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want out.\u201d He turned toward her, his face contorted with anger, his blue eyes piercing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply giving you the option. Our relationship has changed, and we can\u2019t act as if it hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t said anything we\u2019d be halfway to your place by now. We both know I would\u2019ve ended up spending the night, and then what?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him answer. \u201cThen tomorrow morning,\u201d she resumed, answering her own question, \u201ceverything would be awkward again and there wouldn\u2019t be time to say or do anything because we\u2019d both need to get to work.\u201d</p><p>Already Jamie could picture the scene. They\u2019d be rushing around dressing, embarrassed and uncomfortable with each other, the way they\u2019d been when Rich had phoned her Monday afternoon. There wouldn\u2019t be time to talk, but they\u2019d exchange polite pleasantries while he drove her back to Forty-third Street so she could pick up her car. Then she\u2019d have to dash home and change clothes again before going to work.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it would\u2019ve been.\u201d After a few kisses neither one of them would want to talk, not when they were so eager to make love. There wouldn\u2019t be any discussion, no clear exchange of views; that was predictable. And their embarrassment the next morning would\u2019ve been inevitable.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you\u2019re throwing a divorce in my face now.\u201d</p><p>It all made sense to Jamie. \u201cWe were planning a divorce anyway, after the baby\u2019s born. There were certain stipulations, agreements we made before the wedding. That\u2019s all changed. If you\u2019re going to have second thoughts, the time is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it me or you who\u2019s having regrets?\u201d he demanded harshly.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t talking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rich, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to turn everything I say around. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt or offend you. I just want this to be as clear as we can make it. Having a baby is too important a decision. We can\u2019t mix it up with egos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to say when my ego\u2019s the one that\u2019s getting battered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not doing it intentionally. All I want is for us to be honest with each other. If you decide you\u2019d rather forget the whole thing, then I\u2019ll understand. Look what\u2019s happened so far! We\u2019ve nearly destroyed the marriage, not to mention our friendship, and we haven\u2019t been married six weeks. This isn\u2019t going to be as simple as we thought.\u201d</p><p>Rich rubbed his hand down his face, looking confused.</p><p>A divorce wasn\u2019t what Jamie wanted, but she felt she had to give him the opportunity to end their plans now, before the relationship was further complicated by a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was so confident about what we were doing,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI ...was, too.\u201d Jamie could barely stand the suspense, but she wouldn\u2019t say anything to encourage him one way or the other. They both had to be completely sure that they were doing the right thing. \u201cWould you prefer to take a couple of days to think it over?\u201d</p><p>Rich\u2019s gaze found hers. \u201cMaybe I should. I thought I knew, but maybe I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Disappointed, Jamie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you then.\u201d She secured her purse strap over her shoulder and smiled. \u201cGood night, Rich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>As she headed toward her car, which was parked four or five spaces from his, she struggled not to reveal any of what she was feeling. Rich surprised her by walking the short distance beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve really made a mess of this, haven\u2019t I?\u201d he asked. For the first time since she\u2019d mentioned the divorce, he didn\u2019t look as though he wanted to bite her head off.</p><p>\u201cWe both have,\u201d she answered in a small voice. She tried to smile at him and failed. When they reached her car, she opened her purse, searching for her keys.</p><p>\u201cIt may not make any difference,\u201d Rich said, and his eyes burned into hers, \u201cbut I\u2019d like you to know I had to work Saturday morning. I probably should\u2019ve woken you. I assumed my singing in the shower would have\u2014\u201d he gave a lopsided grin \u201c\u2014but when it didn\u2019t, I decided to let you sleep. It was thoughtless of me not to leave a note.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were at work?\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded. \u201cWhen I did phone, you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t any message.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAfter what I went through on Friday, I was done with leaving messages. Anyway, you might\u2019ve phoned me.\u201d The last remark was made as an offhand suggestion, but it didn\u2019t disguise his frustration.</p><p>\u201cI did! But you weren\u2019t home. I didn\u2019t leave a message, either.\u201d What a fool she\u2019d been. What fools they\u2019d both been. Jamie wanted to groan at their stupidity.</p><p>\u201cYou phoned?\u201d His sigh of frustration was audible.</p> <p>\u201cYou did, too?\u201d Her sigh joined his.</p><p>Jamie resisted the urge to weep. There\u2019d been so much she\u2019d wanted to say, and hadn\u2019t. So much she\u2019d longed to tell him. And couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll phone me...soon?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound as anxious as she felt.</p><p>Rich nodded. One corner of his mouth lifted in a half smile. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message if you\u2019re not in this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t call me, then I\u2019m calling you.\u201d She refused to leave room for any additional misunderstandings. Not again.</p><p>Before he realized where he was going, Rich found himself at Jason\u2019s apartment complex. He sat in the parking lot for several minutes.</p><p>When Jamie brought up the idea of divorce, he thought he\u2019d explode. Rich couldn\u2019t remember ever being angrier in his life. Angry and hurt and confused. They were minutes away from making love, and she dropped the word as though she was talking about something casual, something unimportant.</p><p>Divorce.</p> <p>At one point he\u2019d decided there was no reasoning with her, and the best thing to do was walk away from the whole mess. Then the unexpected happened.</p><p>She\u2019d started to make sense.</p><p>Jamie had always been the logical one. The perfectionist. Everything had to be just so. It had driven him to distraction when they were on the yearbook staff together. He should\u2019ve realized that although thirteen years had passed since then, Jamie hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>She wanted everything as clear as they could make it. Those were her words.</p><p>Rich knew what he wanted, too. He wanted her back in his bed so he could make love to her again. Naturally he didn\u2019t say as much. How could he? She claimed that they were denying what had happened, that they couldn\u2019t pretend nothing had changed when everything was different. Well...yes, that was true\u2014and no, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Hours later, Rich was still sitting in his car, and he still didn\u2019t know what to make of their meeting. He needed someone to talk to, so he elected Jason, whether his brother was willing or not.</p><p>The lights were out in Jason\u2019s ground-floor apartment, but that didn\u2019t deter Rich. He leaned on the buzzer until a sliver of light shot out from under the door.</p><p>He waited until he heard the lock snap open, then stepped back.</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d His brother groaned, tying the knot in his bathrobe. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? Do you have any idea what time it is?\u201d</p><p>Rich checked his watch, surprised to discover it was after eleven. \u201cI need to talk,\u201d he said, marching past Jason and into the kitchen.</p><p>A yawning Jason followed. \u201cIs this going to take long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why? Have you got a woman with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I wouldn\u2019t have answered the door, no matter how long you rang the bell.\u201d Jason pulled out a kitchen chair, sat down and slouched forward over his folded arms. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not in a talking mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, all you have to do is listen.\u201d</p><p>Rich walked over to the refrigerator and opened it. He took out two cold sodas and pushed one at his brother. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you bought groceries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you\u2019ve got in there is a tin can with a fork sticking out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Jason said, covering his yawn. He waited a moment, then gestured. \u201cGo on...talk. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Now that he had the floor, so to speak, Rich couldn\u2019t figure out where to start. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of having made love to Jamie, but he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d feel if she knew he was talking to Jason about their night together.</p><p>\u201cYou need some help with this, little brother?\u201d Jason asked, straightening and opening his soda.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rich said vehemently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you anyway. You and Jamie have succumbed to the delights of the flesh and now you don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>Rich was so flabbergasted that all he could do was stare at his brother, his mouth wide open.</p><p>Jason ignored him and guzzled half the can of soda.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Saturday night,\u201d Jason informed him, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cHow... What\u2019d I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I asked you if Jamie was pregnant yet, remember?\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded. The question had hit him like a sledgehammer. Jason\u2019s curiosity was what had led Rich to call her Monday afternoon. Jamie might well be pregnant from their one night together, although she\u2019d been quick to reassure him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Rich asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p>\u201cYou looked so shocked and you closed up tighter than a clam. It was obvious, at least to me, that she might be \u2018with child,\u2019 as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage rarely is. Why do you think I\u2019ve avoided it all these years? I tried to tell you before the wedding, but would you listen? Ah, no, this was different, you said. You and Jamie were friends entering into a business agreement. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember what I said,\u201d Rich muttered, taking another swallow. He\u2019d been incredibly naive about this marriage. The whole thing had sounded like a great idea; he had to admit it still did. Although an even better idea was to turn their arrangement into a till-death-do-us-part marriage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d</p><p>Rich crushed the empty aluminum can between his hands. \u201cI just met with Jamie for the first time since...since I spent the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go well?\u201d</p><p>Rich shrugged. \u201cPut it this way. She suggested a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA divorce? Good grief, Rich, what did you say to the poor girl?\u201d</p><p>Rich found it interesting that Jason immediately placed the blame on him. \u201cHell if I know. She came up with that all on her own. According to her, I ...we changed the rules so we need to reevaluate our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Jason leaned back in his chair, its two front legs lifting from the floor. \u201cSounds serious. So are you reevaluating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rich said forcefully. \u201cI think we should throw the whole prenuptial agreement out the window and move in together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you want this to be a real marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think Jamie would go for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He hoped she would, but he\u2019d suffered more than one setback lately. He wasn\u2019t nearly as confident as he had been earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded without hesitation. \u201cLike crazy.\u201d Standing, he walked over to the sink and leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms. \u201cNo one\u2019s more surprised about that than I am. I didn\u2019t have a clue that I felt anything for Jamie other than friendship. I didn\u2019t even notice how beautiful she is until recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew that, I wouldn\u2019t be pounding down your door in the middle of the night.\u201d Rich\u2019s response was short-tempered, but Jason should\u2019ve realized that much for himself.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Jason rubbed the lower half of his face. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose sleep on it is the kind of advice you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, if I could sleep, I\u2019d be home in bed.\u201d Rich had lived alone for years, but the thought of returning to an empty apartment filled him with dread. He wanted to be with Jamie. It didn\u2019t even matter whether or not they made love; he needed her. Needed her reassurance. Needed her warmth, her laughter. Her love.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew what she wanted,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think?\u201d Rich tossed his brother a scathing look. \u201cJamie, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bite my head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ask idiotic questions.\u201d</p><p>Jason yawned loudly, but Rich ignored his brother\u2019s broad hint. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give me a single indication of how she felt about it. Absolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of appearing stupid,\u201d Jason said mournfully, \u201can indication of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce.\u201d Rich frowned. \u201cShe offered it to me as an option, but when I asked what she wanted, she wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Jason responded between yawns, \u201cyou\u2019d be influenced by what she said and she wants the decision to be yours. She\u2019s a smart gal.\u201d</p><p>Rich paced the compact kitchen. \u201cI told her I\u2019d think everything over and get back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go home,\u201d Jason said, standing. \u201cNow.\u201d He ushered Rich toward the front door. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not exactly at my brightest, and I\u2019ve got surgeries scheduled all day tomorrow. I need my sleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rich brushed off his coat sleeves and chuckled. \u201cI can take a hint.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Jason shook his head. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Fullerton\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jamie said, her hand tightening on the receiver. \u201cI ...need to cancel my appointment with Dr. Fullerton.\u201d She gave the date and time.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to reschedule now?\u201d</p><p>Jamie would\u2019ve liked nothing better, but not knowing what Rich would decide made that futile. \u201cNot now, thank you. I\u2019ll call you next week.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had delayed contacting Dr. Fullerton\u2019s office all day. She\u2019d hoped to hear from Rich early that morning. In her optimistic imagination, she\u2019d had him phoning first thing with the assurance that he felt as strongly committed to their marriage and their child as ever.</p><p>When she hadn\u2019t heard from him by noon, she had no option but to cancel her appointment. It wasn\u2019t the end of the world. Yet she was overwhelmed by her emotions for the rest of the afternoon. She had to struggle to keep her feelings from interfering with her ability to make sound business decisions.</p><p>She\u2019d thrown a frozen entr\u00e9e into her microwave for dinner and munched on miniature marshmallows while watching a cable-TV reality dating show. So much for good eating habits or any semblance of healthy emotion. She\u2019d sunk about as low as she could.</p> <p>Jamie, normally meticulous about her clothes, didn\u2019t bother to change after work. Instead, she wandered around the condo in her suit, her blouse pulled out from the waist. Her slippers made scuffing noises as she shuffled from room to room with no real purpose or direction. She would\u2019ve liked to blame her lethargy on her recent bout with the flu, but she knew otherwise.</p><p>What was really bothering her was her husband. Or rather, her lack of one. A real one. In their discussion the night before, she\u2019d tried to be as forthright and honest with Rich as she could. She\u2019d been careful not to hint at her feelings or preferences. She was no longer so sure she\u2019d made the right decision. Maybe she should\u2019ve mentioned, even casually, how much Rich\u2019s willingness to follow through on their agreement meant to her. Perhaps if she\u2019d assured him she\u2019d be a good mother, their evening might have turned out differently.</p><p>No. That would\u2019ve been emotional blackmail.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have said any of those things, any more than she could\u2019ve admitted how much she loved him. Or how eager she was to explore the sensuality they\u2019d so recently discovered.</p><p>Jamie was pacing in front of the television, clutching the plastic bag of marshmallows, when the doorbell chimed.</p><p>Her heart lurched. It could be Rich, but she was afraid to hope. More likely it was her neighbor coming to complain that the television was too loud.</p> <p>Her mouth was full of marshmallows, which she attempted to swallow quickly. It didn\u2019t work, although she was chewing as fast as she could. She unlocked the door and nearly choked when Rich smiled in her direction.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She raised her right hand, as though she were making a pledge.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with your cheeks. Have you got the mumps?\u201d</p><p>Pointing at the bag of marshmallows, she chewed some more and swallowed a mouthful of marshmallows. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, her heart leaping against her ribs. \u201cI ... I wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Rather than risk leaving a message, I decided to stop over. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d If he had the slightest idea how pleased she was to see him, he\u2019d be really smiling instead of grinning at her with those blue eyes of his. She knew she was staring, but Jamie couldn\u2019t stop looking at Rich.</p><p>\u201cSomething doesn\u2019t smell right,\u201d he said, wrinkling his nose and sniffing the air. He walked into her kitchen, and opened the microwave. Cringing, he waved his hand in front of the now-cooked\u2014overcooked\u2014entr\u00e9e.</p> <p>\u201cMy dinner,\u201d she explained, stuffing the bag of marshmallows in the silverware drawer.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d given up on this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did...but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to cook tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had to cancel my appointment with Dr. Fullerton and I was depressed. I know I\u2019m depressed when I crave marshmallows and turn on junk television. Life doesn\u2019t get any bleaker than that.\u201d</p><p>Rich was looking at her as though he\u2019d never seen her before.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and make fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you would.\u201d She swiped the back of her hand under her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I didn\u2019t get into the marshmallows when I broke up with Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words I\u2019m responsible for reducing you to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I can\u2019t blame you for everything. Let\u2019s just say you\u2019re responsible for my choice in TV viewing.\u201d</p><p>Rich grinned and brushed a strand of hair from her temple. \u201cWould it help if I told you I\u2019ve come to a decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She was almost afraid to hope....</p><p>Instead of telling her what he\u2019d decided, he removed her unappetizing dinner from the microwave, carried it to the garbage can and dumped it inside.</p><p>\u201cIf you want junk food, we\u2019ll order pizza, all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded eagerly. The we part didn\u2019t escape her. Apparently he intended to stay a while, which was fine with her. More than fine.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re at it, I think it would be best if you ditched the marshmallows, too.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly she jerked open her silverware drawer and handed him her stash.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She gazed up at him, her heart in her eyes. She tried not to let her feelings show but it was impossible.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cancel the appointment with Dr. Fullerton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...you know.\u201d She rubbed her palms together. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear from you this morning\u2014not that I expected I would. I mean, overnight was much too soon for you to make up your mind. It would\u2019ve been unreasonable for me to expect anything of the sort.\u201d Jamie knew she was rambling, but she couldn\u2019t make herself stop. \u201cMy...our appointment with Dr. Fullerton is...was for tomorrow and I couldn\u2019t very well go through with the insemination process, could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been through one insemination process.\u201d He seemed to enjoy reminding her of that.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...this is different.\u201d</p><p>His mouth slanted upward, his eyes bright with laughter. \u201cI should hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to cancel the appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you can reschedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Her eyes connected with his, her heart pounding so loudly she thought he could hear it. \u201cAre you saying you want to stay married and have the baby and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>Jamie couldn\u2019t help herself. She let out a cry of sheer joy, threw her arms around his neck and brought his mouth down to hers.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Rich moaned in surprise and welcome as Jamie\u2019s mouth sought his. He wrapped his arms around her as she stepped deeper into his embrace. His breath\u2014and her breath, too\u2014was heavy, abrupt, as if they\u2019d both been caught off guard by the power of their attraction. The power of their need.</p><p>Rich tried to discipline his response to her, but his arousal was fierce and sudden.</p><p>He wanted Jamie as he\u2019d never wanted anyone. He needed her. The kiss, which had began as a spontaneous reaction of joy and excitement, quickly became a sensuous feast of desperation and desire.</p><p>Rich groaned. He couldn\u2019t stop himself. His wife was in his arms, where she belonged, where he intended to keep her.</p><p>Patience, patience, his mind chanted. They\u2019d make love soon, very soon and when they did, it would be a celebration of their marriage. There would be no grounds for regret or misgivings. No room for doubts. It would all come in time. Soon, Rich promised himself. Soon.</p><p>By a supreme act of will, Rich drew in a tattered, shaky breath and buried his face in her hair. \u201cYou taste of marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d It demanded more control than he\u2019d ever imagined to ease himself from her arms. \u201cWhat about ordering that pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She recovered quickly, Rich noted. Far more quickly than he did. She smiled shakily up at him. \u201cThere was a coupon in Tuesday\u2019s mail....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want pepperoni and sausage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d she said over her shoulder. She moved away from him as if they\u2019d never touched. Rich envied her ability to do so. He had difficulty disguising her effect on him.</p><p>Jamie pulled out a kitchen drawer where she maintained a small file for coupons. Once again he was astonished\u2014although he shouldn\u2019t have been\u2014at how organized she was. In no time, she\u2019d located the right coupon and placed the order.</p><p>The pizza arrived promptly, thirty minutes later, and by then they were back on an even keel with each other. Rich would\u2019ve liked to discuss their kiss, but didn\u2019t want to say or do anything to destroy this fragile peace. There\u2019d be lots of time later to talk about their feelings. For now, he would bask in the warm glow of his love for Jamie and wait patiently for her to love him back.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t take long. He didn\u2019t mean to be cocky about his attractiveness or charm, but their love would be built on the firm foundation of friendship. All he had to do was exhibit patience and tenderness. The way he figured, in a week or two he\u2019d be confident enough to approach her with the truth about his love. By the end of the month he\u2019d be moving in with her.</p><p>No one would fault his plan. Least of all Jamie. He\u2019d bide his time, give her the love and attention she needed, prove that he\u2019d be a good husband to her and a good father to their child.</p><p>If everything went according to his plans, Jamie would be pregnant long before they could see Dr. Fullerton again.</p><p>Soon the pizza box lay open on the kitchen table. Jamie had set out plates and napkins and two cold cans of pop.</p><p>\u201cThis is delicious.\u201d</p><p>Rich agreed with a nod of his head. The pizza was excellent, but its taste couldn\u2019t compare to Jamie\u2019s kisses. In fact, he could easily become addicted to the flavor that was hers alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Fullerton\u2019s office in the morning,\u201d she said casually. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to get in until next month.\u201d Her eyes briefly met his, as though she was seeking his approval.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine to me.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes brightened and her hand reached for his. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this work. We can, I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we can,\u201d Rich told her. If things went the way he wanted them to, they\u2019d soon be a family\u2014and that was exactly how they\u2019d stay, at least if he had anything to say about it. Jamie didn\u2019t know that yet, but she\u2019d discover his intentions soon, and by that time she\u2019d be as eager as he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The alarm blared and Jamie rolled onto her back, swung out one arm and flipped off the buzzer. The irritating noise was replaced with the gentle sounds of the soft rock station she listened to each morning.</p><p>The bed was warm and cozy and she didn\u2019t relish the thought of crawling out into the dark, cold world, especially on a Monday morning. It was far more pleasant to linger beneath layers of blankets, thinking about the good things that were happening between her and Rich.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t seen much of each other in the past week because Rich was involved in a defense project for Boeing. He\u2019d worked three to four hours overtime every night, plus both days of the weekend. Yet he called her every day without fail, usually late in the evening.</p><p>He sounded so frustrated at not seeing her as often as he wanted. As often as she wanted. Jamie had done her best to pretend it didn\u2019t matter, but it did. She missed him dreadfully, although their nighttime phone conversations went a long way toward making up for that.</p> <p>They were like a pair of teenagers talking on the phone. There wasn\u2019t really a lot to discuss, yet they often spent an hour or more chatting and laughing as if it had been weeks since they\u2019d last spoken. Afterward, Jamie would spend the rest of the night swaddled in happiness.</p><p>Rich was exhausted whenever he called her. Although he\u2019d never said as much, she had the impression he hurried out of the office and drove straight home just so he could talk to her.</p><p>Although they hadn\u2019t actually seen each other since the week before, Jamie felt encouraged by the way their relationship was developing. They were close, closer than they\u2019d been at any time since high school. It seemed natural for her life to be so closely entwined with his. Natural and right.</p><p>Everything was going so well for them, she thought again. Rich seemed pleased when she rescheduled her appointment with Dr. Fullerton. Jamie often fantasized about their child\u2014boy or girl, she\u2019d be delighted and she knew he would, too.</p><p>Stretching her arms high above her head, she yawned loudly and kicked away the covers. Although she\u2019d prefer to laze the morning away thinking about Rich and their future, she had to shower and get ready for work.</p> <p>Still yawning, she sat up and turned on the bedside lamp. The room started to sway. Jamie exhaled slowly and closed her eyes. The sensation worsened until she was forced to put her head back on the pillow. The dizziness was followed by a surge of nausea.</p><p>Apparently she was suffering from a relapse of the flu. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Jason called Rich at the office early Tuesday morning. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in a while,\u201d he said, giving the reason for his call. \u201cI thought I\u2019d check in to see how everything\u2019s going with you and Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Rich said, studying a design layout on his desk. He held the phone to his ear with his shoulder as he worked. \u201cI appreciated your words of wisdom the other night.\u201d However, as Rich recalled, Jason had been more concerned with getting him out of his apartment than shedding any new light on Rich\u2019s muddled marriage.</p><p>Rich had been more shaken that night than he\u2019d realized. The mere mention of the word divorce had thrown him. It had also forced him to deal with the depth of his love for Jamie and had set his determination to do everything within his power to make their marriage work.</p><p>\u201cSo things between you and Jamie are better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more talk of a divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Thank God, Rich mused.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve agreed to her terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d It was the terms they\u2019d both agreed to\u2014only he wanted to change the rules now. All he needed was a few days to convince Jamie how crazy she was about him. It shouldn\u2019t be that difficult, especially when he was already so much in love with her, as long as he could get a few hours free from work. Which was difficult right now, with that defense contract gearing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018more or less\u2019 mean?\u201d Jason wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d Rich said, his words heavy with impatience, \u201cthat I intend to make this marriage real.\u201d He glanced around to be sure no one in the office across the hall from him could hear. This wasn\u2019t the way he wanted his fellow workers to learn he was a married man.</p><p>\u201cHow does Jamie feel about this, or\u2014\u201d Jason hesitated \u201c\u2014does she know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe will soon enough.\u201d Rich had never felt more frustrated. The defense project was taking all his time; knowing he\u2019d volunteered for it didn\u2019t help, either. He\u2019d been single at the time, but his life had changed and he was a married man. Sort of a married man. One who longed to be a real husband to his wife.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve considered telling Mom and Dad that you\u2019re married, have you?\u201d</p><p>Jason should\u2019ve gone into police work, Rich mused. He certainly possessed interrogation skills.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt, you know,\u201d Jason added.</p><p>Rich frowned. \u201cIs there any reason I should tell them?\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s chuckle annoyed him. \u201cNot really,\u201d his brother said. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll let me be there when you do.\u201d</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t find any humor in his teasing. \u201cI will when the time\u2019s right.\u201d That might take longer than he\u2019d originally planned, thanks to all the overtime he\u2019d been putting in lately. Informing his parents that he and Jamie were married, and had been for the past six weeks, wasn\u2019t a task he relished. Of course, the longer he waited, the more offended they\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rich said absently, more concerned about the designs he was reviewing than the conversation with his brother. He hung up the phone and glanced at his watch. The defense project was winding down, and if the day progressed as he hoped, he\u2019d be able to take a break this evening and visit Jamie.</p><p>Rich was so involved in the designs that he didn\u2019t notice someone standing in the doorway until he glanced up. When he did, his eyes widened with shock.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d Her own eyes were red and glazed with tears. Yet she was smiling. Rich didn\u2019t know which emotion to respond to first. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rich, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened,\u201d she cried, and ran toward him, arms outstretched. \u201cYou just won\u2019t believe it. I ... I know I shouldn\u2019t have come here, not when you\u2019re so busy, but I had to, I simply had to.\u201d</p><p>Worried that there might be something seriously wrong with her, Rich got out of his chair and had her sit down. Then he crouched in front of her, holding the armrests, forming a protective barricade around her.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said tenderly.</p><p>\u201cI woke up sick yesterday,\u201d she muttered, opening her purse and digging through it for a tissue. When she found one, she dabbed at the corners of her eyes. Once again she was smiling broadly and weeping at the same time. Tears slid down her face, and her mouth trembled with some as-yet-undetermined emotion.</p><p>\u201cI assumed it was the flu,\u201d she said, sobbing, \u201cbut I felt fine a little bit later. I didn\u2019t even think to mention it when you phoned last night\u2014but this morning my stomach was queasy again and I felt light-headed, as though I was going to faint. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think until I checked the calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe calendar?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d Rich was afraid to place too much significance on what she was saying\u2014what she seemed to be saying. She couldn\u2019t possibly mean what he hoped she did. It was ludicrous. They\u2019d only made love that one time.</p><p>Once again she nodded wildly. \u201cRich,\u201d she said, her hands gripping his. \u201cWe\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d Rich repeated in a whisper, stunned. If he hadn\u2019t been clutching the sides of the chair, he would\u2019ve toppled onto his backside. \u201cPregnant,\u201d he repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed it would happen so quickly. My temperature was only elevated a little that morning and... I didn\u2019t really think I was fertile yet, but obviously I was. Rich, oh, Rich,\u201d she sobbed joyfully. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby.\u201d Rich stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? You\u2019ve been to see Dr. Fullerton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... I bought a pregnancy test in the drugstore this morning and a few minutes later\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cThe stick turned blue. You can\u2019t get any more positive than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue...does that mean the baby\u2019s a boy?\u201d His head, his heart, were racing, trying to take it all in.</p><p>Jamie laughed and hiccuped and laughed some more. \u201cNo, silly, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re having a son, it means we\u2019re going to be parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could be having a son,\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Or a daughter.\u201d She threw her arms around his neck and laughed, an outpouring of joy. It was the sweetest, most poignant song he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Rich said, finally\u2014fully\u2014taking it in. \u201cWe\u2019re really pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said, brushing the tips of her fingers over his face. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant.\u201d Slipping his arms around her waist, he stood, bringing her with him. His mouth found hers, and he kissed her the way he\u2019d longed to do all week.</p><p>Jamie moaned. So did Rich. The kiss created a need for much more, and this was neither the time nor the place.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d she whispered, her eyes holding his. Her hands pressed against the sides of his jaw. \u201cTell me you\u2019re pleased about the baby.\u201d</p><p>Everything he wanted to tell her\u2014his joy, his excitement, the overwhelming love he felt for her\u2014it all formed a huge lump in his throat. To his dismay, Rich couldn\u2019t utter a single word. Finally he threw back his head and released a shout that sounded like a war cry.</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d A frowning Bill Hastings appeared in his doorway.</p><p>Rich grinned and waved. He broke away from Jamie, but took her hand in his. \u201cHello, Bill. Have you met Jamie Manning, my wife?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s smile grew and grew. \u201cJamie Warren Manning,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d Bill frowned again, but recovered quickly. \u201cWhen did this happen? You never said a word. This isn\u2019t the same Jamie Warren you...you know, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Jamie answered for him. \u201cI\u2019m the one he wanted you to ask out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better be,\u201d Rich said, tucking his arm around Jamie\u2019s slim waist. The time would come when that same waist would expand, her belly filled with his child. Thinking about it, he felt shaky inside. Rich hadn\u2019t realized men were susceptible to those kinds of emotions. He\u2019d assumed they were reserved for women. His heart was full. Overflowing with a happiness so profound, it was unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced. His throat thickened as though he might break into tears. Rich couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d wept. It wasn\u2019t something men did often. But knowing Jamie was pregnant with his child, his son or daughter, was enough to reduce him to tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d Bill said slowly, clearly not seeing a thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Jamie announced.</p><p>Bill grinned, then turned to Rich. \u201cBut you offered me Seahawks play-off tickets to take her to dinner, and that wasn\u2019t more than two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paid him to take me to dinner?\u201d Jamie muttered under her breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Rich teased. \u201cI was young and foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all rather sudden, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Bill continued, choosing to ignore the whispered conversation between Rich and Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Rich answered. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a fourteen-year courtship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen years!\u201d Bill looked astonished. \u201cIt seems congratulations are in order. I\u2019m very pleased for you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jamie returned graciously.</p> <p>Bill left the office then, and Jamie whirled around to face Rich. \u201cYou told him we\u2019re married!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich, we can\u2019t tell your coworkers and not our families.\u201d</p><p>Rich hadn\u2019t given the matter much thought. It had happened spontaneously. But if a husband had just learned he was about to become a father, he should be able to tell someone, and in this case Bill was that someone.</p><p>\u201cSince you told Bill,\u201d Jamie said, pacing his office, \u201cthen I should be able to tell someone, too. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Personally Rich could see no harm in letting the news out. Especially when revealing the truth might actually help him achieve his goal.</p> <p>Jamie reached for his phone, hesitated momentarily, then sighed deeply and punched out a phone number. Rich had no idea who she was calling. It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>While she was waiting for whomever she\u2019d phoned to answer, Rich moved behind her and slipped his arms around her waist. He closed his eyes and reveled in the emotion he experienced as he held her tight. He wondered how long this euphoric feeling would last. All day? A week? A month? Deep down, he began to doubt it would ever entirely leave him.</p><p>So this was love. This feeling of warmth and fullness. The sensual alertness. This knowledge that the woman you loved more than life itself was giving birth to your child.</p><p>Rich rubbed his cheek against the side of her neck. She smelled of wildflowers and spring.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Rich tensed. She\u2019d asked to tell one person and she\u2019d decided to tell her mother. Rich didn\u2019t know Doris Warren well, but what he did remember of her wasn\u2019t reassuring. She loved to gossip. Except she didn\u2019t call it that, as he recalled. Doris networked.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d Rich whispered in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m calling because I\u2019ve got some fabulous news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJamie?\u201d Rich was in a panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear Doris\u2019s response, but he knew from the loud, squeaking sound that came from the receiver that Jamie\u2019s mother was more than a little surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe father?\u201d Jamie repeated. She twisted around and grinned sheepishly up at Rich. \u201cThat\u2019s not important. What is important is that after all these years, you\u2019re finally going to be a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and tell her,\u201d Rich whispered. Good news, especially news this wonderful, was meant to be shared. Now that Jamie was pregnant\u2014and now that the situation between them had changed\u2014Rich certainly didn\u2019t plan to maintain the confidentiality of their marriage. He couldn\u2019t see the point. He was too proud to keep Jamie\u2019s pregnancy a secret.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d Jamie returned, nodding absently. \u201cOf course, I will. No...no, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Listening to only one half of the conversation put him at a distinct disadvantage, but Rich didn\u2019t mind. He was far more interested in spreading kisses along the side of Jamie\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure. One of those home pregnancy tests.... Yes, Mother. Listen, I have to go now, I\u2019m already late for work. Yes, I\u2019ll call later. Yes, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Rich\u2019s teeth caught hold of Jamie\u2019s earlobe. Her response was immediate; she went weak in his arms. Rich had never felt more powerful in his life.</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d she chastised softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t... Rich!\u201d She swatted him playfully, but he couldn\u2019t make himself stop nibbling her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I thought I\u2019d break it to her gently. A little at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you started by telling her you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d He found her reasoning a bit irrational, which wasn\u2019t typical for Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIf I told my mother we were married, she\u2019d say something to your parents. We both know she would. Mom\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But somehow the prospect wasn\u2019t as intimidating as it had been when Jason had broached the subject earlier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cause problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d Rich said. He reached for her hand and raised it to his lips, kissing her knuckles. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t let it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced regretfully at her watch. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss it later. I\u2019m late.\u201d She seemed as reluctant to leave as Rich was to let her go.</p><p>\u201cMeet me for dinner tonight?\u201d Rich intended to make reservations at the best restaurant in town.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>He tried to judge when he\u2019d be finished, but he had no way of telling. \u201cI won\u2019t know until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Come to my place when you\u2019re through here and we can decide then.\u201d</p><p>Jamie left a few minutes later.</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t know how her day went, but his was a total waste. More than once he found himself staring into space, dreaming of Jamie and his child, plotting how to convince her to make their marriage real.</p><p>His day wouldn\u2019t have been so chaotic, though, if he hadn\u2019t been at meetings for much of the afternoon. He\u2019d be taking notes, and before he realized it, his mind would wander to Jamie. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, not a few stolen moments out of a hectic work schedule. At the end of the day, he longed to hurry home and find her waiting for him. It was easy to envision walking in the front door after a long day at the office and having Jamie there to greet him. Jamie and their son.</p><p>That warm feeling returned, and Rich knew he\u2019d been lost in another world again. Luckily, he hadn\u2019t embarrassed himself at any of the meetings.</p><p>At seven that evening, when he\u2019d finished at the office, he hurried out the door. Bill and a couple of the other engineers invited him for a drink, but Rich declined. He knew they were eager to hear the details of his marriage, but he was in too much of a rush to get home.</p><p>Home to Jamie and his new life. His real life. Now all he had to do was convince her how much he loved her....</p><p>Jamie opened the door and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d say she seemed almost shy. \u201cHi, yourself. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded. Of course he wanted the truth. He remembered she\u2019d told him about the dizzy spells and nausea attacks. He\u2019d listened, but in his excitement had forgotten.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so worried,\u201d she said, laughing gently. \u201cI feel fabulous. Wonderful. I\u2019ve been walking on air all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have told my mother, though,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t kiss her soon, Rich decided, he might lose his mind. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, although he agreed with the sentiment.</p><p>Not giving her a chance to answer, he took her in his arms. His mouth met hers, and they strained against each other. Eager. Hungry. The kiss moist and hot. Before he could question the wisdom of his actions, he was unfastening her blouse. He\u2019d freed four tiny buttons before he had the presence of mind to hesitate.</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her breast, which was sheathed in a pale cream teddy.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be starved by now,\u201d she murmured hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, kissing her once more. Slowly. Thoroughly. Until there could be no doubt of what he wanted. \u201cBut it\u2019s you I\u2019m hungry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...about dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he whispered, easing the silk blouse from her shoulders and reaching for the zipper at the back of her skirt. \u201cI need you, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, too. Oh, Rich, I need you so much.\u201d Her voice was a fleeting whisper.</p><p>Rich tracked a row of kisses down the side of her neck. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>He dipped his tongue into the hollow of her throat. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>He eased the straps from her teddy over her shoulders, blazing a trail of warm, moist kisses toward her breast.</p><p>The sound of the doorbell went through him like an electric shock.</p><p>Jamie tensed. \u201cI ... I\u2019m not expecting anyone,\u201d she said, picking up her blouse and pulling it on.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d Rich said urgently.</p><p>Whoever was at the door must have heard him because the buzzer sounded again in a long, angry blast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get rid of whoever it is,\u201d she muttered, buttoning her blouse as fast as her fingers would cooperate. She hurried to the door and checked the peephole, then groaned.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Rich demanded.</p><p>Jamie closed her eyes. \u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Jamie cried, looking at Rich. She\u2019d been an idiot to announce her pregnancy to her mother, but Jamie had been so excited and happy. Keeping such wonderful news to herself for even a minute longer than necessary was just too hard. Rich had apparently felt the same way, because he\u2019d told a coworker.</p><p>They\u2019d both agreed weeks before not to tell anyone about their marriage or the pregnancy until Jamie was five or six months along and her condition was obvious. All of that had flown out the proverbial window when Bill Hastings had stepped into Rich\u2019s office.</p><p>If Rich had found it necessary to announce their marriage, then surely she was entitled to tell someone about the pregnancy. So Jamie had done what came naturally; she\u2019d called her mother.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we have much of an option,\u201d Rich said calmly. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Once again the doorbell buzzed, now in short bursts. There wasn\u2019t time to argue, but the prospect of facing her mother filled Jamie with dread.</p><p>She opened the door. \u201cMother,\u201d she said, her voice unnaturally high. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Doris Warren\u2019s face revealed dismay. Slowly her gaze traveled to Rich, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Warren,\u201d Rich said.</p><p>\u201cRich.\u201d She nodded stiffly in his direction, then turned to Jamie, her mouth tightening. \u201cYou didn\u2019t return a single one of my calls, Jamie Marie Warren.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother had called the bank a total of seven times. With uncanny luck, Jamie had managed to avoid speaking to her. However, she was pragmatic enough to realize she\u2019d need to soon. But first she had to talk to Rich so they could decide how much to explain. That hadn\u2019t been possible with Rich tied up in meetings all afternoon.</p><p>She\u2019d arrived home, eager to see her husband. Her phone had rung three separate times and she\u2019d let the caller leave messages. Not surprisingly, all three were from her determined mother. Jamie hated having to avoid her, but it was necessary until she\u2019d had the chance to talk to Rich. Now the matter had been taken out of her hands.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should all sit down,\u201d Rich suggested, gesturing toward the couch.</p><p>\u201cI ...don\u2019t know if I can,\u201d Doris Warren muttered. She immediately collapsed onto the sofa. \u201cI can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve ever spent a more distressing day. How could you do such a thing to me?\u201d she asked, glaring at Jamie. \u201cI\u2019m beside myself. My only daughter\u2019s having a baby! My only child...\u201d She paused. \u201cYou\u2019re sure of this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mom, I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d It was more than obvious that she suspected Rich, as once again, her narrowed gaze traveled to him.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Rich announced proudly. He smiled over at Jamie and reached for her hand, squeezing it reassuringly.</p><p>Jamie was in the recliner, and Rich sat on the arm, his hand continuing to hold hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for concern, Mrs. Warren,\u201d he began.</p> <p>\u201cNo need for concern!\u201d Jamie\u2019s mother shot back. \u201cI can tell you right now, I most certainly am concerned. This is my daughter you\u2019ve been fooling around with, and I insist\u2014no, I demand you do the honorable thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Jamie had never seen her mother more agitated. \u201cRich isn\u2019t a criminal. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, it takes two to make a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did seduce you,\u201d Rich delighted in reminding her.</p><p>Jamie frowned back at him. \u201cYou did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Doris cried, \u201che admits it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do now, Mrs. Warren?\u201d Rich asked, seeming genuinely contrite.</p> <p>If Jamie didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d think he was enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cI insist you marry Jamie, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut are you sure you want me for a son-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich!\u201d Jamie was growing angry at this silly game of his.</p><p>Rich\u2019s fingers tightened around hers. Although he did a valiant job of trying to disguise a smile, he failed miserably. His lips quivered and his eyes fairly sparkled. \u201cI believe we should tell her, darling.\u201d</p><p>Darling! Jamie couldn\u2019t remember Rich using that term even once. She looked up at him, astonished by his nerve.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Doris asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Jamie decided to lead into her marriage slowly, giving her mother time to adjust to one shock before hitting her with another.</p><p>\u201cLife is always complicated,\u201d Doris countered, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cRich and I have been friends for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very best of friends,\u201d Rich added.</p><p>\u201cThat much is evident.\u201d Jamie\u2019s mother raised her chin a notch, as though she needed a great deal of restraint to remain civil.</p><p>\u201cNot evident yet,\u201d Rich said, \u201cbut it will be soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jamie muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cExplaining,\u201d Rich answered. Then, turning to his mother-in-law, he smiled serenely down at Jamie and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, Mrs. Warren. Jamie and I are already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Doris sprang to her feet. \u201cJamie, is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted reluctantly. \u201cBut I\u2019d hoped to break the news to you a little more gently.\u201d She frowned at Rich, not bothering to hide her irritation.</p><p>Her mother sat back down and pressed her hand over her heart. \u201cThe two of you are married.... When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral weeks ago,\u201d Rich said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything\u2014not even to your own mother.\u201d This was directed at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a perfectly logical explanation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can already guess.\u201d Doris\u2019s hand flew out, her index finger pointed accusingly at Rich. \u201cThe two of you had to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! No one has to marry in this day and age.\u201d Jamie felt as if she were in a tug-of-war, caught between her mother\u2019s shock and her husband\u2019s amusement. She wondered if he\u2019d behave the same way when it came to informing his own family.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing,\u201d Rich remarked. \u201cJamie and I did marry for the sake of the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop!\u201d Jamie vaulted to her feet.</p><p>\u201cDarling...\u201d Rich stared up at her blankly, as though he couldn\u2019t understand what had caused her outburst.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t darling me!\u201d she snapped at him, her anger getting the best of her. How Rich could find humor in this situation was beyond her. He made her pregnancy sound like...like a joke.</p><p>\u201cJamie, tell me what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Now it was Doris Warren\u2019s turn.</p><p>\u201cRich and I are married,\u201d Jamie explained, facing her mother. \u201cI never would\u2019ve agreed to the wedding if Rich hadn\u2019t insisted on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope he insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, and frankly, Mother, I doubt I can explain now. Suffice it to say, I\u2019m married and pregnant, and you needn\u2019t worry about me. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d Telling her poor confused mother everything at once was sure to complicate things even more than they already were. Someday soon, Jamie would answer all her questions, but not now. Not when Rich was acting as though this had all been contrived for his amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy?\u201d Doris\u2019s bewildered gaze locked with Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBlissfully.\u201d It was Rich who answered for them. Jamie needed all the fortitude she could muster not to contradict him.</p><p>\u201cThen... I\u2019m happy, too.\u201d Doris stood, but seemed surprised to find herself on her feet. She glanced around the room as if she wasn\u2019t sure where she was. Taking the cue, Rich walked to the door and held it open.</p><p>\u201cShall I call you \u2018Mother\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Doris Warren stared up at him for an awkward moment. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye then, Mother Warren. Jamie and I will be in contact with you soon.\u201d</p><p>As though in a stupor, Jamie\u2019s mother walked out the door. Rich closed it after her. The lock had barely slipped into place when Jamie turned on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you were doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cReassuring your mother.\u201d Rich walked past her and sat nonchalantly in the recliner. His actions only fuelled her anger.</p><p>\u201cYou confused her.\u201d And Jamie, as well. Just when she was beginning to believe there was a chance of something wonderful between them, he\u2019d lapsed into these childish antics. The man obviously didn\u2019t recognize a crisis when he saw one. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she cried, continuing to pace.</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d His eyes went wide with a look of pure innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou made everything sound like a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnancy isn\u2019t a tragedy. I couldn\u2019t be happier about it. Besides, the sooner we explained everything to your mother, the sooner she\u2019d leave and the sooner we could get back to what we were doing and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were like this in high school, too.\u201d Jamie\u2019s anger wasn\u2019t going to be appeased that easily. Nor would she allow him to lead her into the bedroom and silence her concerns with his kisses. There was too much at stake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to drag high school into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t one big laugh, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she argued, \u201cyou just act that way. We\u2019re dealing with my mother here and she has\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who told her you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she cried, throwing her hands in the air. \u201cYou had to tell Bill Hastings instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was better than blurting it out to relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom would know soon enough anyway.\u201d Jamie noticed the laughter was gone from Rich\u2019s eyes and he was beginning to frown.</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to apologize for my part in this marriage then you\u2019ll have a long wait. You\u2019ve obviously got regrets, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Rich glared at her. \u201cAs I recall, you made a point of saying that I insisted we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d</p><p>Rich ignored her outburst and continued without pausing. \u201cYou also insinuated you didn\u2019t want the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Jamie\u2019s original idea hadn\u2019t included any of this.</p><p>From the first, her instincts had told her that marriage, even a marriage of convenience, wasn\u2019t to be taken lightly. Rich had never shared her concerns and, in fact, had carelessly brushed them aside.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I went along with this scheme of yours,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cwas because you insisted.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed from his blue eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re so overwhelmed with regrets, you might\u2019ve said something sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to rehash old arguments, but they\u2019d need to clear up the past before they could deal with the future. \u201cI tried to explain my feelings before we were married, but you refused to listen to me. You never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never listen to you?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cOkay, to be fair, you listen, then you ignore my worries and tell me how foolish they are. The wedding\u2019s a prime example of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you agree to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... I want the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be pleased,\u201d Rich said as he marched toward the front door. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your baby\u2014it\u2019s just me you don\u2019t want.\u201d With that parting shot, he was gone.</p><p>He shut the door with enough force to rattle the pictures on the wall. Jamie\u2019s first instinct was to run after him and tell him she didn\u2019t mean any of it. True, she hadn\u2019t been keen on marrying him, but not for the reasons he believed. She loved him, but she couldn\u2019t let him know. She needed to remind herself repeatedly that their marriage wasn\u2019t a love match. Rich had never intended it to be. She was the one who had problems remembering that this was a marriage of convenience.</p><p>She was the one who couldn\u2019t keep her heart out of it.</p><p>Rich hadn\u2019t meant to argue with Jamie. Fighting was the last thing on his mind when he went to her apartment. From the minute she\u2019d left his office that morning, all he could think about was making love to her again. He longed to hold her in his arms and tell her how thrilled he was about the pregnancy. But nothing had worked out the way he\u2019d planned. Instead, they\u2019d gotten into a shouting match during which she\u2019d repeatedly reminded him that she hadn\u2019t wanted to marry him in the first place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t seem particularly concerned about what she was doing to his ego, either.</p><p>All right, so maybe his attitude toward Jamie\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t the best, but no way was he going to sit there wearing a frown and pretending this pregnancy was some unthinkable disaster. So he\u2019d taken a lighter approach. If Jamie wanted to fault him for that, then fine. Guilty as charged.</p><p>He had a sense of humour. He liked to tease. Always had. A fact that Jamie delighted in reminding him. Leave it to a woman to reach back thirteen years to their high school days to dig up something they could fight about.</p><p>Rich walked across the living room, loosening his tie as he moved. So, Jamie still regretted their marriage. No wonder she\u2019d been so eager to offer him the option of a divorce.</p> <p>He lowered himself into his favorite chair, raised his feet onto the ottoman and leaned his head against the back, closing his eyes. He needed to clear his thoughts, erase any trace of pride and negative emotion. Deal with the issues facing him.</p><p>What were the issues?</p><p>Jamie was pregnant. Apparently she was as thrilled at the prospect as he was himself, but for different reasons. He was a means to the end, and now that he\u2019d accomplished what she wanted, he was of no use to her.</p><p>He felt a painful tightening in his chest. Over the years he\u2019d met a lot of women. Women who used him, wanted him, manipulated him. He would never have believed Jamie was one of them. It was more than obvious that she was trying to push him out of her life. There wasn\u2019t much Rich could do.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t force her to love him.</p> <p>Rich must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew the phone was ringing. His eyes shot open, and he stood abruptly, awkwardly, and walked across the room. He prayed with everything in him it would be Jamie, but it wasn\u2019t his headstrong wife.</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d</p><p>This questioning, bewildered tone was one he\u2019d rarely heard in his mother\u2019s voice. \u201cHello, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had the most...surprising phone call from Doris Warren.\u201d</p><p>Rich groaned inwardly. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Jamie Warren\u2019s mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me about you and Jamie being married?\u201d She made the statement into a question, as if she expected Rich to immediately deny everything.</p><p>\u201cShe told you that?\u201d Circumstances being what they were, Rich chose to answer his mother\u2019s question with one of his own.</p><p>\u201cShe also said Jamie\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Like Jamie, his mother had plenty of experience dealing with his stall tactics. When he didn\u2019t immediately respond, she raised her voice and asked him again. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Rich wearily rubbed his face, hoping that would help clear his mind. \u201cPart of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was quickly advancing toward hysteria. Rich knew his father wasn\u2019t there, otherwise Eric Manning would\u2019ve made the call. His mother had a tendency to get excited over the smallest details. For that matter, so did his father.</p> <p>When his parents learned Taylor had married Russ Palmer in Reno, all hell had broken loose. They hadn\u2019t been thrilled to learn Christy had married Cody Franklin on the sly, either. Rich could only guess what their reaction would be when they learned he was married to Jamie. Like his two sisters, he\u2019d married without a family wedding.</p><p>\u201cRather than explain everything over the phone, I suggest Jamie and I drop in tomorrow evening,\u201d Rich said. \u201cWe can discuss everything then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be able to get away from the office around six. I\u2019ll check with Jamie to make sure that time is convenient for her, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer one question. Are you and Jamie Warren married or not?\u201d</p><p>Rich hesitated. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me a thing,\u201d Elizabeth cried.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rich couldn\u2019t argue with his mother about that. But he couldn\u2019t tell her what he didn\u2019t know himself.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished the conversation, Rich stared down at the phone for a moment. He didn\u2019t have any choice; he had to call her. Swallowing his pride left a bitter taste in his mouth, but there was no avoiding it. He reached for the receiver and punched out her number.</p><p>Jamie answered on the second ring. Rich didn\u2019t bother with any greetings. \u201cI just got a call from my mother. She apparently talked to yours.\u201d</p><p>Jamie released a slow, frustrated sigh. \u201cI was afraid that would happen. What did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs little as I could. Naturally she didn\u2019t understand, so I told her we\u2019d come by after work tomorrow, around six, and explain.\u201d Rich tried to keep the inflection in his voice to a minimum, tried not to let any of his emotions rise to the surface.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jamie repeated.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient, then I\u2019ll let you call and tell her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d He knew he sounded stiff and formal, but Rich couldn\u2019t help it. A man\u2019s pride could take only so much abuse.</p><p>When he\u2019d hung up, Rich sauntered into his kitchen. He hadn\u2019t eaten since early afternoon, but he wasn\u2019t hungry. Scanning the contents of his refrigerator, he reached for a cold pop.</p><p>On his way out of the kitchen, he paused in front of the phone. Before he could question his actions, he dialed Jason\u2019s number and waited two long rings before his older brother answered.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night at six,\u201d Rich announced without preamble. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to exchange pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening tomorrow?\u201d Jason demanded, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling Mom and Dad I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s hesitation was only slight. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought she canceled the appointment with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d Rich realized he sounded abrupt and disagreeable. Hey, he was abrupt and disagreeable. But Jason had asked to be present when Rich told their parents about his marriage.</p><p>\u201cIf Jamie canceled the doctor\u2019s appointment, then how...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby was conceived in the traditional way.\u201d</p><p>Jason was silent for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d Rich snapped. \u201cReal happy.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t seem a fair exchange. He wanted the baby, but nothing was happening the way he would\u2019ve liked. According Rich\u2019s plan, he and Jamie would\u2019ve been in bed together right this minute. They would\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s arms, her face nestled on his shoulder. When they kissed, it would\u2019ve been a leisurely exploration of their need and appreciation for each other. His restless hands would be roaming at will over her body, and he\u2019d spread his palm over her flat stomach, communicating his feelings to his unborn child. When they made love, it would\u2019ve been a celebration of her pregnancy.</p><p>But Jamie didn\u2019t need him any longer.</p><p>Rich had served his purpose.</p><p>Rich had trouble keeping his mind on his work the following afternoon. Every ten minutes or so, he found himself looking at his watch. Each time, he mentally calculated how long it would be before he\u2019d be confronting his parents with the truth.</p><p>A few minutes after five, he was sitting at his desk, reviewing some figures, when there was a polite knock at his door. He grumbled a reply, and the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>Jamie stood before him, dressed in a pretty pink suit. \u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>The last person Rich expected to see waltzing through his office door was his pregnant wife.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rolling back his chair, \u201cyou\u2019re not disturbing a thing.\u201d Maybe his equilibrium...and his heart. But precious little else. \u201cSit down.\u201d He gestured toward the chair on the other side of his desk.</p><p>Jamie sat down, and he saw that her gaze fell to her clenched hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought we should discuss what we\u2019re going to tell your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d He hoped to give the impression that whatever they decided didn\u2019t matter one way or the other to him. He leaned against the back of the chair and locked his fingers behind his head.</p><p>\u201cDo they know I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your mother told mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she must have,\u201d Jamie said, with a sigh. \u201cI feel like such a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, still avoiding eye contact. \u201cFor telling her. I\u2019ve complicated the whole situation.\u201d</p><p>Rich didn\u2019t agree or disagree. It seemed that every time he opened his mouth, he said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you think we have to explain?\u201d Jamie asked, risking a glance in his direction.</p><p>Rich hadn\u2019t decided. \u201cEverything,\u201d he said without giving it any thought.</p><p>\u201cA-all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see any reason to hold any of it back.\u201d Some of the disappointment and lingering animosity from their argument from the day before seeped into his words.</p><p>\u201cI thought we might want them to assume the baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rich said forcefully.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s startled gaze connected with his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even let me finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew what you were going to say. You want my parents to assume this baby was conceived artificially. I won\u2019t be a party to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Rich\u2019s phone rang just then. He reached for it, although he would\u2019ve preferred to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cEngineering,\u201d he responded automatically. \u201cRich Manning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paul,\u201d his eldest brother said. \u201cI just got done talking to Mom. What\u2019s going on with you and Jamie Warren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d So Mom was calling in the big guns. Paul was the responsible one in the family, or at least that was his reputation and his role. When it came to family problems, his parents tended to lean on Paul for support.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI got a call from Mom no more than ten minutes ago with some crazy rumor about you being married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no rumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie Warren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie Warren Manning,\u201d Rich answered without thinking. He had to stop saying that. She\u2019d never be a Manning. Rich could feel her stare, but he avoided glancing in her direction, refusing to give her the power to disconcert him.</p><p>\u201cMom says Jamie\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Rich had no intention of hiding it. In a few months, Jamie\u2019s condition would become obvious, and while she might want to hide the truth, he had no interest in colluding with her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you tell it tonight.\u201d Paul\u2019s disapproval was all too evident.</p><p>Rich rubbed his eyes. Thanks to Jamie, he hadn\u2019t slept well the night before. His dreams had been troubling, and he\u2019d tossed restlessly until morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJamie and I\u2019ll be there at six. We\u2019ll explain everything then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be there, too.\u201d</p><p>Rich closed his eyes to the mounting frustration. This meeting with his parents was becoming a real spectacle, with Paul and Jason sitting on the sidelines. Rich wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his parents brought in Taylor and Christy, too.</p><p>His whole family was about to discover that Rich was the biggest fool who\u2019d ever walked the earth.</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>Both of Rich\u2019s brothers were there waiting for him when he arrived at his parents\u2019 home with Jamie at five minutes to six. Paul and Jason were perched on bar stools, holding pop cans, eager to view the latest family performance. The scene reminded Rich of one that had played out months earlier between his parents and his sister Christy when she\u2019d announced her marriage to Cody Franklin. Rich remembered being amused by the circumstances then. Following in his youngest sister\u2019s footsteps, however, was proving to be far less entertaining.</p><p>His mother was on the phone, and from the way she was shaking her head and muttering under her breath, Rich realized she was probably talking to one of his sisters in Montana.</p><p>He walked into the living room with Jamie beside him. He noticed how close she stood to him, which surprised him. At his office, they\u2019d taken several minutes to review exactly what they planned to say.</p><p>To him, the entire matter was cut-and-dried. He was in his thirties, certainly old enough to do as he pleased without his parents\u2019 approval. Who and why Rich married was his own business, and that was how he intended to keep it. He\u2019d convinced Jamie that, if necessary, he\u2019d reveal the details of their arrangement, but he doubted it would come to that.</p> <p>After Rich and Jamie were seated, Eric Manning stalked into the living room. His father was tall and in excellent physical condition; his thick hair was nearly gray, and his hairline had barely begun to recede. He was in robust health and looked it.</p><p>Rich\u2019s two sisters claimed all the men in the Manning family were black-belt chauvinists. Rich hadn\u2019t given it much thought, but he had definite ideas about a man\u2019s responsibilities\u2014to his wife and his family.</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d his father said, nodding once. Eric\u2019s face was grave, and the glance he shot Rich would have quelled Attila the Hun.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Rich nodded, too. He chose to sit on the sofa, Jamie still at his side. He didn\u2019t know whose hand reached out first, but their fingers entwined automatically, as though they gained strength from each other. Jamie appeared far more nervous than Rich, which, he supposed, was natural.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s talking to Taylor,\u201d his father said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be finished in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>So Rich had guessed correctly. His mother had managed to involve his oldest sister in this.</p> <p>\u201cWould you care for something to drink?\u201d Eric asked Jamie. \u201cThere\u2019s cold pop, coffee or tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks,\u201d she answered with a smile.</p><p>Rich noticed that Jamie rested her free hand against her stomach, then drew in a deep, calming breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d She\u2019d mentioned not being well in the mornings, but he\u2019d been so caught up in his own concerns that it had slipped his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nerves,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about mornings?\u201d</p> <p>Rich wasn\u2019t especially thrilled to have his two brothers and his father monitoring his conversation, but he was worried about Jamie\u2019s health and their baby\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2019s still a little queasy, but I heard it\u2019ll get better in a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe book I read says morning sickness should gradually disappear, starting at about the third month.\u201d Rich had devoured the paperback on pregnancy and childbirth in one sitting, eager to read everything he could about the changes taking place in Jamie\u2019s body. Eager to learn the most minute details about how his child was forming.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cYou\u2019re reading a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might surprise you to learn I read quite a bit,\u201d he chided.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, and her gaze met his, faltering slightly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re reading one about pregnancy and childbirth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt just does.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t say much for her view of him. Rich would have questioned her further, but his mother chose to enter the room just then. Elizabeth Manning smiled warmly in Jamie\u2019s direction, but her eyes hardened as they slid toward Rich. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done that was so terrible. His father had looked at him in much the same way, as though he should be taken out to the woodpile to have his backside tanned.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Taylor?\u201d Rich inquired conversationally, ignoring the censorious looks from both his parents. He kept his voice cool and even. He was actually proud of his composure.</p><p>\u201cTaylor\u2019s fine. So are Russ and little Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Rich crossed his long legs and leaned against the couch. This wasn\u2019t going to be nearly as bad as he\u2019d suspected, as long as he kept a cool head.</p><p>\u201cTaylor\u2019s decided to do some substitute teaching for the school district. Russ isn\u2019t completely in favor of the idea, but he\u2019s coming around.\u201d</p><p>Rich knew from experience that his oldest sister\u2019s will was powerful enough to launch a rocket. Russ would do well to recognize that and act accordingly.</p><p>\u201cShe was shocked to hear about you and Jamie getting married,\u201d his mother continued, after drawing in a deep breath. \u201cWhich, I might add, came as a significant shock to your father and me, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d Jason spoke for the first time. \u201cI knew about it from the beginning. In fact, I was Rich\u2019s best man.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention swung to Jason.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d their mother echoed, accusation in her voice.</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cTrust me. I tried to talk him out of it, but you know how stubborn Rich can be. He refused to listen to the advice of his betters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked Jason to the ceremony and not your own mother?\u201d Elizabeth Manning cried. She pulled a tissue from her pocket and dabbed at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was a civil ceremony at the King County courthouse,\u201d Rich started to explain. He didn\u2019t get very far. Once again he was interrupted by his mother.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even marry Jamie in a church?\u201d Elizabeth sounded as if this was the worst misdeed of all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset, Mrs. Manning, I preferred it that way,\u201d Jamie answered quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut...why get married in a courthouse when you both belong to a church?\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned nervously to Rich. Now was the time to announce the reason for their impromptu wedding.</p><p>Rich had it all worked out in his mind. The assurances, the brief but concise explanation of what had led to their unusual agreement. Yet when the moment arrived, Rich discovered he couldn\u2019t make himself say it.</p><p>\u201cWe did it that way for our own reasons,\u201d was all the explanation he was willing to give. From the corner of his eye, Rich caught sight of Jason arching his brows.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jamie\u2019s mother, Jamie was already pregnant at the time of the wedding,\u201d Eric bellowed. His hands clenched at his sides, he paced the length of the living room, then paused in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to Rich and Jamie. \u201cA couple doesn\u2019t need any more reason to marry quickly than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to disillusion you,\u201d Rich reported calmly, \u201cbut as a matter of fact, Jamie wasn\u2019t pregnant when we got married.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth glared at him, her expression implying it was all a lie. Rich had no intention of arguing with either of his parents; they could believe what they wished.</p><p>\u201cThen why did Doris make a point of telling us the two of you had married because of the baby?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>Rich groaned inwardly. \u201cBecause we\u2019d decided Jamie should get pregnant as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Jamie exchanged a look with Rich, and added, \u201cWe\u2019re married because we both want to become parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell Rich a wedding wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Jason inserted, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t listen to me. He felt that if they were going to have a baby, he should marry her first. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>His mother gave Jason a horrified look. \u201cI should certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>Eric turned around to face them, frowning. \u201cTrust me, parenthood\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad,\u201d Paul teased. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so bad, now, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to weddings,\u201d Eric argued, \u201cit\u2019s been a nightmare. It was bad enough that your sisters had to get married on the sly\u2014but I never suspected one of you boys would pull that stunt. I want to know when there\u2019s going to be a real wedding in this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane and I had a real wedding,\u201d Paul reminded his father.</p><p>\u201cBut no one from the Manning family was there.\u201d Eric\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cThe boy goes into the army, ships out to Alaska and returns home a married man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just one of those things,\u201d Paul said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGetting back to Rich and Jamie,\u201d their mother said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jason agreed, gesturing toward the sofa. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Rich and Jamie. Do you realize, Mom and Dad, that they\u2019re married and aren\u2019t even living together?\u201d</p><p>Rich sent his brother a look hot enough to sizzle bacon.</p><p>\u201cRich?\u201d His mother turned to him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cNot living together? Why not? You\u2019re married, aren\u2019t you?\u201d His father fired rapid questions at them. \u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married,\u201d Rich broke in.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...yet.\u201d It was the best evasion Rich could come up with on such short notice. This was a subject he\u2019d hoped to avoid, along with several others.</p><p>\u201cThey plan to move in together soon, isn\u2019t that right, Rich?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It was Jamie who responded, and Rich stared at her. He couldn\u2019t help wondering if she was sincere or if her sudden reassurances were all part of an act to appease his parents. Not that Rich had any objection to moving in with Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAre there problems with your lease?\u201d his mother asked next.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m working on it,\u201d Rich muttered noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll move in with her soon,\u201d Eric asserted, burying his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cA pregnant woman needs her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely positive you\u2019re pregnant, Jamie, dear?\u201d Elizabeth Manning\u2019s voice was filled with gentle concern.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely positive,\u201d Jamie said with a firm nod. \u201cThe kit I bought at the drugstore is very reliable, but I was at the doctor\u2019s this afternoon and he confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to the doctor?\u201d Rich asked before he could stop himself. They\u2019d spent half an hour at his office discussing this meeting and she hadn\u2019t said a word about seeing Dr. Fullerton! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a short visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he give you a due date?\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled shyly and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Rich was calculating dates. His best guess placed her delivery date sometime close to Christmas. A child would be the best gift of his life.</p> <p>\u201cThe last week of December,\u201d Jamie announced.</p><p>\u201cI always did love the winter months,\u201d Rich said, having difficulty keeping the pride and elation from his voice. Then, damning caution, he brought her knuckles to his mouth and brushed his lips over her hand.</p><p>Elizabeth sighed softly. \u201cAre you experiencing morning sickness, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA husband should be with his wife,\u201d Eric reminded Rich for the second time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about Rich moving in with me,\u201d Jamie said. This was news to Rich, who couldn\u2019t recall a single word of such a conversation. After Doris Warren had unexpectedly dropped by Jamie\u2019s apartment, they\u2019d barely been able to resume their conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a truck,\u201d Jason said, again motioning toward them with his pop can. \u201cAnytime you need anything hauled, little brother, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Rich muttered. He didn\u2019t know what Jamie was up to, but he wasn\u2019t complaining. If she wanted his family to assume this was a love match, he\u2019d play along. From his perspective it was, so this was an unexpected turn for the better.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled, then,\u201d Eric said forcefully. \u201cRich is moving in with Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold a reception in their honor?\u201d Rich\u2019s mother asked his father. Her eyes were sparkling with excitement. Rich remembered how his mother had thrown all her efforts into the engagement party for Christy and what a disaster that had been.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave that up to these young folks, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Rich wasn\u2019t keen on a reception, especially in light of the fact that Jamie planned to divorce him as soon as their baby was born. Thank heaven no one had inquired too closely.</p><p>Rich made a point of glancing at his watch. \u201cIf you\u2019ll both excuse us, Jamie told her mother we\u2019d be stopping by her house, as well.\u201d She\u2019d delivered that tidbit of information when she\u2019d arrived at his office earlier.</p><p>The prospect of facing Doris Warren twice in as many days didn\u2019t thrill Rich. One set of parents at a time was about all he could handle.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d lied to Rich\u2019s family. Normally she stuck to the truth, believing with all her being that a lie was always wrong. Yet when Rich\u2019s father had started questioning them about their living arrangements, Jamie found herself uttering a falsehood.</p><p>Rich had looked flabbergasted when she\u2019d said they were moving in together. Stunned. To his credit, he recovered quickly and went along with her as though they\u2019d actually reached that decision.</p><p>Although they hadn\u2019t discussed the prospect even once, Jamie had hoped Rich would suggest moving in with her once he learned she was pregnant. He hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She regretted their argument of the day before. Over and over during the long sleepless night, she\u2019d relived their angry exchange and felt worse each time.</p><p>She\u2019d overreacted. Rich was only being Rich. She\u2019d lashed out at him because he\u2019d responded to a tense situation with humor.</p> <p>His parting shot about her not wanting him now that she was pregnant troubled her the most. He couldn\u2019t honestly believe that, could he? Jamie was crazy about Rich. She\u2019d been in love with him for years, but she\u2019d been too blind to recognize it.</p><p>After her appointment with Dr. Fullerton, she\u2019d gone to Rich\u2019s office at the Boeing Renton complex. She\u2019d hoped they\u2019d have a few minutes alone to clear the air. But when she arrived, Rich was stone-cold and about as friendly.</p><p>Only when they were at his parents\u2019 home did he lower his guard. He\u2019d taken her hand in his and smiled down on her as though they\u2019d never exchanged a cross word. Of course, it could all be for show, but Jamie prayed that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>\u201cYour mother seems to be in better spirits this evening,\u201d Rich said conversationally. He drove at a relaxed pace, weaving through the narrow neighborhood streets.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had time to adjust to our news.\u201d Their visit had been short and sweet. Just long enough to offer the reassurances Doris seemed to need. Jamie hadn\u2019t found that difficult, because she was perfectly comfortable in the role of happy mother-to-be.</p><p>\u201cHave you adjusted to the news?\u201d Rich asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded. \u201cI suppose I should be surprised, but frankly, I\u2019m not. By the way, are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Jamie was famished. She\u2019d woken with a queasy stomach that morning and skipped breakfast. Then at noon, she\u2019d eaten a small carton of blueberry yogurt but nothing since.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go to a restaurant and get something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, thinking quickly. \u201cWe could order pizza and have it delivered to my place.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, as if the suggestion had astonished him. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>It was nearly eight by the time they got to Jamie\u2019s condominium. While Rich ordered the pizza, Jamie went into her bedroom and changed out of her business suit. She chose jeans and a pale blue sweater.</p><p>When she returned to the living room, Rich had loosened his tie and was leafing through the evening paper. He looked up when she entered the room and slowly set the newspaper aside.</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize both sets of parents expect me to move in with you now.\u201d The thought apparently weighed heavy on his mind.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sat across from him, leaning forward, and clasped her hands. \u201cPersonally I ...don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to believe her.</p><p>\u201cI mean...this will probably be the only pregnancy for either of us, and since you\u2019ve been reading so much about it, and seem so interested...it\u2019s only fair that you share as much of the experience as possible.\u201d Jamie hesitated a moment. \u201cUnless, of course, you\u2019d rather not live with me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a noncommittal shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d His gaze moved past her to the hallway that led to the two bedrooms. \u201cNaturally I\u2019ll be sleeping in the spare room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jamie concurred. But not for long, if everything went as she hoped. She loved Rich. Truly loved him. So far, she\u2019d bungled their relationship and their marriage at every turn. If he were to share these short precious months with her before the birth of their child, there was a chance he might grow to love her.</p><p>It was worth the risk.</p><p>Worth the potential heartache.</p><p>Worth gambling her pride and even her future for this one opportunity.</p><p>The pizza arrived soon after, and they sat at the kitchen table, the cardboard box propped open in front of them. They both drank tall glasses of cold milk.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been feeling queasy in the mornings?\u201d Rich posed the question after several minutes of comfortable silence. He too seemed to be working to maintain this fragile peace.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little. Dr. Fullerton said it would pass soon enough. I haven\u2019t gotten really sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Fullerton suggested I nibble on a couple of soda crackers when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bring them to you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. She would like that, but she was afraid to let Rich know how much it would mean to her. Even now, weeks later, she continued to miss their early-morning phone conversations. They\u2019d shared a special closeness then, one that had gone from her life.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d Jamie asked when they\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and read the paper and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice, wifely thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jamie responded with a saucy smile. She took her time making the coffee. While she waited for it to brew, she cleaned the kitchen, wiped the counters and placed their few dishes in the dishwasher.</p><p>Carrying a steaming cup of coffee into the living room, she hesitated when she saw that Rich\u2019s eyes were closed, although the paper was still clutched in his hands.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Jamie sat on the nerby ottoman. She took a sip of the coffee as she carefully studied the man she\u2019d married. His features were more relaxed now, his head cocked slightly to one side.</p><p>How handsome he was. His good looks were even more appealing in slumber. Not sure what dictated her actions, Jamie set the coffee aside and slipped the newspaper from his unsuspecting grasp. Rich stirred briefly, then nestled more securely in the chair.</p><p>Jamie reached for the lamp, dimming it. Then, calling herself a romantic idiot, she slipped into Rich\u2019s lap and pressed her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d He sounded unsure.</p><p>\u201cWere you hoping to find someone else in your arms?\u201d she asked in a small whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A smile faintly curved his mouth.</p><p>His grin disappeared as his hand framed her face, and his blue eyes held her captive. Jamie could feel her heart pound frantically. Then his thumb caressed the line of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI never realized how beautiful you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAll these years...\u201d</p><p>Jamie dropped her gaze, afraid to meet his eyes. She wasn\u2019t anywhere close to being beautiful, and it hurt, a good kind of hurt, that he should think otherwise.</p><p>His mouth sought out hers. The kiss started slowly, gently, so gently that Jamie could feel herself begin to melt. A feeling of sublime languor filled her. It was completely unfair\u2014downright decadent, in fact\u2014that he could make her feel such things with a simple kiss.</p><p>Simple. Rich didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word. Certainly not when it came to kissing.</p><p>Jamie heard the whimpering sound before she was aware that it came from her.</p><p>Rich ended the kiss as leisurely as he\u2019d begun it. Jamie\u2019s eyes remained closed, and her breathing came in staggered gasps. For long, contented moments, he held her. His fingers were at the back of her head, stroking her hair. In those moments, Jamie felt the air vibrate with sweet, unspoken promises.</p><p>He wanted to make love to her.</p><p>Jamie wanted it, too.</p><p>\u201cI should be heading home?\u201d Rich\u2019s voice rose softly at the end of his statement, turning it into a question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, catching his lower lip between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving in with me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting right this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?</p><p>Jamie smiled and pressed her lips to his. \u201cYou want to argue with me?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo...it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t allow him to finish, kissing him again, cramming her heart, her soul, her love, into a single kiss.</p><p>She\u2019d surprised him; his gasp confirmed as much. He groaned anew, then deepened the kiss.</p><p>They were both trembling when it ended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Getting off his lap, Jamie stood and held out her hand to Rich. His smoky, passion-hazed eyes met hers, his gaze questioning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked her again, his words hoarse with need, his eyes hot with passion and some other emotion she couldn\u2019t quite read. Restraint? Doubt? Jamie didn\u2019t know which.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Why he felt he had to remind her of that was beyond her. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d As she was speaking, her hands were unfastening the buttons on his shirt. Rich helped her by pulling his tie loose and dropping it to the carpet. Jamie slid the shirt from his shoulders, then ran her hands down the full length of his arms.</p><p>His chest captured her attention next. His warm, muscular, chest. She ran her flattened hands over it, marveling at the strength she sensed in him. She closed her eyes, wanting him so badly she felt weak with the need.</p><p>\u201cYou make me crazy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d It made no sense to Jamie. \u201cYes. I want you so much you make me ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.... Me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Rich groaned and took her, in his arms, lifting her against him until she became profoundly aware of his arousal.</p><p>For one wild second it was as though the world stood still for them. Rich\u2019s blue eyes appeared aquamarine in the dim light. Bright, intense, filled with promises.</p><p>Jamie felt completely vulnerable to him. Vulnerable and desirable, more desirable than she\u2019d ever felt in her life. She smiled and moved away from him.</p><p>Rich looked confused, but he released her.</p><p>Jamie turned and had gone two steps before she turned around again. A smile quivered at the edges of her mouth. \u201cYou coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed softly, sexily, and held out her hand to him. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Rich woke in the middle of the night. It took him only seconds to realize he was in bed with Jamie. For the next few minutes he did nothing more than watch his wife as she slept. He drank in every delicate nuance of her beauty. He stared at her as if they\u2019d been separated for months, years, when she\u2019d actually spent the night in his arms.</p><p>Gradually his gaze lowered to her lips, parted slightly, her breathing slow and even. She had the most delectable mouth....</p><p>Desire came at him unexpectedly. Memories of the gentle way Jamie had led him to her bed suffused him like a mist. She\u2019d held her arms out to him, until the ache of wanting her, needing her, dissolved any will he had to refuse her.</p><p>She\u2019d freely opened her heart and her body to him. When she\u2019d cried out in pleasure at her completion, the sound of her joy had echoed in his very soul. The sheer, utter beauty of their lovemaking had marked him in ways he was only beginning to understand.</p><p>Jamie stirred and rolled her head to one side. Her hair spilled across her face, and after a moment, Rich risked waking her by gently brushing it aside. His breathing was fast, much too fast considering the simplicity of the gesture.</p><p>He leaned forward, intending to kiss her. The way he was feeling, with need clawing at his insides, he knew if he followed through with his intention, the kiss would be too intense, too powerful. By an act of will, he stopped himself just in time.</p> <p>He\u2019d made love to her only hours before and already he was wondering how long it would be before he could do so again.</p><p>He had to think. Pull himself together. Make some sense of this nagging physical ache, this overwhelming need, before he woke Jamie and frightened her. Folding back the covers, he sat on the side of the bed, rubbing his face.</p><p>\u201cRich.\u201d</p><p>The panic he heard in Jamie\u2019s voice made him turn around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d He slipped back into the bed and gathered her in his arms. She felt so soft against him. Holding her, he wished he could stay like this forever.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she repeated, almost deliriously, clinging to him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Even if he\u2019d wanted to, Rich could never have walked away from her. He was so much in love with her, so driven by need...and desire.</p><p>He kissed her, hoping to reassure her, but the kiss was everything he\u2019d feared. And wanted. His mouth was hard and demanding, as his hands investigated her warm, perfect skin.</p><p>\u201cJamie...\u201d He slid his mouth down the perfume-scented curve of her neck, down her shoulder to the peaked softness of her breast.</p><p>Jamie moaned softly and arched her back, encouraging him, plowing her fingers through his hair, thrashing beneath him.</p><p>He lifted his head and kissed her mouth. \u201cI need you...again,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Their need for each other was as urgent as their kisses. A strangled cry slipped from her throat as she clutched at his back.</p><p>Rich jerked his mouth from hers. \u201cI\u2019m scaring you?\u201d He was afraid he had, or worse, that he was hurting her.</p><p>\u201cNo...no, love me, just love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Rich intended to do a lot more than simply fulfill their bodies\u2019 hunger. But for now, his need was too great to take it slow. Or easy. Ruthless desire dictated his actions.</p><p>She lay there, eager and trusting, vulnerable to him. Her dark hair fanned about her shoulders. Her sweet face was flushed with excitement, her eyes wide and misty with an emotion too strong to voice. Her lips were parted and moist from his kisses, and her breath came in tiny gasps of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cJamie...love. My love.\u201d</p><p>Rich couldn\u2019t resist her a second longer. Not another second.</p><p>The alarm sounded while it was still dark. Jamie rolled onto her side and reached blindly for the clock radio, shutting off the irritating noise.</p><p>Rich moved toward her, cradling her, placing his arm around her middle. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he whispered. With familiarity, his hand cupped her breast. Although they\u2019d spent much of the night making love, Jamie was astonished by her body\u2019s ready response to his touch.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Jamie couldn\u2019t help feeling a little shy after the tempestuous night they\u2019d spent. Memories of their lovemaking filled her mind\u2014the brazen way she\u2019d led him into her bedroom, stripped for him, stripped him, sent a surge of color into her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling this morning?\u201d Rich asked, his mouth close to her ear. He caught her lobe between his teeth and sucked gently, shooting warm shivers down Jamie\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to bring you some crackers?\u201d</p><p>Jamie hadn\u2019t immediately realized he was asking about the baby, the pregnancy. \u201cNot...yet.\u201d She eased back the covers and cautiously righted herself. When she did suffer bouts of nausea, it was generally when she first sat up. With her legs dangling over the bed, she inhaled a deep breath and was relieved to discover she didn\u2019t feel queasy at all.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to shower first?\u201d Rich asked from behind her, his hands at her waist.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She had trouble looking at him. It was silly to be so nervous, she told herself. They were married, for heaven\u2019s sake. Married. There was no reason to feel uncomfortable or ill at ease. Rich was her husband, and he had a perfect right to spend the night with her.</p><p>Jamie moved into her bathroom and turned on the shower, adjusting its temperature. It wasn\u2019t until she was under the pulsing spray that she remembered.</p><p>The scene replayed itself, its effect as brutal as a slap across the face.</p><p>Rich had been about to leave her again, sneaking out in the middle of the night. If she hadn\u2019t half wakened when she did, he would\u2019ve walked out on her a second time. Once again he\u2019d planned to leave her, to let her face the empty morning alone. Except that this time she\u2019d pleaded with him to stay.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t know how long she stood under the spray. Long enough to regulate her breathing and wait for the pain that rippled through her to subside.</p><p>When she finished, she forced a smile and walked nonchalantly back into the bedroom, a white towel around her. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told him, not meeting his eyes.</p><p>Rich had made coffee and brought her a mug, as well as a small plate with four soda crackers. \u201cBreakfast is served,\u201d he said, bowing before her.</p><p>Jamie drank some of her coffee, careful to keep the towel securely in place with one hand. It was ludicrous to act modest after what they\u2019d shared. The things they\u2019d said. The things they\u2019d done. Beautiful things...</p><p>Nevertheless she was.</p><p>Rich frowned, then left her. Although the bathroom door was shut, Jamie heard him singing at the top of his lungs over the sound of the shower. She took advantage of the brief privacy to get dressed, haphazardly choosing her outfit for the day.</p><p>She made the bed, folded Rich\u2019s scattered clothes and laid them on top, then hurriedly moved into the kitchen. Generally she didn\u2019t pack a lunch for work, but she did this morning, just to pass the time. If there was anything to be grateful for, it was that Rich hadn\u2019t called her darling. He\u2019d only done that in the presence of others, for the sake of the pretense they had to maintain in front of their parents.</p><p>She was putting together a sandwich when Rich joined her. He poured himself a second cup of coffee. Jamie concentrated on making her turkey sandwich and managed to avoid eye contact.</p><p>She turned around to get an apple from the refrigerator and stopped short of colliding with Rich. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she mumbled under her breath, flattening herself against the counter so he could step past her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some breakfast?\u201d she asked matter-of-factly, as though she often made the same inquiry of men who spent the night with her.</p><p>\u201cJust coffee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed with relief. The intimacy of cooking a meal for him would\u2019ve been a strain. She made a point of glancing at her watch. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better head out to the salt mines,\u201d she said, striving to sound carefree and happy when all the while there was a lump in her throat that made it hard to speak.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Rich\u2019s voice was low and hesitant, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure what was happening, but whatever it was, he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t, either, but she didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>She was halfway out of the kitchen when Rich stopped her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to leave with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She was eager to escape, to be by herself, examine her thoughts and reactions, analyze their relationship.</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have a key to lock up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d She opened the closet and pulled out her coat.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to move in with you, we should have an extra one made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in with me...\u201d She\u2019d suggested it when they\u2019d met with Rich\u2019s family. It had seemed like a good idea at the time, and she\u2019d been so eager to find a way to make her marriage work.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cI ...just think we should reevaluate the situation before we do something we might regret later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018Regret later,\u2019\u201d Rich repeated slowly. \u201cIn other words, you regret having made the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d He moved past her and out the front door, slamming it behind him. The sound reverberated like thunder, leaving Jamie alone to withstand the storm.</p><p>Rich had never met a more contrary woman in his life. It seemed that one minute she was leading him into her bedroom, and in the next she was behaving as though she couldn\u2019t get away from him fast enough.</p> <p>Rich wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d announced to his family that they were moving in together. Nor had he invited himself into her home for dinner and then seduced her. It was the other way around. All right, she hadn\u2019t exactly seduced him, but the lovemaking had been Jamie\u2019s idea.</p><p>Then, in the light of day, she\u2019d acted as if she\u2019d never seen him before. As if she would\u2019ve preferred that he disappear in the middle of the night.</p><p>Leaving before she woke was what had gotten him into trouble the first time they\u2019d made love.</p><p>Rich was damned if he did and damned if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand it. He\u2019d never been this confused by a woman.</p> <p>Although Rich tried to work, by midafternoon he felt like calling it quits. Leaning back in his chair, he rubbed his tired eyes. Generally, when he had a problem he wanted to talk over with someone, he called Jason. The two of them had been each other\u2019s support system for years.</p><p>This time, however, Rich decided to phone Paul instead. Paul had been married nearly five years; surely in all that time he\u2019d gleaned some wisdom about women and marriage.</p><p>Rich stood and closed his office door before sitting back down and reaching for his phone. Paul worked for the largest of the two Seattle papers and was often out chasing down a story. But his brother answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Paul teased. \u201cThe only pressing thing I have is a three o\u2019clock deadline.\u201d</p><p>Since it was quarter to three, Rich figured he\u2019d better talk fast. \u201cDid Jason tell you about Jamie and me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Paul said, his amusement evident in his voice, \u201cbut I put two and two together. Jason confirmed my suspicions, although I have to admit I would never have guessed you\u2019d agree to artificial insemination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Jason said.\u201d</p><p>Rich could picture his brother in the middle of the newsroom, leaning back in his chair wearing that cocky know-it-all grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen. And how they think.\u201d</p> <p>Paul responded with a low laugh. \u201cYou want me to explain a woman\u2019s mind. I hope you\u2019re kidding. No one, at least no man, will ever be able to understand the way a woman thinks. Trust me, I\u2019ve got five years\u2019 experience in this marriage business. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask Dad. He\u2019ll tell you the same thing. Take Diane. She wants another baby. Apparently she isn\u2019t busy enough with Ryan and Ronnie. For weeks on end she\u2019s talked about nothing else. She wants a little girl, she says. The twins run her ragged as it is. Besides, there\u2019s no guarantee we\u2019d have a girl. We actually had a big fight about it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Rich didn\u2019t mean to pry, but he was curious to know how Paul and his wife settled their disagreements.</p><p>\u201cWell, I stood my ground, if that\u2019s what you mean. Not that it did much good,\u201d he admitted reluctantly. \u201cI absolutely refused to discuss having another child. I tried to appease her though, I don\u2019t want to be dictatorial or unreasonable. I said we\u2019d talk about it this time next year. That way the twins will be in kindergarten when the new baby\u2019s born. Planning our family makes sense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Diane say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d This was followed by a significant pause. \u201cBut I should mention that she threw out her birth-control pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she always this stubborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Diane. All women are stubborn. To make matters worse, she wore this sexy little piece of black lace to bed. I tried to ignore her, pretend I didn\u2019t see...you don\u2019t need me to tell you what I could see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Rich would rather not hear. He still didn\u2019t know what to make of Jamie\u2019s actions that morning. Had he frightened her, wanting her the way he did? Hell, it hadn\u2019t seemed like it the night before, but what did he know?</p><p>Apparently very little.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Diane will probably get her way simply because I don\u2019t have the strength to fight her. I could stop making love to her, but then I\u2019d be the one losing out.\u201d</p><p>Rich rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cDoes Diane ever say one thing when she means another?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s laugh was abrupt. \u201cOh, yeah. In my experience, women are often indirect. They figure they\u2019re being subtle or giving us hints or something like that. But they won\u2019t come right out and say what they want. Oh, no, a man\u2019s supposed to guess, and heaven forbid if we guess wrong.\u201d</p><p>Rich exhaled a long, slow sigh. Paul was confirming what he already knew. \u201cRemember, when we met with Mom and Dad, how Jamie casually said I was moving in with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure surprised me when she brought it up. We\u2019d never said a word about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to move in with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do! For weeks I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to suggest it. Then, out of nowhere, she invites me to live with her, in front of my family. I was so excited it was all I could do not to jump up and somersault across the living room floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>It was a logical question and one Rich couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cIf I knew that, I wouldn\u2019t be calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Paul said. \u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove home with Jamie last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Paul prompted when Rich didn\u2019t immediately continue.</p><p>\u201cAnd I ended up staying the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything sounds fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014until this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>Rich shrugged, although Paul couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cI can\u2019t say. The alarm went off and we were cuddling like old married folks. Ten minutes later, Jamie\u2019s out of the shower, with this towel wrapped around her middle. She wouldn\u2019t so much as look at me. I played it cool, gave her some space. Some women are modest\u2014I understand that\u2014so I left her alone.</p><p>\u201cBefore I know it, she\u2019s in the kitchen making herself lunch like it\u2019s the most important thing she\u2019s ever done. By accident I happened to step too close to her and she practically threw herself against the counter so we wouldn\u2019t touch.\u201d Rich paused to take a deep breath. \u201cOn top of that, when I said I should get a key to her place, she tells me we should reevaluate my moving in with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Paul muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething, that\u2019s for damn sure. Think,\u201d Paul advised. \u201cYou must\u2019ve made some remark that set her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d They\u2019d done more kissing than talking.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? I wasn\u2019t there. Just think...review everything you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried that, but I can\u2019t come up with a single thing I could have done to warrant this reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said, but he didn\u2019t sound convincing. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best procedure because...well, you\u2019ll learn that soon enough. But if you\u2019re honestly in the dark about what went wrong, then you might as well ask. But if you do, be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have your ego shredded. When Diane acts like that, I know I\u2019m in trouble. Often, and this is what\u2019s so confusing, Diane can\u2019t even tell me what I did. All she knows is that she\u2019s furious with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t explain why she\u2019s mad?\u201d Rich could hardly believe it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. She glares at me like I should be arrested. Then, when I can\u2019t stand it anymore, I finally ask her what I did that was so terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Paul added with a sigh, \u201cshe says she\u2019s still getting in touch with her feelings. According to her, it has to do with her upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the way she was brought up, according to her, was all about being taught never to make a fuss or create waves. To be a \u2018good girl,\u2019 which means not to make any demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Rich hesitated. \u201cWhat you suggest. Ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Rich Manning,\u201d Paul said, as if Rich should be awarded a medal for bravery. \u201cLet me know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised. After thanking his oldest brother for the advice, Rich hung up, resolved to bring the situation into the open as soon as he had the chance.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur. Because they were putting the finishing touches on the defense project, Rich had to stay late that night. He wasn\u2019t pleased about it, but he had no choice. Bill Hastings and the others were working overtime, as well. Rich couldn\u2019t very well announce that he\u2019d had an argument with his wife and then leave. Especially when half his colleagues didn\u2019t even know he had a wife.</p><p>At quarter past six, there was a polite knock at his door. He glanced up and did a double take when he saw Jamie standing there.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d she asked shyly.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stood and gestured toward the chair on the opposite side of his desk. Once she sat down, he did, too. This was the chance he\u2019d been hoping for, but since she was the one who\u2019d come to see him, Rich figured he\u2019d let her start the conversation. Trying to appear as nonchalant as possible, he leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for this morning,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Rich was in a generous mood. Apparently she\u2019d seen the error of her ways and had come to make amends. He felt a surge of relief. Maybe this was going to be easier than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cI ... I was completely unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you want me to move in with you, after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course...that is, if you\u2019re still willing.\u201d</p><p>Was he ever! \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something to think about,\u201d he said solemnly. Then he added, \u201cI read that women are often unreasonable during pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour book said that?\u201d Jamie asked, frowning.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all those hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a book, too, but I haven\u2019t got to that chapter yet. It makes sense, though.\u201d She opened her purse and reached for her wallet, snapping open the change compartment. \u201cI had a key made for you during my lunch hour,\u201d she said, handing it to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working late this evening.\u201d He hoped she\u2019d suggest he drop in at her place\u2014at their place\u2014on his way to the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be. That\u2019s why I came here first.\u201d</p><p>A short uncomfortable silence passed. Rich wondered if he should raise the subject of her bad mood this morning or let it go. Maybe it was simply the hormonal overload. Or maybe she didn\u2019t even know herself and regretted her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d bring some of my clothes over this evening,\u201d Rich said, experimentally, waiting to see if she\u2019d offer him some encouragement.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t encouragement, exactly, but it wasn\u2019t opposition, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact Jason and ask if he can help me move the furniture and the large items this weekend.\u201d He\u2019d put what he didn\u2019t need into storage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s plenty of room for your stuff.\u201d Jamie stood up. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>When Rich got to her place, he didn\u2019t want to play any guessing games about their sleeping arrangements. \u201cWhere will I be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes widened at the directness of his question. \u201cUh...that\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he returned firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s completely up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyplace you\u2019d like,\u201d she said almost flippantly.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like me to sleep?\u201d he asked, throwing the question back at her.</p> <p>She hesitated, then lowered her gaze. \u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>He felt as though he\u2019d scaled the gates of paradise. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyplace else I\u2019d rather sleep,\u201d he said, unable to keep the pleasure from his voice. He got to his feet and walked toward her, slipping an arm around her shoulders. Rich walked her to the elevator, and while they waited, he leaned forward and gently kissed her.</p><p>As so often happened during their kisses, Rich found himself wanting more. Much more. She braced her hands against his chest, her breath ragged, uneven. A warmth filled his heart and seemed to radiate outward.</p><p>When they broke off the kiss, Rich was delighted to see that Jamie was trembling. For that matter, so was he.</p><p>\u201cYou make me forget,\u201d she said in a husky whisper.</p><p>Rich understood. She made him forget where he was, too.</p><p>Bill Hastings strolled by and smiled affectionately at them. He stood a discreet distance away, apparently hoping to talk to Rich.</p><p>The elevator arrived and although Rich was reluctant to let her go, he still had another hour, at least, of work.</p> <p>\u201cGoodbye, darling,\u201d Rich said. \u201cI\u2019ll be home in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s reaction was instantaneous. She tore away from him, stepped into the elevator and whirled around. Her eyes, her beautiful dark eyes, were brimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most horrible thing you\u2019ve ever said to me, Rich Manning.\u201d</p><p>Rich was so mystified by her irrational behavior that it took him a moment to respond. \u201cWhat I said? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well.\u201d With that, the elevator doors glided shut.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d Rich asked, utterly bewildered. He turned to his coworker, at a loss to understand.</p><p>Bill Hastings\u2019s blank look confirmed that he was equally in the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was must\u2019ve been awful. Jamie was crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I said,\u201d Rich told him, baffled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s upset because you told her you wouldn\u2019t be home for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Rich shook his head. \u201cMaybe...\u201d Although his working overtime had never seemed to bother Jamie before. Not that he was aware of, anyway. Sighing with frustration, Rich decided to give up trying to figure out his wife. Jamie had been a whole lot easier to understand before he married her, back when they were just friends.</p><p>\u201cLeave now,\u201d Bill urged. \u201cSort this out before it\u2019s too late.\u201d That meant he was offering to handle the brunt of the remaining paperwork himself, which Rich didn\u2019t think was fair.</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cI\u2019ll work it out with her later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Bill hesitated. \u201cMaybe you should reconsider.\u201d Bill gave him a look that reminded Rich his friend was divorced. He knew that Bill wished his circumstances were different. Over a beer one night, he\u2019d told Rich that if he had it to do over again, he\u2019d work harder to save his marriage.</p><p>Rich\u2019s heart was racing. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Go! Do what you have to before everything gets blown all out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Rich said over his shoulder. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.... Only, Rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe happy.\u201d</p><p>Rich nodded. \u201cI intend to, even if it kills me.\u201d Remembering the furious glare Jamie had sent his way, he figured it probably would.</p><p>Although he hurried out of the building and toward guest parking, Rich missed her. Jamie\u2019s car was nowhere in sight. He released a breath of frustration as he turned and walked to the employee parking area.</p><p>Maybe it was better that he hadn\u2019t caught up with her. His mood wasn\u2019t too positive at the moment, any more than hers was. Would married life always be this difficult? he wondered. Would his life consist of continually making amends for some unexplained wrong? Must he be constantly on his guard, afraid to speak his mind?</p><p>If there\u2019d been something handy to punch, Rich would\u2019ve done it. Plowing his fist into empty air only discouraged him more.</p><p>How fitting. Fighting imaginary ghosts. Didn\u2019t that describe his entire marriage?</p><p>Jamie had always been a sensible woman, or she had until she\u2019d become pregnant. Yes, he\u2019d read pregnant women could be temperamental, but this was ridiculous.</p><p>Jamie felt like a fool. Tears had left moist trails down her cheeks. She wasn\u2019t a woman given to such blatant emotion, and her actions surprised her even more than they did Rich.</p><p>But he deserved it, she thought in quick reversal. Calling her darling in front of his friend, putting on a big show, pretending to love her. As if saying it wasn\u2019t enough, he had to go and wear a besotted look, as though parting was such sweet sorrow.</p><p>It all seemed to be a game with him, and she couldn\u2019t bear to play anymore. If this was the first time, she might\u2019ve been able to overlook it, but this nonsense had become a habit. When they\u2019d gone to visit his parents, Rich had sat beside her, his hand clutching hers. The tender expression on his face, the loving way he\u2019d smiled down on her, was more than she could stand.</p><p>It was all so hypocritical. Counterfeit love.</p><p>Would she ever learn? Men were fickle, not to be trusted. And yet she knew Rich, probably better than she did any other man she\u2019d ever dated. His behavior surprised her. More than that, it hurt.</p><p>Driving while crying wasn\u2019t safe, so Jamie pulled over to the side, got a tissue from her purse and blew her nose. When she could see clearly again, she sniffled and continued driving.</p><p>Once she was home, she wandered around her condo, walking from room to room, wondering if she\u2019d ever be able to erase Rich\u2019s presence. A part of her longed to chase him out of her life, run after him militantly waving a broom, demanding he leave her alone.</p><p>Another part of her hungered to run toward him, greeting him with open arms.</p><p>\u201cThis is what happens when you fall in love,\u201d she chastised herself loudly. She pressed her hand over her smooth, flat stomach and a smile settled on her lips.</p><p>Things were different this time because a child was involved. This time she\u2019d walk away from the relationship with a bonus. A very special bonus.</p><p>Making herself a cup of tea, Jamie sat in her kitchen, nursing her hot drink and her wounded heart. The damp tissues had piled up, but she\u2019d composed herself enough to realize her display of anger had been out of character. No doubt Rich had viewed it as totally irrational. When she spoke to him again\u2014if she did\u2014she intended to set matters straight.</p><p>Pretense was unacceptable and she\u2019d make sure Rich understood that.</p><p>There was a noise from her door. Since Jamie always kept it locked, she dashed into the living room, surprised to see it swing open. Rich, tall and ominous, entered her condo. He was supposed to be at work! In fact, she\u2019d suspected he wouldn\u2019t show up at all tonight, considering the way they\u2019d parted. One brief glance at the dark, brooding anger shining from his eyes, the tightly clenched jaw, told her he was in a furious mood.</p><p>Another surprise\u2014the suitcase he held. It was large and bulky, the kind you\u2019d take on an extended vacation. A three-week European tour. A two-week cruise. No one would confuse it with an overnight bag.</p><p>He set it down with a thud and headed toward her. Wide-eyed, Jamie moved out of his way.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d A challenge might not be the smartest way to start their conversation, but it told him she refused to be intimidated. He could rant and rave all he wanted, but she wouldn\u2019t be browbeaten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I live here.\u201d He said it with enough conviction to make the windows vibrate. \u201cFurthermore, I\u2019ll be sleeping in the master bedroom\u2014with you. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Coward that she was, Jamie nodded. She\u2019d never seen Rich like this. Generally, he treated every situation in a joking manner. He could bluff, cajole and tease himself through just about anything. Jamie already knew what he\u2019d be like when she was in labor. He\u2019d be at her side telling jokes, entertaining the nurses, sharing good-ol\u2019-boy remarks with Dr. Fullerton.</p><p>\u201cNo arguments?\u201d He sounded shocked that she wasn\u2019t going to fight him over the issue of living with her, sleeping with her. Despite her contradictory emotions, she wanted him there. She wanted him in her life more than she didn\u2019t, if that made any sense.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded once as if to say this was going to be easier than he\u2019d expected. \u201cNow please explain what I said that was so despicable, when you left my office.\u201d</p><p>Jamie found it difficult to speak. \u201cDarling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me darling,\u201d she said, hating that she had to explain it. She clenched her fists, her long nails digging deep into the tender flesh of her palms.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He frowned, genuinely bewildered.</p><p>\u201cSo... I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d A lump was forming in her throat, but Jamie tried to ignore it.</p><p>Rich stalked to the far end of her kitchen, his back toward her. He leaned against the sink, hanging his head as if her words demanded deep concentration. After a moment he turned to face her. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me working overtime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThat would be unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd objecting to being called darling isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Jamie lowered her gaze to the polished kitchen floor. \u201cI ...wouldn\u2019t care if you\u2019d meant it. But we both know you didn\u2019t and worse than that\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWorse? You mean there\u2019s something worse than calling one\u2019s wife darling? Does the FBI know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing funny isn\u2019t going to help you this time, Rich Manning.\u201d She\u2019d known it would be impossible to talk to him. He turned everything into a joke.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cTell me what other horrible felony I\u2019ve committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the way you looked.\u201d To illustrate her point, she crossed her eyes and let her tongue dangle from the corner of her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI looked like that?\u201d he challenged in disbelief. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly like that, but close.\u201d She held herself stiff.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that silly expression supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou with a besotted look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesotted? Who uses a word like besotted?\u201d He gave a short, abrupt laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI do. And I wasn\u2019t trying to be cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never looked like that in my life.\u201d Rich walked over to the round oak table, then frowned when he saw the pile of tissues. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I have a cold.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI thought you were never going to cry over another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I didn\u2019t intend to.... I probably wouldn\u2019t, either, but I\u2019m pregnant and, like you said, my hormones are all screwed up, so don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to us?\u201d He advanced several steps toward her, stopping just short of taking her in his arms. \u201cJamie, love...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d she cried, her voice rising to near-hysteria. Calling her his love was too painful, like taunting her with the one thing she truly wanted and couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He raised his hands, palms up, in sheer frustration.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me your love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rich glared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me and I ... I can\u2019t tolerate it when you pretend you do.\u201d The words poured out of her until she was shouting, shaking with the force of her anger.</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cOh...right.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have thought Rich would lie to her about something so serious. It offended her that he\u2019d try to pass off as truth what she knew to be false.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you honestly didn\u2019t realize that?\u201d He came forward, but for every step he took, Jamie retreated two.</p><p>\u201cBecause it isn\u2019t true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that after the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t confuse good sex with love.\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t know what had made her say that, but she couldn\u2019t stop. She wore her pride like a protective cloak. She\u2019d been hurt so many times before. Her trust had been violated, her heart bruised. She couldn\u2019t go through all of that again, especially with Rich, whom she loved so desperately. It was safer if he believed she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s all it was to you\u2014good sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. You don\u2019t think it was anything more, do you?\u201d</p><p>With each word she threw at him, his anger increased until it flashed like fire from his eyes.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s back was flattened against the wall, her fingers splayed against it. She longed to tell him their times together had been the most beautiful, the most meaningful, of her life, but she lacked the strength.</p><p>She\u2019d never known how exhausting it was to lie.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you want me to prove it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jamie returned flippantly, since that was an impossible task.</p><p>Not meeting her eyes, Rich marched past her with purposeful strides. He slammed his suitcase onto the floor, opened it and dug through his clothes until he found what he wanted\u2014apparently a white business envelope with some kind of logo on the upper left side.</p><p>Without a word he stepped over to her fireplace, reached for one of the long-stemmed matches she kept on the mantel and struck it against the brick. The flame sprang to life. Cupping his hand over it, Rich knelt and held the match to the white envelope, which he\u2019d set on the grate. Within seconds the paper was nothing more than charred ashes.</p><p>At first Jamie didn\u2019t understand what he was doing. It came to her gradually, until each breath she drew was more painful than the one before. Rich had burned the marriage agreement they\u2019d had drawn up before the wedding. The one they\u2019d both signed.</p><p>The tears that crowded her throat refused to be contained anymore. They leapt to her eyes, burning, smarting. Her throat ached with the need to breathe, her sobs desperate to escape.</p><p>She must\u2019ve made some sound, because Rich, whose back was to her, turned slowly. His eyes slid to hers, until Jamie thought she\u2019d drown in those blue depths.</p><p>Could she believe? She was afraid to hope that what he\u2019d said was true and that he did indeed love her. Hope was so fragile, so easily shattered.</p><p>Dare she believe?</p><p>Love had always been so disappointing. It had stripped her of her pride, stolen her aspirations. Cheated her.</p><p>Did she dare trust her heart again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in a marriage of convenience with you any longer, Jamie,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI haven\u2019t been, since the night I found you with Floyd what\u2019s-his-face. I realized then that I love you and probably have for years, only I hadn\u2019t realized it. Condemn me if you will, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s heart quickened. Tears streamed down her face and she brought her fingers to her lips, knowing it would be impossible to speak. Instead, she held out her hand to him, her shoulders trembling.</p><p>Rich was there a second later, hauling her into his arms. His mouth unerringly found hers, and he lavished warm, moist kisses on her quivering lips.</p><p>\u201cI hope all this emotion means what I think it does,\u201d he murmured against the curve of her neck.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s tears fell without restraint. The emotions within her were too primitive, too deeply rooted to allow her the luxury of responding with words. Her hands framed his face as she spread eager kisses wherever she could. Trying to convey everything in her heart, she cherished him with her lips, kissing him again and again until they both shook with passion.</p><p>\u201cJamie...\u201d Rich tore his mouth from hers and stared searchingly into her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she managed in a breathless whisper.</p><p>His smile was more brilliant than a rainbow after the fiercest storm. \u201cI know.\u201d He wore a cocky grin as he swung her effortlessly into his arms and walked to the bedroom.</p><p>Tenderly he placed her on the bed and moved over her. When he kissed her, their passion flared to life, with no reservations, no holding back.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you said wasn\u2019t true,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cTell me our lovemaking touched you the same as it did me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie tried to answer him, reassure him it had been her pain talking, her disillusionment, but she couldn\u2019t speak for the lump in her throat. Smiling, she gazed up at him, letting all the love in her heart spill into her eyes. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him.</p><p>They made love gently, slowly, and when they\u2019d finished, they held each other. For a long time neither spoke.</p><p>They kissed after a while and Rich rolled onto his back, taking her with him. His hand caressed the small of her back. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love our baby, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.... I\u2019m sorry I doubted you.\u201d</p><p>Content, Jamie nestled against him, pressing her ear to his heart, which beat solidly in his chest. Her own heart was radiant with emotion. She\u2019d tried to close herself off from love, but Rich had made that impossible.</p><p>His hand reached for hers. Palm to palm. Heart to heart.</p><p>And Jamie felt\u2014finally\u2014like the married woman she was. A wife deeply in love with her husband. A woman deeply loved by a man.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The brightly decorated Christmas tree stood in the corner of Rich and Jamie\u2019s spacious new living room, in front of a large bay window that overlooked Puget Sound.</p><p>Jamie sat with her swollen ankles elevated while Rich brought her in a cup of tea from the kitchen. He\u2019d insisted on doing the dishes and Jamie hadn\u2019t argued. She was tired and crabby and impatient for their baby to be born.</p><p>\u201cWe really should take down the tree,\u201d she said. Christmas had passed several days before.</p><p>\u201cTake down the tree?\u201d Rich objected. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior wants to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich,\u201d Jamie muttered, her hands resting on her protruding stomach. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for you. Junior has decided he\u2019d rather not be born. He\u2019s hooked his foot over my ribs and says he\u2019d rather stay right where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only three days past your due date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like three months.\u201d She\u2019d given up any hope of seeing her feet back in October.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d Rich asked. \u201cA pillow? Your knitting? A book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so solicitous,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cMy, my, we are a bit testy this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cute, either. I\u2019m not in the mood for cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about adoring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...but you\u2019re going to have to convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should try for the besotted look.\u201d He crossed his eyes and dangled his tongue out of the side of his mouth, imitating the impression she\u2019d done of him earlier that year.</p><p>Despite her low spirits, Jamie laughed and held her arms out to him. \u201cI love you, even if you do look like a goose.\u201d</p><p>Rich sat on the ottoman facing her. \u201cI love you, too. I must, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be this worried.\u201d The humor left his eyes as he leaned forward and placed his hand on her stomach. \u201cCome out, come out, whoever you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really worried?\u201d He tended to hide his anxiety behind a teasing facade, and Jamie had been so consumed by her own apprehensions that she hadn\u2019t taken the time to address Rich\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m anxious.\u201d His hands gripped hers and he raised her knuckles to his mouth and gently kissed her fingers.</p><p>\u201cSo am I! I want this baby to be born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly believe how much I love him already,\u201d Rich whispered, his eyes serious. \u201cAt first, the baby was something we talked about. When I learned you were pregnant I was so excited I could\u2019ve walked on water. Then a few weeks later, we were living together. This summer we sold your condo and moved here. That was only the beginning of all the changes in our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Junior started getting sassy, constantly moving around, letting us know he was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014or she,\u201d Jamie said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the first time I felt him\u2014or her\u2014move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, either,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Rich smiled that lopsided grin of his that never failed to disarm her. \u201cEverything\u2019s changed, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Once again his blue eyes brightened. \u201cThis child is part of you and me\u2014the very best part of us both. Every time I think about him, I get all soft inside. I want to hold him in my arms and tell him how much his mother and I wanted him. Or her,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cEnough to go to exorbitant measures.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot that it was necessary,\u201d Jamie whispered. \u201cMight I remind you that Junior was conceived in the good old-fashioned way?\u201d</p><p>Rich leaned forward and reminded her of some other good old-fashioned methods they\u2019d discovered. She was laughing when she felt the first contraction. Her eyes widened and she squeezed Rich\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think all my complaining might have done some good. Have you got the stopwatch?\u201d</p> <p>Rich paled, nodded, then rushed into their bedroom, returning with the stopwatch he\u2019d purchased after attending their childbirth classes.</p><p>He knelt in front of her, clasping her hand. \u201cAre you ready, my love?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. She\u2019d been ready for this moment for the past nine months.</p><p>With a loud squall, Bethany Marie Manning made her way into the world thirteen hours later. Rich was at Jamie\u2019s side in the delivery room. When Dr. Fullerton announced that they had a daughter, Rich looked at Jamie, his face filled with wonder and surprise.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl?\u201d he asked, as though he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard correctly.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to check for yourself?\u201d Dr. Fullerton teased.</p><p>Jamie watched her husband, searching for signs of disappointment, but if there were any she didn\u2019t see them. The nurse weighed Bethany, then wrapped the protesting infant in a warm blanket and handed her to Rich.</p><p>Rich stared down at the bright pink face and smiled. When he looked over at Jamie his eyes shone with unshed tears. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not disappointed we didn\u2019t have a son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? I always wanted a girl. I just said I wanted a boy to keep you off guard.\u201d Very gently, Rich bent down and kissed his daughter\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Hours later, Jamie woke and saw that Rich was asleep, slumped in the chair next to her hospital bed. His head rested against hers. Smiling contentedly, she rubbed her fingers through his tangled hair.</p> <p>Yawning, Rich raised his head. \u201cHello, little mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, proud daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is so beautiful. Oh, Jamie, I can\u2019t believe how much I love her. And you.\u201d He kissed her hand, then held it against his jaw. \u201cI never knew I could feel like this.\u201d</p><p>Feeling dreamy and tired, Jamie nodded and let her eyes drift shut.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing,\u201d Rich whispered, his face close to hers. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallet classes.\u201d He pulled open the drawer in the bedside table and withdrew a Seattle phone book. \u201cI\u2019ve called two schools, both of whom are sending us brochures. I also talked to a teacher about piano lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust kidding.\u201d He lifted her hand and clasped it between his own. \u201cI love you, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>They\u2019d come so far, Jamie mused. They\u2019d tried to manipulate fate, create their own destiny, constrain their marriage with limits and conditions.</p><p>Instead, love had caught them unawares. </p> </body></html>"]
