It was as though he didn\u2019t exist, and then suddenly, he was everywhere.</p><p>I\u2019d just bailed on the Halloween party still in full swing behind me. Weaving between the cars crammed into the parking lot behind my ex\u2019s frat house, I tapped out a text to my roommate. The night was beautiful and warm\u2014a typical Southern-style Indian summer. From the wide-open windows of the house, music blared across the pavement, punctuated with occasional bursts of laughter, drunken challenges and calls for more shots.</p><p>As tonight\u2019s designated driver, it was my responsibility to get Erin back to our dorm across campus in one non-mangled piece, whether or not I could stand another minute of the party. My message told her to call or text when she was ready to go. The way she and her boyfriend, Chaz, had been tequila-soaked dirty dancing before they linked hands and tripped up the stairs to his room, she might not be calling me until tomorrow. I chuckled over the thought of the short walk of shame she\u2019d endure from the front porch to my truck, if so.</p> <p>I hit send as I dug in my bag for my keys. The moon was too cloud-obscured and the fully lit windows of the house were too far away to provide any light at the far end of the lot. I had to go by feel. Swearing when a mechanical pencil jabbed a fingertip, I stomped one stiletto-clad foot, almost certain I\u2019d drawn blood. Once the keys were in my hand I sucked on the finger; the slight metallic taste told me I\u2019d punctured the skin. \u201cFigures,\u201d I muttered, unlocking the truck door.</p><p>In the initial seconds that followed, I was too disoriented to comprehend what was happening. One moment I was pulling the truck door open, and the next I was lying flat on my face across the seat, breathless and immobile. I struggled to rise but couldn\u2019t, because the weight on top of me was too heavy.</p><p>\u201cThe little devil costume suits you, Jackie.\u201d The voice was slurred, but familiar.</p><p>My first thought was Don\u2019t call me that, but that objection was quickly dismissed in favor of terror as I felt a hand pushing my already short skirt higher. My right arm was useless, trapped between my body and the seat. I clawed my left hand into the seat next to my face, trying again to push myself upright, and the hand on the bare skin of my thigh whipped up and grabbed my wrist. I cried out when he wrenched my arm behind my back, clamping it firmly in his other hand. His forearm pressed into my upper back. I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cBuck, get off me. Let go.\u201d My voice quavered, but I tried to deliver the command with as much authority as possible. I could smell the beer on his breath and something stronger in his sweat, and a wave of nausea rose and fell in my stomach.</p> <p>His free hand was back on my left thigh, his weight settled onto my right side, covering me. My feet dangled outside the truck, the door still open. I tried to pull my knee up to get it under me, and he laughed at my pathetic efforts. When he shoved his hand between my open legs, I cried out, snapping my leg back down too late. I heaved and squirmed, first thinking to dislodge him and then, realizing I was no match for his size, I started to beg.</p><p>\u201cBuck, stop. Please\u2014you\u2019re just drunk and you\u2019ll regret this tomorrow. Oh my God\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wedged his knee between my legs and air hit my bare hip. I heard the unmistakable sound of a zipper and he laughed in my ear when I went from rationally imploring to crying. \u201cNo-no-no-no...\u201d Under his weight, I couldn\u2019t get enough breath together to scream, and my mouth was mashed against the seat, muffling any protest I made. Struggling uselessly, I couldn\u2019t believe that this guy I\u2019d known for over a year, who\u2019d not once treated me with disrespect the entire time I\u2019d dated Kennedy, was attacking me in my own truck at the back of the frat house parking lot.</p><p>He ripped my panties down to my knees, and between his efforts to push them down and my renewed effort to escape, I heard the fragile fabric tear. \u201cJesus, Jackie, I always knew you had a great ass, but Christ, girl.\u201d His hand thrust between my legs again and the weight lifted for a split second\u2014just long enough for me to suck in a lungful of air and scream. Releasing my wrist, he slapped his hand over the back of my head and turned my face into the leather seat until I was silent, almost unable to breathe.</p><p>Even freed, my left arm was useless. I leveraged my hand against the floor of the cab and pushed, but my wrenched and aching muscles wouldn\u2019t obey. I sobbed into the cushion, tears and saliva mixing under my cheek. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, please don\u2019t, oh God stop-stop-stop...\u201d I hated the weedy sound of my powerless voice.</p><p>His weight lifted from me for a split second\u2014he\u2019d changed his mind, or he was repositioning\u2014I didn\u2019t wait to find out which. Twisting and pulling my legs up, I felt the spiky heels of my shoes tear into the pliant leather as I propelled myself to the far side of the bench seat and scrambled for the handle. Blood rushed in my ears as my body rallied for all-out fight or flight. And then I stopped, because Buck was no longer in the truck at all.</p> <p>At first, I couldn\u2019t figure out why he was standing there, just past the door, facing away from me. And then his head snapped back. Twice. He swung wildly at something but his fists hit nothing. Not until he stumbled back against my truck did I see what\u2014or who\u2014he was fighting.</p><p>The guy never took his eyes off Buck as he delivered two more sharp jabs to his face, bobbing to the side as they circled and Buck threw futile punches of his own, blood streaming from his nose. Finally, Buck ducked his head and rushed forward with bull-like intent, but that effort was his undoing as the stranger swung an easy uppercut to his jaw. When Buck\u2019s head snapped up, an elbow cracked into his temple with a sickening thud. He collided with the side of the truck again, pushing off and rushing the stranger a second time. As though the entire fight was choreographed, he grabbed Buck\u2019s shoulders and pulled him forward, hard, kneeing him under the chin. Buck crumpled to the ground, moaning and cringing.</p><p>The stranger stared down, fists balled, elbows slightly bent, poised to deliver another blow if necessary. There was no need. Buck was almost unconscious. I cowered against the far door, panting and curling into a ball as shock replaced the panic. I must have whimpered, because his eyes snapped up to mine. He rolled Buck aside with one booted foot and stepped up to the door, peering in.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d His tone was low, careful. I wanted to say yes. I wanted to nod. But I couldn\u2019t. I was so not okay. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call 911. Do you need medical assistance, or just the police?\u201d</p><p>I envisioned the campus police arriving at the scene, the partygoers who would spill from the house when the sirens came. Erin and Chaz were only two of the many friends I had in there, more than half of them under-aged and drinking. It would be my fault if the party became the focus of the police. I would be a pariah.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t call.\u201d My voice was gravelly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t call anyone. Don\u2019t call the police.\u201d</p> <p>His jaw hung ajar and he stared across the expanse of seat. \u201cAm I wrong, or did this guy just try to rape you\u2014\u201d I flinched at the ugly word \u201c\u2014and you\u2019re telling me not to call the police?\u201d He snapped his mouth closed, shook his head once and peered at me again. \u201cOr did I interrupt something I shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>I gasped, my eyes welling up. \u201cN-no. But I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>Buck groaned and rolled onto his back. \u201cFuuuuuck,\u201d he said, not opening his eyes, one of which was probably swollen shut anyway.</p><p>My savior stared down at him, his jaw working. He rocked his neck to one side and then back, rolled his shoulders. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I wasn\u2019t about to escape one attack just to do something as stupid as get into a stranger\u2019s car. \u201cI can drive myself,\u201d I rasped. My eyes flicked to my bag, wedged against the console, its contents spilled across the floor of the driver\u2019s side. He glanced down, leaned to pick out my keys from the bits and pieces of my personal effects.</p><p>\u201cI believe you were looking for these, before.\u201d He dangled them from his fingers as I realized that I still hadn\u2019t moved any closer to him.</p><p>I licked my lip and tasted blood for the second time that night. Scooting forward into the faint illumination shed by the tiny overhead light, I was careful to keep my skirt pulled down. A wave of dizziness crashed over me as I became fully conscious of what had almost happened, and my hand trembled when I reached out for my keys.</p><p>Frowning, he clamped his fist around them and dropped his arm back to his side. \u201cI can\u2019t let you drive.\u201d Judging by his expression, my face was a disaster.</p><p>I blinked, my hand still extended for the keys he\u2019d just confiscated. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>He ticked three reasons off on his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking, probably an after-effect of the assault. I have no idea if you\u2019re actually uninjured. And you\u2019ve probably been drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m the designated driver.\u201d</p><p>He raised one brow and glanced around. \u201cWho exactly are you designated for? If anyone had been with you, by the way, you might have been safe tonight. Instead, you walked out into a dark parking lot, alone, paying absolutely no attention to your surroundings. Real responsible.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I was beyond angry. Angry at Kennedy for breaking my heart two weeks ago and not being with me tonight, seeing me to the safety of my truck. Angry at Erin for talking me into coming to this stupid party and even angrier with myself for agreeing. Furious at the barely-conscious asswipe drooling and bleeding on the concrete a few feet away. And seething at the stranger who was holding my keys hostage while accusing me of being brainless and careless.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s my fault he attacked me?\u201d My throat was raw, but I pushed past the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault I can\u2019t walk from a house to my truck without one of you trying to rape me?\u201d I threw the word back at him to let him see I could bear it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018One of you\u2019? You\u2019re gonna lump me in with that piece of shit?\u201d He pointed at Buck, but his eyes never left mine. \u201cI am nothing like him.\u201d That was when I noticed the thin silver ring through the left side of his lower lip.</p><p>Great. I was in a parking lot, alone, with an insulted, facially-pierced stranger who still had my keys. I couldn\u2019t take any more of this night. A sob came from my throat as I tried to remain composed. \u201cMay I have my keys, please?\u201d I held my hand out, willing the tremors to subside.</p><p>He swallowed, looking at me, and I stared back into his clear eyes. I couldn\u2019t tell their color in the dim light, but they contrasted compellingly with his dark hair. His voice was softer, less hostile. \u201cDo you live on campus? Let me drive you. I can walk back over here and get my ride after.\u201d</p><p>No more fight in me, I nodded, reaching over to get my bag out of his way. He helped gather the lip-gloss, wallet, tampons, hair ties, pens and pencils strewn across the floor and return them to my bag. The last item he picked up was a condom packet. He cleared his throat and held it out to me. \u201cThat\u2019s not mine,\u201d I said, recoiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I clamped my jaw, trying not to be furious all over again. \u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Buck. \u201cBastard. He was probably gonna...\u201d He glanced into my eyes and back at Buck, scowling. \u201cUh... conceal the evidence.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even contemplate that. He shoved the square package into his front jeans pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll throw it away\u2014he\u2019s sure as hell not getting it back.\u201d Brow still furrowed, he swung his gaze to me again as he climbed in and started the truck. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to call the police?\u201d</p> <p>Laughter sounded from the back door of the house and I nodded. Framed exactly within the center window, Kennedy danced with his arms around a girl dressed in a gauzy, low-cut white outfit, wings, and a halo. Perfect. Just perfect.</p><p>At some point during my battle with Buck, I\u2019d lost the devil-horned headband Erin had stuffed onto my head while I sat on the bed whining that I didn\u2019t want to go to a stupid costume party. Without the accessory, I was just a girl in a skimpy red-sequined dress that I\u2019d refuse to be caught dead wearing otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>The headlights illuminated Buck as we backed out of the parking spot. Throwing a hand in front of his eyes, he attempted to roll to a sitting position. I could see his split lip, misshapen nose and swollen eye, even from that distance.</p><p>It was just as well I wasn\u2019t the one behind the wheel. I probably would have run him over.</p> <p>I gave the name of my dorm when asked, and stared out the passenger window, unable to speak another word as we meandered across campus. With a straightjacket hug, I gripped myself, trying to conceal the shudders wracking through me every five seconds. I didn\u2019t want him to see, but I couldn\u2019t make them stop.</p><p>The dorm lot was nearly full; spots near the door were all taken. He angled the truck into a back space and hopped out, coming around to meet me as I slid from the passenger side of my own truck. Teetering on the edge of breaking down and losing it, I took the keys after he activated the door locks, and followed him to the building.</p><p>\u201cYour ID?\u201d he asked when we reached the door.</p><p>My hands shook as I unsnapped the front flap on my bag and withdrew the card. When he took it from my fingers, I noted the blood on his knuckles and gasped. \u201cOh, my God. You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his hand and shook his head, once. \u201cNah. Mostly his blood.\u201d His lips pressed flat and he turned away to swipe the card through the door access, and I wondered if he meant to follow me inside. I didn\u2019t think I could hold myself together for much longer.</p><p>After opening the door, he handed me my ID card. In the light from the entry vestibule, I could see his eyes more clearly\u2014they were a clear gray-blue under his lowered brows. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked for the second time, and I felt my face crumple.</p> <p>Chin down, I shoved the card into my bag and nodded uselessly. \u201cYes. Fine,\u201d I lied.</p><p>He huffed a disbelieving sigh, running a hand through his hair. \u201cCan I call someone for you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I had to get to my room so I could fall apart. \u201cThank you, but no.\u201d I slipped past him, careful not to brush against any part of him, and headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cJackie?\u201d he called softly, unmoving from the doorway. I looked back, gripping the handrail, and our eyes met. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, hard, nodding once before I turned and ran up the stairs, my shoes rapping against the concrete steps. At the second floor landing, I stopped abruptly and turned to look back at the door. He was gone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know his name, and couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing him before, let alone meeting him. I\u2019d have remembered those unusually clear eyes. I had no idea who he was... and he\u2019d just called me by name. Not the name on my ID\u2014Jacqueline\u2014but Jackie, the nickname I\u2019d gone by ever since Kennedy renamed me, our junior year of high school.</p><p>Two weeks ago:</p><p>\u201cWanna come up? Or stay over? Erin is staying at Chaz\u2019s this weekend...\u201d My voice was playful, sing-songy. \u201cHis roommate\u2019s out of town. Which means I\u2019ll be all alone...\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy and I were a month from our three-year anniversary. There was no need to be coy. Erin had taken to calling us an old married couple lately. To which I\u2019d reply, \u201cJealous.\u201d And then she\u2019d flip me off.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. I\u2019ll come up for a little while.\u201d He kneaded the back of his neck as he pulled into the dorm parking lot and searched for a parking space, his expression inscrutable.</p><p>Prickles of apprehension arose in my chest, and I swallowed uneasily. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d The neck-rubbing was a known stress signal.</p><p>He flicked a glance in my direction. \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d He pulled into the first open spot, wedging his BMW between two pickups. He never, ever wedged his prized import into constricted spots. Door dings drove him insane. Something was up. I knew he was worried over upcoming midterms, especially pre-cal. His fraternity was hosting a mixer the next night, too, which was plain stupid the weekend before midterms.</p><p>I swiped us into the building and we entered the back stairwell that always creeped me out when I was alone. With Kennedy behind me, all I noticed was dingy, gum-adorned walls and the stale, almost sour smell. I jogged up the last flight and we emerged into the hallway.</p><p>Glancing back at him while unlocking my door, I shook my head over the charming portrayal of a penis someone had doodled onto the whiteboard Erin and I used for notes to each other and from our suitemates. Coed dorms were less mature than depicted on college websites. Sometimes it was like living with a bunch of twelve year olds.</p><p>\u201cYou could call in sick tomorrow night, you know.\u201d I laid a palm on his arm. \u201cStay here with me\u2014we\u2019ll hide out and spend the weekend studying and ordering take-out... and other stress-reducing activities...\u201d I grinned naughtily. He stared at his shoes.</p><p>My heart sped up and I suddenly felt warm all over. Something was definitely wrong. I wanted him to spit it out, whatever it was, because my mind was conjuring nothing but alarming possibilities. It had been so long since we\u2019d had a problem or a real conflict that I felt blindsided.</p><p>He moved into my room and sat on my desk chair, not my bed.</p><p>I walked up to him, our knees bumping, wanting him to tell me he was just in a bad mood, or worried about his upcoming exams. My heart thudding heavily, I put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cKennedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackie, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The drumming pulse in my ears grew louder, and my hand dropped from his shoulder. I grabbed it up in my other hand and sat on the bed, three feet from him. My mouth was so dry I couldn\u2019t swallow, let alone speak.</p><p>He was silent, avoiding my eyes for a couple of minutes that felt like forever. Finally, he lifted his gaze to me. He looked sad. Oh, God. Ohgodohgodohgod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having some... trouble... lately. With other girls.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, glad I was sitting down. My legs would have buckled and sent me to the floor if I\u2019d have been standing. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I croaked out. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018trouble\u2019 and \u2018other girls\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cNot like that, not really. I mean, I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d He looked away and sighed again. \u201cBut I think I want to.\u201d</p><p>The hell?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d My mind worked frantically to make the best possible situation out of this, but every single remotely-possible alternative sucked.</p><p>He got up and paced the room twice before planting himself halfway between the door and me. \u201cYou know how important it is to me to pursue a career in law and politics.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still stunned to silence and pedaling hard to keep up.</p><p>\u201cYou know our sister sorority?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, acknowledging the very thing I\u2019d worried about when he moved into the frat house. Apparently, I hadn\u2019t worried enough.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a girl\u2014a couple of girls, actually, that... well.\u201d</p><p>I tried to keep my voice rational and level. \u201cKennedy, this doesn\u2019t make sense. You aren\u2019t saying you\u2019ve acted on this, or that you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stared into my eyes, so there\u2019d be no mistake. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>Really, he could have just punched me in the stomach, because my brain refused to comprehend the words he was saying. A physical assault, it might have understood. \u201cYou want to? What the hell do you mean, you want to?\u201d</p><p>He bolted out of the chair, walked to the door and back\u2014a distance of a dozen feet. \u201cWhat do you think I mean? Jesus. Don\u2019t make me say it.\u201d</p><p>I gaped. \u201cWhy not? Why not say it\u2014if you can imagine doing it\u2014then why the fuck not say it? And what does this have to do with your career plans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was getting to that. Look, everyone knows that one of the worst things a political candidate or elected representative can do is to become embroiled in some sexual scandal.\u201d His eyes locked on mine in what I recognized as his debate-face. \u201cI\u2019m only human, Jackie, and if I have these desires to sow my wild oats or whatever and I repress it, I\u2019ll probably have the same desire later, even worse. But acting on it then would be a career-killer.\u201d He spread his hands helplessly. \u201cI have no choice but to get it out of my system while I can do it without annihilating my future professional standing.\u201d</p><p>I told myself, This isn\u2019t happening. My boyfriend of three years was not breaking up with me so he could bang coeds with shameless abandon. I blinked hard and tried to take a deep breath, but I couldn\u2019t. There was no oxygen in the room. I glared at him, silent.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cOkay, so I guess trying to let you down easy was a bad idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your idea of letting me down easy? Breaking up with me so you can screw other girls? Without feeling guilty? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>The last thing I thought before I picked up my econ textbook and hurled it at him: How can he use such a piece-of-shit clich\u00e9 in a moment like this?</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Erin\u2019s voice woke me. \u201cJacqueline Wallace, get your ass out of that bed and go save your GPA. For chrissake, if I\u2019d let a guy throw off my academic mojo like this, I\u2019d never hear the end of it.\u201d</p><p>I made a dismissive sound from under the comforter before peeking out at her. \u201cWhat academic mojo?\u201d</p><p>Her hands on her hips, she was wrapped in a towel, fresh from a shower. \u201cHa. Ha. Very funny. Get up.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, but didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI\u2019m doing fine in all of my other classes. Can\u2019t I just fail this one?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cAre you even listening to yourself?\u201d</p><p>I was listening to myself. And I was every bit as disgusted with my cowardly sentiments as Erin\u2014if not more so. But the thought of sitting next to Kennedy for an hour-long class three days a week was unbearable. I couldn\u2019t be sure what his newfound single status would mean in terms of open flirtations or hookups, but whatever it meant, I didn\u2019t want to stare it in the face. Imagining the details was bad enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If only I hadn\u2019t pressed him to take a class with me this semester.

God knows I can\u2019t do it en fran\u00e7ais at ass o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I arrived outside the classroom at straight-up 9:00, knowing that Kennedy, habitually punctual, would already be there. The classroom was large and sloped. Slipping through the back door, I spotted him, sixth row center. The seat to his right was empty\u2014my seat. Dr. Heller had passed around a seating chart the second week of class, and he used it to take attendance and give credit for class participation. I would have to talk with him after class, because there was no way I was sitting there again.</p> <p>My eyes scanned the back rows. There were two empty seats. One was three rows down between a guy leaning on his hand, mostly asleep, and a girl drinking a venti something and chattering nonstop to her neighbor. The other open seat was on the back row, next to a guy who appeared to be doodling something into the margin of his textbook. I turned in that direction at the same time the professor entered a side door below, and the artist raised his head to scan the front of the classroom. I froze, recognizing my savior from two nights ago. If I could\u2019ve moved, I would have turned and fled the classroom.</p><p>The attack came flooding back. The helplessness. The terror. The humiliation. I\u2019d curled into a ball on my bed and cried all night, thankful for Erin\u2019s text that she was staying with Chaz. I hadn\u2019t told her what Buck had done\u2014partly because I knew she\u2019d feel responsible for making me go, and for letting me leave alone. Partly because I wanted to forget it had happened at all.</p><p>\u201cIf everyone will be seated, we\u2019ll begin.\u201d The professor\u2019s statement shook me from my stupor\u2014I was the only student standing. I bolted to the empty chair between the chatty girl and the sleepy guy.</p><p>She glanced at me, never pausing in her weekend confession of how trashed she\u2019d been and where and with whom. The guy unsquinted his eyes just enough to notice when I slid into the bolted-down chair between them, but he didn\u2019t otherwise move.</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d I whispered to him.</p> <p>He shook his head and mumbled, \u201cIt was. But she dropped. Or stopped coming. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>I pulled a spiral from my bag, relieved. I tried not to look at Kennedy, but the angled seating made that effort challenging. His perfectly styled dirty blond hair and the familiar uncreased button-down shirt drew my eyes every time he moved. I knew the effect of that green plaid next to his striking green eyes. I\u2019d known him since ninth grade. I\u2019d watched him alter his style from a boy who wore mesh shorts and sneakers every day to the guy who sent his fitted shirts out to be pressed, kept his shoes scuff-free, and always looked as though he\u2019d just stepped from the cover of a magazine. I\u2019d seen more than one teacher turn her head as he passed before snapping her gaze away from his perfect, off-limits body.</p><p>Junior year, we had pre-AP English together. He focused on me from the first day of class, flashing his dimpled smile in my direction before taking his seat, inviting me to join his study group, inquiring about my weekend plans\u2014and finally making himself a part of them. I\u2019d never been so confidently pursued. As our class president, he was familiar to everyone, and he made a concerted effort to become familiar with everyone. As an athlete, he was a credit to the baseball team. As a student, his academic standing was in the top ten percent. As a member of the debate team, he was known for conclusive arguments and an unbeaten record.</p><p>As a boyfriend, he was patient and attentive, never pushing me too far or too fast. Never forgetting a birthday or an anniversary. Never making me doubt his intentions for us. Once we were official, he changed my name\u2014and everyone followed suit, including me. \u201cYou\u2019re my Jackie,\u201d he told me, referencing the wife of Jack Kennedy, his namesake and personal idol.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t related. His parents were just weirdly political\u2014and also at odds with each other. He had a sister named Reagan and a brother named Carter.</p><p>Three years had passed since I\u2019d gone by Jacqueline, and I fought daily to regain that one original part of myself that I\u2019d put aside for him. It wasn\u2019t the only thing I\u2019d given up, or the most important. It was just the only one I could get back.</p> <p>Between trying to avoid staring at Kennedy for fifty minutes straight and having skipped the class for two weeks, my brain was sluggish and uncooperative. When class ended, I realized I\u2019d absorbed little of the lecture.</p><p>I followed Dr. Heller to his office, running through various appeals in my head to induce him to give me a chance to catch up. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t cared that I was failing. Now that the possibility had become a probability, I was terrified. I had never failed a class. What would I tell my parents and my advisor? This F would be on my transcript for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Ms. Wallace.\u201d Dr. Heller removed a textbook and a stack of disorderly notes from his battered attach\u00e9 and moved around his office as though I wasn\u2019t standing there. \u201cState your case.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cMy case?\u201d</p><p>Tiredly, he peered at me over his glasses. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed two straight weeks of class\u2014including the midterm, and you missed today. I assume you\u2019re standing here in my office in order to make some sort of case for why you should not fail macroeconomics. I\u2019m waiting with bated breath for that explanation.\u201d He sighed, shelving the textbook. \u201cI always think I\u2019ve heard them all, but I\u2019ve been known to be surprised. So go ahead. I don\u2019t have all day, and I presume you don\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI was in class today. I just sat in a different seat.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for that, since you approached me at the end of the lecture. That\u2019s one day of participation back in your favor\u2014amounting to about a quarter of a grade point. You still have six missed class days and a zero on a major exam.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. As if a plug had been pulled, the jumbled excuses and realizations came pouring out. \u201cMy boyfriend broke up with me, and he\u2019s in the class, and I can\u2019t stand to see him, let alone sit next to him... Oh my God, I missed the midterm. I\u2019m going to fail. I\u2019ve never failed a class in my life.\u201d As if that speech wasn\u2019t mortifying enough, my eyes watered and spilled over. I bit my lip to keep from sobbing outright, staring at his desk, unable to meet the repulsed expression I imagined him wearing.</p> <p>I heard his sigh in the same moment a tissue appeared in my line of vision. \u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day, Ms. Wallace.\u201d</p><p>I took the tissue and pressed it to my wet cheeks, eyeing him cautiously.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I have a daughter just a bit younger than you. She recently endured a nasty little breakup. My whip-smart, straight-A student turned into an emotional wreck who did nothing but cry, sleep, and cry some more\u2014for about two weeks. And then she came to her senses and decided that no boy was going to ruin her scholastic record. For the sake of my daughter, I\u2019ll give you one chance. One. If you blow it, you will receive the grade you\u2019ve earned at the end of the semester. Do we understand each other?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, more tears spilling.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d My professor shifted uncomfortably and handed me another tissue. \u201cOh, for Pete\u2019s sake\u2014as I told my daughter, there\u2019s not a boy on the planet worth this amount of angst. I know; I used to be one.\u201d He scribbled on a slip of paper and handed it to me. \u201cHere\u2019s the email address of my class tutor, Landon Maxfield. If you aren\u2019t familiar with his supplemental instruction sessions, I suggest you get familiar with them. You\u2019ll no doubt need some one-on-one tutoring as well. He was an excellent student in my class two years ago, and he\u2019s been tutoring for me since then. I\u2019ll give him the details of the project I expect you to do to replace the midterm grade.\u201d</p><p>Another sob escaped me when I thanked him, and I thought he might explode from discomfort. \u201cWell, well, yes, of course, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He pulled out the seating chart. \u201cShow me where you\u2019ll be sitting from now on, so you can earn those quarter-points for attendance.\u201d I pointed to my new seat, and he wrote my name in the square.</p><p>I had my shot. All I had to do was get in touch with this Landon person and turn in a project. How hard could it be?</p><p>The Starbucks line in the student union was ridiculously long, but it was raining and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to get soaked crossing the street to the indie coffee shop just off-campus to get my fix before my afternoon class. In unrelated reasoning, that was also where Kennedy was most likely to be; we went there almost daily after lunch. On principle, he tended to shun \u201ccorporate monstrosities\u201d like Starbucks, even if the coffee was better.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m making it across campus on time if I wait in this line.\u201d Erin growled her annoyance, leaning to check out how many people were ahead of us. \u201cNine people. Nine! And five waiting for drinks! Who the hell are all of these people?\u201d The guy in front of us glanced over his shoulder with a scowl. She scowled back at him and I pressed my lips together to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cCaffeine addicts like us?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d she huffed and then grabbed my arm. \u201cI almost forgot\u2014did you hear what happened to Buck Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. The night I just wanted to forget wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cHe got jumped in the parking lot behind the house. A couple of guys wanted his wallet. Probably homeless people, he said\u2014that\u2019s what we get with a campus right in the middle of a big city. They didn\u2019t get anything, the bastards, but damn, Buck\u2019s face is busted up.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cHe actually looks a little hotter like that. Rowr, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I felt ill, standing there mute and feigning interest instead of refuting Buck\u2019s explanation of the events leading to his pummeled face.</p><p>\u201cWell, crap. I\u2019m gonna have to chug a Rockstar to keep from zoning out during poly-sci. I can\u2019t be late\u2014we\u2019ve got a quiz. I\u2019ll see you after work.\u201d She gave me a quick hug and scurried off.</p><p>I scooted forward with the line, my mind going over Saturday night for the thousandth time. I couldn\u2019t shake how vulnerable I felt, still. I\u2019d never been blind to the fact that guys are stronger. Kennedy had scooped me into his arms more times than I could count, one time tossing me over his shoulder and running up a flight of stairs as I clung to his back, upside down and laughing. He\u2019d easily opened jars I couldn\u2019t open, moved furniture I could hardly budge. His superior strength had been evident when he\u2019d braced himself above me, biceps hard under my hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two weeks ago, he'd torn out my heart, and I\u2019d never felt so hurt, so empty.</p><p>But he\u2019d never used his physical strength against me.</p><p>No, that was all Buck. Buck, a campus hottie who didn\u2019t have a problem getting girls. A guy who\u2019d never given any indication that he could or would hurt me, or that he was aware of me at all, except as Kennedy\u2019s girlfriend. I could blame the alcohol... but no. Alcohol removes inhibitions. It doesn\u2019t trigger criminal violence where there was none before.</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p> <p>I shook off my reverie and looked across the counter, prepared to give my usual order, and there stood the guy from Saturday night. The guy I\u2019d avoided sitting next to this morning in economics. My mouth hung open but nothing came out. And just like this morning, Saturday night came flooding back. My face heated, remembering the position I\u2019d been in, what he must have witnessed before he\u2019d intervened, how foolish he must consider me.</p><p>But then, he\u2019d said it wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>And he\u2019d called me by my name. The name I no longer used, as of sixteen days ago.</p><p>My split-second wish that he wouldn\u2019t recall who I was went ungranted. I returned his penetrating gaze and could see he remembered all of it, clearly. Every mortifying bit. My face burned.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d His question pulled me from my disorientation. His voice was calm, but I felt the exasperation of the restless customers behind me.</p> <p>\u201cGrande caff\u00e9 Americano. Please.\u201d My words were so mumbled that I half expected him to ask me to repeat myself.</p><p>But he marked the cup, which was when I noted the two or three layers of thin white gauze wrapped around his knuckles. He passed the cup to the barista and rang up the drink as I handed over my card.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay today?\u201d he asked, his words so seemingly casual, yet so full of meaning between us. He swiped my card and handed it back with the receipt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The knuckles of his left hand were scuffed but not severely abraded. As I took the card and receipt, his fingers grazed over mine. I snatched my hand away. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, but he said nothing else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a venti caramel macchiato\u2014skinny, no whip.\u201d The impatient girl behind me gave her order over my shoulder, not touching me, but pressing too far into my personal space for comfort. His jaw tensed almost imperceptibly when he shifted his gaze to her.</p> <p>Marking the cup, he gave her the total in clipped tones, his eyes flicking to me once more as I stepped away. I don\u2019t know if he looked at me after that. I waited for my coffee at the other end of the bar, and hurried away without adding my usual dribble of milk and three packets of sugar.</p><p>Economics was a survey course, and as such the roster was huge\u2014probably two hundred students. I could avoid eye contact with two boys in the midst of that many people for the remaining six weeks of fall semester, couldn\u2019t I?</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I dutifully emailed the econ tutor when I got back to the dorm after class, and started on my art history homework. While tapping out a response essay on a neoclassical sculptor and his influence on the style, I mumbled a thank you to my inner neurotic that I\u2019d at least kept up in my non-econ classes.</p><p>With Erin at work, I could buckle down to an evening of quiet studying. Here in our microscopic room, she couldn\u2019t help being a near-constant distraction. While I attempted to cram for an algebra test last week, the following conversation took place: \u201cI had to have those pumps for my job, Daddy!\u201d she argued into her cell. \u201cYou said you wanted me to learn the value of work while I\u2019m in school, and you always say a person should dress for success, so I\u2019m only trying to follow your words of wisdom.\u201d</p><p>When she glanced at me, I rolled my eyes. My roommate was a hostess at a swanky restaurant downtown, a position she frequently used as an excuse for overspending her clothing budget. Three hundred dollar shoes, essential for a job that paid nine bucks an hour? I stifled my laugh when she winked back at me. Her father always caved, especially when she employed the D-word\u2014Daddy.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting a quick reply from Landon Maxfield. As an upperclassman and a tutor for a huge class like Dr. Heller\u2019s, he had to be busy. I was also certain he\u2019d be none too thrilled to assist a failing sophomore who\u2019d skipped the midterm and two weeks of class, and who had never attended one of his tutoring sessions. I was prepared to show him I would work hard to catch up and get out of his hair as quickly as possible.</p><p>Fifteen minutes after I emailed him, my inbox dinged. He\u2019d replied, in the same formal tone I\u2019d chosen after switching back and forth between using his first or last name in the address, finally deciding on Mr. Maxfield.</p> <p>Ms. Wallace,</p><p>Dr. Heller has informed me of your need to catch up in macro and the project you\u2019ll need to complete in order to replace the midterm grade. Since he\u2019s approved you to do this work, there\u2019s no need to share the reason why you\u2019ve fallen so far behind with me. I\u2019m employed as a tutor, so this falls under my job description.</p><p>We can meet on campus, preferably in the library, to discuss the project. It\u2019s detailed, and will require a great deal of outside research on your part. I\u2019ve been instructed by Dr. Heller as to the level of assistance I should provide. Basically, he wants to see what you can do, alone. I\u2019ll be available for general questions, of course.</p><p>My group tutoring sessions are MWTh from 1-2:00, but those cover current material. I assume you\u2019ll need more assistance comprehending the material you missed over the past two weeks. Let me know the times you\u2019re available to meet for individual tutoring sessions and we\u2019ll coordinate from there.</p><p>LM</p><p>I clenched my jaw. Though perfectly polite, the tone of his email reeked of condescension... until his signature at the very end: LM. Was he being friendly, or casual, or ridiculing my attempt to sound like a serious, mature student? I\u2019d alluded to the breakup in my email, hoping he wouldn\u2019t want or ask for details. Now I felt as though he\u2019d not only eschewed learning the particulars, but he thought less of me for letting a relationship crisis affect my academic life.</p><p>I read his email again and got even madder. So he thought I was too dumb to comprehend the course material on my own?</p><p>Mr. Maxfield,</p><p>I can\u2019t attend your sessions because I have art history MW 1-2:30, and I tutor at the middle school on Thursday afternoons. I live on campus and am available to meet late afternoons Monday/Wednesday, and most evenings. I\u2019m also free on weekends when I\u2019m not tutoring.</p><p>I\u2019ve begun reading the course material on GDP, CPI, and inflation, and I\u2019m working on the review questions at the end of chapter 9. If you want to meet to pass on the project requirements, I\u2019m sure I can catch up on the regular coursework on my own.</p><p>Jacqueline</p><p>I pressed send and felt superior for all of about twenty seconds. In actuality, I\u2019d barely glanced at chapter 9. So far, it looked less like comprehensible supply and demand charts, and more like gibberish with dollar signs and confusing shifts tossed in for fun. As for GDP and CPI, I knew what those acronyms signified... Sort of.</p><p>Oh, God. I\u2019d just haughtily dismissed the tutor provided by my professor\u2014the professor who wasn\u2019t obligated to give me a second chance, but had.</p><p>When my email dinged again, I swallowed before clicking over to it. A new message from Landon Maxfield was at the top of my inbox.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>If you prefer to catch up on your own, that\u2019s your prerogative, of course. I\u2019ll gather the information on the project and we can meet, say, Wednesday just after 2:00?</p><p>LM</p><p>PS What do you tutor?</p><p>His reply didn\u2019t seem angry. He was civil. Nice, even. I was so emotional lately that I couldn\u2019t judge anything clearly.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>I teach private lessons to orchestra students\u2014middle and high school\u2014on the upright bass. I just remembered I agreed to assist in transporting two of my students\u2019 instruments to a program this Wednesday afternoon. (I drive a truck, to accommodate transport of my own instrument, and now I\u2019m constantly inundated with requests to move large musical instruments, sofas, mattresses...)</p><p>Are you free any evening? Or Saturday?</p><p>JW</p><p>I\u2019d been playing the upright bass since I was ten. In fourth grade, one of the orchestra\u2019s two bass players had a pee wee football collision the second weekend of school, resulting in a snapped collarbone. Our orchestra teacher, Mrs. Peabody, had looked out over the vast sea of violin players and pleaded for someone to switch. \u201cAnyone?\u201d she\u2019d squeaked. When no one else volunteered, I raised my hand.</p><p>Even the half-sized instrument dwarfed me back then; I\u2019d needed a step-stool to play it, a fact that had provided my orchestra classmates with endless amusement. The ridicule didn\u2019t stop at school.</p><p>\u201cHoney, isn\u2019t that an odd choice of instrument for a girl to play?\u201d my mother asked. Still petulant over my rejection of learning piano\u2014her instrument of choice\u2014in favor of the violin, she was immediately unsupportive of my new preference.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I glared at my mother and she rolled her eyes. She\u2019d never lost her disdain of the instrument I came to love to play for the way it grounded and directed the rest of the orchestra. I also loved the disbelief on the faces of fellow contestants at regional competitions, their surety that I wasn\u2019t as good as they were because of my gender\u2014and the way I proved that I was better.</p><p>By the time I was fifteen, I\u2019d reached my full five-and-a-half-foot stature and could perform with a three-quarter sized instrument, no height adjustment needed, though it was a close thing.</p><p>For the past year, I\u2019d been giving lessons to local students\u2014all of them boys\u2014each of them some version of smug and impertinent until they heard me play.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Upright bass? Interesting.</p><p>I\u2019m busy in the evenings this week, and most weekends as well. I don\u2019t want you to lose time on this, so I\u2019ll send you the project information later tonight, and we can discuss it over email until we can sync our schedules. Will that work for you?</p><p>LM</p><p>PS \u2013 I\u2019ll keep you in mind if I buy a large appliance or need to move.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>Thank you, yes\u2014that would be great. (Re: sending the project information, I mean, not your brazen resolution to use me for my truck\u2019s hauling capacity. You\u2019re no better than my friends! They dodge U-Haul rentals and delivery fees, and I get paid in beer.)</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>I\u2019ll send the project specifics when I get home, and we can discuss.</p><p>The barter system is just primitive economics at work, you know. (And are you old enough for beer?)</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p><p>Far be it from me to knock an effective use of prehistoric economics. And I suppose friends who pay in beer are better than friends who don\u2019t pay at all. (Re: my age\u2014I don\u2019t believe the job description of Economics Tutor makes you privy to that sort of personal information.)</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Touch\u00e9. I\u2019ll just have to trust you not to get me arrested for supplying alcohol to minors.</p><p>You\u2019re right\u2014impoverished, auto-lacking college students like myself should respect tried-and-true methods of transport negotiations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>LM</p><p>I smiled at his candid admission of being carless, my face falling when I contrasted it with the sense of self-importance Kennedy got from his car. Right before we graduated, his parents gave his two-year-old Mustang to his sixteen-year-old brother, who\u2019d wrecked his Jeep the weekend before. As an early graduation gift, they replaced Kennedy\u2019s Mustang with the brand new BMW\u2014sleek and black, with every available upgrade, including plush leather seats and a stereo system I could hear from a block away.</p><p>Dammit. I had to stop linking every single thing that happened to me with Kennedy. Realization dawned then, that he was still my default. Over the past three years, we\u2019d become each other\u2019s habit. And though he\u2019d broken his habit of me when he walked away, I\u2019d not broken my habit of him. I was still tethering him to my present, to my future. The truth was, he now belonged only to my past, and it was time I began to accept it, as much as it hurt to do so.</p><p>As soon as we hit campus freshman year, Kennedy had pledged his father\u2019s fraternity. Despite my boyfriend\u2019s need for cliquish affiliation, I\u2019d never shared that aspiration. He didn\u2019t seem to mind when I said I preferred not to rush any sororities, as long as I supported his future-politician need for brotherhood. He told me once he sort of liked that I was a GDI girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cA GDI? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d laughed and said, \u201cIt means you\u2019re goddamned independent.\u201d</p><p>When he walked out of my room almost three weeks ago, it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that he was taking my carefully cultivated social circle with him. Minus my relationship with Kennedy, I had no automatic invitation to Greek parties or events, though Chaz and Erin could invite me to some stuff since I fell under the heading of acceptable things to bring to any party: alcohol and girls.</p><p>Awesome. I\u2019d gone from an independent girlfriend to party paraphernalia.</p><p>Running into clusters of my former friends was uncomfortable at best. Just outside the main library, tables of frat boys sold coffee, juice and pastries every morning for a week to raise money for leadership training. Armed with portable grills, Tri-Delts camped out in tents on their lawn to showcase the plight of the homeless. (I suggested to Erin that most homeless people are unlikely to own portable Coleman grills and REI camping gear, and she snorted and said, \u201cYeah, I pointed that out. My warning fell on deaf ears.\u201d)</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t leave my dorm and walk in any direction without passing people with whom I\u2019d had uncomplicated relationships just days before. Now their eyes shifted away when I walked by, though some still smiled or waved before pretending to be deep in conversation with someone else. Even fewer called out, \u201cHi, Jackie.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell them I was no longer using that name.</p><p>At first, Erin insisted that the snubs were in my head, but after two weeks, she reluctantly concurred. \u201cPeople feel the need to choose sides when a relationship splits\u2014it\u2019s human nature,\u201d she said, her second-year psych classes kicking in. \u201cStill. Cowards.\u201d I appreciated that she was willing to ignore her detached analysis in support of me.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise me that practically everyone chose Kennedy. He was one of them, after all. He was the outgoing, charming, future world leader. I was the quiet, cute but somewhat odd girlfriend... After the breakup, I became just a non-Greek undergrad\u2014to everyone but Erin.</p><p>Tuesday, we passed the reigning campus power-couple\u2014Katie was president of Erin\u2019s sorority and D.J. was vice president of Kennedy\u2019s fraternity. \u201cHi, Erin! Great outfit,\u201d Katie said, as though I wasn\u2019t there. D.J. tipped his chin and smiled at Erin, his eyes flicking over me, but he didn\u2019t acknowledge my existence any more than his girlfriend had.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Erin responded. \u201cFuckheads,\u201d she muttered right after, linking her arm through mine.</p><p>When I\u2019d moved into my dorm room over a year ago, I\u2019d been horrified to find myself with a roommate who embodied the sorority girl stereotype. Erin had already claimed the bed nearest the window. Above her headboard, she\u2019d fastened shiny blue and gold high school pom-poms to a huge cutout spelling \u201cERIN\u201d which was coated in gold glitter. Surrounding the giant gilded letters were posters covered in photos of cheerleader events and homecomings with hulking football players.</p> <p>As I stood gaping at her light-reflective side of our tiny room, she\u2019d bounced through the door. \u201cOh, hi! You must be Jacqueline! I\u2019m Erin!\u201d</p><p>Diplomatically, I hadn\u2019t voiced the no shit comment that popped into my head.</p><p>\u201cSince you weren\u2019t here, I chose a bed\u2014I hope you don\u2019t mind! I\u2019m almost done unpacking, so I can help you.\u201d Wearing a university T-shirt that almost exactly matched her upswept coppery hair, she picked up my heaviest bag and swung it onto the bed. \u201cI attached a whiteboard to the door so we can leave messages to each other\u2014my mom\u2019s idea, actually, but it sounded like a usable suggestion, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her, mumbling, \u201cUh-huh,\u201d as she unzipped my bag and started removing the belongings I\u2019d brought from home. There had to be some mistake. I\u2019d filled out a lengthy roommate attribute preference sheet, and this girl appeared to have not one of those desired qualities. I\u2019d basically described myself: a quiet, studious bookworm who would go to bed at a decent hour. A non-partier who wouldn\u2019t bring a parade of boys through our room, or make it the floor headquarters for beer pong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jackie, actually,\u201d I\u2019d said to her.</p><p>\u201cJackie\u2014so cute! I do like Jacqueline, though, I have to admit. So classy. You\u2019re lucky, you can choose! I\u2019m sort of stuck with Erin. Good thing I like it, huh? Okay, Jackie, where should we hang this poster of\u2014who is this?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d glanced at the poster in her hands\u2014the likeness of one of my favorite singers, who also played the upright bass. \u201cEsperanza Spalding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of her. But she\u2019s cute!\u201d She\u2019d grabbed a handful of tacks and hopped up on my bed to press the poster against the wall. \u201cHow \u2018bout here?\u201d</p> <p>Erin and I had come a long way in fifteen months.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Arriving a minute before econ began Wednesday morning, the last thing I expected to see was Kennedy, leaning on the wall outside the classroom, exchanging phone numbers with a Zeta pledge. Giggling after snapping a picture of herself, she handed his phone back. He did the same, grinning down at her.</p><p>He would never smile at me like that again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I was frozen in place until a classmate shouldered into me, knocking my heavy backpack from my shoulder. \u201c\u2019Scuse me,\u201d he grumbled, his tone more Get out of the way than Sorry I ran into you.</p><p>As I bent to retrieve my backpack, praying Kennedy and his fangirl hadn\u2019t seen me, a hand grasped the strap and swung the pack up from the floor. I straightened and looked into clear gray-blue eyes. \u201cChivalry isn\u2019t really dead, you know.\u201d His deep, calm voice was just as I remembered from Saturday night, and from Monday afternoon, across the Starbucks counter.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He slipped the strap back onto my shoulder. \u201cNah. That guy\u2019s just an asshole.\u201d He gestured toward the guy who\u2019d bumped me, but I could have sworn his eyes raked over my ex, too, who was crossing to the door, laughing with the girl. Her bright orange sweatpants said ZETA across the rear. \u201cYou okay?\u201d For the third time, this question, from him, held deeper significance than the usual, everyday implication.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine.\u201d What could I do but lie? \u201cThank you.\u201d I turned and entered the room, took my new seat, and spent the first forty-five minutes of class fixing my attention on Dr. Heller, the whiteboard he filled, and the notes I took. Dutifully copying charts of short-run equilibrium and aggregate demand, all of it seeming like so much nonsense, I realized I would have to beg Landon Maxfield for help after all. My pride would only cause me to slide further behind.</p><p>Minutes before the end of class, I turned and reached into my backpack as an excuse to sneak a look at the guy on the back row. He was staring at me, a black pencil loose between his fingers, tapping the notebook in front of him. He slouched into his seat, one elbow over the back of it, one booted foot casually propped on the support under his desk. As our eyes held, his expression changed subtly from unreadable to the barest of smiles, though guarded. He didn\u2019t look away, even when I glanced into my bag and then back at him.</p><p>I snapped forward, my face warming.</p><p>Guys had shown interest in me over the past three years, but other than a couple of short-lived, certainly never revealed or acted-upon crushes\u2014one on my own college-aged bass tutor, and another on my chemistry lab partner\u2014I\u2019d not been attracted to anyone but Kennedy. The economics lecture reduced to background babble, I couldn\u2019t decide if my response to this stranger was lingering embarrassment, gratitude that he\u2019d saved me from Buck, or a simple crush. Perhaps all three.</p><p>When class ended, I packed my textbook into my backpack and resisted the urge to look in his direction again. I fiddled long enough for Kennedy and his fangirl to leave. As I stood to go, the persistently sleepy guy who sat next to me spoke.</p><p>\u201cHey, which questions did he say to do for the extra credit? I must have knocked off for a few seconds right around when he discussed those\u2014my notes are indecipherable.\u201d I glanced at the spot he indicated in his notes, and sure enough, the scribbles became less and less readable. \u201cI\u2019m Benji, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, let\u2019s see...\u201d I flipped through my spiral and pointed to the assignment details printed across the top of the page. \u201cHere it is.\u201d As he copied it, I added, \u201cI\u2019m Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>Benji was one of those guys to whom adolescence hadn\u2019t been kind. A scattering of acne dotted his forehead. His hair was overgrown and curly\u2014a skilled stylist could tame it, but he was probably a fan of the eight-dollar place featuring flatscreens of nonstop ESPN. Given his doughy midsection, I doubted he spent much time in the university\u2019s state-of-the-art gym. The t-shirt stretched across his belly gave some sort of \u201cbro\u201d instruction best left unread. Expressive hazel eyes and an engaging smile that crinkled them adorably were his saving grace in the looks department.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jacqueline. This saves my ass\u2014I need those extra credit points. See you Friday.\u201d He snapped his notebook closed. \u201cUnless I accidentally sleep in,\u201d he added, giving me a genuine smile.</p><p>I returned the smile as I moved into the aisle. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I was capable of making friends outside of my Kennedy circle. This interaction, along with the defection of most of our friends to Kennedy after the breakup, made me realize how dependent on him I\u2019d become. I was a little shocked. Why had this never occurred to me before? Because I\u2019d never thought Kennedy and I could end?</p><p>Foolish, na\u00efve assumption. Obviously.</p><p>The room had almost cleared, the guy from the back row included. I felt a stab of irrational disappointment. So he\u2019d stared at me in class\u2014big deal. Maybe he was just bored. Or easily distracted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as I exited the room, I spotted him across the crowded hallway, talking with a girl from class. His demeanor was relaxed, from the navy shirt, open over a plain gray t-shirt, to the hand tucked into the front pocket of his jeans. Muscle didn\u2019t show under the unbuttoned long-sleeved shirt, but his abdomen looked flat, and he\u2019d put Buck on the ground and bloody easily enough Saturday night. His black pencil sat atop one ear, only the pink eraser at the tip showing, the rest disappearing into his dark, messy hair.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a group tutoring thing?\u201d the girl asked, twirling a long loop of blonde hair around and around her finger. \u201cAnd it lasts an hour?\u201d</p><p>He hitched his backpack, twitching wayward bangs out of his eyes. \u201cYeah. From one to two.\u201d</p><p>As he gazed down at her, she tilted her head and rocked her weight slightly from side to side, as though she was about to dance with him. Or for him. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll check it out. What are you doing after?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWork.\u201d</p><p>She huffed an annoyed breath. \u201cYou\u2019re always working, Lucas.\u201d Her pouty tone hit my ears like nails on a chalkboard, as it always has when used by any girl above age six. But bonus\u2014I\u2019d just learned his name.</p><p>He glanced up then, as though he sensed me standing there, eavesdropping, and I pivoted in the opposite direction and started walking swiftly, too late to pretend I hadn\u2019t been purposely listening to their conversation. I wove through the rush of people in the packed hallway, ducking out the side exit.</p><p>No way was I going to those tutoring sessions if Lucas attended them. I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant\u2014if he meant anything at all\u2014staring at me like that during class, but the overt intensity of his gaze made me uneasy. Besides, I was still in a mourning period over my recently-shattered relationship. I wasn\u2019t ready to start anything new. Not that he was interested in me that way. I all but rolled my eyes at my own thought processes. I\u2019d gone from a marginal amount of interest to a possible relationship in one jump.</p><p>From a purely observational perspective, he was probably used to girls like the blonde in the hallway throwing themselves at his feet. Just like my ex. Kennedy\u2019s titles of class and then student body president equated to small-time celebrity status, and he\u2019d relished it. I\u2019d spent the last two years of high school ignoring the envious girls who dogged our relationship, just waiting for him to be finished with me. By the time we\u2019d left town for college, I was so sure of him.</p> <p>I wondered when I would stop feeling like such a clueless twit for that misplaced trust.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>I\u2019m having more trouble with the current material than I let on, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever be able to make it to one of your tutoring sessions. Too bad for both of us that my ex didn\u2019t dump me early enough in the semester to drop this class! (No offense. You\u2019re probably an econ major and like this stuff.)</p><p>I\u2019ve started researching online journals for the project. Thanks for decoding Dr. Heller\u2019s notes before sending them to me. If you\u2019d have forwarded them without a translation, I\u2019d be searching for a tall building/ overpass/ water tower from which to yell \u201cgoodbye cruel world.\u201d</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p> <p>Please, no leaping from towering structures. Do you have any idea how much damage that would do to my tutoring reputation?? If nothing else, think of the effect on me. ;)</p><p>I create worksheets for the tutoring sessions. I\u2019ve attached the past three weeks\u2019 worth. Use them as study guides, or fill them in and send them back to me, and we\u2019ll see where you\u2019re getting confused.</p><p>Actually, I\u2019m an engineering major, but we have to take econ. I think everyone should, though \u2013 it\u2019s a good starting point for explaining how money, politics and commerce work together to create the total chaos that is our economic system.</p><p>LM</p><p>PS \u2013 How did the regional competitions go? And btw, your ex is obviously a moron.</p><p>I downloaded the worksheets, turning over his last statement in my mind. Whether Landon knew Kennedy or not\u2014unlikely, given the size of the university and their differing majors\u2014he\u2019d taken my side. Me, a girl so absurdly unhinged by a breakup that she\u2019d skipped class for two weeks.</p><p>He was smart and funny, and after only three days, I already looked forward to his name in my inbox, our back-and-forth banter. All of a sudden, I wondered what he looked like. God. Just yesterday, I\u2019d left class telling myself to ignore the brooding stares of a guy in class because I needed time to get over Kennedy\u2019s desertion, and here I was daydreaming over a tutor who could look like Chace Crawford. Or... Benji.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. I needed time to recover, even if Landon was right. Even if Kennedy was a moron.</p> <p>I clicked on the first worksheet and opened my econ text, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>The worksheets are definitely going to help. I already feel less scared of failing this class. I did the first two - when you have time, could you look them over? Thank you again for wasting your time on me. I\u2019ll try to get caught up quickly. I\u2019m not used to being the student who\u2019s a pain in the butt.</p><p>I had two freshmen from rival schools in competition with each other at regionals. Both asked me, separately thank God, who was my favorite. (I told each of them, \u201cYou are, of course.\u201d Was that wrong??) They were very smug with each other when they came to get their basses from my truck, and I prayed that neither would mention the favorite status in front of the other. BOYS.</p><p>Engineering? Wow. No wonder you seem so brainy.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>The worksheets look great. I marked a couple of minor mistakes that could trip you up on an exam, so check those.</p><p>Ah, sounds like your freshmen have crushes on you? Not surprised. A bass-playing college girl would have rendered me speechless at 14.</p><p>Of course I\u2019m brainy! I\u2019m the all-knowing tutor. And in case you\u2019re wondering - yes, you\u2019re my favorite. ;)</p><p>LM</p><p>Saturday night, Erin was once again threatening to drag me out of our room, ignoring my protests and reluctance. This time, three of us were heading to the strip to hit some clubs with our fake IDs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember how the party last weekend went for me?\u201d I asked when she shoved a clingy black dress into my outspread arms. Of course she didn\u2019t remember; I hadn\u2019t told her. All she knew was that I\u2019d bailed early.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, babe, I know this is hard. But you can\u2019t let Kennedy win! You can\u2019t let him make you a hermit, or keep you scared of falling for someone new. God, I love this part of it\u2014the hunt for a new guy, everything unknown, untried\u2014the mass of hot prospects in front of you, waiting to be discovered. If I didn\u2019t lust after Chaz so hard, I\u2019d be jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>The way she described it, the process sounded like an expedition to an exotic continent. I didn\u2019t share her feelings, not in the least. The idea of finding a new guy sounded exhausting and depressing. \u201cErin, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last weekend, and you did fine!\u201d She frowned, thinking, and for the hundredth time, I almost told her about Buck. \u201cEven if you did leave early.\u201d She rehung the black dress I didn\u2019t intend to wear, and I held my tongue, losing my chance again. I wasn\u2019t sure why I couldn\u2019t tell her. I was mostly afraid she\u2019d be infuriated. More unreasonably, I was afraid she\u2019d be disbelieving. Neither response was something I wanted to contend with; I just wanted to forget.</p><p>I thought of Lucas, annoyed that his presence in econ was making that process impossible, because he was irrevocably connected to the horror of that night. He\u2019d not looked at me at all Friday\u2014as far as I knew. Every time I snuck a look back at him, he appeared to be sketching rather than taking notes, his black pencil held low between his fingers, a concentrated expression on his face. When class ended, he stuck the pencil behind his ear, turned and walked from the classroom without a backward glance, first one out the door.</p><p>\u201cNow this will show off the goods,\u201d Erin said, breaking into my reverie. Next up was a stretchy, low-cut purple top. Yanking it from the hanger, she tossed it to me. \u201cPut on your skinny jeans and those badass boots that make you look like a gangbanger\u2019s girlfriend. This fits your tough, I\u2019m-a-challenge mood better anyway. You have to dress to attract the right guys, and if I make you too cute, you\u2019ll flick them all away with glares and irritated rolls of your big blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and she laughed, pulling the black dress over her own head. Erin knew me far too well.</p><p>I\u2019d lost count of the number of drinks Erin had pressed into my hand, telling me that since she was the designated driver, I was required to drink for two. \u201cI can\u2019t touch any of these hotties, either\u2014so I have to live vicariously. Now finish that margarita, stop scowling, and stare at one of these guys until he knows he won\u2019t lose a limb if he asks you to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scowling!\u201d I scowled, obeying and tossing the drink back. I grimaced. Cheap tequila refused to be concealed by an abundance of even cheaper margarita mix, but that\u2019s what you get for no cover charge and five dollar drinks.</p><p>Still relatively early, the small club we decided to occupy for the night wasn\u2019t yet overcrowded with the hundreds of college students and townies it would hold soon. Erin, Maggie and I claimed a corner of the near-vacant floor. Having downed the drinks and dressed the part, I moved to the music, gradually loosening up while laughing at Erin\u2019s cheer poses and Maggie\u2019s ballet movements. The first guy to interrupt us approached Erin, but she shook her head as her lips mouthed the word boyfriend. She turned him toward me and I thought: That\u2019s me: boyfriend-less. No more relationship. No more Kennedy. No more You\u2019re my Jackie.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d the guy yelled over the music, fidgeting as though he was ready to bolt if I turned him down. I nodded, choking back the pointless, almost physical pain. I was no one\u2019s girlfriend, for the first time in three years.</p><p>We moved to an open space a few feet from Erin and Maggie\u2014who also had a boyfriend. It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that the two of them planned to point every guy who asked one of them to dance at me. I was their pet project for the night.</p><p>Two hours later, I\u2019d danced with too many guys to remember, dodging wandering hands and turning down any drinks not handed to me by Erin. Crowded around a tall table near the floor, we leaned hips on the barstools surrounding it, watching the surrounding hookup activity. As Maggie returned from bopping and pirouetting her way to the bathroom and back, I asked if we could go yet, and Erin fixed me with a look she usually reserved for ill-mannered steakhouse patrons. I smirked at her and sipped my drink.</p><p>I knew when the next guy walked up behind me, and that Erin and Maggie approved, because their eyes widened simultaneously, focusing over my shoulder. Fingers grazed the back of my arm, and I took a deep breath and exhaled it slowly before turning around. Good thing, too\u2014because it was Lucas who stood there, his eyes dropping to my cleavage for a split second. He crooked an eyebrow and gazed into my eyes with a faint smile, unapologetic for looking. The heels on my boots were killing my feet, but they weren\u2019t tall enough to bring me eye-to-eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rather than raising his voice like everyone else, he leaned close to my ear and asked, \u201cDance with me?\u201d I felt his warm breath and inhaled the scent of his aftershave\u2014something basic and male\u2014before he withdrew, his eyes on mine, waiting for my answer. An enthusiastic nudge between my shoulder blades told me Erin\u2019s vote: go dance with him.</p><p>I nodded, and he took my hand and made his way to the floor, maneuvering through the crowd, which parted easily for him. Once we reached the worn oak floor, he turned and pulled me close, never letting go of my hand. As we found the rhythm of the slow-paced song, swaying together, he took my other hand in his and moved both hands behind my back, gently holding me captive. My breasts grazed against his chest and I struggled not to gasp at the subtle contact.</p><p>I\u2019d barely let anyone else touch me at all tonight, adamantly refusing all slow dances. Dizzy from weak-but-plentiful margaritas, I closed my eyes and let him lead, telling myself that the difference was the alcohol in my blood, nothing more. A minute later, he released my fingers and spread his hands across my lower back, and my hands moved to his biceps. Solid, as I knew they would be. Tracking a path, my palms encountered equally hard shoulders. Finally, I hooked my fingers behind his neck and opened my eyes.</p><p>His gaze was penetrating, not wavering for a moment, and my pulse hammered under his silent scrutiny.</p> <p>Finally, I stretched up toward his ear, and he leaned down to accommodate my question. \u201cS-so what\u2019s your major?\u201d I breathed.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I watched his mouth twitch up on one side. \u201cDo you really want to talk about that?\u201d He maintained the closeness, our torsos pressed together chest to thigh, ostensibly waiting for my answer. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been so full of pure, unqualified desire.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cAs opposed to talking about what?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and I felt the vibrations of his chest against mine. \u201cAs opposed to not talking.\u201d His hands at my waist gripped a little tighter, thumbs pressing into my ribcage, fingers still at my lower back.</p><p>I blinked, one moment not understanding what his words implied, and the next knowing unreservedly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I lied.</p><p>He leaned closer still, his smooth cheek whispering against mine as he murmured, \u201cYes, you do.\u201d Struck again by his scent\u2014clean and subtle, unlike the trendy colognes Kennedy favored, which always seemed to overpower any scent I wore\u2014I felt an impulse to bring my fingertips to his face and trail them over his freshly shaven jaw, the sexy scruff from yesterday gone. His skin wouldn\u2019t redden mine now if he kissed me, hard. I would feel nothing but his mouth on mine\u2014and maybe that slim ring at the edge of his lip...</p><p>The errant thought made my breath catch.</p><p>When his lips touched just south of my earlobe, I thought I might pass out. \u201cLet\u2019s just dance,\u201d he said. Pulling back just far enough to stare into my eyes, he drew my body against his, and my legs obeyed where his said to go.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cHoly fuckburgers. Who was that hot guy?\u201d Erin carefully maneuvered her daddy-furnished Volvo sedan around the people weaving drunkenly through the parking lot. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t stone cold sober, I\u2019d think he was a figment of my sex-starved imagination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPsshh,\u201d I mumbled, eyes closed, my spinning head lolling back against the headrest. \u201cDon\u2019t even talk to me about sex-starved.\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed my hand and squeezed. \u201cAw, shit. I\u2019m sorry, J. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>It had been three weeks since my breakup, but I wasn\u2019t about to disclose the fact that it had been more like four weeks... maybe five, since the last time we\u2019d been at all intimate. I should have seen Kennedy\u2019s lack of interest for the sign it was, rather than giving him justifications in my head\u2014he was busy with frat obligations, while I fit in at least two hours of practice a day\u2014more when I had ensemble rehearsal. He had his straight-A grade point average to maintain, and I had music lessons to give.</p><p>A minute later, Maggie piped up from the back seat. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered the question, Jacqueline!\u201d Her speech was almost as slurred as mine, my name pronounced in three distinct syllables, like three separate words. \u201cWho was that beautiful guy, and more importantly, why didn\u2019t you solve your sex-starvedness with him? Holy hell, I think I\u2019d be willing to boot Will outta bed for a night with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlut,\u201d Erin said, rolling her eyes into her rearview mirror.</p><p>Maggie laughed. \u201cIn this case... Hell. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>They both grew quiet, staring at me, waiting for me to reveal who he was. I mentally sorted through everything I knew about him. He\u2019d saved me from Buck\u2019s attack, which I hadn\u2019t told anyone about. He\u2019d beaten the crap out of Buck, which I likewise hadn\u2019t told anyone. He\u2019d stared at me all through economics on Wednesday, and then ignored me completely on Friday, which I hadn\u2019t told anyone. He worked at the Starbucks. And he kept asking me if I was okay... but he hadn\u2019t asked me that tonight.</p><p>Tonight had been something else altogether. By unspoken agreement, we\u2019d danced several dances without stopping\u2014slow, fast, and everything in between. His hands never left my body, triggering an upsurge of longing I\u2019d not felt in a very long time\u2014longer than four or five weeks ago. His hands hadn\u2019t wandered inappropriately, his fingers not even teasing beneath the fabric of my top at the waist, but they\u2019d seared the skin beneath regardless.</p> <p>And then he disappeared. Bending, his lips next to my ear, he thanked me for the dances, led me back to my table, and vanished into the throng of people. I hadn\u2019t seen him again, and could only assume he\u2019d left the club.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Lucas. He\u2019s in my economics class. And he draws stuff.\u201d</p><p>Maggie began giggling and slapped the leather seat. \u201cHe draws stuff? What kind of stuff? Naked girls? That\u2019s pretty much the extent of most guys\u2019 artistic endeavors. Usually not even whole girls. Just boobs.\u201d</p><p>Erin and I laughed along with her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he draws. He was just... sketching something in class Friday. I don\u2019t think he listened to the lecture at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Erin!\u201d Maggie leaned as far up as her seatbelt would allow. \u201cSounds like that god of a man is a bad student. We know what that means for Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Erin shook her head, smiling. \u201cCome on, J\u2014have you ever in your life been attracted to a bad boy? Or a boy who\u2019s, um, academically challenged? In other words, a boy who isn\u2019t\u2014gasp!\u2014a brainiac?\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open. \u201cShut up! Are you saying I\u2019m an intellectual snob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! We didn\u2019t say you were\u2014we don\u2019t mean that. We just mean... you sure didn\u2019t look indifferent to this Lucas guy tonight, while you two danced together for like ever, and it sounds like he\u2019s maybe not your usual type\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only \u2018type\u2019 has been Kennedy for the past three years! Who knows what my type is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get huffy. You know what I mean\u2014you don\u2019t even crush on dumb guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who does?\u201d I rebelled against the idea that Lucas was dumb. Maybe he was unmotivated in economics, but nothing about him seemed unintelligent.</p><p>\u201cHello!?\u201d Maggie called. \u201cDo you even know Will?\u201d We all dissolved into fits of giggles. Maggie\u2019s boyfriend was a sweet guy, and he could probably bench press a small Honda, but he wouldn\u2019t be winning any acclaim for his GPA.</p><p>\u201cChaz is brainier than me\u2014but that\u2019s not saying much,\u201d Erin said.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried repeatedly to get her to quit knocking her B-average intellect, but at some point in her life, she became convinced that she\u2019s not smart. I poked her in the arm, as I have every time she\u2019s spouted that self-deprecating nonsense.</p><p>\u201cOw! I\u2019m just being honest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Erin continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been known to slum it and shop in the gag-him-and-bag-him aisles, believe it or not.\u201d Maggie hooted a laugh behind us as Erin continued. \u201cHave y\u2019all seen the guy who took me to senior prom?\u201d We\u2019d all seen her photos of that guy\u2014the Adonis in a tux, his arm around her silk-clad waist. \u201cWhat a body\u2014holy cow, I just wanted to lick his abs. He was in remedial classes, but let me tell you, he was gifted and talented at plenty of non-academic occupations.\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure my face was on fire\u2014as it was whenever my roommate elaborated so explicitly, and Maggie was laughing so hard she was having trouble breathing. They\u2019d both come to college single and sexually experienced. Kennedy and I had been sleeping together since winter break of senior year, but I\u2019d never been with anyone else. I\u2019d had no complaints about our sex life, though the occasional magazine article or something Erin said made me wonder if there was more to it than I knew.</p><p>\u201cAnd all of this proves\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Erin grinned at me. \u201cIt proves you\u2019re ready for a long-overdue Bad Boy Phase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoohhh,\u201d Maggie sighed.</p><p>\u201cUm. I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Don\u2019t think. You\u2019re gonna seduce this Lucas guy and rebound the hell out of him. That\u2019s the thing about bad boys\u2014they don\u2019t have any qualms about being the rebound guy because they don\u2019t hang around for long anyway. He probably lives for being the rebound guy\u2014especially in a situation like this, where he\u2019ll get to teach you all sorts of naughty stuff.\u201d</p><p>Maggie endorsed Erin\u2019s crazy idea with one heavily sighed word. \u201cLucky.\u201d</p><p>I thought of Lucas\u2019s hands at my waist, his mouth grazing my ear, and I shivered. I recalled his penetrating gaze Wednesday during class, and the breath in my lungs went shallow. Maybe I was experiencing alcohol perspective, and everything would look different tomorrow\u2014but at the moment, Erin\u2019s crazy idea was starting to sound almost not crazy.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>I was a ball of nerves as I approached the classroom Monday morning, unsure if I should initiate the man-snaring strategy I\u2019d agreed to test on my unsuspecting classmate, or abandon it fully while I still could. He walked into the room ahead of me, and I watched his eyes flick over my recently assigned seat, and the vacant one next to Kennedy, who was already seated, thank God. I had about thirty seconds to reconsider the whole thing.</p><p>Erin and Maggie hadn\u2019t let up on the thankfully short drive back to the dorm, feeding each other\u2019s enthusiasm and swearing envy over what I was about to do. Or who I was about to do. Since Erin had nothing to drink on Saturday but Diet Dr. Pepper, she\u2019d sprung out of bed Sunday morning unhungover and chock-full of plans for Operation Bad Boy Phase.</p><p>I pretended more of a hangover than I had, just to put her off, but Erin with an idea was not readily put off. Determined to impart her how-to-seduce-a-guy knowledge whether I wanted it or not, she\u2019d shoved a bottle of orange juice into my hands as I grumbled and pulled myself to a sitting position. I wanted to tug the covers over my head and plug my ears, but it was far too late for that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She plopped next to me. \u201cFirst, you have to approach this with no fear. Seriously, they can smell fear. It totally puts them off the scent.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cOff the scent? That\u2019s so...\u201d I tried to think of a more suitable word than aaauugh, but my brain hadn\u2019t booted up yet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so true, you mean? Look\u2014guys are dogs. Women have known this since the beginning of time. Guys don\u2019t want to be chased; they chase. So if you\u2019re going to catch one, you have to know how to make him chase you.\u201d</p><p>I squinted at her. Archaic, sexist, demeaning my brain declared, filling in for aaauugh, too late. This viewpoint shouldn\u2019t have surprised me\u2014I\u2019d heard her say these sorts of things before. I just never considered those off-the-cuff remarks to be part of a creed.</p> <p>I chugged half of the OJ before commenting. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about this.\u201d</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThis is where I don\u2019t say \u2018as a heart attack,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><p>Go time.</p><p>I took a deep breath. I had three minutes until class started. Erin said I needed one minute, no more than two. \u201cBut two is pushing it,\u201d she insisted, \u201cbecause then you look too interested. One is better.\u201d</p><p>I slid into the seat next to him, but perched on the edge, making it obvious that I had no intention of remaining. His eyes snapped to mine immediately, dark brows disappearing into that messy hair falling over his forehead. His eyes were almost colorless. I\u2019d never seen anyone with eyes so light.</p> <p>He was definitely startled by my appearance next to him. Good, according to Erin and Maggie.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, a subtle smile on my lips, hoping I appeared somewhere between interested and indifferent. According to Erin and Maggie, that impression was a vital part of the strategy.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He opened his econ text, concealing the open sketchbook in front of him. Before he obscured it, I caught a detailed illustration of the venerated old oak tree in the center of campus and the ornamental wrought iron fence surrounding it.</p><p>I swallowed. Interested and indifferent. \u201cSo, it just occurred to me that I don\u2019t remember your name from the other night. Too many margaritas, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips and stared at me a moment before answering, and I blinked, wondering if he was purposefully making my loosely-sustained indifference more challenging to maintain. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucas. And I don\u2019t think I gave it.\u201d</p><p>In the next moment, Dr. Heller entered noisily near the podium, catching his handled case in the door. An audible, \u201cDammit,\u201d echoed through the lecture hall, thanks to the planned acoustics of the room. Lucas and I smiled at each other as our fellow classmates tittered.</p> <p>\u201cSo... you, um, called me Jackie, before?\u201d I said, and his head tilted slightly. \u201cI actually go by Jacqueline. Now.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew down slightly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and stood\u2014surprising him again, judging by his expression. \u201cNice to meet you, Lucas.\u201d I smiled again before turning away and darting to my assigned seat.</p><p>Keeping my attention on the lecture and defying the compulsion to peek over my shoulder was excruciating. I was sure I felt Lucas\u2019s eyes boring into the back of my head. Like an out-of-reach itch, the sensation nettled me for fifty minutes straight, and it took herculean effort to refrain from turning around. Unknowingly, Benji helped by making distracting observations on Dr. Heller, like tallying the number of times he said, \u201cUuummm,\u201d during the lecture with marks at the top of his notebook, and pointing out the fact that our professor was sporting one navy and one brown sock.</p><p>Instead of lingering at the end of class to see what Lucas would do (speak to me or ignore me?), instead of waiting for Kennedy to leave (funny, I\u2019d paid scant attention to him for the past hour\u2014that was a first), I swung my backpack onto my shoulder and practically sprinted from the room without looking at either of them. Emerging from the side door into the crisp fall air, I sucked in a deep breath. Agenda: Spanish class, lunch, Starbucks.</p><p>Erin: How\u2019d OBBP go?</p><p>Me: Got him to tell me his name. Went back to my seat. Didn\u2019t look at him again.</p><p>Erin: Perfect. Meet you after next class for more strategizing before coffee. ;)</p> <p>When Erin and I joined the line at the Starbucks, I didn\u2019t see Lucas.</p><p>\u201cRats.\u201d She craned her neck, making sure he wasn\u2019t one of the people behind the counter. \u201cHe was here last Monday, right?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYeah, but his work schedule is probably unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>She elbowed me lightly. \u201cNot so much. That\u2019s him there, right?\u201d</p><p>He came through a door to the back with an industrial-sized bag of coffee. My physical reaction to him was unnerving. It was as though my insides all clenched up at the sight of him, and when they unwound, everything restarted at once\u2014my heart rate accelerating, lungs pumping air, brainwaves running amok.</p><p>\u201cOoh, J, he\u2019s got ink, too,\u201d Erin murmured appreciatively. \u201cJust when I didn\u2019t think he could get any hotter...\u201d</p><p>My eyes fell to his forearms, flexing as he sliced the bag open. Tattooed designs wrapped around his wrists, contiguous symbols and script running up both arms and disappearing into the sleeves of the gray knit shirt, which were shoved above his elbows. I\u2019d never seen him without his sleeves pulled to the wrists. Even Saturday night, he\u2019d worn long sleeves\u2014a faded black button-down, open over a white t-shirt.</p><p>I\u2019d never been attracted to guys with tattoos. The notion of needles injecting ink under the skin and the confidence of making permanent imprints of words and symbols was foreign to me. Now, I wondered how far the tattoos spread\u2014just the sleeves of his arms? His back? His chest?</p><p>Erin tugged my arm as the line moved forward. \u201cYou\u2019re botching our carefully crafted indifferent act, by the way. Not that I can blame you.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMaybe we should bail now before he\u2014\u201d</p><p>I glanced at her when she fell silent, and watched a devious smile cross her face as she turned to me.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking at me,\u201d she said, laughing as though we were having an amusing conversation. \u201cHe\u2019s staring at you. And I mean staring. That boy is undressing you with his eyes. Can you feel it?\u201d Her expression was triumphant.</p><p>Could I feel his stare? I can now, thanks, I thought. My face heated.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re blushing,\u201d she whispered, her dark eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d My teeth were clenched, voice tight. \u201cStop telling me he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndressing you with his eyes?\u201d She laughed again and I\u2019d never wanted to kick her more. \u201cOkay, okay\u2014but J, do not worry. You\u2019ve got this. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done to him, but he\u2019s ready to sit up and beg. Trust me.\u201d She glanced in his direction. \u201cOkay, he\u2019s starting a new batch of coffee now. You can do your own staring.\u201d</p><p>We stepped closer; there were only two people in front of us. I watched Lucas replace the filter, measure out the coffee, and set the controls. His green apron was haphazardly secured in the back\u2014more of a knot than a bow. The ties drew my eyes to his hips in his worn, low-slung jeans, one pocket holding a wallet to which a loose chain was attached. It disappeared under the apron, linking to a front belt loop, no doubt.</p><p>He turned then, eyes on the second register as he punched buttons and brought it to life. I wondered if he planned to ignore me as I had him during class. It would serve me right, playing this game. Just as the guy in front of me began his detailed drink order to the girl at the first register, Lucas\u2019s gaze swung up to meet mine. \u201cNext?\u201d The steel gray of his shirt set off the gray in his eyes, the blue disappearing. \u201cJacqueline.\u201d He greeted me with a smirk, and I worried that he could read my mind, and the devious plans Erin had implanted in it. \u201cAmericano today, or something else?\u201d</p><p>He remembered my drink order from a week ago.</p><p>I nodded, and he flashed a barely-there grin at my bemusement, ringing up the order and printing the cup with a sharpie. Instead of passing it to a coworker, though, he made the drink himself.</p><p>He added a protective sleeve and a lid and handed me the cup. I couldn\u2019t read his trace of a smile. \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d Looking over my shoulder, he said, \u201cNext?\u201d</p><p>I joined Erin at the pick-up counter, confused and sulking.</p><p>\u201cHe made the drink for you?\u201d She retrieved her drink and followed me to the condiment counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I removed the lid and added sugar and milk while she shook cinnamon over her latte. \u201cBut he just handed it over like I was any other customer and took the next guy\u2019s order.\u201d We watched him interact with customers. He didn\u2019t once glance my way.</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn he was so into you he couldn\u2019t see straight,\u201d she mused as we left, rounding a corner to join the mass of people flowing through the student center.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby!\u201d Chaz\u2019s voice pulled both of us from our thoughts. He snatched Erin out of the flow of people and I followed, laughing at her delighted squeal until I noticed the guy standing next to him.</p><p>My face went hot, blood pounding in my ears. As our friends kissed hello and began talking about what time they each got off work tonight, Buck stared down at me, his mouth turning up on one side. My breath came in pants and I fought to keep the rising panic and nausea under control. I wanted to turn and run, but I was immobilized.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t touch me here. He couldn\u2019t hurt me here.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jackie.\u201d His piercing gaze roamed over me and my skin crawled. \u201cLookin\u2019 good, as always.\u201d His words gushed flirtation, but all I felt was the threat underneath, intended or not.</p><p>The bruises had faded from his face, but weren\u2019t entirely gone. One yellowish streak ringed his left eye, and another brushed along the right side of his nose like a pale smear. Lucas had given him those, and only the three of us knew it. I stared back, mute, the coffee clutched in my hand. I\u2019d once thought this boy handsome and charming\u2014the all-American veneer he wore fooling me as thoroughly as it fooled everyone else.</p><p>I raised my chin, ignoring my physical reaction to him, and the fear causing it. \u201cIt\u2019s Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow, confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed my elbow. \u201cCome on, hot stuff. Don\u2019t you have art history in like five minutes?\u201d</p><p>I stumbled slightly as I turned and followed her, and he issued a soft, taunting laugh as I passed him. \u201cSee you around, Jacqueline,\u201d he teased.</p><p>My name in his mouth sent a tremor through me, and I trailed behind Erin into the sea of students. Once I could move, I couldn\u2019t get away from him fast enough.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Erin: Do you still have your coffee cup?</p><p>Me: Yes?</p><p>Erin: Take the sleeve off</p><p>Me: OMG</p><p>Erin: His phone number?</p><p>Me: How did you know???</p><p>Erin: I\u2019m Erin. I know all. ;)</p><p>Erin: Actually, I just wondered why he wrote on your cup if he was going to make your drink.</p><p>If Erin hadn\u2019t texted me during class, that cup, and his number, would have been pitched into the hallway wastebasket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So... Lucas wasn\u2019t writing an unnecessary drink order onto my cup, he was giving me his phone number. I entered it into my phone, wondering what I was meant to do with it. Call him? Text him?</p><p>I thought about what I knew of him: He\u2019d come out of nowhere the night of the party. After putting a stop to the attack, some further protective trait had obliged him to see me safely back to the dorm. He\u2019d somehow known my name that night\u2014my nickname\u2014but I\u2019d never noticed him before.</p><p>He sat in the back row in economics, sketching or staring at me instead of paying attention to the lecture. Saturday night, the firm touch of his hands as we danced made my head swim, before he disappeared without explanation. He\u2019d undressed me with his eyes, Erin said, in the middle of Starbucks\u2014where he worked. He was cocky and self-sure. Tattooed and too hot for words. He looked and acted like the Bad Boy Erin and Maggie believed him to be.</p><p>And now, his number was programmed into my phone. It was as though he knew all about Operation Bad Boy Phase, and he was as willing and eager to fill that role as my friends believed he\u2019d be.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t know him. I didn\u2019t know what he thought of me. If he thought of me. The girl talking to him after class last week wanted him. In the club, girls had openly stared as he passed, some of them turning around in his wake to assess him further. He could have danced with any of them, probably gone home with most of them. Why me?</p><p>Landon,</p><p>I\u2019ve attached an outline of my research paper. If you have a chance, could you make sure it\u2019s not too broad, or too focused? I\u2019m not sure how many economies outside the US to include. Also, the J-curve is a little confusing. I get that we can see it after the fact, but isn\u2019t economics based on prediction, like the weather? I mean, who cares if we can only see what happened after the fact - if the weather guy can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, he\u2019s probably going to get fired, right?</p><p>I did the worksheets, too. Sorry I\u2019m sending you so much at once, and on a Monday. I should have sent it earlier, but I went out with some friends Saturday and didn\u2019t get it done.</p><p>JW</p> <p>Jacqueline,</p><p>No problem. I\u2019m either working, studying or in class practically every waking hour. I hardly notice what day it is. I hope you enjoyed your night out.</p><p>I know I initially said I didn\u2019t need details of your breakup (if that was rude, I didn\u2019t mean it that way); it must have been bad to make you ditch class for two weeks. I can tell skipping is atypical for you.</p><p>I\u2019ve attached a WSJ article that explains the J-curve better than the text. You\u2019re exactly right, without the ability to predict, economics isn\u2019t economics, it\u2019s history. And while history has its place in the predictable probabilities of both economics and meteorology (clever analogy, btw), it\u2019s hardly useful if you need to know whether or not to invest in foreign currency or bring your umbrella to school.</p><p>LM</p><p>I stared at the email, trying and failing to compare Landon to Lucas. They seemed as opposite as night and day, but I only knew half of each of them. I didn\u2019t know much about Lucas beyond his striking looks and his ability to beat the shit out of someone. During art history, I\u2019d found myself wondering what would have happened in that interaction with Buck, if Lucas had been with me. I wondered if Buck would have dared to look at me like that. To say what he\u2019d said: Lookin\u2019 good. The thought of Buck\u2019s cold eyes examining me made my stomach turn.</p> <p>Feeling shallow for caring, I speculated again what Landon might look like, and how much impact that might have on what I thought of him. His compliments made me stare at my laptop and smile. He\u2019d said my ex was a moron, and now he seemed to be interested in our breakup. In me. That, or I was reading too much into it.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>We were together almost three years. I never saw it coming. I followed him here to school, instead of trying for a performing arts school. My orchestra teacher nearly had a stroke when I told him. He pleaded with me to audition at Oberlin or Julliard, but I didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself. I trusted my future to my HS boyfriend, like an idiot. Now I\u2019m stuck somewhere I\u2019m not supposed to be. I don\u2019t know if I just believed that much in him, or that little in myself. Either way, pretty freaking stupid, huh? So there\u2019s my weepy little story.</p><p>Thank you for the article.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Not stupid. Overly trusting, maybe, but that reflects on his lack of trustworthiness, not on your intelligence. As for being somewhere you\u2019re not supposed to be \u2013 maybe you\u2019re here for a reason, or there is no reason. As a scientist, I lean toward the latter. Either way, you\u2019re off the hook. You made a decision; now you make the best of it. That\u2019s all you can do, right? On that note, I\u2019m off to study for a statistical mechanics quiz. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be able to prove scientifically that your ex isn\u2019t worthy of you, and you\u2019re exactly where you should be.</p><p>LM</p> <p>When Erin came through the door, I was half-asleep and surrounded by conjugated Spanish verbs printed on colored index cards. I scooped most of them up just before she bounced onto the edge of my bed.</p><p>\u201cSo? Did you call him or text him? Did you use the stuff we went over? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>She lay back on the bed, flinging her arms wide dramatically as I snatched up cards before she creased them. \u201cYou chickened out.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the cards in my hand. Yo habr\u00e9, t\u00fa habr\u00e1s, \u00e9l habr\u00e1, nosotros habremos... \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You know, this is better. Don\u2019t call. Make him chase you.\u201d She laughed at my creased brow. \u201cGuys like Chaz are so much easier. Hell, I could tell him to chase me and he would.\u201d</p><p>We laughed at the visual that produced, because it was probably true. I thought about Kennedy. About what kind of guy he was. He\u2019d chased me in the beginning, but he didn\u2019t have to try very hard to catch me. I was swept off my feet by him, swept along in his dreams and plans, because he\u2019d made me part of them. Until a few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cAw, shit, J. I know what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t think about him. I\u2019m gonna make some cocoa. Get back to\u2014\u201d she sat up, picking up a card I\u2019d not grabbed hastily enough, \u201c\u2014ugh, Spanish verbs.\u201d</p><p>Erin filled mugs with tap water in the bathroom and stuck them in the microwave to heat. I stared at the blurry cards in my hand. Damn Kennedy. Damn him, damn him. It would serve him right to see me with someone like Lucas. Someone so different, but equally hot. More so, if I started calculating details.</p><p>Operation Bad Boy Phase was on. But I wasn\u2019t calling Lucas, or texting him. If Erin was right\u2014if he was a chaser\u2014he\u2019d not done enough chasing, yet.</p><p>When she handed me the mug, I took a deep breath and smiled. She\u2019d piled mine with marshmallows from the little stash of them we both occasionally dug into without bothering to make cocoa. \u201cSo if I don\u2019t text him, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and squeaked a triumphant little squeal. \u201cHe must be digging the good girl thing you\u2019ve got going on...\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cJacqueline\u2014maybe he\u2019d noticed you in class before the breakup. You changed seats, right? Making it obvious you two broke up. This is perfect.\u201d I was back to confused and she was laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s already chasing you. Now all you have to do is keep running. Just not too fast.\u201d</p><p>I licked chocolate from my upper lip. \u201cErin, you\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wickedly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Wednesday, I got to the classroom before the 8:00 class let out. As soon as most of the students had filed out the door, I slipped in and took my seat, determined not to pay attention to Lucas when he came in. To that end, I flipped through my index cards, though I was more than ready to ace the quiz in Spanish.</p><p>When Benji slid into his seat on my left, I didn\u2019t pause in my review. I refused to be distracted from not paying attention to Lucas\u2019s seat, and whether or not he was in it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacqueline.\u201d That wasn\u2019t Benji\u2019s voice.</p><p>The seats were bolted to the floor, with right-handed desktops. Lucas leaned slightly over the side of Benji\u2019s, pushing into the very margin of my space. My breath caught, and I focused on letting it out, appearing unaffected. \u201cOh, hi.\u201d</p><p>He bit his lower lip once, briefly. \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t notice the phone number on your coffee cup.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my phone, sitting on the edge of my textbook. \u201cI noticed.\u201d I watched his reaction, knowing I was practically telling him to chase me.</p><p>He smiled, his light eyes crinkling slightly at the corners, and I tried not to swoon visibly. \u201cI see. Turnabout is fair play. How \u2019bout you give me yours?\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow at him. \u201cWhy? Do you need help in economics?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip in earnest that time, stifling a laugh. \u201cHardly. What makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Could I be attracted to a guy who cared so little about doing well in class? \u201cI guess it\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his chin into the palm of his hand. The tips of his fingers were tinged with gray, probably from drawing with that pencil sitting over his ear. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but I want your number for reasons completely unrelated to economics.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my phone and found his number, and sent him a text that said: Hi.</p><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re in my seat.\u201d Benji\u2019s tone was matter-of-fact, but unperturbed.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s phone vibrated in his hand, and he smiled as my text popped up, giving him my number. \u201cThanks.\u201d He unfolded himself from the chair and addressed Benji. \u201cSorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d Benji was one of the most easygoing people I\u2019d ever met. His attitude said slacker, but I\u2019d gotten a look at the midterm crammed into his notebook\u2014he\u2019d made a high B, and for all his talk about skipping class and sleeping in, he\u2019d yet to miss one. After Lucas sauntered back to his seat, Benji leaned over the edge of his desktop, closer than Lucas had. \u201cSo what was that about?\u201d His eyebrows rocked up and down and I tried not to grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I replied, fluttering my lashes in my best Southern belle impersonation.</p><p>\u201cCareful, little lady,\u201d he drawled. \u201cThat fella seems a bit dangerous.\u201d He shook a too-long curl out of his eyes, smiling. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with a bit of danger.\u201d</p><p>My lips pinched into half a smile. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>I congratulated myself for taking a singular peek over my shoulder, halfway through the fifty-minute class. Lucas wasn\u2019t looking at me, so I couldn\u2019t help staring. Pencil in hand, he was sketching intently, first shading and then carefully smearing with his thumb. His dark hair fell around his face as he concentrated on his work, the lecture and the classroom disregarded as though he was alone in his room. I imagined him sitting on his bed, knees up, pad balanced on his thighs. I wondered what he was sketching. Or who.</p><p>He glanced up and caught my gaze. Held it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth pulled into that ghost of a smile and he stretched his neck and rolled his shoulders, returning my stare. Glancing at the pad, he tapped the end of his pencil against it and sprawled back in his seat, lashes fanning down as he examined his work.</p><p>Dr. Heller finished the chart he was free-handing onto the whiteboard, and the lecture resumed. Lucas tucked the pencil over his ear and picked up a pen. Before shifting his attention to our professor, he smiled at me again, and a jolt of excitement shot through me.</p><p>At the end of class, a different girl than last week intercepted him on his way out the door, and I bolted without a backward look. My adrenaline kicked in, my body sensing my need to escape and giving wings to it. Glancing over my shoulder, I ducked through the side exit and slowed down, feeling silly. Erin and Maggie insisted that I should elude his grasp for a few days more, and make him pursue me\u2014but he wasn\u2019t going to literally give chase.</p><p>I texted Erin that I\u2019d be getting crap coffee in the cafeteria before my afternoon class instead of going by the Starbucks. She texted back: GENIUS. I\u2019ll meet you there. Sisters in solidarity and all that shit.</p> <p>By the end of art history, I was beginning to doubt Erin\u2019s notion that Lucas wanted to play this game. Maybe he wasn\u2019t a dog. Or I wasn\u2019t a cat. Or I was just really bad at this. I sighed, stuffing my phone into my bag. I\u2019d clicked it to check for a message at least thirty times during class.</p><p>I\u2019d always disparaged the games people played in pursuit of love\u2014or the next hook up. The whole thing was a competition to see who could get how far, and I could never figure out if there was more luck or skill involved, or some unknowable combination of the two. People rarely said what they thought, or revealed how they felt. No one was honest.</p><p>Easy for me to say, from my high horse of the perfect relationship with Kennedy. Erin had called me on that months ago, when I told her she was being ridiculous over a guy\u2014plotting to decipher what he wanted from a girl before systematically breaking down his defenses. I had to admit she was right. I had no idea what it was like to be a young, single adult, so I wasn\u2019t entitled to judge.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>This angst was absurd, but I couldn\u2019t shake it. He\u2019d stared at me in class. I felt confident when I left economics, and miserable now. Why? Because he hadn\u2019t shoved the redhead out of his way at the end of econ to come after me? Because he hadn\u2019t texted me at some point during the barely three and a half hours since I\u2019d seen him? That didn\u2019t even make sense.</p> <p>By the time I was heating soup in the microwave for dinner, I\u2019d resigned myself to having failed at keeping Lucas\u2019s interest. I pushed the pretty girl who\u2019d rushed up to him at the end of the class from my mind, once I started imagining him leaving the class holding her hand, or more. \u201cDumbass,\u201d I muttered at myself.</p><p>From the end of my bed, my laptop dinged an email alert, and an answering flutter came from my stomach. It was probably nothing\u2014a notice about flu shots from the health center, or another note from one of my old high school friends, who were all \u201cso devastated\u201d that Kennedy and I were over (which they all figured out when he changed his Facebook relationship status\u2014twenty minutes after he\u2019d broken up with me).</p><p>I\u2019d disabled my account immediately, and had yet to reinstate it. The thought of seeing his glib status updates and having photos of him pop up in my feed was demoralizing. Even if I hid him, we knew too many of the same people. There\u2019d be no hiding his activities completely. I began getting sympathetic and condescending emails and texts the next day, so I was justifiably apprehensive whenever I checked my inbox.</p><p>Cringing, I pulled it up... and smiled.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Are you going to make it to the session tomorrow (Thursday)? In case you won\u2019t, I\u2019ve attached the worksheet I\u2019m planning to go over. It\u2019s new, separate stuff, and you needn\u2019t be completely caught up to get it. (Speaking of, you should be all caught up within a week or so.)</p> <p>LM</p><p>PS \u2013 I\u2019ve been thinking about that proof I spoke of last time \u2013 that you\u2019re where you\u2019re supposed to be. And it occurred to me, can you prove you\u2019d be better off somewhere else? If you\u2019d have left the state, your relationship would have ended still. Maybe you\u2019d have even blamed yourself, not knowing that it was doomed because of him, either way. Instead, you\u2019re here. You got dumped, skipped class, and met the best econ tutor at the university! Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll make you fall in love with economics. (What\u2019s your major, btw?)</p><p>Landon,</p><p>I\u2019m a music education major. I hate that saying: \"Those who can, do, those who can\u2019t, teach.\" As a tutor, I know that\u2019s BS. Still. I wanted to do. I imagined joining a symphony orchestra, or a progressive jazz band... And instead, I\u2019m going to teach.</p><p>I won\u2019t be at your session \u2013 I have lessons with my middle school boys tomorrow. (I think I\u2019d be more impressive to them if I could fart the scales instead of plucking them on the bass.)</p><p>Sorry to inform you, but I plan to make it through this class and be done with econ. No reflection on your genius tutoring skills, I swear. Thank you for the worksheet. You\u2019re too kind.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p> <p>If you want to do, then do. What\u2019s stopping you?</p><p>So I\u2019m kind, huh? Never heard that before. People usually think I\u2019m a pretentious a-hole. I must admit, I tend to encourage that estimation. So please promise to keep your opinion to yourself. Reputations can be ruined so easily, you know. ;)</p><p>LM</p><p>PS \u2013 Do the worksheet. Before Friday. I\u2019m giving you a very serious look through this screen. DO THE WORKSHEET. If you have problems with any of the material, let me know.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>What\u2019s stopping me? Well, I\u2019ve blown the chance to go to a serious music school. And I\u2019m stuck in a state that doesn\u2019t always foster the arts (something I\u2019ll probably spend my entire teaching career fighting). It seems impossible to go out now and \u201cdo.\u201d I guess I should rethink that.</p><p>Your secret geniality is safe. My lips are sealed.</p><p>JW</p><p>PS \u2013 I\u2019m DOING the worksheet, but I\u2019m giving you a very petulant look through my screen. Slave driver. Sheesh.</p><p>I was grinning when I clicked send. Maybe I was playing an entirely different game of chase, and Lucas and his infuriatingly enigmatic smile could take a flying leap. Erin and Maggie could keep their make-him-chase-you advice and use it themselves, because I, apparently, sucked at it in real life. Through email, though... My happy expression slid away as I realized the stark truth\u2014I was flirting with someone online. I had no idea what he looked like, or what type of person he was.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly true. I knew exactly what type of person he was, even though I\u2019d never laid eyes on him. He was kind. And intelligent. And straightforward.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t beaten a would-be rapist to a bloody pulp for me. Or made my insides melt when he put his hands on my waist. He probably didn\u2019t have tattoos on his arms or glacier-gray-blue eyes and a liquefying stare.</p><p>At 10:00 pm, my phone trilled a text alert.</p><p>Lucas: Hi :)</p><p>Me: Hi :)</p><p>Lucas: What\u2019s up?</p><p>Me: Nothing. Homework.</p><p>Lucas: I wanted to talk to you after class, but you disappeared.</p><p>Me: I have another class right after. One of those profs who stops talking, stares at you and waits until you get to your seat if you\u2019re late.</p><p>Lucas: I would probably just walk to my seat even slower. ;)</p><p>Lucas: You should come by the SB Friday. It\u2019s usually dead. Americano, on the house?</p><p>Me: Free coffee? I can\u2019t pass that up. I\u2019ll try to stop by. When do you work?</p><p>Lucas: All afternoon. Til 5.</p><p>Me: K</p><p>Lucas: See you Friday, Jacqueline</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Lucas was fifteen minutes late to class on Friday, and we had a pop quiz first thing\u2014which he missed. My first thought was how irresponsible it was to miss a quiz... and then I remembered that I missed the midterm. I couldn\u2019t exactly point any fingers.</p><p>He slipped through the back door as Dr. Heller walked up the center aisle, collecting quizzes. He took the stacks from the left row and then turned to the right, where Lucas sat. \u201cI need to see you after class,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>Inclining his head once, Lucas pulled his text from his backpack and replied in the same subdued tone. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back at him during the remainder of class, and when it was over, he packed up his backpack and walked down the outside aisle to the front. While waiting for Dr. Heller to finish his conversation with another student, Lucas\u2019s eyes lifted and found me. His smile was as unreadable as always, scarcely there at all. But his gaze was focused, pegging me like a dart to a board.</p><p>Turning his attention to our professor, he broke the stare. I released the breath I\u2019d not realized I was holding and escaped the classroom, undecided on whether or not to follow through with stopping by Starbucks that afternoon.</p><p>I considered the quiz I\u2019d just aced, thanks to Landon\u2019s insistence that I complete the worksheet he sent two nights ago. Doing that worksheet had been all sorts of help\u2014on a quiz he must have known about. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d crossed a line and told me something he shouldn\u2019t have, but his toe was definitely on the line. For me. Swept along and invisible among thousands of other students on this enormous campus, I was struck by the fact that for some reason, he\u2019d gone out of his way to help me. For some reason, I mattered to him.</p><p>Erin: Chaz and I are leaving soon. You gonna be ok this weekend? You\u2019re going to SB this afternoon, RIGHT? If he asks you out, GO FOR IT. Clear the palate! Don\u2019t forget you\u2019ll have the room to yourself all weekend. WINK WINK.</p><p>Me: You kids have fun. I\u2019ll be fine! I\u2019ll keep you posted.</p><p>Erin: You\u2019d better! I\u2019ll be back Sunday afternoon. Or evening, depending on the level of hangover Sunday morning. Heh heh. TEXT ME LATER.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten Erin\u2019s road trip with Chaz was this weekend. His brother was in a band, and they were playing at a festival tomorrow near Shreveport, so they had reservations at a bed and breakfast for the weekend. Erin told Maggie and me about it last month while we waited to look at Mercury and Venus through a telescope during an evening astronomy lab.</p><p>\u201cA bed and breakfast?\u201d Maggie arched a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, monogrammed towels?\u201d</p><p>Erin scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s romantic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Maggie laughed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going with Chaz. How\u2019d you even talk Mr. Sports Stats into that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s full lips made a prim little bow and she combed a hand through hair so red I could tell its color even while standing in this dark field on the outskirts of town. \u201cI told him that bed-and-breakfasts have ginormous whirlpool tubs, and that I\u2019d be willing to do unspeakably sinful things to him in it.\u201d</p><p>A strangled sound came from one of the two nerdy guys behind us in line, both wearing tortured expressions and staring at Erin. We stifled laughs.</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u201cPoor Chaz. He never had a chance... he\u2019s gonna be standing in front of a bunch of people saying \u2018I do\u2019 someday without knowing how it happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUgh! I don\u2019t think so. When it\u2019s time to settle down, I\u2019m getting somebody like...\u201d Erin looked over her shoulder at the eavesdroppers behind us, \u201clike one of them.\u201d</p><p>The boys looked at each other and stood up a little straighter. With a smirk in Erin\u2019s direction, one of them fist-bumped the other.</p><p>I doubted Erin would give me a second thought during her romantic weekend. I was on my own. I deliberated, finally turning toward the student union while pulling my jacket tighter against the sudden November chill. Frat parties held this weekend wouldn\u2019t be open-window, not that I\u2019d know firsthand. There was no way in hell I was going anywhere Kennedy might be. Or Buck.</p><p>The coffee smell invaded my senses before the Starbucks came into view. Rounding the corner, my eyes went to the counter, where two employees stood talking. When I didn\u2019t see Lucas, I wondered if he\u2019d switched shifts and forgot to text me.</p> <p>There were only a handful of customers\u2014one of whom was Dr. Heller, reading the paper in the corner. I had nothing against my professor, but I didn\u2019t exactly want him witnessing my attempts to flirt with the guy who skipped the quiz and got called out for it just this morning. I stood just behind a display of coffee mugs and travel cups.</p><p>Just as he had Monday, Lucas pushed through the door to the back as my eyes brushed over it. My fingers and toes tingled at the sight of him. Underneath the green apron, he wore a close-fitting light blue t-shirt, long-sleeved, not the university-branded sweatshirt he\u2019d worn this morning in class. His shirtsleeves were pushed past his elbows again, leaving the tattoos visible. I moved to the counter, my eyes skimming from his forearms to his face. He hadn\u2019t seen me yet.</p><p>One of the girls at the register straightened. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d Her voice held a bite of annoyance, as though she was snapping her fingers to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Eve,\u201d Lucas said, and she shrugged and returned to her conversation with her coworker, but they both eyed me with even more hostility than a moment before. \u201cHey, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced toward the corner where Dr. Heller sat. \u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>His tone wasn\u2019t the tone of a guy who\u2019d specifically asked me to come by. Maybe he was behaving circumspectly for his coworkers\u2019 benefit.</p><p>\u201cUm, a grande Americano, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the cup from the stack and made the drink. I tried to hand him my card, but he shook his head once. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>His coworkers exchanged a look I pretended not to see.</p><p>I thanked him and retreated to the opposite side of the shop from Dr. Heller, setting up my laptop to work on my econ project. I had to glean information from multiple sources to defend the position my research paper was taking. It was due before Thanksgiving break, less than two weeks away.</p> <p>If I never had to make up another midterm, it would be too soon.</p><p>After an hour, I\u2019d bookmarked a dozen sources on current international economic happenings, my coffee was gone, and Lucas hadn\u2019t come over once. I was expected at the high school for my weekly Friday afternoon bass lessons in half an hour. Shutting down my laptop, I turned to unplug the power cord from the wall.</p><p>\u201cMs. Wallace.\u201d At Dr. Heller\u2019s unexpected greeting, I jumped, knocking over my thankfully-empty cup. \u201cOh! So sorry to have startled you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a little jumpy\u2014from, uh, the coffee.\u201d And from thinking for one split second that you were Lucas.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that Mr. Maxfield tells me you\u2019re almost caught up, and making headway on the project. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d He lowered his voice and glanced around conspiratorially. \u201cMy colleagues and I don\u2019t actually want to fail anyone, you know. Our goal is to frighten\u2014I mean encourage\u2014the less, er, serious students to produce. Not that I believe you\u2019re one of those.\u201d</p><p>I returned his smile. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and cleared his throat. \u201cGood, good. Well, on that note\u2014have a productive weekend.\u201d He chuckled at his joke and I managed to avoid rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Heller.\u201d</p> <p>He walked to the counter and spoke to Lucas as I wound the power cord and stowed the laptop in my backpack. The conversation between them was earnest, and I was concerned when Dr. Heller seemed to gesture toward me at least once. I wondered if our professor believed that Lucas was one of those less serious students he could intimidate into becoming more dedicated. If so, I didn\u2019t want to be used as some sort of example.</p><p>As I walked out, I looked over my shoulder, but Lucas didn\u2019t shift his gaze my way at all, and his expression was tense. His coworker, wiping down a counter a few feet away, smirked at me.</p><p>When I left the high school two hours later, I switched on my phone, endeavoring to look forward to a weekend alone while it powered up. Clearly, the trip to Starbucks was a bust. Lucas had been, if possible, even more puzzling and cagey than he was before.</p><p>While working on the project, I\u2019d emailed Landon to thank him for sending the worksheet Wednesday, and for insisting that I do it. Not wanting to trigger a possible guilt complex, I didn\u2019t directly refer to the tipoff he\u2019d knowingly given me, in case he was the rigorously honest type of guy he seemed to be. I hadn\u2019t heard from him since Wednesday, but maybe he would email this afternoon or tonight. Maybe he\u2019d be free this weekend, and we could finally meet.</p><p>I had one text from Erin that she and Chaz had arrived in Shreveport\u2014along with lots of insinuation about what I could do with a room to myself, and Mom had texted to ask about my Thanksgiving plans. Kennedy and I had alternated spending the day at his house or mine the past three years. Somehow, this translated into confusion about whether or not I was coming home this year. When I texted her back that yes, breaking up with a guy generally means no more shared holidays, I expected an apology to follow. I should have known better.</p><p>Mom: Don\u2019t be snippy. Your dad and I planned and paid for a trip to Breckenridge that weekend, because we thought you could stay at the Moore\u2019s. I guess we\u2019ll have to cancel.</p><p>Me: Go ahead and go. I\u2019ll go home with Erin or something.</p><p>Mom: Ok. If you\u2019re sure.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m sure.</p><p>Wow. My boyfriend dumps me, and the first chance Mom has to be tangibly supportive, she and Dad are taking off alone to go skiing. Way to make me feel wanted and included, Mom. As if Kennedy\u2019s rejection wasn\u2019t enough to deal with. Jesus.</p><p>I tossed my phone in an empty cup-holder and drove back to campus, prepared to watch reality TV and work on economics all weekend.</p><p>When I got to my room, I saw that Lucas had texted while I was driving back.</p><p>Lucas: Sorry I didn\u2019t say goodbye</p><p>Me: It was awkward with Dr. Heller there I guess.</p><p>Lucas: Yeah.</p><p>Lucas: So, I\u2019d like to sketch you.</p><p>Me: Oh?</p><p>Lucas: Yeah</p><p>Me: Okay. Not, like, sans clothes or anything right?</p><p>Lucas: Haha no. Unless you\u2019re up for that.</p><p>Lucas: J/k. Is tonight ok? Or tomorrow night?</p><p>Me: Tonight is good.</p><p>Lucas: Cool. I can be there in a couple of hours.</p><p>Me: Ok.</p><p>Lucas: What\u2019s your room number?</p><p>Me: 362. I\u2019ll need to let you into the building.</p><p>Lucas: I can probably get in. I\u2019ll text you if I can\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Lucas\u2019s knock was light. I was so nervous that I was trembling when I got up to answer the door.</p><p>He\u2019d said he wanted to sketch me, but I wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s all he wanted to do, or if it was code for more. Erin would never let me hear the end of it if I had him in our room and didn\u2019t at least get him to kiss me, though Lucas didn\u2019t strike me as the sort of guy who usually had to stop at kissing. Plenty of girls saw college as some sort of exploratory period, and many would be more than happy to explore Lucas. But it had taken me over a year to work up to sex with Kennedy, and he was the only guy I\u2019d ever slept with. I wasn\u2019t ready to go there with Lucas, not yet anyway\u2014rebound or not.</p><p>I took a breath.</p><p>He knocked again, a little harder, and I stopped thinking and opened the door.</p><p>Fringes of dark hair stuck out from his dark gray beanie. In the diffuse hallway lighting, his eyes took on the nearly colorless quality they\u2019d had that first night, when he peered into my truck after he\u2019d fought with Buck. He hunched his shoulders, hands in his front pockets, sketchpad under one arm. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>I stepped back into the room, holding the door wide. Olivia and Rona lounged in their own doorway across the hall, eyeballing Lucas, gaping at me, watching him enter my room while Erin was gone. Olivia arched a brow and glanced at her roommate.</p><p>The whole floor would know I had a hot guy in my room within five minutes.</p><p>I let the door swing shut as Lucas tossed his sketchpad on my bed and stood in the center of the room, which seemed to shrink with him in it. Without moving, he examined Erin\u2019s side of the room, the walls above her bed covered in photos, the Greek letters of her sorority above the glittery letters of her name. Taking advantage of his distraction, I studied him: cowboy boots, scuffed to hell, worn jeans, heather gray hoodie. He turned his head to scan my side of the room, and I stared at his profile\u2014recently-shaved jaw, parted lips, dark eyelashes.</p><p>Facing me, his eyes flicked over me and then to the laptop on my desk, which I\u2019d hooked to a small set of speakers. I\u2019d set up a playlist of tracks from my collection and set it to play quietly. Another of Erin\u2019s suggestions. She\u2019d titled the playlist OBBP, and I belatedly hoped he didn\u2019t inspect the list and ask what that meant. I wouldn\u2019t tell him, of course, but my blush-prone parts would probably incinerate.</p><p>\u201cI like this band. Did you see them last month?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kennedy and I had seen them, in fact\u2014the night before we broke up. They were one of our favorite local groups. He\u2019d been weird that night. Distant. At concerts, he\u2019d usually tuck my back to his chest, legs spread just enough to accommodate my feet between his, his arms locked around my middle. Instead, he\u2019d stood next to me, like we were friends. After we broke up, I realized that he\u2019d made up his mind before that night\u2014that his reserve was evidence of the wall between us; I just hadn\u2019t seen it yet.</p><p>I nodded, vanquishing Kennedy from my thoughts. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t remember seeing you there\u2014but it was dark, and I maybe had a beer or two.\u201d He smiled\u2014white teeth, just imperfect enough to indicate that he\u2019d not suffered through the orthodontics I had. Pulling off the cap and dropping it on my bed, he placed the pencil on his sketchbook and slid both hands through his flattened hair, and then shook it out, resulting in a bed-head look. Good God. When he drew the hoodie over his head, his white t-shirt pulled up a bit with it, and I got my answer on how far the tattoos extended. Four lines of script, too small to read, snaked around his left side. Some sort of Celtic-looking design balanced it on the right. Bonus: I now knew what Erin meant by lickable abs.</p><p>The hoodie joined the cap, and his t-shirt fell back into place. Picking up the sketchbook and pencil, he turned to me, and I noted that the ink on his forearms continued over his biceps and under the short sleeves of his shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d More breathless than I\u2019d intended, my question seemed a brazen proposition. Wow. Could I be any more obvious? Maybe I should just come out and ask him if he wanted to be my Kennedy-rebound, no strings attached.</p><p>My insides went liquid from his ghost of a smile\u2014the one that was becoming more and more familiar. \u201cOn the bed?\u201d he said, his voice gruff.</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cOkay.\u201d I moved to perch on the edge of the mattress as he swept the hoodie and the cap to the floor. My heart was pounding, waiting.</p><p>He peered at me, head angling to the side. \u201cUm. You look really uneasy. We don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t have to do what? I thought, wishing I could ask him if using me as a model was a pretense, and telling him that if so, it was a pretense he didn\u2019t need to maintain. I looked him in the eye. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>He stuck the pencil over his ear, looking unconvinced. \u201cMmm. What position would be the most comfortable for you?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say aloud the answers that popped into my head at that question, but the flush that spread across my face like wildfire gave me away. He caught his lower lip in his teeth, and I was sure it was to contain a laugh. Most comfortable position? What about with my head stuck under a pillow?</p><p>He glanced around my room and went to sit on the floor, against the wall, facing the foot of my bed. Knees up, pad on his thighs, he was just as I imagined him in class the other day. Except he was in my room, not his own.</p><p>\u201cLie down on your stomach and rest your head on your arms, facing me.\u201d</p> <p>I did as he told me. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyeing me as if absorbing details or searching for flaws. Coming onto his knees, he moved close enough to fan his fingers through my hair and let it fall over my shoulder. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he murmured, scooting back to his position against the wall, a few feet away.</p><p>I stared at him as he sketched, his eyes moving back and forth from my face to the pad. At some point, his gaze began to move over the rest of me. As if his fingertips skimmed over my shoulders and down my back, my breath caught in my throat and I shut my eyes.</p><p>\u201cFalling asleep?\u201d His voice was soft. Near.</p><p>I opened my eyes to find him on his knees next to me, sitting back on his heels. My heart picked up the pace again at his nearness. \u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d left the pad and pencil on the floor behind him. \u201cAre you... done?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slightly. \u201cNo. I\u2019d like to do another, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d At my nod, he said, \u201cTurn onto your back.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled over slowly, afraid he\u2019d be able to see my heart hammering through my thin sweater. He grabbed the pad and pencil from the floor and stood. Staring down, he let his eyes roam over me, and I felt vulnerable, but not in danger. I knew so little about him, but there was one thing I felt unequivocally: safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to arrange you, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cUh... sure.\u201d My hands were clutched to my ribcage, my shoulders hunched almost to my ears. What, this isn\u2019t how you want me positioned? I barely contained the nervous twitter that bubbled up at the thought.</p><p>His fingers encircled the wrist nearest him, and he brought my arm over my head, bent it as though it had been thrown back. Taking the opposite hand, he splayed my fingers over my abdomen, sat back, stared at me a moment, and then moved it, too, over my head, crossing my wrists, as though I was bound. I struggled to breathe normally. Impossible. \u201cI\u2019m going to move your leg,\u201d he said, his eyes on mine, waiting for my nod. His hands on my knee, he angled it out, leaving it flush against the mattress.</p><p>He picked up the pad and turned the page. \u201cNow tilt your face toward me a bit\u2014chin down\u2014that\u2019s good. And shut your eyes.\u201d I fought to remain relaxed, knowing that as long as I heard the scratch of his pencil across the page, he wasn\u2019t going to touch me. I lay unmoving, eyes closed, listening to the rasp of lead on paper, broken by the soft brush of his finger, smearing a line or a shadow.</p><p>From the laptop on my desk, my inbox dinged, and my eyes flashed open. Without thinking, I rose to my elbows. Landon? But there was no way I could check.</p><p>Lucas was watching me closely. \u201cDo you need to check that?\u201d</p><p>Landon had ignored my email all afternoon, when in the past he\u2019d answered so promptly that I was probably spoiled. But Lucas was sitting in my room. On my bed. I lay back, returned my arms to their prior position, and I shook my head. I didn\u2019t close my eyes this time, and he didn\u2019t ask me to.</p> <p>He returned to sketching, concentrating on my hands a long while, and then my face. He stared into my eyes, back and forth between that intense examination and his drawing. When he stared at my mouth for long moments\u2014drawing, staring, drawing, staring\u2014I wanted to reach up, grab his t-shirt, and pull him down to me. My hands clenched involuntarily and his gaze flicked there and back.</p><p>Eyes blazing, he looked down at me. \u201cJacqueline?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night we met\u2014I\u2019m not like that guy.\u201d His jaw was rigid.</p><p>\u201cI know tha\u2014\u201d He placed a finger over my lips, his expression softening.</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured. Or overpowered. But I do, absolutely, want to kiss you right now. Badly.\u201d He trailed his finger over my jaw and down my throat, and then into his lap.</p><p>I stared at him. Finally comprehending that he was waiting for a response, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the pad onto the floor and the pencil followed, his stare never unlocking from mine. As he leaned over me, I felt a heightened awareness of every part of my body that touched a part of his\u2014the edge of his hip pressed to mine, his chest sliding against mine, his fingers tracing from wrists to forearms and then framing my face. He held me in place, lips near my ear. When he kissed the sensitive spot, my breath shuddered. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered, moving his mouth to mine.</p><p>His lips were warm and firm, pressing against mine, and when his tongue began a gentle onslaught against the line of my lips, I opened them. Tongue delving into my mouth, his hands traveled in opposite directions\u2014one to my still-crossed wrists, pressing them into the mattress above my head, one skimming down my side, digging into my waist. He kissed me harder, claiming the responses he coaxed from me. My head swam, and I was drawing in short bursts of air as if I was surfacing every few seconds before diving deeper. Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take the intensity, he lessened the pressure and sucked my lower lip softly, brushed his tongue over it, and then he repeated the movement. I fidgeted beneath him and his tongue slipped between my lips again and repeated its closer examination\u2014caressing my tongue, my teeth, the roof of my mouth.</p><p>If someone had asked, How does this compare to kissing Kennedy? I would have answered, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hands each grasped a wrist and placed my arms around his neck. Responding by doing something I\u2019d dreamed of doing more than once, I pushed my hands into his hair, mussing it further. He drew me up, scooping me onto his lap as he scooted his back against my pile of pillows at the head of the narrow bed, one booted foot still on the floor, the other drawn up under me. Leaning me back, his hand cradling my head, he kissed a path down my neck and into the V of my t-shirt. My head fell back as I panted and tried to form a rational thought.</p><p>His hand drifted under my shirt to slide along my ribs, roaming over the satin cups of my bra, his fingertips skimming the skin above, the curves of flesh, the cleavage augmented by my folded-up position. Pushing the hem of the shirt above my breasts, he moved his lips to the places his fingers had been and ran his tongue along the line of skin just above the edge of my bra.</p><p>My hands tightened in his hair as his fingers skimmed the front clasp. Hadn\u2019t I worn this easy-access bra for this very reason? My body wanted him, but my mind protested\u2014a first kiss, to feeling me up, to\u2014what?</p><p>Erin\u2019s voice in my head said, Rebound the hell out of him! and I choked an untimely laugh.</p><p>Lucas raised his head and cocked an eyebrow at me. \u201cTicklish?\u201d he asked, incredulous.</p><p>I was entirely horrified, and couldn\u2019t imagine a bigger tragedy in that moment than having ticklish breasts\u2014unless it was having the stupidest sense of humor on the planet. I bit my lip, trying not to laugh again, thinking, Oh my God. I shook my head.</p><p>His gaze flicked to my teeth, clamped on my bottom lip. \u201cYou sure? Because it\u2019s either that... or you find my seduction techniques... humorous.\u201d</p><p>I barked another laugh, unable to contain it, and he shook his head as I sat on his lap, my chest half-bare, mortified. I jerked my hand from his hair and slammed it over my imprudent mouth.</p><p>Then, he smiled. Behind my palm, I smiled back, begging him silently not to make me laugh again\u2014because just under the surface, the repressed hysterics were preparing to mutiny.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just tickle you and get it over with.\u201d He appeared to mull over the idea.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I said, alarmed. Like most people, I wasn\u2019t an attractive sight when tickled. I knew this, because my aunt had filmed my jackass older cousin tickling me into a writhing, pleading mess on my eleventh birthday. My face had turned a blotchy scarlet, spit trailing from the corner of my mouth, and the sounds of protestation I uttered were almost inhuman.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please, no.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he took my hand from in front of my face and pressed it to his chest, leaning forward swiftly and kissing me. I noticed he\u2019d carefully pulled my shirt back down, though that didn\u2019t stop him from stroking his fingertips across my abdomen beneath it, or palming my breasts through the bra, his thumb stroking over a nipple while his mouth moved with mine, leaving me lightheaded. Against my hand, his heart thumped in time with mine.</p><p>I forgot all about laughing.</p><p>My lips were sensitive and tingly. Touching them brought rushes of gooey memories\u2014his hands, and what they\u2019d done in concert with his mouth\u2014the crazy-making kisses, and the few words he\u2019d spoken. You\u2019re so beautiful.</p><p>I wanted to see the sketches, so he showed them to me. They were good. Amazingly good. I told him so and earned his barely-there smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with them?\u201d I asked, more than a little belatedly.</p><p>\u201cRedo them in charcoal, probably.\u201d</p><p>I waited for more. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged into his hoodie and stared down at me. \u201cTack them to my bedroom wall?\u201d</p><p>My lips parted, but I had no idea what to say. Bedroom wall?</p><p>His eyes returned to the pad, turned to the second drawing. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to wake up to this?\u201d</p><p>That statement had a ninety-nine percent chance of meaning what it seemed to suggest, but I wasn\u2019t sure enough to reply in kind, so I said nothing. He closed the sketchpad and laid it on the bookcase near the door. Taking my chin in his hand, he rubbed his thumb across my lower lip, gently.</p><p>\u201cAh, crap.\u201d He pulled his hand away and looked at his fingers. \u201cI forgot what my hands look like after drawing.\u201d He looked at my shirt. \u201cYou may have little gray marks... everywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Assuming I now had a gray lip and possibly faint streaks of gray across my abdomen and the upper curves of my breasts, I couldn\u2019t think what to say beyond, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He balled his hands into fists, set one under my chin to raise it again and used the other to tug me closer. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, no fingers.\u201d Dragging my body against his, he kissed me, his back against the door to my room. In this position, there was no hiding what his body wanted from me. I pressed against him and he groaned into my mouth and wrenched his mouth from mine, breathing raggedly. \u201cI have to go now, or I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>This was the moment for me to say Stay, but I couldn\u2019t. Kennedy flashed through my mind, saying something oh-so-similar not that long ago. Even more insane was the thought of Landon, and a possible email waiting for me. Neither of those things should matter. Not in this moment.</p><p>Lucas straightened and cleared his throat. Kissing my forehead and the tip of my nose, he opened the door. \u201cLater,\u201d he said, and was gone.</p> <p>I gripped the doorframe and watched him walk away, pulling the beanie over his tousled hair. Every girl he passed glanced up. Some turned and watched until he reached the stairwell door, before whipping their heads around to see where he\u2019d come from. I retreated into my room and left them to their speculation.</p><p>The interrupting email wasn\u2019t from Landon, it was from Mom\u2014and contained my parents\u2019 itinerary for their ski trip to Colorado. A ski trip that I\u2019d not been invited to join. A ski trip scheduled for the only mid-semester weekend I\u2019d planned to spend at home\u2014a holiday weekend, no less.</p><p>Still, I had a difficult time stirring up any real anger when I opened her email, for two reasons. One, I was oddly disappointed that it wasn\u2019t Landon\u2019s name in my inbox, and two, I was so high from being thoroughly kissed by Lucas that I didn\u2019t care about a holiday eleven days in the future, or how I\u2019d be spending it.</p><p>By Sunday evening, I was eating spoonfuls of peanut butter for dinner, watching He\u2019s Just Not That Into You, and telling myself I was clearly no exception to anyone\u2019s rule. Landon still hadn\u2019t emailed, and I hadn\u2019t heard from Lucas, either.</p><p>Erin was due back any moment, and I was eager for her boisterous, colorful presence in our room. Too much quiet left me depressed and consuming condiments for meals.</p> <p>My inbox dinged and I debated whether or not to pause the movie to check it. I wasn\u2019t in the mood for another of my mother\u2019s efforts to shed her remorse about deserting me on a major holiday. So far, she\u2019d tried logic (\u201cIt was your year to go to Kennedy\u2019s.\u201d), emotional blackmail (\u201cYour father and I haven\u2019t had a trip alone in twenty years.\u201d), and one grudging invitation to join them (\u201cI suppose we could get you a ticket. But you\u2019d have to sleep on the sofa or a cot, because the rooms are undoubtedly booked.\u201d). I ignored the first two and said No, thanks to the third.</p><p>What next\u2014an attempt to buy me off? A proposed shopping trip wouldn\u2019t be out of the question\u2014she\u2019d used that before. Last week, I\u2019d bookmarked a pair of boots online that my private lesson pay and my allowance wouldn\u2019t quite cover. I paused the movie and clicked my inbox.</p><p>Jackpot. But not Mom. Landon.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>I\u2019m glad you felt confident about the quiz. Whenever you get a draft of your paper together, I\u2019d be happy to look it over before you turn it in. I\u2019ve attached the worksheet for tomorrow\u2019s session, which I just finished making. If you have any questions, let me know.</p><p>LM</p> <p>I reread the email, pouting. There was nothing remotely flirtatious in it. It could have come from a professor. He didn\u2019t account for why it had taken him all weekend to answer me, when he usually answered within a couple of hours, if not sooner. He didn\u2019t tease me about anything, or ask any non-econ related question. I felt as though I\u2019d imagined every shred of familiarity we\u2019d developed over the past couple of weeks.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>Thank you. I\u2019ll send the draft by Saturday morning. I hope you had an enjoyable weekend.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Getting it to me by Saturday is fine. I\u2019ll try to get it back to you quickly so you can get it in to Dr. H before the break. My weekend was good. Especially Friday. How was yours?</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p> <p>Good. A bit lonely (my roommate was out of town all weekend, and she just got home and is bursting to tell me all about it), but productive. Thanks again for all your help.</p><p>JW</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Once again, Lucas was approached by a girl at the end of class. What the hell? Did every girl in our class feel a need to converse with him? But then a guy walked up next to her, his arm wrapping around her shoulder. Alarmed, I realized what my visceral reaction implied: jealousy. Over a guy I barely knew, with whom I\u2019d exchanged more saliva than sentences.</p><p>As I passed the last aisle, Lucas gave me a tight smile with a slight lift of his chin and shifted his attention back to the couple in front of him. Conflicted, I was equal parts relieved and disappointed.</p><p>I asked Erin\u2019s advice over lunch.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s holding his cards damned close.\u201d Sipping her typical Jamba Juice lunch, she mulled over possible causes for his reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like... he\u2019s resisting being attracted to you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, lots of guys get standoffish\u2014but usually not until they\u2019ve closed the deal.\u201d She gave me a close look. \u201cAre you sure nothing more happened Friday night?\u201d</p><p>I heaved a sigh and clunked my forehead with the heel of my hand. \u201cOh yeah, I totally forgot that part where we had wild sex all night Friday.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, and then her brows rose. \u201cHey. What if he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I hadn\u2019t considered that. \u201cI guess that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>My mind went to one thing I couldn\u2019t say: What if what happened the night we met made me appear as pathetic and foolish as I felt, and he couldn\u2019t get past it? Those terrifying minutes haunted me still, and running into Buck a few days ago only amplified the threat. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time I\u2019d see him. He was in the same frat as Kennedy. He was friends with Chaz and Erin, and my entire former circle of friends. He was almost unavoidable.</p><p>\u201cA girlfriend would definitely put a kink in our plans,\u201d Erin mused.</p><p>Out of the blue, I wondered if Landon Maxfield had a girlfriend. He hadn\u2019t mentioned one, but why would he? There was no reason for him to insert Hey, btw, I have a girlfriend into one of our email exchanges. I could find some way to ask. He seemed so candid that I was sure he\u2019d answer.</p><p>\u201cJ?\u201d Erin\u2019s voice broke into my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow, slurping up the last of her smoothie. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? I know that calculating look, and as your official wing-woman, I need in on whatever you\u2019re plotting.\u201d</p><p>I picked at the sandwich in my hand, pulling the tomatoes out and stacking them in the corner of my tray. I couldn\u2019t tell her about Buck. But I could confess my building interest in Landon. \u201cYou know my economics tutor?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, confused, and suddenly, forming an online-only attraction while attending a university where there were thousands of single guys seemed like the most ridiculous thing ever in the history of ridiculous things.</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes it seems like we\u2019re flirting. And once, he said Kennedy was a moron.\u201d</p><p>She arched one brow. \u201cHe knows Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean he said, \u2018Your ex is a moron.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he actually knows him. It was more of a... complimentary statement, to me.\u201d I took a bite of my turkey-bacon-guacamole sandwich.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Erin leaned both elbows onto the table between us. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a given that he can\u2019t be as hot as Lucas. But he\u2019s a tutor, so he must be smart\u2014God knows that\u2019s right up your alley. Is he cute at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\u201d I said, still chewing.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019ve never met him, have you?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, not at all. I have no idea what he looks like, all right? But he\u2019s intelligent and funny. And he\u2019s been really nice, and helped me so much\u2014I\u2019m almost caught up in class, except for that project\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, you can\u2019t fall for a guy without ever seeing him! What if his looks are a deal-breaker? He could look like\u2014\u201d she scanned the food court and zeroed in on a creepy-looking guy in a ratty t-shirt and sweats loping past our table \u201c\u2014that guy.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, offended on Landon\u2019s behalf. \u201cThat guy looks like a social outcast. Landon is too smart to look like that.\u201d</p><p>She covered her eyes and shook her head. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll make Landon Plan B.\u201d She eyed me, wearing her conspiracy-theory expression\u2014eyes narrowed, lips puckered. \u201cWhat do you really know about this Landon guy?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cA lot more than I know about that Lucas guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what he looks and tastes like.\u201d She waggled her brows.</p><p>\u201cUgh! Erin. You have a one-track mind.\u201d</p><p>She smiled deviously. \u201cI prefer to think of it as target-driven.\u201d</p><p>We skipped the Starbucks\u2014part of Erin\u2019s plan, though she lamented the sacrifices she was making on my behalf as we choked down cups of cafeteria coffee. Leaving me with strict instructions not to text or email either of them, she gave me one swift hug before being swallowed by a group of her sorority sisters\u2014all of whom acted as though we were distant acquaintances at best\u2014as they set up an afternoon bake sale.</p><p>A month ago, I\u2019d been sanctioned as Kennedy\u2019s GDI girlfriend; now I was only poor Erin\u2019s non-Greek roommate.</p><p>Laundry rooms were located on each floor of the dorm, but since everyone on my floor decided to run loads at the same time, the washers were all full. Heaving the overflowing mesh bag into the stairwell, I hopped it down the concrete steps one at a time, hoping the residents a floor down were less moved to cleanliness, at least tonight.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I headed back upstairs with my empty bag. Stopping just inside the stairwell when my phone buzzed, I answered a message from Maggie reminding me to email a link she needed for a Spanish assignment we were doing together. Itching to text Lucas or email Landon, I shoved my phone down into my front pocket. I\u2019d promised Erin I\u2019d do neither. She knew how boys\u2019 minds worked, while my years with Kennedy left me woefully unprepared for these sorts of complex maneuvers. Frankly, the rules for hooking up didn\u2019t seem that much less tricky to me than the rules for finding a committed relationship, but what did I know.</p><p>The door beneath me opened and shut as I rounded the corner, and ascending footsteps sounded behind me. There were hundreds of residents in my building, and though we all used the elevator or the main stairs for coming and going from the building, most of us employed the persistently dank stairwell when moving between floors. The creeped-out, claustrophobic sensation was something I felt every time, and I forced myself not to sprint for the door at the top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jerked to a stop, realizing that I was moving forward, but my laundry bag wasn\u2019t. Assuming it was hooked on the handrail, I turned to liberate it and was almost eye to eye with Buck. The end of the bag was caught in his fist.</p><p>I gasped and my heart stopped, as though the moment was suspended in slow-motion, and then it began pounding like heavy machinery in my chest. He stepped up to the stair just beneath me\u2014and sneered down at me. \u201cHey Jackie.\u201d Bile rose in my throat at the sound of his voice, and I swallowed. \u201cOr no. I guess it\u2019s Jacqueline now, right? Isn\u2019t that what you said? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet...\u201d When he leaned closer, I tried to back up the stairs and tripped, sprawling. I used the opportunity to scramble backwards and up toward the door, but he reached down and pulled me up easily, both hands gripping my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I choked.</p><p>He smiled as though he was hypnotizing small, trapped prey. Toying with me. \u201cC\u2019mon, Jacqueline, don\u2019t be like that. You\u2019ve always been real nice to me. I just want you to be a little bit nicer, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>His words weren\u2019t slurred this time. He was sober and resolute, and the malevolence in his eyes told me that I would pay for my escape the night of the party. I would pay for what Lucas had done.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m saying no, Buck. Just like last time.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and I could barely hear the curse he hissed from the blood pulsing through my ears. Run. Run. Run, it seemed to say, and I wished I could obey. I let go of the bag, and it fell at our feet.</p><p>\u201cI know what happened that night wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty girl, and obviously that guy had the same idea I did. He just got the jump on me \u2019cause I\u2019d been drinking.\u201d His breath fell over my face, hot, not a trace of alcohol. He wouldn\u2019t trip if I twisted from his grip and ran. \u201cSo did he fuck you in your truck, or did you let him take you back to your room? I know Erin was with Chaz that night. Just like she\u2019ll be tonight.\u201d</p><p>I flinched from his vulgar words. I hadn\u2019t gotten a text from Erin yet, but it wasn\u2019t impossible that she was staying with Chaz tonight, or that Buck would know before I would.</p> <p>One arm snaked around and grasped my hip, squeezing it painfully. The pain was nothing compared to the degradation of being pawed against my will.</p><p>\u201cThe stairwell is rank and uncomfortable, but doable. Why don\u2019t we go to your room, instead? I\u2019ll make it good for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>His threat was obvious. If I said no, he would rape me right here. \u201cS-someone could come into the stairwell any moment.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTrue. Too bad you aren\u2019t wearing that little skirt you had on the other night. I could put you against this wall and do you in two minutes without taking a thing off of you.\u201d</p><p>My head spun. I strained against him, trying to move, even just a little, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve been caught with some hot little freak in an off-the-wall position. And hey\u2014bonus\u2014if you want to get Kennedy back for dumping you, then turning into the girl who\u2019ll do anything, anywhere, with anyone, would make him crazy.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou already started with that piece of shit\u2014and who knows who else? So we can do it here, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and his eyes flared. \u201cMy room.\u201d My breath panted out, shaky and hopefully mistaken for horniness in his pea-brained assessment. He smiled, and I almost threw up. I\u2019ve never wanted to vomit more, but my body fought it down instinctively.</p><p>Arm around my waist, he turned me toward the door at the top, grabbing the laundry bag from the floor. I asked myself if I was willing to do what I was about to do. If I was prepared to scream, fight and claw him in the hallway, humiliate myself in front of everyone, in hopes that he wouldn\u2019t succeed in getting me into my room. If he did that, I was done for. The walls weren\u2019t sound-proof, but everyone was used to hearing all sorts of noises emanating from neighboring rooms. If anyone even heard anything over their music, televisions and video games, they\u2019d likely think nothing of it.</p><p>We emerged into the hallway, and I evaluated the people I was about to depend on. My room was six doors from the stairwell. Two guys at the opposite end of the hall were practicing kick-flips on a skateboard. Olivia stood in the middle of the hall, talking to Joe, a guy from the fourth floor. When she spotted us, her mouth dropped open before she snapped it closed, and Joe looked over his shoulder, lifted his chin at Buck, and turned back to her with a low chuckle. This was bad.</p><p>Kimber, who roomed two doors down, came into the hallway with her laundry. I stopped. It was now or never. Buck took a step forward before realizing I was holding my ground. He turned back toward me. \u201cC\u2019mon, J,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cNo. You aren\u2019t going into my room, Buck. I want you to leave now.\u201d</p><p>The shock registered on his face. Kimber, Olivia and Joe froze, waiting to witness firsthand whatever was about to go down.</p><p>Buck\u2019s hand was at my elbow. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you said a few minutes ago, babe. Let\u2019s have this talk in private.\u201d He tried to pull me forward, but I wrenched my arm from his meaty hand.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave. Now.\u201d I glared, my chest heaving.</p> <p>Indecision played across his features. Five people were watching. He put both hands up, palms out. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, okay? I tried to tell you that brick would be cold and rough. It\u2019s not my fault you couldn\u2019t wait five minutes.\u201d Tossing the bag over my shoulder, he said, \u201cCall me later when you cool down, pretty girl.\u201d He bumped fists with Joe and sauntered to the stairwell, and I waited until he disappeared through the door to move.</p><p>My face burning, I unlocked my door while Olivia whispered not-so-discreetly behind me. \u201cOhmygod, they just did it in the stairwell? She had some other guy in her room like, Friday night! I wonder if she was screwing around on Kennedy and that\u2019s why he\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shut my door, leaned against it, and slid to the floor, quaking. Tears skated in tracks down my face and my breath shuddered out, leaving my chest aching. I wanted to run away. To go home. To be ignorant of getting dumped, of having my dreams dashed, of constantly feeling too inexperienced and stupid to deal with my own life.</p><p>I\u2019d outwitted Buck this time, making it twice that he\u2019d not gotten what he wanted, and he was pissed. Popular and good-looking, he could almost take his pick of girls, and from what I\u2019d heard and witnessed, he used that advantage to the fullest. I was no prettier than girls like Olivia, who constantly threw themselves in his path. There was no reason for him to fixate on me.</p><p>There had been some early rivalry between Buck and Kennedy, but I couldn\u2019t remember what it was. Something that happened when they were pledges. Would he harass me like this because of some grudge against my ex?</p><p>He might, if he thought he could get under Kennedy\u2019s skin by doing it.</p><p>I was going to have to tell Erin. She would be furious with me for keeping this to myself, and I dreaded her reaction, but I had no choice. Not anymore.</p><p>Me: I need to talk to you.</p><p>Erin: I need to talk to you too! Meet me in our room after your class.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, did you hook up with Buck last night?\u201d Erin hissed as the door to our room shut behind her.</p><p>I imagined I could feel the blood draining from my face. \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>She made a noise\u2014pshh. \u201cWhere did I not hear it? Why didn\u2019t you tell me this morning during astronomy? And why Buck of all people? I mean he\u2019s hot and all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d I swallowed with difficulty, and my eyes were filling. \u201cI didn\u2019t, Erin.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at my expression and crossed the room in three strides, grabbing my arms. \u201cJ, what\u2019s the matter? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I sunk onto my bed and she sat with me, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI... have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... I\u2019m listening...\u201d</p><p>Where to start? Last night? Two weeks ago?</p><p>\u201cWhen I left the Halloween party early\u2014a couple of weeks ago? Buck followed me.\u201d I chewed a loose piece of skin on my lip and knew it was bleeding. The taste of blood brought that night back more vividly and my face flushed hot. \u201cHe was drunk. He pushed me into my truck.\u201d I held myself rigidly, forcing the words out as her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d Her grip on my arm tightened.</p><p>\u201cHe was going to r-rape me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to?\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes. Licked the blood from my lip. \u201cLucas showed up out of nowhere. He stopped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking God.\u201d</p><p>In the silence that followed, I finally opened my eyes. Erin still gripped one of my arms as she stared at the worn carpet beneath our feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d The tears wouldn\u2019t stay dammed, though I felt sure I would run dry soon. The last time I cried\u2014before Kennedy broke up with me, before the past month\u2014had been over a year ago, when I fractured my femur snowboarding. Before that, when our old dog, Cissie, died.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, how can you\u2014of course I believe you! What kind of question is that?\u201d She glared at me, insulted. \u201cAnd by the way, why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me this before now? Because you didn\u2019t think I\u2019d believe you?\u201d Her lip quivered, transforming her expression from offended to injured.</p><p>\u201cChaz and Buck are best friends, and I thought I could just... avoid him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, this is exactly the sort of stuff women need to share with each other! I don\u2019t give a shit if he was drunk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>She sat, staring and silent.</p><p>\u201cLast night, he caught me in the stairwell.\u201d Erin\u2019s eyes grew round and I shook my head. \u201cNothing happened. I tricked him into coming upstairs by saying we could go to my room. When we got into the hallway, with other people around, I told him to leave.\u201d I covered my face with my hands and choked out the rest. \u201cHe made it sound like we\u2019d done it in the stairwell. Olivia heard him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture,\u201d Erin said, grabbing my hands. \u201cThat gossipy whore has no right to spread rumors about anyone. I don\u2019t care about her. But be honest with me, J. Did he hurt you? Did he?\u201d Her eyes flashed.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe just scared me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her forehead creased in thought, and then she straightened. \u201cWait. So that lying bastard ran into Lucas\u2019s fists multiple times, not a couple of homeless thugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The hurt crept across her face\u2014I could see it in her eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slid up and down, almost imperceptibly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was to put her arms around me. \u201cAnd Lucas? You knew him before all of this?\u201d</p><p>I leaned against her, tucked my head under her chin. \u201cNo. I\u2019d never seen him before that night. Our econ class is huge, and it\u2019s not like I was looking around at other guys. I had Kennedy.\u201d My hands flipped palm up on my lap. \u201cOr, I thought I did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Erin\u2019s arms tightened. \u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cDo you go to the tutoring sessions? I\u2019ve only been a couple of times, but I don\u2019t remember seeing you there.\u201d Benji\u2019s voice snapped my attention from Lucas.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled as I shoved my econ text into the backpack at my feet, embarrassed at having been caught sneaking a glance at Lucas. Again.</p><p>\u201cTutoring sessions? I wish I could, but I have another class at the same time. We\u2019ve emailed, though\u2014I needed help catching up, after my two-week hiatus from sanity.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I realized\u2014if Benji had attended the tutoring sessions, that meant he had seen Landon. I\u2019d also deduced, from a few deliberately transparent comments, that Benji was gay. So he might not be opposed to answering questions such as Exactly how hot is the econ tutor?</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been to a couple of sessions, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and I decided to start with something way more fundamental.</p> <p>\u201cIs there any chance the tutor is, you know, gay?\u201d I held my breath, waiting for his answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat, like I hand out a survey?\u201d He laughed when I blinked, worried I\u2019d just offended him. \u201cI\u2019m just messing with ya. I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t play for my team. Though if he did, he\u2019d be a little out of my league.\u201d He sucked in and patted his stomach, which was made somewhat flat by his efforts. \u201cNothing a couple of weeks at the gym and giving up bread for the weekend wouldn\u2019t take care of.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI love being a guy. Need to lose five pounds? Go without ketchup for a couple of weeks. Problem. Solved.\u201d</p><p>We shouldered our backpacks and trudged up the stairs. \u201cI really hate you right now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, more so when my eyes scanned the space between Lucas\u2019s seat and the door. He was gone. \u201cSo, you\u2019re trading emails and intense do-me stares in class. I\u2019m guessing you aren\u2019t the only girl\u2014or guy\u2014in Heller\u2019s class who thinks the tutor\u2019s hot like a spicy tamale\u2014but you may be the only one where the feeling is mutual.\u201d</p> <p>I heard his teasing words, but nothing registered after I made the connection that had been right in from of me. \u201cLucas... is the tutor?\u201d</p><p>Benji halted with me, both of us buffeted by people parting around us. \u201cI didn\u2019t know his name, but yeah\u2014holy shit.\u201d He dragged me from the heavy flow of foot traffic. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know he was the tutor?\u201d He smiled. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll be going to the sessions now, huh? I mean, technically, you\u2019re off-limits, but you aren\u2019t the only one in that staring game or I wouldn\u2019t tease you.\u201d He leaned his face down and looked into my eyes. \u201cJacqueline? What the hell?\u201d</p><p>I considered the emails he wrote to me as Landon, and Lucas\u2019s stares, his texts... and most notably, the sketching and makeout session five days ago. After which he hadn\u2019t texted. Or emailed. Or told me he was Landon!</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d Like I needed one more damned thing to make me feel like an utter idiot.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ms. Obvious, I sorta deduced that from your dazed and confused expression. Maybe he thought you knew?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe knew I didn\u2019t know.\u201d I frowned. \u201cAnd what do you mean, that I\u2019m off-limits?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder. \u201cMy roommate tutored freshman chemistry. Tutors have to attend the class they\u2019re doing sessions for, but they aren\u2019t allowed to, you know, fraternize with those students. Conflict of interest. Not as big of a deal as GTAs or professors\u2014who are advised against hooking up with any student at all. Still, it\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re all human.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the floor. \u201cAm I just completely freaking clueless? How did I not know?\u201d</p> <p>Benji tucked a finger under my chin. \u201cUm. I\u2019m getting the distinct feeling there\u2019s been some fraternizing going on.\u201d He sighed at the look on my face. \u201cLook, if you never attended a tutoring session, and neither of his alter egos told you he was the same guy, how were you supposed to know, exactly?\u201d</p><p>The tension in my shoulders deflated. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right. Now what?\u201d</p><p>My jaw locked. \u201cNo idea. But one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014I\u2019m not telling him I know.\u201d</p><p>Benji shook his head, one arm around my shoulders as we merged back into the stream of students. \u201cWhen I registered for econ, I had no idea that I\u2019d be in for this level of reality-show drama. It\u2019s like a big fat bonus.\u201d</p><p>Erin: I signed us up for a self-defense class</p><p>Me: What??</p><p>Erin: Put on by the campus po-po. Saturdays 9-noon, starts this week, skips the weekend after Thanksgiving, then 2 more.</p><p>Me: Okay.</p><p>Erin: We get to beat the shit outta guys in those big puffy suits!!! I\u2019ve always wanted to really kick the crap outta some guy\u2019s nuts. Now I can do it guilt-free!</p><p>Me: You\u2019re a sick girl.</p><p>Erin: Guilty as charged. :)</p><p>On Friday, I didn\u2019t look in Landon/Lucas\u2019s direction once. Not one single time. It had been a week since our university-prohibited makeout. Was that the pull for him? That I was forbidden fruit? I\u2019d show him forbidden.</p><p>When we were packing up, Benji looked over my shoulder, his eyebrows rising into the dark curls falling over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jackie.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy hadn\u2019t spoken to me in over a month, the last words between us involving a trite clich\u00e9 and the very textbook I was currently holding. I pulled a steadying breath through my nose and turned. \u201cKennedy.\u201d I waited, sure he had some reason to approach me, though I had no idea what it was.</p><p>\u201cAre you heading home for Thanksgiving? If so, we should carpool. You know, make that four-hour drive a little less monotonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to drive home... together?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and flicked his head to the side with a faintly dimpled smile. Kennedy tossing his hair out of his eyes was an arresting sight, and he damn well knew it. At the moment, though, it kind of pissed me off.</p><p>Benji cleared his throat and touched my elbow. \u201cSee ya Monday, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cHave a good weekend, Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>He winked at me and bumped by Kennedy without apology.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his deal?\u201d my ex scowled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you really want, Kennedy?\u201d I shifted my backpack and stared up at him, conflicted by my contradictory desires in that moment. I wanted to punch him in the face. I wanted to fall into his arms and wake up from the nightmare of him casting me aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like for us to be friends at the end of this. You mean a lot to me.\u201d The gentleness in his eyes was almost a physical caress. I\u2019d known him so well, and for so long.</p><p>This speech was unanticipated\u2014too much, too soon. My eyes teared up. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ever do that, Kennedy. And I don\u2019t want to drive home with you next week. Excuse me.\u201d I edged around him and started up the aisle to the door.</p><p>\u201cJackie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jacqueline,\u201d I said without turning, leaving him behind.</p><p>Landon,</p><p>I\u2019m sending this a little early, though of course I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019re sitting around on a Friday night waiting for economics projects to pour in. But I\u2019m going to be busy tomorrow morning, so I thought I\u2019d go ahead and send it.</p><p>Thank you again for looking it over before I turn it in.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>As a matter of fact, you\u2019ve distracted/saved me (temporarily, at least) from an infuriating search for a bug somewhere within hundreds of lines of code that doesn\u2019t quite work. I\u2019d much rather look over your econ project. I\u2019ll have it back to you by Sunday evening, if not sooner.</p><p>LM</p><p>I stared at the L of his signature, picturing him as the guy I knew he was\u2014Lucas. As Landon, his flirting had been subtle; as Lucas, it was overt. What game was he playing? I had no way of knowing if this situation was a first for him, or if he frequently stepped outside of those tutor-student boundaries. The night we met, that horrible night, he\u2019d known who I was. He\u2019d called me Jackie, the name he must have heard Kennedy call me. When I first emailed him for economics help, he must have known, too, but he gave me no hint.</p><p>According to the university\u2019s website, restrictions on socializing were to protect\u2014or prevent\u2014students from trading sexual favors for grades, or the appearance of such a thing. But Landon was helping me learn the material, and I was doing the work. When it came to my grade in Dr. Heller\u2019s class, there was nothing improper going on. He knew it. I knew it.</p><p>But even consensual fraternization, as Benji called it, was theoretically against the rules.</p><p>I could get Landon Maxfield in serious trouble. When he came to my room, I thought he was just another student in the class, and he\u2019d continued that deception.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed me, touched me, and I\u2019d let him. I\u2019d wanted him to.</p><p>I shut my laptop and stared at my phone. We\u2019d made out a week ago. Here, in my room. And hadn\u2019t texted me once since then. I wanted to know why.</p><p>Me: Did I do something wrong?</p><p>I waited several minutes, looking at photos on my phone\u2014many of which included Kennedy. I wondered if it was weakness that made it tough to delete them, or if I just wanted to keep the evidence that we\u2019d seemed in love\u2014that we\u2019d looked in love, even while it was all ending.</p><p>Lucas: No. Been busy. What\u2019s up?</p><p>Me: I guess you haven\u2019t had time to redo the sketches.</p><p>Lucas: Actually, I did one of them. I\u2019d like you to see it.</p><p>Me: I\u2019d like to see it. Is it tacked to your wall?</p><p>Lucas: Yes.</p><p>Lucas: Listen, I\u2019m out right now, ttyl?</p><p>Me: Sure</p><p>According to his email, he was working on what sounded like a huge CSE project, and according to his text, he was out partying. I had no idea which was true. I\u2019d believe he was blowing me off... except for this: I\u2019d like you to see it. I reread the text, opened my laptop and reread his email, but felt no closer to figuring him out.</p><p>Erin came storming into our room at 1:00 am, on her cell. \u201cYou know what? I think you don\u2019t respect my opinion about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, I was awake, watching online video clips of self-defense classes. Despite Erin\u2019s eagerness for nut-kicking and my own need to learn this stuff, the last thing I wanted to do in the morning was get up and go punch and kick some guy in a puffy suit. I couldn\u2019t see how that would correlate into getting away from someone like Buck. If I\u2019d have been able to break his grip on me either night, let alone kick him, I would have.</p><p>The door shut behind my clearly furious roommate as she flung her bag onto her bed, kicking off her heeled pumps. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t be with someone who\u2019s decided to stand behind a fucking rapist.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. I closed out of YouTube and pushed my laptop off my lap.</p><p>\u201cYes, Chaz, that\u2019s what I really think.\u201d She unbuttoned her white blouse so forcefully, I was sure she would rip off a button or two. \u201cFine. Think whatever you want. I\u2019m done.\u201d Punching her phone, she growled at it and tossed it on her bed before turning to me, yanking her shirt off. \u201cWell. I guess that\u2019s over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth agape, I sat, speechless, while she shoved her black skirt down over her hips and kicked it in the general direction of the laundry hamper. She slipped bracelets from her arms and removed her earrings, dropping them on a desk littered with jewelry, tarot cards, gum packets and paperback novels.</p><p>\u201cErin, did you just\u2014break up with Chaz? Over me?\u201d</p><p>She pulled on a t-shirt that fell to mid-thigh and clearly belonged to Chaz. Scowling, she ripped it back over her head, wadded it up and hurled it. \u201cNo. I broke up with Chaz because he\u2019s a fucking twat-headed jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJacqueline.\u201d She held up one palm like a traffic cop signaling stop. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. I broke up with Chaz because he proved what\u2019s important to him. \u2018Bros before hos.\u2019 Well fuck that. I won\u2019t come second to a bunch of his dumbass friends, and I certainly won\u2019t come second to some dickhead who\u2019s a walking affront to all women. Besides... it was never gonna be a permanent thing, right? Who does that in college anyway?\u201d</p><p>She spun around and rummaged through the top drawer of our tiny built-in wardrobe, ostensibly searching for a non-previously-Chaz-owned t-shirt. I heard one muffled sniff and knew she was crying. Damn Chaz. Damn Buck. Damn Lucas/Landon/whoever the hell he was.</p><p>The campus \u201cSelf-Defense for Women\u201d classes were held in one of the classrooms on the first floor of the activities building. We found the room and I tossed my coffee cup in the hallway trash can, Erin yawning after a sleepless night\u2014which I knew because her restless fidgeting and sniffling had kept me awake. Around 4:00 am, she\u2019d crawled into bed with me, curling into spoon position against me as I swept the hair back from her face. Mercifully, she\u2019d fallen asleep almost immediately, and I\u2019d followed suit.</p><p>\u201cHey. Isn\u2019t that\u2014?\u201d Erin spoke without moving her lips, like a ventriloquist. Clad in black sweat pants and a black t-shirt, Lucas stood at the front of the room with two older men.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hissed as we took our seats and I stared down at the packet of course material, the cover of which depicted a man attacking a woman who was poised to defend herself. \u201cErin, I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes you can,\u201d she countered, so quickly that she must have been anticipating my response.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, ladies.\u201d The smaller, older guy began, silencing any further protest from me. \u201cI\u2019m Ralph Watts, the Assistant Chief of Police on campus. This feeble-looking guy to my left is Sergeant Don, and the ugly one is Lucas, one of our parking enforcement officers.\u201d Everyone chuckled, as Don and Lucas were far from feeble or ugly. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that you\u2019ve given up a Saturday mornings to increase your knowledge of personal safety.\u201d</p><p>I snuck a look at Erin when she nudged me with her knee. \u201cParking enforcement officer? Jesus, how many jobs does he have?\u201d she mumbled from the side of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I mumbled back. She didn\u2019t even know about the tutoring job.</p><p>\u201cCould be hot...\u201d she whispered. \u201cEspecially if there\u2019s a uniform. Or handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p> <p>Glancing around the semi-circle of folding chairs, I noted that there were only about a dozen of us\u2014a mix of students, professors and administrative staff. The oldest was a white-headed black woman who had to be the age of my grandmother. I told myself that if she could come in here to learn how to kick potential rapist ass, so could I.</p><p>Even if Lucas was standing across the room, alternately staring at me and avoiding my eyes completely.</p><p>The first hour and a half, basic self-defense principles were discussed. Ralph told us that ninety percent of self-defense involves reducing the risk of attack in the first place. \u201cIn an ideal world, we could all go about our business without fear of being assaulted. Unfortunately, that ideal is not representative of reality.\u201d</p><p>My face heating, I recalled Lucas admonishing me for walking across the dark parking lot behind the frat house texting, instead of paying attention to my surroundings. I circled \u201c90%\u201d in blue ink until I\u2019d obscured the words on either side. But then I remembered the last thing he\u2019d said that night: It wasn\u2019t your fault.</p><p>We were encouraged to propose safety prevention suggestions, and write them all down\u2014locking doors, walking or exercising with a friend, wearing shoes that don\u2019t hinder running. Erin\u2019s suggestion of \u201cAvoid assholes\u201d was popular.</p><p>\u201cThree things are necessary for an assault: an assailant, a victim, and opportunity. Remove opportunity and you take a huge leap in reducing the likelihood of the assault.\u201d Ralph clapped his hands together once. \u201cAlrighty, let\u2019s take a short break, and when we come back, it\u2019s time to do some of the butt-kicking you ladies signed up to inflict on Don and Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cMany of you are probably convinced that without a weapon, you have no hope against an aggressive male.\u201d Ralph spoke from the opposite side of a set of mats on which Don and Lucas faced each other. The rest of us spread out along the outer edge of the mats, prepared to watch whatever they were about to do. Lucas still hadn\u2019t acknowledged my presence.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, you have several weapons at your disposal, and we\u2019re gonna show you how to utilize them to your best advantage. Big, mean Don here will be the assailant, and Lucas, with all that pretty hair, will be the intended victim.\u201d</p><p>Giggling erupted from several girls standing near Lucas as he pinned his lips together in good-natured irritation and raked his dark hair back out of his face.</p><p>\u201cYour weapons are your hands, feet, knees and elbows, and your head\u2014and I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s inside it, although that comes into play. Your forehead and the back of your head, when they come into contact with susceptible areas on your assailant, can leave him seeing stars.\u201d Using Don as an example, he pointed out the obvious vulnerable spots (\u201cYes,\u201d Erin hissed when he indicated the groin), and then the less obvious places, like the top of the foot and the forearm.</p><p>Ralph called out the moves Lucas employed to defend himself as he and Don acted out half a dozen choreographed attacks, time-lapsed to clearly demonstrate what they were doing. I felt more hopeless, not less, as I watched them. Lucas\u2019s muscular body was trained to execute those blocks and hits, to absorb blows from an assailant. I\u2019d watched him beat the crap out of Buck\u2014when I could barely dislodge him long enough to scream, let alone inflict any damage.</p><p>\u201cThe goal here is not to beat the guy up.\u201d Ralph smiled at Erin\u2019s disappointed grumble. \u201cOur objective is to give you time to escape. Gettin\u2019 the hell outta Dodge is your goal.\u201d</p><p>We divided into pairs to practice wrist blocks and parries. The three instructors circled the room, assisting and repositioning. I was relieved when Don walked up to watch Erin and me as we took turns trying to slow-motion slap each other. \u201cKeep your eyes on the assailant,\u201d he reminded me. He turned to Erin. \u201cPut a little more oomph into that attack. She can block it.\u201d</p><p>I was shocked to find he was right. Erin almost hit me the second time because I was so surprised I\u2019d completely blocked her first attempt.</p><p>Don nodded. \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>We smiled stupidly at each other and switched assailant and victim roles. \u201cSo when do we get to the junk-kicking?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>Don shook his head and sighed. \u201cI swear, there\u2019s one in every class. Kicks will be next time.\u201d He pointed at her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m makin\u2019 sure you\u2019re in Lucas\u2019s line for that.\u201d</p><p>She put on her innocent face. \u201cDon\u2019t y\u2019all wear those padded Michelin-man suits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes... but those pads don\u2019t block all feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh-heh,\u201d Erin said, and Don quirked one eyebrow at her.</p><p>I looked around the room during this exchange, watching Lucas with a couple of the giggly girls. \u201cLike this?\u201d one of them asked, blinking up at him like she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d positioned her hand incorrectly.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d He turned her palm around and adjusted her elbow. \u201cLike that.\u201d His voice was almost inaudible with all of the slapping, blocking and laughter scattered through the wide-open room. Even still, I felt his words like a soft stroke down my back. I could hardly connect this guy\u2014his shaggy hair, his tattoos, the pure sexuality in the way he walked and the low thrum of his voice\u2014with Landon, an engineering senior who said\u2014or wrote\u2014that my ex was a moron and teased me about 14-year-old orchestra students crushing on me. All while helping me pass a class I\u2019d have failed without him.</p><p>I was attracted to the whole of him\u2014each side incongruent with the other. But the whole of him was also a liar. The fact that our professor called him by a different name than the Assistant Chief of Police was perplexing, too. The preface of his official email address was LMaxfield. No help there.</p><p>He looked up and caught me staring, and for the first time that morning, neither of us looked away until Erin said, \u201cJ\u2014pay attention! Just try to slap me.\u201d I broke the stare and turned to her. She moved around to face me, her back to Lucas, and rolled her eyes. \u201cDoes the concept of playing hard-to-get totally escape you?\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet. Him. Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing that game any longer.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder and back. \u201cGirlfriend, I don\u2019t think he knows that.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>We practiced defensive stances and simple hand strikes, and though I felt silly at first, Erin and I were soon yelling, \u201cNO!\u201d along with our classmates, and shoving the heels of our hands into each other\u2019s chins or hammering a fist (very slowly) down onto each other\u2019s noses.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing today will be ground defense. We\u2019ll watch Don and Lucas illustrate the first position and defense, and then each pair come grab a mat and we\u2019ll circulate while you practice.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lay face down on the mat and Don knelt over him, holding him down with his weight. My heart rate spiked and my breaths came irregularly, just watching. I didn\u2019t want to be in that position again. I couldn\u2019t do it in front of a classroom of people. I couldn\u2019t do it in front of Lucas.</p><p>Erin uncurled my fist with her fingers and took my hand. \u201cJ, you\u2019ve gotta do this one. You be the attacker first. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s too much like\u2014\u201d I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why you\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d Before I said anything else, she squeezed my hand. \u201cHey, help me do it, okay? And then we\u2019ll see how you feel.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I helped Erin, but I could only stand to play the victim once. I did the moves\u2014and dislodged her fairly easily. As an ex-cheerleader, Erin was strong, but she was no Buck. I had no faith that this move would dislodge someone of his size and strength.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at Lucas\u2014not during this final exercise, and not as we filed out the door.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t wanna go? I could use you to keep me from testing those moves we learned this morning on Chaz, if he has the balls to show up at this party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked up from the novel I was reading, because Landon still hadn\u2019t sent my econ project back (funny how I continued to think of him in terms of Lucas and Landon), and I was weirdly caught up on homework. My roommate had never understood my compulsion to read when I had free time, especially if there were campus social events to attend. \u201cNo, Erin, I really don\u2019t want to go to a sorority thing, believe it or not. Not to mention the fact that no one would be thrilled to see me there.\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, she frowned down at me. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. But you\u2019re coming with me to the Brotherhood Bash in a couple of weeks, right? Bitches got nothing to say about me bringing you then\u2014frat rules apply\u2014additional booze and broads welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, what a sweet and not at all demeaning sentiment.\u201d</p><p>She laughed while she pulled on platform heels. \u201cI know, right? What a bunch of pricks.\u201d Her smile fell. \u201cSeriously, though, I could use a buffer between me and Chaz that night. Not that he\u2019ll, you know, bother me. But I know some girls who\u2019ve just been waiting for me to be out of the way. They\u2019ll be on him like ticks on a country dog, and I really don\u2019t wanna see it.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI understand\u2014and eww on that visual... though it\u2019s revoltingly appropriate. Can\u2019t you just skip the brotherhood thing? You could have the Asian Flu. Or Malaria. I\u2019ll vouch.\u201d</p><p>Tossing her hair over her shoulder, she grabbed her purse and walked to the door like a runway model\u2014not the slightest wobble. \u201cNope. It\u2019s a huge deal. Besides, I\u2019ve gotta face it sometime. Plus, I already RSVP\u2019d for us both. And I have a couple of weeks to mentally prepare for it.\u201d She yanked the door open. \u201cWe\u2019re going power shopping after break, though. I\u2019m gonna make that asshole gnaw his own hand off that night, dammit.\u201d</p><p>As the door shut behind her, my phone trilled a text alert.</p><p>Lucas: Do you still want to see the charcoal?</p><p>Me: Yes</p> <p>Lucas: Tonight?</p><p>Me: Ok</p><p>Lucas: I\u2019ll be outside your place in 10? Pull your hair back and wear something warm.</p><p>Me: You aren\u2019t bringing it over?</p><p>Lucas: I was bringing you to it. Unless you don\u2019t want to.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll come down, but I need 15 minutes.</p> <p>Lucas: I\u2019ll wait. No rush.</p><p>I tore around the room like an insane person, stripping off my flannel PJs and snatching a clean bra and panties from the clean-but-not-put-away laundry pile. Warm clothes... Sweats? No. Jeans. Black UGGs. The soft sapphire sweater that made Erin say, \u201cThat makes your eyes pop.\u201d After brushing my teeth, I brushed my hair and secured it at the nape\u2014though I wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Grabbing my black wool peacoat on the way out the door, I left the building by the main exit. I hadn\u2019t been in the stairwell since Buck caught me there, even when it meant extra steps.</p><p>Lucas was at the curb, leaning against a motorcycle, arms crossed over his chest. Along with his now-familiar boots and jeans, he wore a dark brown leather jacket that made his hair look black. Watching me with those light eyes, his gaze didn\u2019t waver from me, no matter the distracting Saturday night noises of residents coming and going. He didn\u2019t hide the unhurried top-to-bottom scan that left parts of me molten and longing for him to touch me like he had in my room.</p><p>Swallowing the lump in my throat, I reminded myself of his deception in a failing attempt to douse the desire spreading through me like lava\u2014slow-moving, heavy and hot. My trepidation about his motorcycle helped cool it to some degree. I\u2019d never been on one before, and couldn\u2019t say I\u2019d ever intended to change that fact. When I walked up to him, he held out an extra helmet.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is the reason for the hair guidelines,\u201d I said, taking the helmet and examining it hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYou can take it back down when we get to my place, if you want. I didn\u2019t figure you\u2019d want to stuff it under the helmet... or leave it loose and let it get all tangled on the ride.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, wondering if I needed to undo the straps completely or just loosen them.</p> <p>\u201cNever been on a bike before?\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Rona and Olivia exit the building behind a group of boys. Both girls stopped and stared at Lucas, and then me, while I pretended not to notice them. \u201cUm. No...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with that, then.\u201d</p><p>After I put my bag\u2019s strap over my head and settled it crosswise over my chest, he took the helmet and placed it on my head, securing the straps under my chin.</p><p>I felt like a bobblehead figurine.</p><p>Once we were both helmeted and on the bike, I reached my arms around him and clasped my hands over his abdomen, marveling at how firm it was.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he said, shoving the kickstand back. His suggestion was unnecessary as the engine roared to life\u2014I had a death grip on his torso, my entire front pressed securely against his back, my chin tucked and my eyes squeezed shut. I tried to imagine I was on a roller coaster\u2014perfectly safe and attached to a track instead of hurtling through the streets on a flimsy five hundred pounds or so of metal and rubber, hoping some drunk in an SUV wouldn\u2019t run a red light and flatten us.</p><p>The ride to his place\u2014an apartment over a detached garage\u2014took less than ten minutes. My hands were numb from the combination of the grasp each had on the other and the chilled November air rushing over them. As I stood rubbing them together, he parked the bike on a paved section between the garage and the open steps before turning and taking my hands in his, one at a time, and massaging warmth into them. \u201cI should have reminded you to wear gloves.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my hand from his and pointed to the house not more than fifty feet away. \u201cDo your parents live there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned to walk up the wooden stairway and I followed. \u201cI rent the apartment.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the door to a huge studio with a wall, but no door, defining what I assumed was the bedroom in the far right corner. A small open kitchen was on the left; a bathroom between the two. On the sofa, a huge orange tabby cat regarded me with characteristic feline apathy before hopping down and stalking to the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is Francis.\u201d Lucas opened the door and the tom wandered lazily outside, stopping on the landing to clean a paw.</p><p>I laughed, moving to the center of the room. \u201cFrancis? He looks more like a... Max. Or maybe a King.\u201d</p><p>He shut and locked the door, his ghost smile turning his mouth up on one side. \u201cTrust me, he\u2019s superior enough without a macho name to back it up.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his jacket off as he crossed the room to me, and I stared up at him, starting to unbutton my coat. \u201cNames are important,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded, dropping his eyes to my fingers. \u201cYes.\u201d I pushed the oversized buttons through the slits slowly, top to bottom, as though there was nothing beneath. Sliding his thumbs inside the lapels, he dragged the coat from my shoulders, his thumbs brushing down the arms of my sweater. \u201cSoft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cashmere.\u201d My voice was nearly breathless, and though I wanted to follow up on my statement about names, wanted to press him to tell me why he was misleading me, I couldn\u2019t jar the words from my throat.</p><p>The coat fell past my fingertips and he turned aside, tossed it on top of his jacket. \u201cI had an ulterior motive for bringing you here.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, he took my hands. \u201cI want to show you something, but I don\u2019t want to freak you out.\u201d He breathed a sigh. \u201cThis morning\u2014that last thing\u2014the ground defense...\u201d He watched me closely, and I tried to look away, anywhere but his eyes, because my face was burning, humiliated, but I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from his. \u201cI know you don\u2019t believe it would work. I want to show you it will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, show me?\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on mine. \u201cI want to teach you exactly how to execute it. Here. With no one else watching.\u201d</p><p>It was the replication of the position itself, but also the thought of him watching that had been so unnerving this morning, but he couldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Jacqueline. It works. Will you let me show you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He led me to the center of the floor space, pulled me down to my knees next to him. \u201cLie flat. On your stomach.\u201d Heart pounding, I obeyed. \u201cThe majority of men have no martial arts training whatsoever, so they won\u2019t be able to counter the moves correctly. And even those who do won\u2019t be expecting what you\u2019re going to do. Remember what Ralph said\u2014the key is to get away.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my cheek on the carpet, my heart slamming against the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the moves?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, shutting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I could tell you were freaking out in class. Your friend did the right thing, not forcing you. I don\u2019t want to force you, either. I just want to help you feel more in control.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find yourself in this position, you want to do these moves automatically, without wasting time or energy trying to buck him off.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened as his inadvertent use of Buck\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name. Buck.\u201d</p><p>I heard him inhale through his nose, like he was trying to maintain control. \u201cI will remember that.\u201d He was silent for a moment. \u201cThe first move seems counterproductive because it provides no leverage. But that\u2019s the thing\u2014you\u2019re taking his leverage away. Choose the side you want to roll onto, and put that arm straight up and out, like you\u2019re standing and reaching for the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>I put my left arm up as he described.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, with your opposite arm, you give yourself leverage, and you remove his already precarious balance. Palm flat on the ground, elbow up. Shove down and roll to your side, throwing him off.\u201d</p><p>I followed his instructions\u2014easy to do, with no weight on top of me.</p><p>\u201cCan we try it? I\u2019m going to push your shoulders down and use my weight to hold you there. If you have a problem, just say so and I\u2019m off. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I fought my panic. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His gentleness as he knelt over me, holding my shoulders to the floor, was so contrary to Buck\u2019s violence that I almost cried. He lay over me, his breath in my ear. \u201cArm straight up.\u201d I obeyed. \u201cPalm flat, and push off, hard, and roll onto your side.\u201d</p><p>I did as he said, and he tumbled off. \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s try it again.\u201d</p><p>We went through the moves again, and again, and again, and each time he was more forceful and harder to displace, but still, I threw him off, every time. Until I mistakenly pushed up with my hips, trying to rise.</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cThat won\u2019t work, Jacqueline\u2014though it\u2019s the natural response to something unwanted on top of you. The only sure way to dislodge a man in this position is rolling to the side. I\u2019m too strong for you to move me by pressing up. You have to fight that inclination.\u201d</p><p>Finally, we tried it more for real than any other time. He shoved me down, and my arm shot up and out, but I had a difficult time getting my hand free for leverage. Finally, I switched arms and got the opposite palm to the floor, shoved and rolled, throwing him off and to the side. \u201cShit!\u201d he laughed, facing me as we lay on the floor. \u201cYou swapped sides on me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled at his praise, and his gaze flicked to my lips.</p><p>\u201cThis is the part where you\u2019d get up and run like hell.\u201d His voice was gravelly.</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t he chase me?\u201d We lay on our sides, two feet of carpet between us, neither making a move to sit up.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe might. But most of these guys don\u2019t want challenging prey. Only a handful will go after you, if you run away screaming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, took my hand. \u201cI was supposed to show you your portrait, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it won\u2019t seem like you brought me here under completely false pretenses?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared and my breath caught. \u201cI do want you to see the charcoal, but I admit that was secondary to what we just did. Do you feel more confident now, that it\u2019ll work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned up on his elbow, closing the distance between us, pushing his hand into my hair and moving it to cup my face. \u201cI did have one other concealed motive for bringing you here.\u201d Leaning down slowly, his lips met mine and the fire that had been embers since he left my room over a week ago flamed. I opened my mouth and his tongue pressed inside, stroked mine and withdrew. Turning his head, he moved his mouth over mine, sucking my lower lip into his mouth, caressing it with his tongue and releasing it to pay attention to the upper. His tongue ran over the sensitive space above my top teeth and I gasped.</p><p>And then his hands started moving.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Cradling my head against his shoulder, both hands skimmed down to my hips, urging me closer until there was no space between us. His lips continued to move against mine, unrelenting and sweet, and my head swam as he swept his tongue through my mouth, his hand gripping my thigh, drawing it between his so that our legs were scissored together. I leaned into him and he moaned, one hand kneading my hip and the other stroking up beneath my sweater, warm fingers splayed across my lower back.</p><p>One of my arms crushed between us, I lay the other against his chest, fingering the front placket of his flannel shirt, covertly sliding buttons from buttonholes, feeling the variation between the smooth surface of the flannel and the bumpy texture of the thermal knit shirt beneath it. Shirt unbuttoned, I peeled it aside and slid my hand beneath the thermal to his hard stomach. His breath caught and I pulled away to lean on my elbow and look down on him.</p><p>\u201cI want to see your tattoos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do, huh?\u201d His eyes burned into mine. When I nodded, he withdrew his hand from beneath my sweater and sat up, crooking an eyebrow at me when he looked down on his unbuttoned shirt. My face warmed at his smirk and he chuckled, removing the shirt and tossing it aside.</p><p>Reaching behind his neck, he removed the white thermal the way boys do\u2014pulled forward over the back of his head\u2014unworried about ruined mascara, or blusher smeared on the fabric. He dropped this shirt, inside out, on top of the flannel one, and lay back on the floor, offering himself up for my inspection.</p><p>His skin was smooth and beautiful, his torso segmented with definitions of muscle and ornamented with the two tattoos I\u2019d seen in my dorm room\u2014an intricate octagonal design on his left side, and four scripted lines on his right. There was one other\u2014a rose over his heart, the petals dark red, the dark green stem slightly curved. On his arms were mostly designs and patterns, thin and black like wrought iron.</p><p>I ran my fingers over each one, but he didn\u2019t turn and I couldn\u2019t read the poem-like lines snaking around his left side. It looked like a love poem, and I was jealous of whoever inspired the sort of devotion he must have felt to make those words so permanent. I wondered if the rose represented her as well, but I couldn\u2019t ask.</p><p>When my fingers trailed down his abdomen to the line of hair below his navel, he sat up. \u201cYour turn, I think.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much.\u201d He stood and reached a hand down to me. \u201cWould you like to see the drawing now?\u201d</p><p>He was asking me to go to his bedroom. I felt like I should come back with something smart, like Should I call you Lucas or Landon in bed? but I couldn\u2019t manage it. I reached up and took his hand, and he pulled me up effortlessly. Without releasing my hand, he turned toward the bedroom, and I followed.</p> <p>Dim light from the outer room illuminated the furniture and the wall adjacent to his bed, where at least twenty or thirty drawings were tacked up. He switched on a lamp and I saw that the entire surface of the wall was covered in cork. I wondered if he\u2019d installed it, or if it was here, and when he went looking for a place to live, he knew immediately that this was meant to be his.</p><p>The two uncorked walls were painted an earthy taupe, and his furniture was dark and not at all typical college-boy\u2014from the queen-sized platform bed to the solid desk and hutch.</p><p>I moved into the narrow space between his bed and the wall of drawings, searching for myself, but distracted by the others\u2014renditions of familiar scenes like the downtown skyline, unfamiliar faces of children and old men, and a couple of Francis in repose.</p><p>\u201cThese are amazing.\u201d</p><p>He came to stand next to me just as my eyes found my own face amongst the others. He\u2019d chosen to charcoal the one of me on my back, looking up at him. Its placement was low on the right side of the wall. Seemingly, this display spot would indicate lower importance, but I was acutely aware of where it was located in relation to his bed\u2014directly across from his pillow.</p><p>Who wouldn\u2019t want to wake up to this? he\u2019d said.</p><p>I sat on his bed, staring at it, and he sat, too. I was abruptly aware of his bare chest, and his statement in the other room: Your turn, I think. Turning to him, I saw that he was watching me.</p><p>I\u2019d been so sure that this sort of moment would summon debilitating memories of Kennedy\u2014of his kiss, of our years together. But the truth was, I didn\u2019t miss him. I couldn\u2019t dredge up a single twinge of sorrow. I wondered if I was either anesthetized to the grief of losing him\u2014which would be worrisome\u2014or if I had cried so much and grieved so deeply in the past several weeks that I was over it. Over him.</p><p>Lucas leaned to me and the Kennedy bubble burst entirely. His breath in my ear, he ran his tongue along the curved edge, sucking the fleshy lobe and my small diamond stud into his mouth, and my eyes drifted closed while I babbled a weak sound of longing. Nuzzling my neck, he lapped gentle kisses down the side, his hand coming up to cradle the weight of my head, which had fallen to the side. His weight left the bed as he knelt on the floor and pulled my boots from my feet before resuming his seat and removing his own.</p><p>His lips played over mine, and he pulled me to the center of the bed and laid me flat. I opened my eyes when he drew back and stared down at me. \u201cSay stop, whenever you want to stop. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stop now?\u201d</p><p>My head moved back and forth on the pillow.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, his mouth returning to mine, his tongue plunging inside as I dug my fingers into his solid arms. I stroked his tongue with mine, sucking it deep into my mouth, and he groaned, wrenching away long enough to lift me slightly and remove my sweater. Teasing one fingertip over the swell of my breast, he followed the arc with his lips.</p><p>When I pushed against his shoulder he stopped, his eyes unfocused. I pushed him onto his back and straddled him, feeling him hard and ready through our two pairs of jeans. His hands smoothed up my waist and pulled me down, and we kissed deeply as I rocked against him. Minutes later, he flicked the hooks free at the back of my bra and tugged the straps down my arms. It wasn\u2019t off completely before he slid me higher and took a nipple in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I gasped, going limp in his arms.</p><p>We rolled again and I was under him, his hands tracing and circling, followed by his mouth. Then he unbuttoned my jeans and touched the zipper and everything crashed around me.</p><p>I tore my mouth from his. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d he panted, watching me.</p><p>I bit my lip and nodded.</p><p>\u201cStop everything, or just go no further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust... just no further,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He gathered me into his arms and kissed me, one hand tangled in my hair and the other caressing down my back, our hearts pulsing out a cadence that the musician in me translated into a concert of lust.</p><p>I kept my eyes open on the ride home. Peeking over Lucas\u2019s shoulder, I watched the scenery fly by\u2014and it was exhilarating, not frightening. I trusted him. I had since that first night, when I let him drive me home.</p><p>Kennedy would have never stopped like that. Not that he had ever forced me or come close to doing so. If I asked him to stop, he\u2019d stop and lay back, a hand over his face, calming himself and saying, \u201cGod, Jackie, you\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d After that, there was no further physical activity\u2014no kissing, no touching. And I always felt guilty.</p><p>I thought the guilt would go away once we were actually sleeping together, because it was rare when I\u2019d ask for a reprieve from sex, but if anything, my self-reproach was worse. He\u2019d stop, abruptly, like it pained him. It was all or nothing. He\u2019d take a few deep breaths, click on a game, or channel surf, or we\u2019d go get something to eat. And I would feel like the world\u2019s worst girlfriend.</p><p>Lucas had continued the make-out for another hour. Before it was over, he\u2019d slid his hand between my legs, over my jeans. \u201cThis okay?\u201d he asked, and at my breathless affirmative answer he stroked his fingers there while kissing me deeply, and somehow made me come through a layer of denim. I was shocked, and a little embarrassed, but one glance at his face told me he savored my body\u2019s response, and his ability to trigger it. He would not let me return the favor.</p><p>\u201cLeave me something to anticipate,\u201d he\u2019d whispered.</p><p>Now he was leaving me at the front of my building, wide awake from the cold drive, though he\u2019d placed my hands under his jacket during the ride, so they wouldn\u2019t be frozen. He put the helmets and his gloves aside and pulled me closer, his hands under my jacket, over my sweater. \u201cDid you like the charcoal?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes. Thank you for showing me your drawings... and the defense move.\u201d</p><p>Resting his forehead to mine, he closed his eyes. \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He kissed the tip of my nose, and then moved his lips to mine.</p><p>It almost hurt to kiss him\u2014almost. I sighed into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get inside before...\u201d He kissed me again, more hungrily, and I curled my hands between us against his hard chest.</p><p>\u201cBefore...?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and exhaled through his nose, his mouth a tight line, his hands gripping my waist. \u201cJust. Before.\u201d</p><p>I kissed the edge of his jaw and pulled away. \u201cGoodnight, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>He remained leaning against the Harley and watched me. \u201cGoodnight, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>I walked up the steps to my building, and not until I got to the door did I look up and see Kennedy standing there on the top step, his narrowed, curious eyes flicking between Lucas and me. \u201cJackie.\u201d He stared down at me as I stepped up next to him. \u201cI came by, thought we could talk. But Erin said you were out, and she wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be back at all?\u201d I\u2019d left Erin a scribbled note telling her where I was. She must have enjoyed rubbing my night out in Kennedy\u2019s face. He looked back toward the curb, but I didn\u2019t turn to see if Lucas was there or gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you text first? Or call?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, combing his hair back from his forehead with one hand, the other stuffed into the front pocket of his jeans. \u201cI was in the building.\u201d</p><p>I angled my head. \u201cYou were in the building, and thought you\u2019d just stop by and I\u2019d be in my room?\u201d I had planned to just be in my room, but that was beside the point.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t assume you\u2019d be there,\u201d he backpedaled. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d be there.\u201d He looked toward the curb again. \u201cIs... that guy waiting for you, or something?\u201d</p> <p>I turned then and saw Lucas, arms crossed over his chest, still leaning against his motorcycle. I couldn\u2019t make out his facial features from this distance, even with the flood lights surrounding the dorm. But his body language spoke volumes. I lifted a hand and waved, to let him know I wasn\u2019t being threatened. \u201cNo. He was just dropping me off.\u201d</p><p>After a smirk of disdain in Lucas\u2019s direction, Kennedy turned his sharp green eyes to me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look as though he understands the concept of \u2018dropping off,\u2019 if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t ask you. What do you want, Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>Some guy going inside called out, \u201cK-Moore!\u201d and Kennedy acknowledged him with a lifted chin before answering me. \u201cI told you, I want to talk.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, starting to feel the chill in the air I hadn\u2019t felt pressed to Lucas. \u201cAbout what? Haven\u2019t you said everything that needs to be said? Do you want to devalue me some more? Because I have to tell you, I\u2019m not real super amenable to that.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed as though tolerating some sort of distraught outburst, a familiar consequence of me being inflexible\u2014his word\u2014that I\u2019d seen many times in the past three years. I\u2019d forgotten about that until seeing it again. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be inflexible,\u201d he said then, as though reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cReally? I think there are plenty of reasons for my inflexibility. Or stubbornness. Or obstinacy. Or pigheadedness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, Jackie.\u201d</p><p>My hands made fists at my hips. \u201cIt\u2019s. Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, his eyes flaring. For a split second, I thought he was angry\u2014but that wasn\u2019t anger in his eyes. It was desire. \u201cI get it, Jacqueline. I hurt you. And I deserve everything you\u2019re saying, and everything you feel.\u201d He raised his hand to my face and I stepped back, out of his reach, my thoughts chaotic. Dropping his hand, he added, \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Snapping my mouth closed, I spun to swipe my card and enter the dorm, and Kennedy followed me through the door. I turned to tell him I didn\u2019t want to talk and saw Lucas grabbing the door just before it snapped shut. Stepping next to me, he glared at my ex and the air was charged between them the moment Kennedy turned and noticed him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Jacqueline?\u201d Lucas asked, his eyes never wavering from my ex.</p><p>\u201cLucas\u2014\u201d I started to reiterate verbally that Kennedy was no physical threat to me when he huffed an arrogant laugh, peering at Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014aren\u2019t you the maintenance guy? The one who repaired the A/C at the house?\u201d He glanced at me, and back to Lucas. \u201cWhat would administration think about you sniffing around the students?\u201d</p><p>The look on Lucas\u2019s face was murderous, but he held his ground without reaction, ignoring Kennedy\u2019s question as though it hadn\u2019t been asked. He turned his eyes to me, waiting for my answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I promise.\u201d I held my breath, hoping he\u2019d believe me. People near the door were already nudging each other and whispering.</p><p>\u201cAre you hooking up with this guy, too?\u201d Kennedy interjected.</p><p>\u201cToo?\u201d I asked, but I knew what he meant before he confirmed it.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to Buck.\u201d</p><p>The edges of my vision closed in. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kennedy took my arm just above the elbow, as though he meant to escort me away, and Lucas\u2019s hand shot out, grabbing his wrist and removing his hand from me easily.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Kennedy\u2019s voice was a low growl as he jerked his arm from Lucas\u2019s grip. He put himself slightly in front of me, facing off with Lucas, and everyone within sight of the developing spectacle was stock-still and gawking. The two of them looked evenly matched, but I knew Lucas\u2019s proficiency firsthand. Kennedy would lose, and Lucas would be expelled.</p><p>I stepped around my ex and laid a hand on his forearm. It was rock-hard beneath my fingers. \u201cKennedy, leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you with this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKennedy, leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a maintenance man, Jackie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a student, Kennedy.\u201d I decided not to point out that Lucas was in our econ class, in case he recognized him as the class tutor and reported him for going out with me.</p><p>Kennedy inclined his head, his expression transforming into concern\u2014slightly furrowed brow, eyes searching mine. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk next week. When we\u2019re home.\u201d His meaning was clear and directed at Lucas. The two of us were about to spend several days in our hometown, where he would have unrestricted access to me, without the nuisance of interference.</p><p>I wanted to tell him I had nothing to say to him, not now or then, but my jaw was clenched so tightly that I couldn\u2019t speak. Still unsure what I was even doing over Thanksgiving break, I ignored his implication that we would be alone then. Judiciously, he didn\u2019t try to touch me again, though his lethal expression matched Lucas\u2019s as they faced off. I didn\u2019t exhale until he went through the door.</p><p>Onlooker disappointment was palpable. A few hung around to see if there would be a bonus row between Lucas and me. The adrenaline was clearly still pumping through him\u2014his body was taut, like the hard wire of my bass strings, and when I reached a hand to his forearm, it was granite under layers of leather and flannel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, honest.\u201d I sighed heavily. \u201cWell, as okay as I can be after that.\u201d I squinted up at him. \u201cExactly how many jobs do you have, anyway? Barista, self-defense guru, fixit guy, parking enforcement officer\u2014and by the way, does that mean you gave me the ticket I got last spring for two measly minutes of double parking when I ran into the library to return a book?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed with my teasing tone, and I was rewarded with the ghost smile. \u201cI plead the fifth on that. I write a lot of parking tickets. The, um, fixit thing is rare. And I volunteer time for the self-defense gig.\u201d</p><p>What I\u2019d left off this list, and what he didn\u2019t add: economics tutor.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should add one more, huh?\u201d I said, watching him closely. He had a superb poker face. No reaction at all. \u201cPersonal defender of Jacqueline Wallace?\u201d</p><p>The faint smile appeared again.</p><p>\u201cAnother volunteer position, Lucas?\u201d I asked coyly, brows rising. \u201cHow will you have time for studying? Or anything fun?\u201d</p><p>His hands reached for me, gripping my hipbones and pulling me forward. He stared down at me, his voice low. \u201cThere are some things I will make time for, Jacqueline.\u201d Leaning, he kissed the spot just in front of my ear, the spot that made my breath go shallow. And then, he turned and jogged out to his motorcycle, leaving me standing in the entryway. Once he was outside the pool of light surrounding the building, I couldn\u2019t see him. I turned and walked to my room in a daze.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Your paper is good. Solid research. I think Dr. H will be pleased with it. I noted a couple of small inconsistencies, and one place you may have left out a citation. Other than that, I think it\u2019s a valid, well-supported argument.</p><p>I\u2019ve attached the worksheet for tomorrow\u2019s session. You\u2019re caught up now, and you seem to have a good grasp on the new material, but I\u2019ll continue to send you the worksheets for the last two weeks of class, if you\u2019d like.</p><p>I assume you\u2019re going home over the break? I\u2019ll be heading home Wednesday morning. No wifi there, so I\u2019ll be out of pocket until Sunday.</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p><p>Looks like I may get this paper turned in early\u2014what a relief. Thank you for your help. Yes, please continue to send the worksheets.</p><p>My parents are going skiing over break, but I\u2019d rather go home for a few days and hang out with old friends than stay here on campus. They\u2019ll be boarding Coco, Mom\u2019s evil-tempered little dog, so it should be peaceful and quiet.</p><p>Are you flying home? I remember you saying you were carless.</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Your parents are going skiing and not taking you? You\u2019ll be at home for Thanksgiving alone?</p><p>I\u2019m hitching a ride from someone with a car. Home isn\u2019t far, though it seems like another world at times.</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p><p>My parents thought I\u2019d be at my ex\u2019s. We\u2019ve traded off the last couple of years rather than trying to join both family meals; this was his year. My BFF\u2019s family will be at her grandparents\u2019 cabin outside Boulder, and I\u2019m not in the mood to burden anyone else.</p><p>I\u2019d rather be alone. That\u2019s weird, huh?</p><p>JW</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>Not weird to me. But maybe I\u2019m just weird, too, and I wouldn\u2019t know.</p><p>I\u2019ll miss your emails.</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p><p>Ditto. Have a good break.</p><p>JW</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look back at Lucas during class Monday without thinking about Saturday night. His hooded stares made me think he was having the same issue. After I caught him staring holes into the back of Kennedy\u2019s head, I didn\u2019t turn back around. When class ended, Kennedy turned and smiled at me. I forced my lips into a line and turned my back to him to pack up. This class, this semester could not end too soon, for too many reasons to count.</p><p>\u201cCan I just say\u2014your ex is gorgeous, but he seems like a conceited asshat.\u201d Benji crammed his spiral into a backpack that looked as though it could erupt with loose papers any moment.</p><p>I zipped my backpack. \u201cYeah, he totally is.\u201d We waited for Kennedy to pass before moving into the aisle, and I studiously avoided making eye contact. I was more than a little worried about his assertion that we would talk while we were both home; I couldn\u2019t imagine what he could have to say that I\u2019d want to hear.</p><p>Following our classmates up the steps, everyone animated with anticipation of the coming long weekend, Benji told me he\u2019d be flying home to Georgia and coming out to his father\u2014the only member of his family he hadn\u2019t told. \u201cMom\u2019s known I was gay since I was thirteen.\u201d</p><p>I was worried on his behalf. \u201cWill your dad be... upset?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI think he knows. He\u2019s just not sure if that means I\u2019m going to show up in a dress or something.\u201d The thought of Benji in a dress wasn\u2019t a pretty picture, and I couldn\u2019t hold back my laugh. He laughed too, adding, \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>Lucas was gone, or so I thought, until Benji and I emerged into the busy hallway and I spotted him leaning on the far wall, near the side door I usually took to escape the building. He watched us approach, but he seemed acutely aware of everyone else as well. I imagined him watching for Dr. Heller. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him you know yet, have you?\u201d Benji asked, speaking from the side of his mouth.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make him suffer too much. He looks sorta vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cRight. A tough, muscular guy like that\u2014who\u2019s trained to beat people up, and lies about who he is to girls\u2014is so vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>He squeezed my arm just above the elbow and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s either an asshat to rival all asshats before him, or there\u2019s a reason for those lies.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI wish I was a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not, once you know what\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever do.\u201d</p><p>Benji shrugged in agreement and veered off toward the long hallway leading to the south exit, turning to call, \u201cHave a good break, Jacqueline.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>I reached Lucas and he turned to follow me, leaning close to push the door open. \u201cCan I see you tonight?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I wondered if I was turning into a booty call. Or if that\u2019s all it had ever been to him\u2014if that was his reason for not telling me he was Landon Maxfield. \u201cI have a test tomorrow in astronomy. We have study group in our room tonight.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at him, walking beside me with his hands stuffed into the front pockets of his jeans. His gaze continuously scanned over the crowd of people, as though he was on guard.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d He stared down at me as we neared the building, and I noted that he seemed to know exactly where I was going.</p><p>\u201cI have an ensemble rehearsal tomorrow. I usually spend Sunday mornings in the music hall, but I missed yesterday.\u201d I hadn\u2019t told Lucas I played the bass. I\u2019d told Landon.</p> <p>\u201cYou slept in?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>We reached the entry and stopped to the side of the door. \u201cI have to get my bass packed up, too, since I\u2019m taking it home with me.\u201d Waiting to see if he\u2019d react, I watched his eyes, which matched the gray-blue of the overcast sky as his gaze drifted over the faces around us. \u201cI\u2019ll have plenty of time to rehearse during break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you leaving town?\u201d He flicked his hair from his eyes, avoiding the subject of my instrument completely.</p><p>\u201cWednesday morning. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d He shifted, on edge, his lower lip caught between his teeth, and then all of a sudden, he settled and stilled. His eyes met mine, unwavering. \u201cText me if you\u2019re done early. Or your plans change. Otherwise, I\u2019ll catch you after break.\u201d He hitched the shoulder over which his backpack was slung and added, \u201cLater, Jacqueline,\u201d before turning and blending into the flow of students, his dark head rising above most of them.</p><p>\u201cHold up. So tutor-guy Landon and hottie OBBP Lucas are the same guy?\u201d Maggie\u2019s eyes were so rounded with shock that I could see white all the way around her light brown irises.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you didn\u2019t call him on that shit immediately.\u201d Erin had her talk-show-participant face on. Any moment, she would call me girrrrl and start recounting the ass-kicking she\u2019d be doing if she was in my shoes. Ever since she\u2019d broken up with Chaz, she was much less tolerant of guys stepping out of line. Or appearing to.</p><p>I huffed a sigh and wished I\u2019d never told them. \u201cWhat happened to gag-him-and-bag him and rebound and operation bad boy phase?\u201d The three of us sat on a comforter in the floor of the dorm room, drinking coffee and eating Oreos, astronomy texts and notes spread all around us, untouched for the last half hour as we discussed Landon/Lucas instead of gas giants and celestial navigation.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be your booty call. Not the other way around.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice resonated with authority.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Maggie chimed in. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you text him that you want to meet up later?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cBecause I have an exam at 9:30 in the morning\u2014which we\u2019re supposed to be studying for right now. And also, I think I need a little distance...\u201d</p><p>Erin peered at me. \u201cOh hell no\u2014you\u2019re getting emotionally involved, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I lay back with my hands covering my face. \u201cUghhhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way\u2014speaking of booty calls, what\u2019s this I hear about you and Buck? He\u2019s definitely bad boy material,\u201d Maggie mused. \u201cDid you add him to the OBBP stable without telling us?\u201d</p><p>I gave Erin a pleading look between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cBuck\u2019s full of shit. You know that, Maggie,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>Maggie nodded. \u201cTrue... Plus, I messed around with him freshman year. He wasn\u2019t very good, from what I recall. Too slobbery.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cWhat is it with slobbery kissers? Are they trying to drown us in spit? I mean, Jesus, swallow every now and then.\u201d</p><p>Her hand squeezing my shoulder, Erin laughed, and while I could hear the contrived ring to it, Maggie didn\u2019t. I knew where Erin\u2019s mind was going. I hadn\u2019t given her many details, and she\u2019d not asked for any. It was difficult enough to speak about that night in generalities. The point was what had happened, and what had almost happened, not the particulars of it.</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t hooking up with him?\u201d Maggie pressed. She was only curious, but it rankled to have my name joined with Buck\u2019s in any way.</p><p>\u201cLike Erin said\u2014he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d I was curious myself. Morbidly so, perhaps. \u201cWhy? Is he saying something about me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cTrisha said her little sister\u2019s boyfriend said Buck was hassling Kennedy about it. Those two are like those big goats that butt heads over the girl goats. I think Buck\u2019s still pissed that he was legacy and Kennedy still beat him out for pledge class president.\u201d</p><p>That was the complication I couldn\u2019t remember before\u2014the all-important initial conflict between them. The start of their weird brotherly rivalry. I frowned. \u201cBut Kennedy was legacy, too.\u201d</p><p>Maggie licked Oreo crumbs from her fingers. \u201cYeah, but Buck was legacy and his daddy was pledge class prez. He thought he had it wrapped up.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, becoming furious as Buck\u2019s motivations became clearer. His reasons for hurting me were nothing more than goading my ex. \u201cAnd that translates into the need for Buck to spread lies that I\u2019m screwing him?\u201d Not to mention the fact that he\u2019d actually assaulted me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it made any sense.\u201d</p><p>Erin pulled her notes onto her lap. \u201cOkay ladies, which constellations do we think we\u2019ll have to plot on the star chart portion of this test?\u201d</p><p>Giving my best friend a grateful look for the change of subject, I shoved thoughts of Buck as far away from my consciousness as I could manage to do.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>After three months away, the house smelled funny. Like dog... combined with the Chanel cologne Mom always wore, plus some other undefinable scent that my mind classified as home. Even still, it was foreign. I didn\u2019t quite belong here anymore, and my body knew it.</p><p>I lugged my bass inside, still nestled safely within its wheeled traveling case. With no parents and no Coco, there was little reason to move it any further than the living room. I parked it against the wall, where it stood like another piece of furniture. The lights in the house were timer-set, since Mom and Dad were gone. I decided to let them go on and off at will, with the exception of the kitchen lighting and the lamps in my bedroom, which probably wouldn\u2019t come on at all otherwise.</p><p>There was food in the pantry and freezer, but barely anything in the fridge. My parents had cleared out all of the perishable stuff before their trip, not knowing I was coming home tonight, since I never told them. Mom texted me earlier that they were boarding their plane, adding: Have fun with Erin. We\u2019ll see you next month. Having never double-checked my plans, she\u2019d somehow come to the conclusion that I was going home with my roommate.</p><p>I heated a box of organic vegetarian lasagna for dinner, and transferred a ground turkey patty from the freezer to the fridge for my Thanksgiving lunch. There was half a package of tater tots in the freezer, too, and I found an unopened bottle of cranberry cocktail in the pantry. I moved it to the fridge. Tah-dah! Thanksgiving for one.</p><p>After watching a couple of sitcom reruns, I switched the television off, scooted the walnut coffee table from its perfectly-centered spot on the hand-knotted Tibetan rug, and unpacked my bass. Improvising with a plant stand when I couldn\u2019t find my music stand, I ran through the beginnings of a pr\u00e9lude piece I\u2019d begun composing for my year-end solo.</p><p>The last thing I expected to hear while scribbling notes onto staff paper was the doorbell. I\u2019d never been afraid to be at home alone, but then I\u2019d never been so completely alone here before. I debated pretending no one was home, but of course whoever was there had heard me playing, and heard me quit. I lay the bass on its side and crept to the solid door, standing on my toes to look through the peephole. Kennedy stood, smiling straight at me, illuminated by the glow of the dual lights of the veranda. He couldn\u2019t see me, of course, but he\u2019d answered this door many times and knew the view from the inside almost as well as I did.</p><p>I unlocked and opened the door, but didn\u2019t move from the doorway. \u201cKennedy? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He glanced behind me and heard the utter quiet of the house. \u201cAre your parents out?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThey aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAren\u2019t here tonight, or aren\u2019t here over break?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten how readily Kennedy could zero in on what wasn\u2019t said. That characteristic probably accounted for most of his debate wins. \u201cThey aren\u2019t here at all\u2014but why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He leaned a shoulder into the door frame. \u201cI texted first but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d I probably hadn\u2019t heard the text alert. Little could be heard over the sound of my bass, once I began playing. \u201cDuring dinner, Mom reminded me to make sure I had you over by 1:00 tomorrow\u2014and yes, that means I never told them we broke up. I started to tonight, and then I thought this might be a welcome escape from Evelyn and Trent. Where are they, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I ignored his question. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that he said we broke up as though our breakup was a mutual decision. As though I hadn\u2019t been the blindsided idiot of the equation.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come to Thanksgiving lunch and pretend we\u2019re all fine, just so you don\u2019t have to tell your parents we broke up?\u201d</p><p>He smiled just enough to make the dimple appear. \u201cI\u2019m not that big of a coward. I can tell them if you want, and say I\u2019ve invited you to come as a friend. But we don\u2019t have to disclose anything to them, if you don\u2019t want to. Trust me, they\u2019re too oblivious to pick up on anything. My little bro\u2019s had a weed habit for over a year\u2014parties so hard he\u2019d put most of the brotherhood to shame, and they have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about him?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHis grades are still decent. He\u2019s just bored. Besides, he\u2019s not my kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your little brother.\u201d I only understood sibling relationships in theory, since I\u2019d never had one, but I assumed logic would dictate some sense of responsibility. Kennedy seemed to feel none. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to anything I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because he never has. C\u2019mon. Come tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up right before 1:00. It\u2019ll be better than... whatever frozen thing you\u2019d planned to microwave?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and he chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t tell them. It\u2019s been over a month.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because I know how much my family loves you.\u201d That was bullshit. I raised an eyebrow and he laughed. \u201cOkay, well they were used to you\u2014used to us. I guess you told your parents?\u201d</p><p>I curled my toes into the cold marble floor, the chill from outside seeping into the entryway. \u201cI told Mom. I assume she told Dad. They seemed vaguely annoyed, though I don\u2019t know if the annoyance was directed at you for dumping me or me for not managing to hold onto you.\u201d I wanted to pinch myself for the dejected words that made it sound as though I was pining for him.</p><p>In actuality, Mom and I had revisited the quarrel we had when I first told her my college plans. She hadn\u2019t approved, claiming that smart girls forge their own educational paths; they don\u2019t follow their high school boyfriends to college. \u201cBut do what you like. You always have,\u201d she\u2019d said, stalking from my room. We\u2019d not discussed it again until Kennedy broke up with me.</p><p>\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t do any good now to point out that I was right about him,\u201d she\u2019d sighed over the phone. \u201cAnd your ill-advised decision to follow him there.\u201d</p> <p>Whenever I appeared to have won an argument, Mom would say something like, \u201cEven broken clocks are right twice a day.\u201d I\u2019d tossed this bit of wisdom back in her face, and just like she had when I announced my college plans, she\u2019d heaved a sigh like I was hopelessly clueless and dropped the subject. Little did she know that in that moment, I agreed with her completely, for once. Following my boyfriend to State was possibly the most dimwitted thing I\u2019d ever done.</p><p>Kennedy stood with his thumbs hooked through his belt loops, looking contrite. \u201cI assume you don\u2019t have plans to have Thanksgiving supper with Dahlia\u2019s family, or Jillian\u2019s, or you\u2019d have already said so.\u201d</p><p>Preferring to wait until the holiday festivities were over, I\u2019d not yet called my high school friends to let them know I was home. Jillian had flunked out of LSU at the end of freshman year, after which she\u2019d moved home to train for management at Forever 21 and get engaged to some guy who managed a mall jewelry store. Dahlia was in the second year of her nursing program in Oklahoma. We\u2019d all grown apart since graduation. It was odd, how unconnected I felt to each of them now, when we\u2019d been joined at the hip for four years of high school.</p><p>Now Dahlia had her nursing undergrad crowd in a neighboring state, and Jillian had a blue stripe in her hair, a full-time job and a fianc\u00e9. Both were shocked when Kennedy and I broke up. They were among the first to text and call, commiserating\u2014or trying to, even though we hadn\u2019t been close in over a year. I hoped we could hang out and hopefully not discuss Kennedy ad nauseum.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have plans with anyone. I thought it would be nice to be home alone.\u201d I emphasized the last word, staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here all by yourself on Thanksgiving.\u201d</p> <p>I hated the pity underlying his assumption, and I glared up at him. \u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>The dark green of his eyes scanned over my face. \u201cYes, you can,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for you to. We can be friends, right? You\u2019ll always be important to me. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I so didn\u2019t know that. But if I said no, if I insisted on staying at my parents\u2019 house alone and eating a microwaved turkey patty for Thanksgiving, it would look like I couldn\u2019t get over him. Like I was so damaged that I couldn\u2019t be around him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, almost instantly regretting it.</p><p>\u201cSo are you and my dickwad brother back together, or what?\u201d Carter asked, under his breath.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t so big, Carter would have been a carbon copy of his older brother\u2014same green eyes and mop of dirty blond hair. But where Kennedy was tall and lean, Carter had sprouted to an equal height, but with the girth and muscle of a running back. Having known him since he was a wiry fourteen-year-old\u2014when Kennedy still towered over him\u2014his transformation was mind-boggling. I remembered him as a quiet, scowling boy, eclipsed by his older brother. He was clearly done with that phase.</p><p>I glanced behind us as we set the table, relieved that no one else was within earshot. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He followed behind me, placing forks on top of the napkins I\u2019d folded. \u201cToo bad for him.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened a bit at this, and when I looked at him, he smirked. \u201cWhat? Anyone can see you\u2019re too good for him. So why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks. And my parents went to Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>He recoiled, astonished. \u201cFuck, are you serious? And I thought my parents were the biggest assholes in this town.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but grin, though I curbed it as much as possible. Carter had always seemed unmanageable and emotional next to the rest of his logical, coolheaded family. I\u2019d never considered what an outsider he must have felt like with them\u2014the impetuous middle child between Kennedy and his little sister, Reagan, who gave the impression that she\u2019d been born a thirty-year-old accountant.</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Carter,\u201d Kennedy said, rounding the corner.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kennedy.\u201d Carter retorted, not missing a beat.</p><p>Fully containing my reaction was impossible. My jaw was like rock in the attempt, but a small snort escaped, which earned a big, full-wattage grin from Carter. He winked at me before scooting off to the kitchen to help his mother. I blinked, imagining that the poor girls at my former high school must collapse against the lockers when he sauntered past.</p><p>Kennedy was scowling.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to \u2018he\u2019s not my kid\u2019?\u201d I asked, placing the last spoon before turning to him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to berate him for dropping the F-bomb, but you wash your hands of helping him kick an alleged drug problem?\u201d I was definitely asking for it. Debating with Kennedy was unwinnable.</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>I blinked again, thinking that the Moore boys were going to shock me to death by the time I left town.</p><p>Grant and Bev Moore were as oblivious as Kennedy had promised. They didn\u2019t seem to detect the strained air between their son and me in the four hours I spent with them, or the absence of our usual PDA. He didn\u2019t sling an arm across the back of my chair during the meal, and though he pushed my chair in when I sat\u2014as he\u2019d been raised to do\u2014he didn\u2019t kiss my cheek or take my hand. When Reagan narrowed her sharp thirteen-year-old eyes on us, I pretended not to notice her scrutiny. Carter, of course, leered and flirted with me outrageously, trying to make me laugh and piss his brother off. He succeeded on both counts while their parents discerned nothing.</p><p>Not touching except for the press of his leg against mine, Kennedy and I sat side-by-side through a football game on the wall-sized flatscreen that made Carter so furious he stood up and cursed at the screen a couple of times, for which his entire family\u2014all four of them\u2014calmly rebuked him. The second time, he stomped from the room and was gone for several minutes. From the way he flexed his hand when he returned, I got the feeling he went to his bedroom and hit something.</p><p>As soon as Kennedy pulled into my driveway to drop me off, I hopped out of the car, thanking him for inviting me and making it clear that I was going inside alone. He smiled tightly. \u201cWe should hang out Saturday. I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d Thankfully, he made no move to exit the car.</p><p>As though he\u2019d not suggested anything, I thanked him again and said goodbye. Once inside, I watched him from a curtained window. He stared pensively at the closed front door for a minute before pulling out his phone and calling someone as he backed out of the drive.</p><p>After making Friday night plans with Dahlia and Jillian, I practiced my bass in the living room until the timer-set lamp clicked off just before 11 pm. Chuckling into the darkness, I propped my instrument against the wall by feel, and placed the bow on a shelf of a nearby bookcase. My phone lit up on the plant stand, signaling a message, and I stood in the dark, reading and answering.</p><p>Lucas: When will you be back on campus?</p><p>Me: Probably Sunday. You?</p><p>Lucas: Saturday.</p><p>Me: Family drama?</p><p>Lucas: No. My ride needs to go back then.</p><p>Lucas: Let me know if you\u2019re back early. I want to see you.</p><p>Lucas: I need to sketch you again.</p><p>Me: Oh?</p><p>Lucas: I\u2019ve done a couple from memory but they aren\u2019t the same.</p><p>Lucas: Can\u2019t quite get the shape of your jaw. The line of your neck.</p><p>Lucas: And your lips. I need to spend more time staring at them and less time tasting them.</p><p>Me: I can\u2019t say I agree with that notion.</p><p>Lucas: More of both, then. Text me when you get back.</p><p>Okay, so sleeping was out.</p><p>I reread the text while stealthy recollections of his lips on mine curled through me, igniting small flames of desire that grew and fused as my memories of Saturday night replayed in graphic detail. Standing in the dark, I closed my eyes.</p><p>I should be fuming or at least distrustful where Lucas/Landon was concerned, but having tried to work up some outrage over his sin of omission, I simply couldn\u2019t. I reasoned that I was on resentment overload between Kennedy and Buck, and in comparison, Lucas seemed more a riddle than a risk. My plan for him, after all, had been to use him as a rebound, Operation Bad Boy Phase, and it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d been fully forthcoming about that.</p><p>Attempting to get a handle on my volatile musings, I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and walked upstairs to my bedroom, the only room still lit in the whole house.</p><p>When I checked my email, I saw there was one from LMaxfield amidst the credit offers and listserv info, and my heart rate jumped. He\u2019d sent it this afternoon, hours before our text exchange. Away from school, I was beginning to connect my tutor with Lucas\u2014the Lucas who spoke to me from behind this Landon alias. I wanted to know why, but I didn\u2019t want to ask\u2014I wanted him to tell me.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>I discovered that the Bait &amp; Tackle has added coffee and wifi, along with a new name promoting these innovative features. Joe (the proprietor) didn\u2019t bother to make up a whole new sign\u2014he just affixed a whitewashed board to the ancient original. Now the hand-painted sign(s) read(s): Bait &amp; Tackle &amp; Coffee, and under \u201cCoffee\u201d it says \u201c&amp; wifi.\u201d</p><p>They have three tiny tables and a couple of lumpy, floral overstuffed chairs\u2014like a Starbucks, if it had been decorated with yard sale furniture from someone\u2019s grandmother. It\u2019s the only place in town that\u2019s open today, so it\u2019s packed. The coffee\u2019s actually not horrible, but that\u2019s the best recommendation I can honestly give it. And predictably, the whole place smells like fish, which sort of detracts from the intended bistro ambiance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did your day go as planned?</p><p>You\u2019re locking and alarming your house every night, right? I don\u2019t mean to be insulting, but you said you were going to be home alone.</p><p>LM</p><p>Landon,</p> <p>Yes, I\u2019m amply skilled in locking up at night. The state-of-the-art alarm system is fully engaged. (And I\u2019m not insulted. I appreciate the concern.)</p><p>I spent the day at my ex\u2019s. His parents have no idea we\u2019re broken up\u2014he never told them, for some reason. It was awkward. I don\u2019t know why I let him talk me into going. He wants to see me Saturday to \u201ctalk.\u201d I may go back to campus early. I haven\u2019t decided yet.</p><p>I\u2019m seeing friends tomorrow, so that should be more fun.</p><p>What about your family? What did you do?</p><p>JW</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t be sure when he\u2019d get my answer, since he\u2019d need the Bait &amp; Tackle &amp; Coffee\u2019s wifi to sign on. After a restless night\u2014one that crawled by, leaving me more exhausted than I started\u2014I made coffee and signed into to my school email. Unsurprisingly, there was nothing new from LMaxfield in my inbox. I thought about texting Lucas, but what would I say? That I\u2019d tossed and turned all night, thinking of his hands on me?</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>When I stopped for gas halfway back to campus, I sent Kennedy a text telling him I\u2019d decided to go back early.</p><p>My phone rang before I even pulled back onto the interstate. Kennedy. I took a deep breath and switched off the stereo before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already left? I thought you were leaving tomorrow. I thought we were going to talk tonight.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, wanting to bang my head on the steering wheel, which wasn\u2019t the best idea while driving seventy miles an hour. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what it is you want to talk about, Kennedy.\u201d I wondered if he\u2019d been blind to how many times I\u2019d been ready and willing to talk, and the multitude of chances he\u2019d carelessly ignored.</p> <p>\u201cI think I made a mistake, Jackie.\u201d Misinterpreting my stunned silence, he added, \u201cI mean Jacqueline. Sorry, I think that\u2019s going to take me a while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. Breaking up.\u201d</p><p>I was silent again, the words sticking as I tried to take them in, gulp them down. I\u2019d avoided campus gossip as much as possible, but I\u2019d heard and seen enough to know that Kennedy had been no saint in the weeks we\u2019d spent apart. He\u2019d also had no shortage of willing participants. But girls willing to share your bed don\u2019t equal girls willing to put up with your random crap moods, listen to your exhaustive legal opinions, or support your life\u2019s goals the way someone who loves you would. No\u2014that had been my role. And I\u2019d been dismissed from it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and I imagined what I knew he was doing\u2014staring up at the ceiling, combing his hair back from his forehead and leaving his hand there, elbow bent. He couldn\u2019t hide habitual mannerisms from me, even on the phone. \u201cWhy did I make a mistake, or why do I think it was a mistake?\u201d I knew, too, that answering a question with a question was his way of buying time while he reasoned his way out of a problematic situation. \u201cThis conversation would have been easier in person\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were together almost three years, and you just broke up with me\u2014without even\u2014there wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I was sputtering. I stopped and took a deep breath. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d He had the nerve to sound hurt.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I snapped. \u201cMaybe the same way you so easily broke it off in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackie\u2014\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground together. \u201cDon\u2019t. Call. Me. That.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, and all I heard was road noise as my truck ate the miles of nothing between the last town and the next. Most of the fields on either side of the road were inactive, given the time of year, but a huge green picker was making its way through one cotton field, and I stared at it. No matter what happened to any individual person, life was going on elsewhere. The first time Kennedy kissed me, it stood to reason that at the same time, other people were splitting up. And the night Kennedy broke my heart, somewhere\u2014maybe right there in my dorm, other people were falling in love.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline. I don\u2019t know what you want me to say.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of seconds, I\u2019d passed through a town that boasted a sizable outlet mall and little else. Every mile took me farther from Kennedy. Closer to Lucas. I was unsettled by the notion that Lucas was someone to go to, before realizing that he\u2019d been that safety zone for me from the moment we met.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to say anything.\u201d</p><p>My ex had the sense to know when he\u2019d reached a deadlock. He thanked me for coming Thursday and said he\u2019d be in touch once he got back to campus, which I didn\u2019t acknowledge.</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>It sounds like he wants you back, or at least, he wants something more than friendship. The question is, what do you want?</p><p>My family is just my dad and me. We had old friends over for Thanksgiving Day, so he was more conversational than he would have been otherwise. When it\u2019s just the two of us in that house, we tend to go hours without speaking. If you don\u2019t count \u201cexcuse me\u201d and \u201cpass the salt\u201d sorts of things, the silence can encompass whole days.</p><p>Dad owns a charter fishing boat. Not much going on this time of year in the bay, though he arranges deep-sea fishing trips or native bird-watching tours over the winter. He\u2019d scheduled one for today, so we said our goodbyes at 5am, and here I am, back at my place just after noon.</p><p>LM</p><p>Lucas was ten minutes from me. I wrestled with the urge to text him and tell him I was back, too. I knew I wouldn\u2019t win this battle for long.</p><p>I unpacked and did laundry. The machines on our floor were easy-access while there were so few of us back, but that wouldn\u2019t be the case tomorrow, when everyone returned. I\u2019d been choosing laundry times that didn\u2019t require me to go up or down. Avoiding the stairwell altogether had become one of my quirks. I wouldn\u2019t go into it at all, even in a group. My subterfuge worked with everyone but Erin, who eyed me closely the second time I used, \u201cI forgot something in my room\u2014I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>One night, she asked me outright, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid to go into the stairwell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I was painting my toenails blood red, and I stared at the tiny brush and tried to keep my hand from shaking. Start at the cuticle, sweep up. Start at the cuticle, sweep up. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>The next time, it was Erin saying, \u201cOh crap, I left my purse in my room. J, come let me in, would ya?\u201d Turning to the others, she said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll meet y\u2019all downstairs in five.\u201d</p><p>Me: I\u2019m back.</p><p>Lucas: I didn\u2019t think you were coming back until tomorrow.</p><p>Me: I changed my mind.</p><p>Lucas: So I see. Free tonight?</p><p>Me: Yes.</p><p>Lucas: Dinner?</p><p>Me: Yes.</p><p>Lucas: I\u2019ll pick you up at 7.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a guy cook for me before.\u201d</p><p>He smiled from the other side of the counter, chopping raw vegetables and drizzling something over them that he\u2019d just mixed up. \u201cGood. That should effectively lower your expectations.\u201d He emptied the ingredients onto a piece of foil, rolled it up, and put it into the oven with the rest of dinner.</p><p>I inhaled through my nose. \u201cMmm, no, it smells good. And you look like you know what you\u2019re doing back there. I\u2019m afraid my expectations are abnormally high.\u201d</p><p>He set a timer, washed and dried his hands, and came around the corner, taking my hand and leading me to the sofa. \u201cWe\u2019ve got fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>We sat side-by-side, and he examined my hand, the pads of his fingers cool as he traced the short nails that wouldn\u2019t interfere with my bass playing, his thumb stroking over the back of my hand. Rotating it gently, his index finger traced up and down, inside the sensitive valleys between my fingers. He drew a spiral on my palm, slowly moving to center, and I was mesmerized, watching and feeling him touch me so softly.</p><p>His fingers slid between mine, palm to palm, and he reached to pull me onto his lap, his lips at the base of my throat. When the timer sounded minutes later, I was beyond being able to hear it.</p><p>The meal he\u2019d prepared was enclosed in individual foil packets\u2014veggies, baked potatoes and red snapper he\u2019d caught two days ago. Francis meowed like a fire alarm until given his own portion of the latter. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019re used to cooking for one?\u201d I asked as we moved to the tiny table pushed against the only blank wall.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cFor the last three years or so. Before that, cooking for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cooked? Not your mom or dad?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, picking at his potato with his fork. \u201cMy mom died when I was thirteen. Before that, yeah, she cooked. After... well, it was either learn to cook or live on toast and fish\u2014which I suspect Dad does when I\u2019m not home, though I try to get him to buy fruit or something green occasionally.\u201d</p><p>Oh. His story lined up with Landon\u2019s\u2014living with his father, no siblings\u2014and he must have been conscious of that. He\u2019d also been a boy who\u2019d lost his mother, and I was too aware of that to call him out for duplicity just then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, but didn\u2019t offer anything further.</p><p>After we ate, he let the cat outside, came back to the table and took my hand, and led me to his bedroom. We lay on our sides in the center of his bed, facing each other, saying nothing. His touch was almost unbearably light, whispering over my jaw, trailing down the side of my neck before releasing the buttons of the white shirt I\u2019d chosen, one by one. Sliding it from my shoulder, he touched his lips to the bare skin, and I closed my eyes and sighed. My hands pushed under his shirt until he sat up, yanked it over his head, and flung it off in one movement, lying over me and kissing me.</p><p>His mouth was demanding, his lips parting mine, tongue driving into my mouth. I thought I felt a tremor move through him when my hand gripped the place on his side where the words were inscribed. He rolled me above him and pushed the shirt from my opposite shoulder, left it there, half-removed, while he moved his attention to the bare skin above the flesh-toned bra, my entire body straining toward his like a static charge that drew me in.</p><p>Without question or explanation, he stopped at the line I\u2019d drawn last week. Talking was limited to there and God and oh. And then nothing but hums and moans and unintelligible sounds that could only be interpreted as yes, yes, yes.</p><p>\u201cI should get you back.\u201d His voice was gruff. We hadn\u2019t spoken in at least an hour. The clock on his desk showed that the time had crept close to midnight.</p><p>He handed me the discarded bra and pulled his shirt back over his head. When I stood, he held my shirt as I slid my arms into the sleeves, and then he turned me, buttoning the buttons and leaning down to kiss me when he was done, his hands framing my face.</p><p>Standing by his bike, I was pulling on my gloves when the back door of the house across the yard opened and a man emerged, holding a full kitchen trash bag. He opened the wheeled garbage bin and tossed it in. As he turned to go inside, I noticed Lucas was stock-still, frozen, watching him. As though he felt our eyes on him, the man turned under the back door floodlight. He was Dr. Heller. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLandon?\u201d he said, and neither of us moved or responded. \u201cJacqueline?\u201d he added, confused. All at once, he appeared to register what time it was, and the fact that the two of us had just exited his tenant\u2019s apartment. There could be no tutoring excuse\u2014not that it was appropriate for us to meet in the apartment for tutoring, no matter the time of day.</p><p>No one spoke for one long moment, and then Dr. Heller\u2019s shoulders sagged. He sighed before pinning Lucas with a resolute expression. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to meet me in the kitchen when you return. No more than thirty minutes, please.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hands were tight around the helmet. He gave Dr. Heller one sharp nod before putting it on. When he turned to make sure I\u2019d strapped mine correctly, our eyes met once but he didn\u2019t speak and neither did I. During the ten-minute ride back, no clarity rushed in. No magic words, no exoneration for his lies. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say or do other than wait for him to tell me why.</p><p>We arrived and I climbed down from behind him, awkwardly removing the helmet and the hair tie with my gloved fingers. Still straddling the bike, he removed his helmet, too, and stored them both away as though he had no plans to put his back on. When I faced him, he was staring at his hands, tight on the wide handlebars. \u201cYou already knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d His voice was low, but I couldn\u2019t tell his frame of mind.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, frowning and searching my eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d I returned. I didn\u2019t want to answer questions. I wanted my questions answered, and I was ticked off that he was going to make me ask them. \u201cSo your name is Landon? But Ralph calls you Lucas. And that girl\u2014other people call you Lucas. So which is it?\u201d</p><p>His gaze returned to his hands for a moment, and my anger expanded like a balloon inflating beneath my ribs. He seemed to be deciding what to tell me and what to withhold. The Harley rumbled softly, ready to rocket away at a second\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both. Landon is my first name, Lucas the middle. I go by Lucas... now. But Charles\u2014Dr. Heller\u2014has known me a long time. He still calls me Landon.\u201d His eyes swung up to mine. \u201cYou know, I think, how difficult it is to get some people to stop calling you what they\u2019ve always called you.\u201d</p> <p>Very logical. All of it. Except the part where he pretended to be two different guys with me. \u201cYou could have told me. You didn\u2019t. You lied to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned the bike off and swung his leg over, standing in front of me and gripping my shoulders. \u201cI never lied to you. You made assumptions\u2014based on what Ch\u2014Dr. Heller called me. Look through our emails. I never called myself Landon.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged from his grasp. \u201cBut you let me call you Landon.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped but he stared down at me, keeping me from moving. \u201cYou\u2019re right, this was my fault. And I\u2019m sorry. I wanted you, and this couldn\u2019t happen as Landon. Anything between us is against the rules, and I broke them.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed thickly, combating choking up. I heard what he hadn\u2019t said, yet. He was telling me it was over, just like that. The awful reality of desertion that Kennedy had begun weeks before came rushing back as though a dam had broken, and with no notice I was drowning in it. My parents had deserted me, Kennedy had deserted me, my friends, except for Erin and Maggie, had deserted me. And now Lucas\u2014and Landon. Two different relationships, both of which had become significant.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just over.\u201d</p> <p>He stared, and I couldn\u2019t have felt it more if his fingers roamed over my face. \u201cYour grade could be at stake otherwise. I\u2019ll take responsibility for this, tonight, when I get back; Dr. Heller won\u2019t hold you accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just over,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned and walked into the building, and didn\u2019t hear the engine of the Harley rumble to life until my foot was on the bottom stair.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cMs. Wallace, please see me for just a moment after class.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up to meet Dr. Heller\u2019s gaze at the end of the lecture Monday, and nodded my assent.</p><p>\u201cOoohhh,\u201d Benji said. \u201cYou little troublemaker.\u201d His smile fell when he saw my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You aren\u2019t actually in trouble are you?\u201d He glanced to the back of the classroom, zeroing in on the only reason I could be in hot water with the professor. \u201cDid he find out about\u2014you know.\u201d He inclined his head in Lucas\u2019s direction.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he lowered his voice. \u201cOh, shit, are you serious? How?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He found out, and it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Pinning his lips together, he stuffed his notebook into his backpack and sighed. \u201cOh, man. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d His hazel eyes were full of sympathy. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again, needing to redirect the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. How did the coming out go?\u201d</p><p>Smiling broadly, he held his arms wide. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m still in one piece, with all essential parts accounted for.\u201d He waggled his brows, tossing his backpack over his shoulder after I gave him a shove. \u201cIt was good. Getting everything out in the open was a relief\u2014to both of us, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I was happy for him, though I\u2019d not had the same experience with recent public revelations. I wouldn\u2019t glance back at Lucas. He\u2019d stared at his sketchbook when I\u2019d entered the classroom, resolutely against even looking at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacqueline.\u201d Kennedy smiled as we passed in the aisle, as though he was proud of himself for finally remembering my name.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I returned, slipping by him on my way down to the front of the lecture hall.</p><p>When I stopped on the lowest step, Dr. Heller glanced over the heads of the students clustered around him and requested that I come in during his afternoon office hours to pick up my paper. His unflinching expression said it wasn\u2019t an invitation as much as a directive. My face warm, I told him I would be there.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong, so you have nothing to be worried about. Probably he just wants to make sure Lucas-Landon-Sideshow Bob-whoever the hell he is didn\u2019t take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>I appreciated Erin\u2019s reassurances, as mistaken as they might be.</p><p>Reclining on my bed, booted feet hanging off the end, I stared at the square of leaden sky visible from our single four-by-four window. Even in our overly warm room, I shivered. Erin and I discovered last winter that the ancient central heating would pump hot air into our little room until it was a sauna, only to click off and resume a slow slide back to frigid before rebooting back to sauna. It was a wonder we hadn\u2019t both ended up with pneumonia by February.</p><p>\u201cLandon was the perfect tutor. What\u2019s between Lucas and me is no one\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept mine,\u201d Erin quipped.</p><p>I turned my head and half-smiled. \u201cExcept yours.\u201d</p><p>She added the finishing touches to a glitter-covered, sorority-themed poster. \u201cWhat time are you supposed to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween 3:30 and 4:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better scoot. I\u2019m heading to work as soon as I finish this thing. Text me and let me know if I need to kick anyone\u2019s ass. Don\u2019t forget\u2014tomorrow we\u2019re getting dresses for the Bash this weekend.\u201d</p><p>My roommate\u2019s ability to change subjects rapidly was legendary. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Heller regarded me from the opposite side of his desk for the second time this semester, and I struggled not to squirm in the chair. I\u2019d never been a kid who earned teachers\u2019 disapproval; finding myself in this position twice in a matter of weeks was unbelievable.</p><p>He\u2019d not looked at me since inviting me to have a seat. Rifling through a stack of folders and papers, he pulled out my research paper with a muttered, \u201cAh-ha.\u201d</p><p>My hands clenched in my lap as he perused it, skimming through the stapled pages. I wondered if he\u2019d already written a grade on it, or if what I said or didn\u2019t say in the coming minutes would influence it.</p><p>He cleared his throat and I flinched. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Mr. Maxfield, which I assume you know.\u201d</p><p>I took a nervous breath. \u201cNo, sir. We haven\u2019t spoken.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose, eyes widening. \u201cI see.\u201d He frowned as though he was confused. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll ask you what I asked him, and I would appreciate your honesty, please. Did he assist you in producing this paper?\u201d</p><p>I returned his perplexed frown, unsure what, exactly, he was asking. \u201cHe gave me some leads on research sources. And he read the completed paper and pointed out a few errors I needed to correct before turning it in. But the work is mine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and sighed. \u201cAll right. There\u2019s also a matter of a quiz you may have been given some... let\u2019s say notice of... ahead of the other students?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cHe suggested that I do the worksheet he\u2019d sent.\u201d Dr. Heller examined me with a direct look and one raised, bushy eyebrow, and I amended, \u201cHe suggested very strongly that I do it. But he never told me there was going to be a quiz, and frankly, I just thought he was being bossy\u2014I didn\u2019t even pick up on any hint\u2014\u201d Shit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken complete responsibility for his error in judgment, Ms. Wallace.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe, my thoughts rioting. From the first moment I saw him\u2014facing Buck in that parking lot after, I can only assume, pulling him off me\u2014he\u2019d been protecting me. Was he in danger of being fired from his job because of our relationship, whatever it had been?</p><p>I moved closer, my hand on the desk. \u201cLucas didn\u2019t\u2014he didn\u2019t take advantage of me in any way. He was very helpful as a tutor. I have another class during his group sessions, so I couldn\u2019t attend them, but he emailed the worksheets to me.\u201d Breathless, I stopped, not wanting to make this worse than it already was. I couldn\u2019t resemble some infatuated girl or my declarations wouldn\u2019t carry any weight at all. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be in trouble because of me.\u201d</p><p>My professor stared at my paper, still in his hands. If anything, he looked more concerned than he had moments ago. Forehead creased, he raised his eyes and stared at me a moment. \u201cHe also says that you weren\u2019t aware of the fact that the boy you were... seeing... was your tutor. That your academic relationship was carried out through email only.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unwilling to contradict anything Lucas said.</p><p>He sighed again, sitting back in thought, one hand covering his mouth. Finally, he slid the paper across the desk to me. \u201cYour research and the conclusions reached were impressive for an undergrad. Good job, Ms. Wallace. If you do well on the final, your grade in the course shouldn\u2019t suffer from the, um, emotional upheavals you faced mid-semester. A word of advice, though. This won\u2019t be the last time you have to deal with something in life that throws you off your game. In future courses, as well as in the real world\u2014such as it is\u2014professors and employers won\u2019t always be accommodating. We all have to\u2014what\u2019s my daughter\u2019s terminology\u2014suck it up and deal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I resisted flipping to the last page to check my grade. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d I knew I should stand up, thank him, and scramble out of his office while I was still on his good side. I couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cAnd Lucas? Is he in trouble? Will he... will he lose his job?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to have been any real harm done, although I\u2019ve reminded Landon\u2014er, Lucas\u2014that sometimes, how a situation is perceived carries more weight than the reality of the matter. With that in mind, I suggested that he limit himself to appropriate tutoring interactions for the duration of the semester.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hadn\u2019t mentioned any possibility of future interactions. His answer to whether or not it was over had been conclusive, and he hadn\u2019t emailed or texted me to contradict it, nor had he looked my way in class today that I knew of.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Heller.\u201d I waited until I was outside to check the grade I\u2019d received\u2014a 94. Unquestionably better than I would have done on the midterm, had I been present for it.</p> <p>I ignored Lucas on my way to my seat before class on Wednesday and Friday, and ignored him again as I left, especially as I found Kennedy waiting in the aisle to walk me out both days. On Wednesday, my ex asked me how the tutoring was going.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stumbled on the next step and he caught my elbow.</p><p>\u201cWas it two eighth-graders or two ninth-graders who had massive crushes on you?\u201d He laughed, turning the heads of two girls we passed on the way outside; per typical Kennedy, he didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cOr do they all have a crush on you by now?\u201d</p><p>Ah\u2014bass lessons, not economics tutoring. I tucked my chin into my fuzzy scarf and pulled my coat\u2019s zipper to my throat when we rounded the corner of the building and a blast of frigid air hit us, and he turned up his collar and shoved his bare hands into his coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re thinking, most of the time. They\u2019re all a little surly.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me and smiled, that dimple riveting my attention as it had since the first time I saw it, and from there, his beautiful green eyes. He bumped me lightly with his elbow. \u201cSurliness is sound evidence that they\u2019re all crushing on you.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, I faced forward and picked up the pace. I couldn\u2019t imagine where he was going with that, but I wasn\u2019t following. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Kennedy. I have to get to Spanish.\u201d</p><p>He caught my arm. \u201cMaggie said you were coming to the Bash on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Erin and I spent four hours shopping for dresses and shoes Tuesday night. She was going all out in her intention to make Chaz regret any decision he\u2019d made that didn\u2019t include worshipping at her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to \u2018I love the hunt\u2019?\u201d I\u2019d asked as she discarded the tenth or eleventh not-quite-perfect cocktail dress before shimmying into a bit of silver fabric with a thigh-high split.</p><p>Smiling into the mirror with predatory resolve, she\u2019d waited for me to zip her up and examined her body in the reflective dress that set off her red hair like she was on fire. \u201cOh, I\u2019m hunting all right,\u201d she\u2019d purred.</p> <p>I split away from Kennedy without a backward glance, and he called, \u201cSee you later, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>I considered and rejected every excuse I could cook up for why I needed to bow out, belatedly wishing that I had never agreed to accompany Erin to the annual Bash. My normally sane roommate was determined to make her ex-boyfriend\u2019s life a living hell for at least one night. At dinner Friday, she said, \u201cI have to do this. For closure.\u201d Maggie arched a brow at me from across the table. Between the Erin/Chaz drama, Kennedy\u2019s attempts to reverse our breakup, and the likely presence of Buck, Saturday night couldn\u2019t be over soon enough for me.</p><p>Avoiding eye contact during the self-defense class Saturday morning proved more difficult than dodging each other during economics, but Lucas and I managed it for the first hour. The oddest part of the past week was the worksheets he continued to send, but without any note beyond. The entire email consisted of: New worksheet attached, LM.</p><p>\u201cWhere a kick is more likely to be miscalculated by the victim or evaded by the perp, a knee-strike is close-range and more easily executed, so we\u2019re going to focus on this defense first.\u201d Ralph\u2019s voice brought me back to the self-defense class. \u201cAnd I assume you ladies know what you\u2019re aimin\u2019 for with that knee.\u201d</p><p>Dividing into two groups as we had two weeks ago, I went to stand in Don\u2019s group and Erin followed. He held a thick pad with straps for his muscular forearm to hold it in place, explaining knee-strike basics and asking for a volunteer to help demonstrate, which Erin readily answered. I was proud of her resounding No! as she grabbed Don\u2019s shoulders and slammed her knee into the pad. I recognized the move from Lucas having used it on Buck\u2014though he\u2019d struck him under the chin rather than the groin. Buck had gone straight to the ground. And stayed there.</p><p>When it was my turn, my self-conscious hesitation disappeared with my group\u2019s vocal encouragement and Don\u2019s \u201cAgain!\u201d between each strike. Exhilarated, I walked back to Erin wide-eyed and shaking with adrenaline. She laughed and said, \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>We progressed to kicks, and every time I landed one and heard Don\u2019s gratifying grunt, my fear that I could never replicate these in real life lessened. Vickie\u2014the white-haired woman who\u2019d unknowingly given me the courage to remain in the class two weeks ago\u2014asked how, even if we hit the right place with enough force, we could win against a man his size.</p><p>Don reminded us that we didn\u2019t have to win a fight\u2014we just had to get away. \u201cEvery second buys you time to run.\u201d</p> <p>When Ralph announced a short break, I stole a look at Lucas. Over the heads of two girls, one of whom was talking to him, his eyes were on me, their icy gray-blue almost colorless from across the bright room. After the physical activity of the morning, my response was overwhelming. My breath went shallow and quick, neither of us turning away until Erin hooked her arm through mine and tugged.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, lovergirl,\u201d she murmured, inaudible to anyone but me.</p><p>I flushed as I let her lead me into the hallway, toward the locker room. Leaning over the sink, I splashed water on my face and stared into the mirror, wondering what Lucas saw when he looked at me. What Kennedy saw. What Buck saw.</p><p>\u201cGot it bad, don\u2019tcha?\u201d Erin handed me a paper towel and pursed her lips, angling her head as she examined my face in the mirror, too. Her dark eyes met mine. \u201cI should have known that hookup therapy wouldn\u2019t work for you. If it makes you feel any better, he doesn\u2019t look any less strung out than you do.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, patting the water from my cheeks. \u201cBelieve it or not, that doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow, her gaze moving to her own reflection as she smoothed an imaginary imperfection on her lip and adjusted her wild ponytail. \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready to learn the last few moves over the next hour or so\u2014defense against holds and chokes. Next week, we\u2019ll integrate everything you\u2019ve learned into potential scenarios.\u201d Clapping his hands together, Ralph added, \u201cDivide up and let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>After the twelve of us had automatically separated into our previous groups, Ralph addressed the men, who were partially padded up, including headgear. \u201cDon, Lucas, let\u2019s have you two switch off for this part. Mix up the attacker tactics a bit.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. So much for avoiding each other.</p><p>Though I knew there was no avoiding this, my brain cast about for any way out of having Lucas\u2019s arms locked around me in front of everyone. The first attack was called the bear hug, and the intrepid, white-haired Vickie volunteered to help demonstrate the slow-motion defense against it. I watched with Erin and the other three ladies in my group, my breathing erratic and my heart thudding like it was trying to break out of my ribcage. He\u2019d not even touched me yet.</p><p>The need for headgear became obvious when he explained the use of head-butts\u2014the back of the victim\u2019s head smashing into the mouth or nose of the assailant. There was also instep-stomping (everyone laughed when Lucas requested that we refrain from actual stomping of his unpadded foot\u2014he would gladly react as though we\u2019d done it forcefully), elbow to the midsection, and a move termed the lawnmower by Ralph, who came over to check on our progress.</p><p>Moving to stand in front of Lucas, he said, \u201cThis\u2019ll be another move that we\u2019d prefer no one tries in earnest on our brave instructors.\u201d He turned and clapped Lucas\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna render our boys incapable of fatherhood.\u201d As the ladies chuckled, Lucas flushed slightly pink and stared at the floor, his lips screwed into a discomfited smirk. \u201cIn a real life attack, if you have a hand free and low, you will reach back and grab the goods, twisting and pulling straight out like you\u2019re startin\u2019 a lawnmower.\u201d</p><p>He demonstrated, complete with a lawnmower-starting sound-effect, and even Don\u2019s group was watching and laughing. Lucas bit his lip and shook his head.</p><p>One by one, the six of us went to stand in front of him, facing the group, waiting for him to grab them so they could practice the techniques. The lawnmower was a favorite of the older ladies, and they all used it, along with the sound effect. Eyes sparkling, Erin used every single defense we\u2019d just learned, one after the other\u2014head-butt, foot-stomp, shin-scrape, elbow to the abdomen with one arm and lawnmower-starting with the other. The ladies in our group cheered and Lucas said, \u201cGood job. He\u2019ll be on the ground begging you to run away at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I kick him first?\u201d she asked, completely serious.</p><p>\u201cUh... if he\u2019s not making a move toward you, then run. You don\u2019t want him to grab your foot and pull you down.\u201d Erin nodded and walked back to me, squeezing my hand when she reached my side.</p><p>He looked into my eyes as I approached. I stared back, turning my back to him as I reached him, trying to concentrate on what I was supposed to do next.</p><p>Suddenly, his arms were around me like bands, but gentler than any assailant would ever be. His muscled arms were solid and unyielding. Unnerved, I forgot every defense I\u2019d just learned and struggled ineffectively against his strength.</p><p>\u201cHit me, Jacqueline,\u201d he said in my ear. \u201cElbow.\u201d</p><p>I elbowed his pad-covered abdomen and he grunted.</p><p>\u201cGood. Foot stomp.\u201d</p><p>I acted it out, carefully.</p><p>\u201cHead-butt.\u201d</p><p>The top of my head barely reached his padded chin, but I butted it.</p><p>\u201cLawnmower.\u201d His voice was soft, breathy, and I could not, even drawing on every bit of imagination I possessed, picture touching him there to harm him.</p><p>I did the move, without the sound effect, blushing full-on, and he let go. Stumbling toward Erin, I would have felt foolish but for the fact that every woman in the room was doing exactly what I\u2019d just done. Except not with a guy whose touch made her insides go hot and liquid. Not with a guy who made her want to turn and be wrapped up in those arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My group smiled and patted my shoulders and commended me as if I hadn\u2019t completely frozen in the beginning.</p><p>The front bear hug was worse, but for the way Lucas\u2019s eyes dilated slightly when I looked up at him, my chest pressed against his. Like Erin said, he was not unaffected\u2014a knowledge that made me feel both better and worse.</p><p>The chokeholds were easier, and I did them without his verbal cues.</p><p>And then the class was over, with Ralph encouraging us to practice\u2014carefully\u2014over the coming week. \u201cNext week the guys will be in full body gear, and you\u2019ll be able to clobber the daylights out of \u2019em, no holds barred.\u201d</p> <p>Erin and Vickie high-fived, and Ralph beamed at them both, rubbing his palms together. \u201cBloodthirsty and ruthless. Exactly what I wanna see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>I hadn\u2019t attended any Greek events since the Halloween party, and had only seen Buck in passing since the stairwell incident\u2014always within a group, and always in public. When he moved closer, I moved away, as though his very being repelled me, which was true. The mere thought of him still made my mouth go dry and my stomach knot.</p><p>In our room, Erin turned after her final mirror check. \u201cHe\u2019d better stay the hell away from you or I will whip out the lawnmower on his ass,\u201d she declared.</p><p>\u201cThat move\u2019s not for ass use,\u201d I joked, hating the tremor that lanced through me at the thought of Buck with his arms banded around me. I hoped Erin was ready to have a shadow, because I didn\u2019t intend to leave her side.</p> <p>Her arm encircling my shoulders, she turned us both to face the full-length mirror. \u201cWe look hot, girlfriend.\u201d Her eyes met mine in the reflection. \u201cThanks for doing this. The girls have been real supportive, but they\u2019re not you. I feel stronger knowing you\u2019ll be with me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hugged her to my side. We did look hot. In the shimmery silver dress, with her silver-strappy heels, Erin was her own disco ball. My blue sheath\u2014simply cut in front and the exact shade of my eyes\u2014looked basic if not dull next to Erin, until I turned around. The combination of bass playing and yoga had given me a toned back, and the dress showed it off with a \u201cV\u201d cut almost to the waist. The nosebleed-level black patent slingbacks on my feet negated dull quite a bit all on their own.</p><p>Erin did a couple of dance moves. \u201cLet\u2019s go make Chaz wish he was never born.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and laughed. \u201cOh, Erin. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, bitch.\u201d She slapped my butt and we grabbed our coats.</p><p>In unspoken agreement, we passed the stairwell door and walked down the wide, open front staircase to meet our ride. Everyone we passed gawked\u2014one scrawny freshman tripping on a step, his eyes moving between Erin and me. Luckily, he was going up, so he landed on both hands, practically at Erin\u2019s feet. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he breathed taking her in.</p> <p>She patted his head as she passed him, crooning, \u201cAww, how sweet,\u201d like he was a puppy. His adoring expression at her touch indicated that here was a guy willing to put her on a pedestal and treat her like a goddess. I suspected that Erin didn\u2019t want that from a guy nearly as much as she insisted she did.</p><p>The men of Chaz\u2019s fraternity had gone all out, hanging an actual disco ball and hiring a band. Outfitted in suits, ties, and a hazardous level of confidence, they all looked hotter than hell and every one of them knew it. Two guys from the pledge class were at the door, one hanging coats, the other taking the plus-one invitation Erin handed over and giving us each a strip of tickets for the \u2018bar\u2019 set up in the kitchen and a raffle ticket for the table of prizes another pledge watched over.</p><p>The prizes were mostly electronic provisions\u2014from iPods to game systems to a 42\u201d flatscreen. \u201cBoys,\u201d Erin scoffed. \u201cWhere\u2019s a spa day? Or a Victoria\u2019s Secret shopping spree?\u201d The table guard\u2019s eyes widened in obvious approval of the latter idea.</p><p>\u201cHello, Erin,\u201d a deep voice said. We turned, and there was Chaz, looking amazing in a perfectly-cut charcoal gray suit and red tie that somehow blended perfectly with Erin\u2019s hair. He glanced at me, his eyes warm and friendly. \u201cHi, Jacqueline.\u201d I sensed no reproach over the fact that their relationship had detonated over Erin standing up for me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Chaz. The place looks awesome.\u201d I answered for both of us while Erin swayed to the music and waved at friends, as though her ex didn\u2019t exist. The theme of the Bash this year was Saturday Night Fever. The band shifted from playing a Keith Urban cover to a Bee Gees song\u2014something popular when my parents were in grade school, maybe.</p><p>Chaz glanced around perfunctorily, his eyes returning to me. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and then he only had eyes for Erin. Watching the people already dancing, she snagged a full red cup from a passing guy with a handful of them. He started to protest, but Chaz glared, daring him to say a word to her. He buttoned his lip and kept moving.</p><p>While she sipped and pretended to be oblivious to his presence, he stared at her. It was obvious where he wanted this to go, and the fact that Erin was conspicuously gazing anywhere but at him told me she was anything but immune. They didn\u2019t move from each other\u2019s orbits the rest of the night, but he didn\u2019t attempt to speak to her again, either.</p><p>I knew Chaz was a good guy, if misguided and gullible. He\u2019d swallowed Buck\u2019s side of what happened between us, had argued with Erin that maybe I was drunk that night, and I didn\u2019t remember everything clearly. He was probably one of those boys to whom rapists were ugly men who jumped out of bushes, assaulting random girls. Rapists weren\u2019t your nice-guy coworker, or your frat brother, or your best friend.</p> <p>Maybe it never occurred to him that his best friend was capable of ripping a girl\u2019s self-confidence away in the span of five minutes. That he could hurt someone innocent to wound a rival. That he could violate her in a twisted attempt to obliterate his own powerlessness. That he could make her feel constantly threatened, and not give a shit.</p><p>The only time I felt completely safe was when I was with Lucas.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I was watching Buck dance with a senior from Erin\u2019s sorority. He smiled and laughed, and so did she. He looked so... normal. For the first time, I wondered if I was the only girl he\u2019d ever terrorized, and if so, why. I jumped when I heard Kennedy\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cYou look stunning, Jacqueline.\u201d My drink sloshed over the cup\u2019s rim onto my hand, luckily missing my dress. He took the cup from my hand. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry\u2014didn\u2019t mean to startle you. C\u2019mon, let me get you a towel.\u201d</p><p>I was disconcerted enough from his arm steering me through the crowd, his hand on my bare back, that I wasn\u2019t aware of the separation from Erin until we were in the kitchen with my arm over the sink as though I had a mortal injury rather than a beer-soaked hand. He rinsed and patted my hand dry, and I withdrew it from his grasp when he didn\u2019t let go right away.</p><p>He ignored my withdrawal, smiling down at me. \u201cAs I was trying to say before\u2014you look beautiful tonight. I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>The music was loud, and conversation required us to stand closer than I wanted to be. \u201cI came for Erin, Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But that doesn\u2019t diminish my satisfaction that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing his usual Lacoste cologne, but it no longer made me want to lean against him and inhale. Once again, he stood in direct contrast to Lucas, whose scent wasn\u2019t any one thing\u2014it was his leather jacket and his barely-there aftershave, the meal he\u2019d cooked for me and the subtle yet sharp smell of graphite on his fingers after he\u2019d been drawing, the exhaust of his Harley and the minty shampoo smell of his pillow.</p><p>One brow cocked, Kennedy looked at me closely, and I realized he\u2019d probably said or asked something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I leaned my ear toward him so I could take a second to push Lucas from my mind.</p><p>\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s dance.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Unable to shake my errant thoughts, I agreed and let my ex lead me to the designated dance floor, right in front of the band. An area had been cleared of furniture just under the motorized disco ball, which hung dangerously low for some of the taller guys. Rotating slowly, its mirrored surface threw flashes of light in waves around the room, illuminating faces and gyrating bodies, and glinting off any reflective surface from doorknobs to jewelry to Erin\u2019s silver dress. Her hands were locked behind the neck of a Pi Kappa Alpha senior, an empty cup hanging from her fingertips. Her dance partner was unknowingly at the receiving end of a death glare from Chaz. Erin had noticed, though, and she pressed closer to him, staring up into his eyes with rapt attention.</p><p>Poor Chaz. I should be angry with him, too, but he was clearly miserable.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Chaz and Erin. What happened?\u201d Kennedy had followed my gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou should ask him.\u201d I wondered what Kennedy would make of Buck\u2019s behavior. They were civil with each other, but that competitive fixation had been between them from day one.</p><p>\u201cI did, sort of. He didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about it. Said they\u2019d had a big fight, she was being unreasonable, blah blah\u2014you know, the stupid stuff guys say when we fuck up something good.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the music changed to something fast, allowing me to reinstate my bubble of personal space and fortunately axing the conversation about breakups and fuckups. I was so relieved to end that exchange that I failed to pay attention to where Erin was. I failed to pay attention to where Buck was.</p><p>In a lull between songs, he walked up behind me. \u201cHey, Jacqueline\u201d he said, and I jumped for the second time that night. \u201cAre you done dancing with this loser? Come dance with me.\u201d The hair on my arms stood on end, every nerve in my body on full alert, and I moved closer to Kennedy, who put his arm around my shoulders. I didn\u2019t want his arm on me, but given the choice between them, there was no choice.</p><p>Smiling, Buck held out a hand.</p><p>I stared at it, incredulous and cringing closer to Kennedy, whose body became rigid, aligned with mine. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With his usual indolent smirk, Buck gazed down at me as though my ex wasn\u2019t there. Like we were alone. \u201cAll right then, maybe later.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and focused on the word I\u2019d said over and over that morning. The word that preceded every kick. \u201cI said no. Don\u2019t you understand no?\u201d From the corner of my eye, I saw Kennedy\u2019s gaze snap to my face.</p><p>Buck\u2019s eyes narrowed and his mask of indifference slipped for a split second. And then he recovered and the guise was back in place. I knew in that moment that he wasn\u2019t giving up. He was merely biding his time. \u201cSure. I hear you. Jacqueline.\u201d His eyes shifted to Kennedy, whose guarded expression was at odds with the piqued rigidity of his body. \u201cKennedy.\u201d He nodded and Kennedy responded in kind, and then he walked away.</p><p>I slumped against my ex, and then moved out of his grasp, my eyes searching for Erin\u2019s silver dress amongst the crush of people in the little house.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, what\u2019s going on between you and Buck?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ignored his question. \u201cI need Erin. I need to find Erin.\u201d I started in the opposite direction Buck had gone and Kennedy grabbed my upper arm to pull me back. I wrenched it away, and then realized people were staring.</p><p>He moved closer, without touching me. \u201cJacqueline, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019ll help you find Erin.\u201d His voice was low, for my ears only. \u201cBut first, tell me. Why are you so angry at Buck?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him and my eyes stung. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>He compressed his lips. \u201cCome with me? To my room?\u201d When I hesitated, he added, \u201cJacqueline, you\u2019re freaking out. Come talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and he led me up the stairs.</p><p>He shut the door and we sat on his bed. His room, as usual, was neat and organized, though the bed wasn\u2019t made, and there were jeans and shirts tossed over his desk chair. I recognized the sheets and duvet cover we\u2019d chosen before coming back to campus this fall, because he wanted something new. I recognized his bookcase and his favorite novels, his law books, his collection of Presidential biographies. The contents of this room were familiar. He was familiar.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d His concern was genuine.</p><p>I cleared my throat and told him what happened the night of the Halloween party, leaving Lucas out of the story. Listening silently, he got up and paced, taking deep breaths, his fists knotted. When I was done, he stopped and sat, hard. \u201cYou said you got away. So he didn\u2019t\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>A breath whooshed out of him. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d He pulled his tie loose and unbuttoned the top button of his white dress shirt. His teeth were clamped so tightly that the cords of his neck popped out under his skin like pipes running from his jaw down. He shook his head and smashed a fist on his thigh. \u201cMotherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy wasn\u2019t usually much of a curser\u2014certainly neither of these words was part of his standard vocabulary. He peered at me closely. \u201cI will handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been\u2014it\u2019s over, Kennedy. I just... I just want him to leave me alone.\u201d I was curiously without tears, which was odd. I felt like I\u2019d gained strength from telling him, just like I felt stronger after telling Erin.</p><p>His jaw clenched again. \u201cHe will.\u201d He took my face in his hands and repeated, \u201cHe will leave you alone. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d And then he kissed me.</p><p>The feel of his mouth was as familiar as the items I\u2019d catalogued when I walked into his room. The books in the bookshelf. The comforter under my hand. The rock-climbing equipment in the corner. The hoodie I used to borrow. The smell of his cologne.</p><p>Unwittingly, I registered the feel of his lips, moving a little too roughly. I reasoned that his anger at Buck made his kiss less tender, but I knew better. Because this, too, was familiar. This kiss\u2014it was how he\u2019d always kissed me. His tongue snaked into my mouth, possessively, and it was familiar and fine and not Lucas.</p> <p>I jerked back.</p><p>His hands dropped. \u201cGod, Jackie, I\u2019m sorry\u2014that was so inappropriate\u2014\u201d</p><p>I ignored his slip. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, I just... I don\u2019t...\u201d I cast about in my head, trying to define what I didn\u2019t want. We\u2019d been broken up for seven weeks. Seven weeks, and I was done. I stared at my palm, turned up on my lap; the realization and the finality were something of a shock.</p><p>\u201cI understand. You still need time.\u201d He stood, and I stood, wanting out of this familiar room and this conversation.</p><p>Time would not change what I was feeling\u2014or not feeling. I\u2019d had time, and though the ache from his desertion hadn\u2019t disappeared, it was decreasing. My future was blurry, yes, but I was beginning to imagine a future when I would no longer miss him at all.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find Erin for you. And I\u2019m going to have a talk with Buck.\u201d</p><p>I froze, halfway to the door. \u201cKennedy, I don\u2019t expect you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m handling this. Handling him.\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath and followed him from the room, hoping his intentions sprung from a determination to do the right thing, and not just because he wanted to win me back.</p><p>Erin and I watched from the window as Buck and Kennedy faced off in the lot behind the house. It was too cold for anyone to party outside, so they were alone. We couldn\u2019t hear the words, but the body language was unmistakable. Buck was taller and bigger, but my ex possessed an innate superiority that refused to cede control to anyone he deemed unworthy of it. Buck\u2019s face was a veneer of annoyance overlaying absolute fury as Kennedy spoke, stabbing a finger at him one, two, three times, never touching him but showing no fear.</p><p>I envied him that ability. I always had.</p><p>We turned away from the window when Kennedy spun to come back into the house, but not before Buck glanced at the window and fixed me with a look of pure hatred.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ,\u201d Erin murmured, taking my arm. \u201cTime for a drink.\u201d</p><p>We found Maggie in a group of people playing quarters. \u201cErrrrrrin!\u201d she slurred. \u201cCome be on my team!\u201d</p><p>Erin crooked a brow. \u201cWe\u2019re playing teams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grabbed Erin\u2019s arm and pulled her onto her lap. \u201cJ, you be partners with Mindi here! Erin and me are gonna kick y\u2019all\u2019s asses.\u201d Mindi was a petite blonde pledge. She smiled and blinked big green eyes, unable to focus on me.</p><p>\u201cYour name is Jay?\u201d Her drawl was very pronounced and her lashes fluttered up and down like a cartoon character, making her seem younger and more vulnerable than eighteen. She was the reverse of Maggie\u2019s sarcastic demeanor and dark pixie looks. \u201cLike a boy\u2019s name, Jay?\u201d</p><p>The guys across the table chuckled and Maggie rolled her eyes disgustedly. It was clear why she wanted me to take her partner. \u201cUm, no. J as in Jacqueline.\u201d One of the boys grabbed two folding chairs from against the wall, wedging them on either side of Mindi and Maggie. I took the one next to Mindi and Erin slid into the other.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mindi frowned and blinked. \u201cSo can I just call you Jacqueline?\u201d My name was almost unrecognizable between the accent and the drunken slurring.</p><p>Maggie started to mumble under her breath so I said, \u201cSure, that\u2019s great,\u201d and looked around the table. \u201cSo, are we winning?\u201d</p><p>The boys on the other side grinned. We definitely weren\u2019t winning.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>By the time our designated driver dropped us back at the dorm, Erin and I had quartered and beer ponged our way to a night of spinning walls at best and toilet-hugging at worst. Neither of us spoke above a whisper until after 3:00 pm Sunday afternoon. There was a scheduled sorority meeting four hours later, and Erin cursed the lineage of whoever put that on the calendar the day after the Brotherhood Bash.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get a damned thing decided\u2014and at least half of us will kill the first person to bang that gavel.\u201d We were still conversing at half-volume.</p><p>I watched her wind a purple scarf around her neck and pull on matching gloves while waiting for my laptop to boot up. \u201cAt least your misery will have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d She pulled a purple cap over her wild red hair and shrugged into her coat. \u201cSee you in a couple of miserable hours.\u201d</p><p>Lucas had already sent Monday\u2019s worksheet. Still no personal note.</p><p>I understood why he couldn\u2019t see me, and maybe why whatever we had been doing was over. But I didn\u2019t understand why our emails had to stop, too. I missed them, and wondered what he\u2019d do if I emailed him back. I wanted to tell him about last night and Buck, about saying no and feeling scared to death and tough at the same time.</p><p>One week of class remained, followed by a week of finals, and then the semester would be over. I had no idea if it would make any difference to him.</p><p>I did the least brain-pounding homework I could do\u2014labeling a constellation chart due tomorrow in astronomy lab\u2014and hung the clean laundry that had been sitting in a basket at the foot of my bed for three days... or four... maybe five. I\u2019d missed my bass practice times all weekend in addition to the ensemble rehearsal, so I would be scrambling to complete additional hours of practice during the week.</p><p>By the time Erin returned, I was seriously considering just going to bed and sleeping off the lingering remains of my hangover. Yawning, I turned toward the door, \u201cI was thinking about crashing early\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin wasn\u2019t alone. Under her arm was Mindi, my quarters partner from the previous night. At first, I thought she was just way more hungover than me; then, I noticed Erin\u2019s grim expression, and I took in Mindi\u2019s red-rimmed, bloodshot eyes. She didn\u2019t just feel like shit from too much alcohol. She\u2019d been crying. A lot. I swung my legs off the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ, we have a problem.\u201d The door shut behind them and Erin tugged Mindi to sit on her bed. \u201cLast night, after you and I left, Mindi danced with Buck.\u201d Mindi flinched and closed her eyes, and tears started streaming down her face.</p><p>My heart began to race. I imagined everything Erin could say next, and none of it was good. I hadn\u2019t prayed in a long time, but I found myself begging. Please God let it not have gone further than what happened to me. Please. Please.</p><p>\u201cHe talked her into going to his room.\u201d At this, Mindi\u2019s hands flew up to cover her face and she crumpled face-first into Erin\u2019s shoulder like a child. \u201cShh, shh,\u201d Erin crooned, fitting both arms around her. We stared at each other over Mindi\u2019s head, and I knew there\u2019d been no Lucas for her.</p><p>\u201cJ, we have to tell. We have to tell this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will believe me!\u201d Mindi rasped. She was hoarse, and I imagined her doing what I\u2019d done\u2014begging him to stop. I imagined her crying all night, and half the day, and I was more pissed than I\u2019d ever been, and scared. \u201cI\u2019m not...\u201d Her voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Erin said firmly.</p><p>I gulped at the knot in my throat and it slid down, but not without a fight. \u201cThey\u2019ll believe you. He tried to\u2014he tried with me, a month ago.\u201d</p><p>Mindi gasped, her blotchy face and wide eyes turning to me. \u201cHe raped you, too?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as chills spiked up in a wave from my neck to my ankles. \u201cSomeone stopped him. I got lucky.\u201d I had no idea how lucky until this moment. I thought I knew, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her voice warbled softly, and she hadn\u2019t quit crying. \u201cWill that count?\u201d</p><p>Erin coaxed Mindi to lie down, flapping a blanket over her. \u201cIt\u2019ll count.\u201d She sat next to Mindi and held her hand. \u201cWill Lucas corroborate your story, J? I mean, I\u2019m guessing, with what we know about him, that he will.\u201d</p><p>Lucas had been irate that I\u2019d not let him call the police that night. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that by not reporting what had happened, I let Buck think he was untouchable. That he\u2019d do it again. I\u2019d assumed that what Lucas had done to Buck was deterrent enough. Not that it had prevented him from what he did in the stairwell... or his implied threats during the party, right in front of Kennedy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>Erin took a shaky breath and looked down at Mindi. \u201cWe need to call the police or go to the hospital or something, right? I have no idea what to do first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital?\u201d Mindi was afraid, and I couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably need to do... an exam, or something.\u201d Erin gentled her voice, but at the word exam, Mindi\u2019s eyes widened and filled with tears again.</p> <p>Her knuckles blanched, gripping the blanket. \u201cI don\u2019t want an exam! I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital!\u201d</p><p>How could I blame her, when reporting would bring more pain and humiliation?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you. You can do this.\u201d Erin turned to me. \u201cWhat should we do first?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, thinking of the campus police. Some, like Don, would probably do well with this situation. Some might not. We could go straight to the hospital, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the steps were. I picked up my phone and dialed.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice was wary, and I realized I\u2019d never called him before.</p> <p>\u201cI need you.\u201d It had been over a week since we\u2019d communicated outside of the worksheets he\u2019d sent, and the self-defense class yesterday morning.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room.\u201d I expected him to ask what I wanted. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBe there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, and I put the phone down, and we waited.</p> <p>Lucas squatted on his heels just below Mindi\u2019s eye level. \u201cIf you don\u2019t report it, he\u2019s going to do it again. To someone else.\u201d His voice hummed through me, barely audible from across the room. \u201cYour friends will stay with you.\u201d</p><p>Erin sat on the bed, holding her hand. I barely knew this girl, but thanks to Buck, we were now allies, associated in a way no one ever wants to be linked.</p><p>\u201cWill you be there?\u201d Her voice was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIf you want,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She nodded, and I tamped down a trace of jealousy. There was nothing to envy in this situation.</p><p>The television in the ER waiting room was set at an earsplitting volume that was no help to my aching head. I wanted to turn it off, or down, but an elderly man was planted in a chair ten feet from it, arms crossed over his chest, staring up at the sitcom repeat. If that noise was distracting him from his reason for being here, who was I to take that diversion away?</p><p>Lucas sat next to me, his bent knee angled toward me, brushing my thigh. His hand was so close to mine I could have reached my pinky finger out to stroke his. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGot something against that show?\u201d</p> <p>His silly question broke my scowl. \u201cNo, but I think I could hear it from across the street.\u201d He was wearing that ghost smile, and I wanted to melt into it.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, staring at the boot on his knee. \u201cAre you a little hung-over, too?\u201d When Erin and Mindi filled him in on the details of last night, he\u2019d quickly figured out that I\u2019d gone with Erin to the Greek event.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, a little.\u201d I wondered if he would think I\u2019d senselessly put myself in danger by attending a party where Buck would obviously be present. His reprimand the night we met\u2014real responsible\u2014still stung, mostly because it was true.</p><p>\u201cSo did he talk to you? Last night?\u201d He was still staring at his boot.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He asked me to dance.\u201d</p><p>A muscle worked in his jaw, and his eyes were cold when he raised them to mine.</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d I heard the defensiveness in my tone.</p><p>He took a deep breath and turned more fully toward me, his voice low and menacing. \u201cJacqueline, it\u2019s taking everything I\u2019ve got right now to sit here and wait for law-abiding justice to take care of this, instead of hunting him down myself and beating the fucking shit out of him. I\u2019m not blaming you\u2014or her. Neither of you asked for what he did\u2014there\u2019s no such thing as asking for it. That\u2019s a fucking lie argued by psychopaths and dumbasses. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, breathless at his declaration.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDid he accept your no?\u201d What I heard at the end of his sentence: this time?</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cKennedy was with me. He noticed how weird I acted with Buck, so I told him what happened. I didn\u2019t say anything about you, or the fight. I just told him I got away.\u201d</p><p>A small crease appeared between his brows. \u201cHow\u2019d he take it?\u201d</p><p>I remembered Kennedy\u2019s uncharacteristic cursing outburst. \u201cHe was angrier than I\u2019ve ever seen him. He took Buck outside and talked to him, told him to stay away from me... which probably made Buck feel weak, and that\u2019s why...\u201d That\u2019s why he raped Mindi.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just say? This is not your fault.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, staring into my lap, tears stinging my eyes. I wanted to believe it wasn\u2019t my fault, but Mindi was hurt after Kennedy had chewed him out. For me. It felt like my fault. I knew better, but I couldn\u2019t help connecting the dots.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s fingers brushed under my chin and turned my face to his. \u201cNot. Your. Fault.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, holding onto his words like they were redemption.</p><p>I parked in front of a neighbor\u2019s house, snapping the truck door shut as quietly as possible and tiptoeing down the sparsely lit driveway toward the detached garage. It was late\u2014hopefully late enough that no one would be peering out a window at a girl sneaking up to a guy\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s motorcycle was parked under the open steps. I stood at the bottom with my hand on the rail, heart hammering, and looked back at Dr. Heller\u2019s house. I couldn\u2019t see any movement within, though there were lights on inside. Taking a deep breath, I climbed the steps and knocked lightly.</p><p>There was a peephole in the door, so I was sure he\u2019d seen me standing under the porch light by the puzzled expression on his face when he yanked the door open. An hour ago, he\u2019d left me at the dorm with Erin and Mindi, and after he\u2019d gone, I realized I hadn\u2019t said what I wanted to say. And most of what I wanted to say included a need to see him while I said it.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline? Why\u2014?\u201d He cut himself off at the look on my face, pulling me inside and shutting the door behind me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His hands gripped my elbows as I stared up at him. He was wearing drawstring pajama bottoms and a dark t-shirt, the sexy lines of his tattoos spilling from his sleeves to his wrists. He also wore thin, black-framed glasses that accentuated the blue in his eyes and his dark lashes.</p><p>I took a breath and blurted everything out before I was too chickenshit to say any of it. \u201cI wanted to tell you that I just\u2014I miss you. And maybe that sounds ridiculous\u2014like we barely know each other, but between the emails and texts and... everything else, I felt like we did. Like we do. And I miss\u2014I don\u2019t know how else to say it\u2014I miss both of you.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, closing his eyes and inhaling slowly. I knew he would be all rational and do-the-right-thing and he would push me away again, and I was determined not to give him that chance. But then his eyes flashed open and he said, \u201cFuck it,\u201d pushing me against the door, slamming his forearms on either side of my head and kissing me more forcefully than I\u2019d ever been kissed, so firmly that I could feel the ring at the edge of his mouth scoring into the surface of my lip.</p><p>He pressed his hard body against mine and I pressed back, grabbing handfuls of his t-shirt and fitting myself to him while his tongue stroked the interior of my mouth. When he drew back a fraction, I protested with an embarrassingly inarticulate sound and he chuckled softly, but he was just removing my coat and towing me to the sofa. Sitting, he dragged me astride his lap, cradling my head in one palm and crushing me closer with the other.</p><p>We parted, breathless, and he tossed his glasses on the side table and tore his t-shirt over his head, and then removed mine more gently. His warm hands spanned my sides and held me tighter as our lips moved together, his tongue making languid, sweeping passes across mine. I wound my arms around his neck, opening my mouth and taking him in. When he kissed the corner of my mouth and dipped his lips to the hollow at the base of my throat, my head fell back. I couldn\u2019t stop the soft keening moan his light sucking kisses triggered.</p><p>\u201cYou have a freckle here,\u201d he whispered, sweeping his tongue over a spot just under my jaw. \u201cIt drives me crazy every time you\u2019re above me. I just want to do this...\u201d The gentle draw of his mouth pushed me over the edge, and my knees tightened around his hips as I rocked against him.</p><p>Light eyes smoldering, he removed my bra, outlining concentric rings with his fingertips, touching me so softly that I grew dizzy wanting more. His hands cupped my breasts, thumbs brushing the undersides, and I leaned my face down to his and sucked his tongue into my mouth, sliding my hand down his taut abdomen and lower over the front of the soft flannel pants. I tugged on one of the strings.</p><p>\u201cGod, Jacqueline,\u201d he gasped, straining against my hand while his arms snaked around me, fingers stealing into my hair at the nape as our mouths devoured each other. Breaking the kiss, he pressed his forehead to my shoulder and groaned, his teeth clenched. \u201cTell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I shook my head, though I had no idea if the action was fervent or imperceptible. His breath fanned over my breasts and I bent to his ear, my voice a murmur. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly rolling us down and onto our sides, he unzipped my jeans and slipped his hand between the insubstantial fabric of my underwear and my skin, his fingers searching for and finding the place he sought as he kissed me. I gasped his name into his mouth, my fingers digging into his bicep, and his voice was a low growl in my ear. \u201cJacqueline. Say stop.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head once, my palm sliding down to press against the evidence of what his body wanted from me. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I breathed, telling him that I wanted what he wanted, unconditionally. I kissed him back, sure in the knowledge that my actions and words were all the confirmation he needed to continue.</p><p>I was wrong. \u201cSay stop, please. Please.\u201d The last whispered word was a plea I couldn\u2019t deny, even if I didn\u2019t understand the reason for it.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I whispered, not meaning it, not wanting it, and he shuddered and removed his hand from me. Curling my hands between our chests, I didn\u2019t move away, didn\u2019t speak. I just lay in his arms for long minutes, until his breathing slowed, finally becoming deep and even.</p><p>Landon Lucas Maxfield was asleep on his sofa. With me.</p><p>I woke to the muffled sound of Francis yowling to be let inside. Disentangling myself from Lucas cautiously, I slid from the sofa and went to let him in, grabbing my bra and long-sleeved t-shirt and pulling them back on. A gust of chilly air entered with Lucas\u2019s cat, and I shut the door as soon as he fully cleared the doorway. After wrapping his tail around my leg for the span of two seconds, he stalked off to the bedroom, and I supposed that was as thankful as he ever got.</p><p>I returned to the sofa, but I sank to the floor and examined Lucas instead of waking him or snuggling back into his embrace. With the planes of his face partially obscured by his dark hair, his full lips slightly parted and thick lashes combined in sleep, I could see the boy inside the man more clearly than I had before. I didn\u2019t understand what happened earlier, why he made me stop him or why he held himself apart from everyone, from me, but I wanted to understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I guessed that the rose tattoo was a possible clue, given its placement over his heart. Most of the ink on his arms consisted of symbols and intricate motifs, and I wondered if any these were his own design. He shifted onto his back then, and I could finally read the words on his left side:</p><p>Love is not the absence of logic</p><p>but logic examined and recalculated</p><p>heated and curved to fit</p> <p>inside the contours of the heart</p><p>I needed no more proof to know that somewhere in his possibly not-so-distant past, Lucas had loved someone, deeply. Someone he must have lost, because she didn\u2019t appear to be around. And then I looked more closely at the tattoo banding the upturned wrist that lay near his face. Within the inky pattern, masquerading as normal pink skin within the design, was a thin but jagged scar. It ran from one side to the other\u2014all the way across, contained by the black tattooed lines like hidden code.</p><p>His right wrist was circled with the same banded design, and watching his face for signs of wakefulness, I lifted it from his chest and gently turned it to check. It, too, was scarred from one side to the other\u2014the scar hidden skillfully by the tattoo artist.</p><p>Stunned, I sat on the floor, watching him sleep. I had no idea if this was something I could ever bring up with him\u2014if it was something he\u2019d ever willingly tell me. Even having spent my fair share of days and nights miserable over the breakup with Kennedy, I was never depressed enough to consider suicide. I had no idea what it would take to get to that hopeless point. Not really.</p><p>It was late, and I needed to get back to my dorm. Our class\u2014my class\u2014began in only eight hours. On the kitchen counter, I found a discarded envelope and I scribbled a note letting him know I\u2019d gone back to the dorm and would see him tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice stopped me with my hand on the doorknob. He sat up, slightly disoriented from sleep.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you, so I left a note.\u201d I picked it up from the end table, folding it and shoving it into my pocket. I was so overfull of words to say and questions to ask that none would come out.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and stood, stretching his neck to the side, extending his arms back, eyes closed. His biceps and pecs flexed from the movement, and I wanted to stop staring, but couldn\u2019t until his eyes flashed open. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out to your truck.\u201d</p><p>He turned to grab his t-shirt and pull it back on, and I was able to ogle him shamelessly again. Across the top of his defined shoulders and back were more inked designs and scripted words, but the t-shirt covered them much too abruptly. He disappeared into his bedroom and came out wearing his hoodie and a very beat-up pair of Sperrys I\u2019d never seen him wear. Boots were his standard footwear.</p><p>\u201cFrancis is on the bed? Unless he\u2019s developed opposable thumbs, I guess you let him in.\u201d Crossing the room to me, he smiled.</p><p>I nodded as he neared, and his smile ebbed. I knew he was thinking about what happened before we fell asleep wrapped up in each other, wondering what I thought about him pleading with me to say stop when I\u2019d made it clear that I didn\u2019t want to. If he only knew\u2014my confusion over his strange rejection was nothing to the apprehension over what had caused the scars on his wrists.</p> <p>Chapter 19</p><p>After a week of Lucas ignoring my existence while we were in class, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect Monday morning. The alteration was minor, but undeniable. When I entered the classroom, his eyes met mine, the barest suggestion of a smile playing on his mouth. Everything about him had grown familiar. The night I danced with him, his features had merged into an exceptionally crush-worthy guy. Now, he was all sharp angled jaw and strong chin, his nose with the slightest hint of a prior break. A crescent-shaped scar sat high on one cheekbone, and his colorless eyes were sometimes a little eerie. The fringes of his bedhead hair were just long enough to soften the whole; if he ever cut it short, he would look like a completely different guy.</p><p>He returned his attention to the ever-present sketchbook, and I pulled my gaze forward in an effort to keep from pitching down the steps. Just hours before, he\u2019d held my face in his hands, pressed me against the door to my truck and kissed me as though we\u2019d done what I\u2019d wanted to do. I\u2019d driven back to my dorm in a state of bewildered lust.</p><p>Sliding into my seat next to Benji, I withstood the temptation to look over my shoulder. If he wasn\u2019t watching me, I\u2019d be disappointed. If he was, I\u2019d be caught.</p><p>The girl on my right was giving her usual Monday morning weekend recap to her neighbor... and the two or three dozen other people who could hear her. Benji pantomimed her perfectly, if a bit dramatically, and I pretended a coughing fit to hide my laughter. Unfortunately, the coughing drew her attention.</p><p>\u201cAre you dying or something?\u201d she asked, affecting a perfect sneer as I shook my head. \u201cWell, hacking up a lung out in public isn\u2019t all that attractive\u2014just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>My face flamed, but then Benji leaned up and spoke around me. \u201cUm, giving half the class an exhaustive summary every Monday morning\u2014in lurid detail\u2014of how much of an alcoholic skank you are? Isn\u2019t all that attractive, either. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as nearby people snickered, and I caught my lower lip between my teeth while trying to stare straight ahead. Thankfully, Dr. Heller entered then, and class started, and I went back to fifty long minutes of attempting to forget Lucas\u2019s presence three rows back and five seats over.</p> <p>\u201cSo... nine days \u2019til the final.\u201d Benji stuffed his backpack and smirked at me while I packed mine.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine days until no more... restrictions.\u201d I rolled my eyes directly at him as his brows danced up and down. \u201cEh? Eh?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help checking to see if Lucas was still in the room. He was talking to the Zeta girl he\u2019d spoken to before\u2014but he was watching me over her head.</p><p>Benji sidled by on his way to the aisle, a grin splitting his face. \u201cI\u2019ll take Hot Tutors for $200, Alex,\u201d he said in an unnaturally feminine voice before he began humming the Jeopardy theme song. He was still humming it when he smiled at Lucas just before exiting.</p><p>I hoped I wasn\u2019t blushing as Lucas fell into step with me, but neither of us spoke until we were outside. Clearing his throat, he gestured toward Benji\u2019s retreating back with one shoulder. \u201cDoes he, um, does he know? About..?\u201d</p><p>He worried his bottom lip and the small silver ring, a slight frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually how I figured out... who you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He walked with me toward my Spanish class, as he had once before.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d noticed us... looking at each other,\u201d I shrugged, \u201cand he asked me if I went to your tutoring sessions.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes for a beat, he took a breath. \u201cGod. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I waited, hoping he would tell me the reason for the Landon/Lucas charade, finally. We hiked across the hilly campus in silence for a minute or two, every step taking us nearer to my class. Without a single cloud in the sky, the sun warmed us in direct patches of light while we froze in the shade cast by trees and buildings.</p><p>\u201cI noticed you the first week.\u201d His voice was soft. \u201cNot just because of how pretty you are, though of course, that played into it.\u201d I smiled, watching our feet as we matched our steps. \u201cIt was the way you lean onto your elbows when you\u2019re listening in class, when something catches your interest. And when you laugh, it\u2019s never to get attention, it\u2019s just\u2014laughter. The way you obsessively tuck your hair behind your ear on the left side, but let the right side fall down like a screen. And when you\u2019re bored, you tap your foot soundlessly and move your fingers on the desktop like you\u2019re playing an instrument. I wanted to sketch you.\u201d</p><p>We stopped and stood in a square of sun, well away from the shadowed entrance to the language arts building. \u201cAlmost every time I saw you, you were with him. But one day, you walked up to the building alone. I was holding the door for several girls in front of you, and I waited for you to catch up. When you reached me, you look pleased, and a little surprised. Unlike the others, you didn\u2019t expect the door to be held for you by some random guy. You smiled up at me and said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 That was the last straw. I prayed you\u2019d never come to a session, and not with him. I didn\u2019t want you to know I was the tutor.</p><p>\u201cHe took you for granted, even when you stood next to him, holding his hand. Like you were an accessory.\u201d He frowned, and I remembered feeling exactly like that with Kennedy. Often. \u201cI never wanted you to get hurt, but I wanted to take you from him. I had to constantly remind myself that it didn\u2019t matter if you were his or not, because you were on the other side of a line I couldn\u2019t cross. And then you didn\u2019t show up the day of the midterm\u2014or the next, or the next. I worried that something had happened to you. He was kind of reserved the first couple of days. By the end of the week, girls were flirting with him before class, and the way he responded told me what had happened.</p><p>\u201cI was sure you\u2019d dropped the class, which made me selfishly ecstatic. Without even knowing I was doing it, I started looking for you on campus.\u201d He stared into my eyes and lowered his voice even further. \u201cAnd then, the Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cYou were there? At the party?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow? You aren\u2019t Greek, are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d fixed the house\u2019s A/C the night before. Maintenance doesn\u2019t do non-emergency stuff on evenings or weekends, but I\u2019m contract labor, so I agreed to do it. When I wouldn\u2019t take a tip, a couple of the guys invited me to the party. I only said yes because I was hoping you might be there. It had been two weeks, and this campus is so huge I was starting to think I\u2019d never run into you.\u201d He chuckled softly and rubbed a hand at the back of his neck. \u201cWow, that sounds total stalker.\u201d</p><p>Or totally hot. God. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to me that night? Before...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou were so withdrawn and miserable. Almost every guy who approached you was rejected without a second glance. There was no way I was going to become one of them. You danced with a handful of guys you already knew\u2014and he was one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When you left, he followed, and I thought maybe... maybe you two had decided to leave early together, without everyone knowing. Meet outside or something.\u201d</p><p>I watched a trio of my classmates enter the building. \u201cHe\u2019s my roommate\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s best friend. Well, her ex\u2019s best friend, now. He was a known entity. A friend, I thought. Boy, was I wrong.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, frowning. \u201cI was about to leave\u2014my bike was parked out front. Something didn\u2019t feel right, but I was struggling with the same desire to take him out that I\u2019d felt for half the semester with your boyfriend, so I questioned my own motives. I lost a minute arguing with myself, and I\u2019m sorry about that. I finally decided if you two were hooking up, I\u2019d just go around front, rev up the Harley, and be done with it. With you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly aware of the lack of people bustling around us, I pulled out my phone. It was two minutes past ten. \u201cCrap. I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Isn\u2019t this the professor who makes an example of you if you\u2019re late?\u201d</p> <p>Impressive. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d Groaning, I pushed my phone into my bag. \u201cI sorta feel like skipping now.\u201d</p><p>His mouth turned up on one side. \u201cWhat kind of university employee would I be, to encourage you to skip class the last week of the semester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just reviewing. I have an A. I don\u2019t really need the review.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other.</p><p>I angled my head and looked directly into his clear eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a class?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot until eleven.\u201d Not for the first time, the feel of his gaze drifting over my face was like a soft breeze, or the lightest possible touch. He stopped on my mouth.</p><p>Lips parted, my breathing slowed as my heart rate sped. \u201cYou never did sketch me again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted to mine, but he didn\u2019t answer, so I thought maybe he didn\u2019t remember his texted request.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were having a hard time doing it from memory. My jaw. My neck...\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd your lips. I said I needed more time staring at them and less time tasting them.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Good God, what did he not remember?</p> <p>\u201cA very foolish thing for me to say, I think.\u201d He was staring at my mouth again.</p><p>My lips tingled from his focused perusal. I wanted to rub my fingers across them. Or graze them with my teeth to stop the tickling sensation. When I wet them with my tongue, he sucked in a breath. \u201cCoffee. Let\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and without another word, we walked toward the student center, the busiest place on campus at this time of day.</p><p>\u201cSo you wear glasses, huh?\u201d We\u2019d been sitting at a tiny table, sipping our coffees and enduring a decidedly uncomfortable silence, so I\u2019d blurted the first viable thing that entered my brain.</p><p>\u201cUm. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Great. I\u2019d just brought up that night. But shouldn\u2019t I bring up that night? Shouldn\u2019t we talk about it? Shouldn\u2019t I ask him if he was pushing me away because he was the class tutor, or because of those scars on his wrists?</p><p>\u201cI wear contacts. But my eyes get tired of them by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>Cue the mental picture of Lucas pulling his door open, the apprehension on his face, the glasses transforming him into someone official while the pajamas produced a contrary effect. I cleared my throat. \u201cThey look really good on you. The glasses. I mean, you could wear them all the time, if you wanted to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re kind of a pain with the motorcycle helmet. And taekwondo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, I can imagine.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet again, with forty minutes until his class and my rescheduled bass practice time. \u201cI could sketch you now,\u201d he said.</p><p>For no good reason, my face flamed.</p><p>Luckily, he was reaching into his backpack, withdrawing his sketchpad, and turning to a blank page. He took the pencil from behind his ear before looking across the table at me. If he noticed my heightened color, he didn\u2019t mention it. Without a word, he leaned back in his chair, the pad on his knee, and started drawing, his pencil making the effortless, sweeping arches of someone who knows what he\u2019s doing. His eyes moved from the pad to me and back, over and over, and I sat silently sipping, watching his face. Watching his hands.</p><p>There was something intimate about modeling for someone. I\u2019d volunteered as a model once in my junior year art class, for extra credit. Severely lacking in drawing skill, I\u2019d jumped at the extra two points without stopping to consider that I would be sitting on top of a table for an entire class period. Giving a classroom of teenaged boys free rein to stare at me for an hour was a whole new sort of awkward. Especially when Jillian\u2019s boyfriend, Zeke, started his portrait with my chest. He stared unabashedly, showing off his artistic efforts to his tablemates while I flushed and pretended I couldn\u2019t hear his wisecracks about nips and cleavage and how he wished I\u2019d just lose the shirt altogether\u2014or at least unbutton it.</p><p>\u201cMost artists begin with the head,\u201d Ms. Wachowski said as she looked over his shoulder. Zeke and the other boys at the table snorted with laughter while I burned with humiliation and the entire class looked on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t relaying that story. \u201cHigh school.\u201d</p><p>The hair falling over his forehead obscured the crease I knew was there, but his lips pressed tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, wondering at the change those two words brought.</p><p>Surrounded by conversations, music and mechanical sounds, the scratch of the lead across the paper was inaudible in the coffee shop. I watched the pencil dance in his hand, wondering what part of me he was sketching, and what parts he might want to sketch. What was he like as a sixteen-year-old boy? Did he draw then? Hang out with other boys his age? Had he fallen in love? Had his heart broken by some callous girl?</p><p>Had he already put those scars on his wrists, or was that yet to come?</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d been with him for three years.\u201d He spoke just loud enough for me to hear him, staring down at the pad as the pencil worked back and forth. There was no question in his voice. He assumed I was thinking about Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about him.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, lips compressed again. Jealousy? Guilt crept in when I realized I wanted him to feel jealous.</p><p>\u201cWhat was high school like for you?\u201d I asked and then wanted to take it back. His eyes flashed to mine and his hand stilled.</p><p>\u201cA lot different than it was for you, I imagine.\u201d His eyes still roved over my face, but he was no longer drawing, and his expression was tense.</p><p>\u201cOh? How?\u201d I smiled, hoping to either bring us back from this ledge-clinging position, or shove us over the edge.</p><p>He lifted his gaze to me then and stared. \u201cFor one, I never had a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the rose over his heart, and the poem inscribed on his left side. I didn\u2019t want that love to be recent. \u201cReally? Not one?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was... unsettled, you could say. I hooked up with girls. No relationships. Skipped class as much as I bothered to show up. Partied with the locals and the beach tourists. Got into fights often, in school and out. Got suspended or expelled so frequently I was never quite sure when I woke up in the morning whether I was supposed to go or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>His face went blank. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, how did you get into college and become this\u2014\u201d I gestured at him and shrugged \u201c\u2014serious student?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the pencil in his hand, his thumbnail scraping over the lead, sharpening it. \u201cI was seventeen, about to flunk out for the last time, prepared to work the boat with Dad the rest of my life. One night, I was partying with some friends. We made a bonfire on the beach, which always drew the tourist kids in\u2014and they always wanted to be hooked up. One of my friends was a dealer. Not big stuff\u2014just party drugs. He\u2019d sell high, so we could skim some off without having to pay his distributor for it.</p><p>\u201cHis sister tagged along that night. She had a crush on me, but she was fourteen. Totally innocent. Not my type. She didn\u2019t take the dismissal well, and started flirting with the guys who financed our night, so to speak. Her dumbass brother was so high he wasn\u2019t watching her at all. My head wasn\u2019t much clearer, but when the guy she was dancing with pulled her down the beach, she looked like she was trying to yank away from him.</p><p>\u201cI remember going after them, but everything after that is murky. I was told I broke the guy\u2019s jaw. Got arrested, charges filed. I probably would have ended up in prison, but the Hellers were visiting that week, and Charles did something to make it all go away.</p><p>\u201cHe and my dad had words. Next thing I knew I was signed up for martial arts classes. I was stupid enough to see the wrong-minded benefit of being able to beat the shit outta people even better than I already could, so I didn\u2019t object. What I didn\u2019t see coming was how it would center me for the first time in a long time. Before he left, Charles lectured me like Dad never had. I didn\u2019t like disappointing him.\u201d He looked at me closely. \u201cStill don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>We sipped our coffees and I waited, holding my tongue, knowing there was more.</p><p>\u201cHe told me I was throwing my future away, that I was better than drugs and fights. He said my mother was watching, and asked if I wanted her to be proud or ashamed. Then, he promised he\u2019d help me get into the university, pull every string he could pull, if I\u2019d just try. He knew I was looking for an escape, and he gave me one second chance.\u201d</p><p>A chill moved down my back at his words.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good at offering those.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, just barely. \u201cYes. He is. I took it. My senior year looked good, but I\u2019d all but killed my overall GPA before that. I don\u2019t know how he got me accepted, even conditionally. Dad can\u2019t pay for it, of course, so that\u2019s why all the odd jobs. I pay rent for the apartment, but I couldn\u2019t get a cot in somebody\u2019s garage for what he charges me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like a guardian angel for you.\u201d</p><p>Raising his light, unnerving eyes to mine, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>I blinked at Erin, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s probably not testifying?\u201d</p><p>My roommate slammed her phone onto her desk. Slammed the door of our mini-fridge after grabbing a bottle of water from it. Kicked her shoes off and then threw one of them across the room where it bounced off the wall over her bed and landed in the center. \u201cThey got to her. Kennedy, D.J. and Dean. Convinced her\u2014or have almost convinced her\u2014that they\u2019ll handle Buck. That she\u2019ll take down the frat and maybe the whole Greek system if she testifies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re making her feel guilty. For being raped!\u201d I\u2019d never seen Erin so enraged. \u201cThis is total fucking crap. I\u2019m calling Katie.\u201d</p><p>I got up and crossed the room, holding her forearm to keep her from dialing. \u201cErin, you can\u2019t tell if Mindi doesn\u2019t want you to tell.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me closely. \u201cJ, you know how the Greeks work. Everyone already knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>She dialed, and I listened as she told her sorority president what she thought of the proposed cover-up. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in an hour, with Mindi.\u201d She put the phone down, her expression calmer and more calculating. Sitting on my bed, she took my hand. \u201cYou have to go with us, J. You have to tell them what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, testifying to a bunch of sorority girls was more terrifying than the thought of reporting Buck to the cops or giving a deposition to the district attorney. \u201cW-why?\u201d I sputtered. \u201cI\u2019m not one of you guys, Erin. They don\u2019t care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows precedent.\u201d</p><p>How many times had I heard Kennedy use this legal jargon\u2014one of his favorites. \u201cAre you sure a failed attempt with me shows a pattern? It\u2019s only twice...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes flared. \u201cJacqueline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right... God, what am I saying?\u201d My hands trembled, sliding over my face, and Erin pulled them down gently.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make sure he doesn\u2019t do this again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing she was right, and she tapped out a text to Mindi.</p> <p>Erin had just unlocked the Volvo when I heard my name and turned to find Kennedy jogging across the dorm lot. \u201cHey, Jacqueline. Erin.\u201d When he gave her a tight, serious smile, she scowled at him. He turned back to me. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cAbout what? About you helping them talk Mindi out of pressing charges, when you know what he did to me?\u201d</p><p>He huffed a tired sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we speak privately? Please?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at Erin and she pursed her lips and gave my ex a cynical once-over before turning her attention back to me. \u201cI\u2019m picking Mindi up, and I\u2019ll meet you at the house?\u201d She was worried that I\u2019d let him talk me out of this, as ill at ease as I already was.</p><p>I peered at Kennedy and I knew that convincing me to abandon the allegation against Buck was his agenda. \u201cYou\u2019ll drive me over? Now? That\u2019s the only way this talk is happening.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated and maybe a little confused by my counter, he agreed. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll take you over, if you\u2019ll talk to me on the way.\u201d</p><p>I stared across the top of the sedan at Erin. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unwavering hope in her eyes, and I followed Kennedy to his car.</p><p>After adjusting the stereo to backdrop level, he drove slowly, with one wrist draped over the top of the leather-wrapped steering wheel. \u201cThanks for agreeing to talk to me.\u201d He glanced across, his eyes skittering away from mine and back to the road. \u201cI want you to know that I believe, one hundred percent, everything you told me Saturday night. I know Buck\u2019s a scumbag\u2014I just didn\u2019t know how much of one. We\u2019ve started proceedings to expel him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExpel him\u2014from the frat? Like that\u2019s punishment?\u201d Closing my eyes, I shook my head to clear it.</p><p>\u201cBuck came to this campus thinking he was going to make pledge class president, thinking he\u2019d move up in the ranks, run the whole frat and maybe the council by senior year, and now he\u2019s about to be out on his ass, daddy or no daddy. Damn right it\u2019s punishment.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cKennedy, he raped a girl.\u201d</p><p>He had the grace to flinch. \u201cI understand that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no but! There\u2019s no fucking but!\u201d My chest heaved with the effort to clench my hands in my lap instead of pummeling his smug face. \u201cHe deserves prison time, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to see he gets it.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help thinking that if Kennedy had been sent to keep me from testifying, then this discussion had produced the reverse effect.</p><p>He pulled to a stop in front of the house and put the car in park. He gripped the wheel with both hands. \u201cJacqueline, you need to understand something. Buck\u2019s been talking shit about hooking up with you for weeks now. Others have corroborated his account. Everyone knows about it. No one else buys your he-tried-to-rape-me-too story, now. It\u2019s kind of late for that.\u201d</p><p>My breath left me, my throat closing up, and pain shot down my arms to my fingertips. Closing my eyes, I fought dizziness and the welling of tears, and so much fury I literally saw red behind my closed lids.</p><p>\u201cMy... story?\u201d</p> <p>His green eyes met mine. \u201cI told you, I believe you.\u201d I stared into his eyes, this boy I\u2019d known so intimately for three years. I could see that he did believe me, but that belief conflicted with his compulsion to save face. He wasn\u2019t going to do the right thing.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me, yet here you sit, trying to talk me out of persuading anyone else to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, it\u2019s more complicated than that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is.\u201d I threw the door wide open and jumped out. Slamming the door on any further protest, I turned and stomped up the sidewalk to Erin and Mindi\u2019s sorority house. I was shaking with anger, and fear, and something else: resolve.</p><p>There were less than twenty girls in attendance at the meeting: Erin, Mindi, the sorority officers, and me.</p><p>As the president, Katie presided from the head of the long, polished table. Seated on either side of her were the senior officers; I recognized Olivia\u2019s older sister as one of them. She and Olivia could have been twins, they looked so much alike\u2014right down to the bitchy sneer.</p><p>\u201cMindi, sweetie, no one\u2019s blaming you here,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with an insincerity that contradicted her words. \u201cBut the thing is, you did go to his room with him. I mean, the expectation was there, you know?\u201d</p><p>Erin put her hand on my thigh when I sucked in a breath\u2014a warning against replying yet. I exhaled through my nose and fumed silently. I was an outsider. I could be removed easily, and that would be no good for Mindi. She needed all the support she could get.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t like, a virgin, either, right?\u201d another girl said.</p><p>\u201cGod, Taylor, that\u2019s not material,\u201d another said.</p><p>Taylor shrugged. \u201cIt would matter to me.\u201d</p><p>Mindi\u2019s face was pale and she looked like she was either going to vomit or pass out. Erin leaned closer to her and whispered, \u201cBreathe, honey.\u201d</p><p>Several people said more stupid things, and others said more sensible things, and finally it seemed like everyone had spoken their minds except Katie, Erin, and the two people who ultimately held Buck\u2019s fate in their hands: Mindi and me. Finally, Katie banged the gavel lightly, stopping all conversation and turning every head in her direction. Her posture so perfect that she could have been a queen wearing a heavy crown, she fixed her eyes on me. \u201cJackie, I understand that you\u2019re alleging that Buck attempted to rape you on the night of the Halloween party?\u201d</p><p>A couple of girls mumbled asides and one actually giggled. My hands tightening into fists in my lap, I ignored them, swallowed and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay sorry, I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s even here,\u201d a junior class rep said. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t actually do it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had every intention of doing it,\u201d Erin said through clenched teeth. \u201cHe was just stopped before he succeeded.\u201d</p><p>The other girl tossed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t report it that night. Why not? And why now? I mean, how do we know this isn\u2019t a ploy for attention? Or some sort of vendetta against Buck?\u201d</p><p>Erin growled next to me.</p><p>\u201cHe was stopped by a guy who saw the whole thing and is willing to make an official report with me.\u201d My voice wavered, and beneath the table, Erin took my right hand and held it tightly. \u201cAs far as why now instead of then... that was my bad judgment. It didn\u2019t occur to me that he\u2019d do this to someone else.\u201d I glanced at Mindi, an apology in my eyes, and then Katie. \u201cI thought it was just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy? One of the brothers? Because dude, they\u2019re not going to testify against Buck,\u201d Taylor said, and several girls nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo. Lucas Maxfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know him,\u201d Olivia\u2019s sister said. \u201cHe\u2019s yummy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he the non-Greek guy who was at the Halloween party without a costume? Cowboy boots? Dark hair? Gorgeous eyes? Total hottie?\u201d the girl next to her asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMindi,\u201d Katie interrupted, \u201cI understand that Dean and D.J. spoke with you yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Mindi nodded, her still red-rimmed eyes wide. \u201cThey want me to drop the charges. They said they would handle it internally.\u201d</p><p>Heads pivoted back and forth between the sorority president and the freshman pledge as they volleyed questions and answers. \u201cWhat are your plans, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really confused.\u201d</p><p>Katie pinned her with a look. \u201cDid Buck do what you said he did?\u201d</p><p>Mindi\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and when she nodded, they spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is there to be confused about?\u201d</p><p>Everyone sat in stunned silence for a moment, until the girl who\u2019d pronounced Lucas a total hottie exclaimed, \u201cAre you saying she should press charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Gasps sounded around the table, and I was so dumbfounded I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cBut this will look so bad for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what looks bad?\u201d Katie cut off her VP. \u201cA bunch of women who don\u2019t support each other when a guy pulls some shit like this. I\u2019m sick of it. Less than an hour ago, I told D.J. where he could stick his goddamned fraternal reputation.\u201d She stood up and leaned forward, her hands on the table. \u201cLet me tell you girls a story, short and sweet. In high school, I was a junior varsity cheerleader dating a senior who was up for football scholarships. I\u2019d slept with him several times, willingly. One night I wasn\u2019t in the mood, but he was. So he held me down and forced me. The few people I told about it\u2014including my best friend\u2014pointed out what would happen to him if I told. They stressed the fact that I hadn\u2019t been a virgin, that we were dating, that we\u2019d had sex before. So I kept quiet. I never even told my mother. That boy put bruises on my body. I was crying and begging him to stop and he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s called rape, ladies.\u201d</p><p>She drew herself up and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSo Buck can enjoy sitting in a cell contemplating how he blew up his life. That dickwad hurt two people sitting at this table. And you\u2019re worried about who\u2019ll look bad if they tell? Screw that. Dean and D.J. and Kennedy and every frat boy on this campus can all go fuck themselves. Are we sisters or not?\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline,</p><p>I\u2019ve attached the review that I\u2019ll hand out on Thursday. I guess it\u2019s technically preferential for me to give it to you a couple of days early, but I did tell you that you were my favorite, after all.</p><p>LM (aka Lucas, aka Landon, aka Mr. Maxfield)</p><p>Mr. Landon Lucas Maxfield,</p><p>It feels odd to get economics email from you. Like you aren\u2019t really the same person. (I just remembered how I asked if you needed help in economics. I was all set to recommend you as a tutor to yourself. You must have thought I was so clueless.)</p><p>Thank you for the review worksheet. I won\u2019t even look at it until Thursday. That way you don\u2019t need to feel guilty about giving it to me early.</p><p>Mindi and I filed reports at the police station earlier. Erin drove us. It was the first time I actually gave anyone a detailed account of the whole thing. I was shaking and crying by the time I was done, and I felt weak and stupid all over again. Mindi was in even worse shape; the case worker said she may need to be treated for PTSD. She told us both to go to the school counseling office or a private therapist for treatment.</p><p>Mindi called her parents on the way back to campus, and they\u2019ll be on a flight here in the morning. It never even occurred to me to tell mine. I don\u2019t think I could deal with another I-told-you-so speech from my mother. Not about this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gave the detective your information, and she said they would call you when they want you to come in.

I got caught up in my own deception, and I felt increasingly rotten about it. I\u2019m glad you found out, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you myself. If anyone was clueless, it was me.</p> <p>I feel like such a jackass for ever saying anything to make you think that any part of that night was your fault. I was so amped, and pissed\u2014at him. If you hadn\u2019t made that sound in the truck, I think I might have killed him.</p><p>Did you both file a restraining order?</p><p>Lucas</p><p>Me: Can we switch to text?</p><p>Lucas: Sure np</p> <p>Me: We got the paperwork to file a temporary RO tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>Lucas: Good. If you feel threatened, I want you to call me. Ok?</p><p>Me: Ok.</p><p>Lucas: Tomorrow is my last class day in econ. Dr. H will be doing a review on Friday.</p><p>Me: Obviously, you don\u2019t need that. I thought you were a bad slacker student. Sitting on the back row, drawing, not paying any attention to the lecture.</p><p>Lucas: I guess I did look that way. This is my third semester to tutor, and my fourth to sit through the class. I know the material pretty well.</p> <p>Me: So, after Wednesday, we don\u2019t have class together? And after the final next Wednesday, then what?</p><p>Several minutes passed, and I knew I\u2019d asked a question he either didn\u2019t know the answer to or didn\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>Lucas: Winter break. There are things you don\u2019t know about me. I told myself I won\u2019t lie to you again, but I\u2019m not ready to put everything out there. I don\u2019t know if I can. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Winter break began a week from Friday\u2014the last day of fall finals. I was required to leave the dorm over break, and the spring semester wouldn\u2019t begin for seven weeks. A lot could change in that space of time.</p><p>I fell out of a tree in sixth grade and broke my arm. I couldn\u2019t play my bass or braid my own hair for seven weeks. When I was fifteen, my best friend Dahlia went to summer camp for seven weeks. When she returned, she was best friends with Jillian. I remained friends with them both, but things were never the same between Dahlia and me. Seven weeks after fall semester started, Kennedy broke up with me, and seven weeks later, I realized I was getting over him.</p><p>Seven weeks could change everything.</p><p>Erin came in from work before I could formulate a reply to Lucas, if there even was one. Uncharacteristically quiet and wearing a distracted expression, she peeled off her work clothes carefully, dropping them into the laundry basket without her usual garment-flinging tendency.</p><p>\u201cErin? Is everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>She flopped onto her bed and stared at the ceiling. \u201cChaz was standing next to my car when I came out tonight. Holding flowers.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t see any flowers, so I could only imagine what had happened to them. Probably nothing good. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d I knew exactly what he wanted. I knew what he\u2019d wanted last Saturday. What he\u2019d probably wanted ever since he\u2019d been dumb enough to choose his dick of a best friend over his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cHe apologized. He groveled. He said he\u2019d apologize and grovel to you if I wanted him to. He swore he\u2019d never thought Buck would resort to\u2014that\u2014to get a girl, because girls are always throwing themselves at him. I told him three weeks ago that it isn\u2019t about sex. It\u2019s about dominance.\u201d She raised up on her elbows to look at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t listen to me then. And now, when Buck is about to be arrested and charged with rape\u2014now he\u2019s listening.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess that guys who\u2019d never do something like that have a hard time believing some other guy would,\u201d I said, but I could see her point. Awareness and apologies were fine and good, but they could come too late.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Kennedy was waiting outside the classroom Wednesday morning. Avoiding eye contact, I intended to walk by him into class, but he reached out as I passed. \u201cJacqueline\u2014come talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Allowing him to pull me a few feet to the left of the door, I faced the classroom so I could see when Lucas arrived.</p><p>He kept his voice low and leaned one shoulder on the smooth tile wall. \u201cChaz says you and Mindi filed police reports yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I expected anger or exasperation, but saw neither. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a couple of fingers over his flawlessly stubbled chin\u2014a habit that used to make me want to do the same. \u201cYou should know, Buck is claiming that the thing with Mindi was consensual, and the thing with you didn\u2019t happen at all the night you said it did.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open and snapped closed. \u201cThe \u2018thing\u2019 with Mindi? The \u2018thing\u2019 with me?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my indignation, he added, \u201cHe apparently forgot that he\u2019d told Chaz and at least a dozen other guys that you and he had hooked up in your truck, right after the party, before he got jumped.\u201d</p><p>I knew Buck had spread rumors, but I hadn\u2019t heard the details. \u201cKennedy, you know I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so, but I wasn\u2019t sure how you were reacting to our breakup. I did a few, um, ill-advised things after... I figured you were entitled to the same.\u201d</p><p>I thought of OBBP\u2014Erin and Maggie\u2019s solution to my after-breakup nosedive\u2014and conceded\u2014to myself\u2014that he wasn\u2019t completely off the mark. Still, I wondered if he\u2019d ever known me at all. \u201cSo you thought I might be so upset over losing you that I\u2019d start screwing random guys in parking lots?\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cOf course not. I mean, I mostly assumed that he was exaggerating. I had no idea that he\u2019d...\u201d his jaw clenched and his green eyes blazed. \u201cIt never occurred to me that he\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>I was getting sick and tired of that sentiment.</p><p>I saw Lucas approaching at the same time he spotted me. Without pausing, he walked straight over and stood next to me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d grown addicted to that sentence from him, and the way he said it, his voice like steel under velvet. I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once at me and gave Kennedy a quick glance that promised lethal injury if he saw fit to inflict it.</p><p>Kennedy blinked and looked over his shoulder to watch Lucas enter the classroom. \u201cThat guy\u2019s in our class? And what the hell was that look for?\u201d He turned back to examine my face more closely as I watched Lucas disappear through the door. \u201cChaz said some guy was in the parking lot that night. That he\u2019s the one who beat the shit outta Buck, not a couple of homeless guys like Buck said.\u201d He gestured with a thumb. \u201cIs that who he was talking about?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me you just got away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that night, Kennedy.\u201d With you, I added silently. I\u2019d have to talk about it soon enough, when I had to give a deposition to the defense, and again when it went to trial.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But you weren\u2019t exactly honest with me the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was honest; I just wasn\u2019t completely forthcoming. I don\u2019t know why I even told you, especially after you asked me to drop the charges so the frat could save face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a mistake. One that\u2019s been rectified\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, by a bunch of sorority girls much braver than you. Mindi was about to cave to your pressure, and if she\u2019d dropped her case, I wouldn\u2019t have had one at all. You of all people know that. So thanks, Kennedy, for your support.\u201d I sighed. \u201cLook, I appreciate your talk with Buck, and for what it\u2019s worth, I know you genuinely didn\u2019t want him to hurt me. But he needs to go to jail, not just be dressed down by a peer and tossed out of his fraternity.\u201d I spun to enter the classroom and stopped when he called my name.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Erin was right. Apologies could come too late. I nodded, accepting his for the sake of everything we used to be, but nothing more.</p><p>Dr. Heller had begun the lecture, so I slipped into my seat, accepted Benji\u2019s smile of hello, and gave myself credit for becoming a survivor. I had survived Kennedy\u2019s decision to end our relationship. I had survived what Buck tried to do to me. Twice. And I would survive if Lucas wouldn\u2019t\u2014or couldn\u2019t\u2014trust me with his personal demons.</p><p>The trees had transitioned from leafy to bare without me noticing. The shift was always a quick thing here\u2014never a lengthy, multihued transformation like it was further north. Even still, I\u2019d been too preoccupied to observe the alteration as it occurred. It seemed like one day the trees were thick and green, and the next, the leaves had vanished altogether, except in small, dead piles trapped in terraced corners and caught under border hedges.</p><p>The occasional warm days were gone as well. Lucas and I hunched into our coats, and my scarf was wound around my neck twice and encroaching on my face. I exhaled into it and savored the warmth that lasted about two seconds.</p><p>Lucas pulled his beanie lower. \u201cDo you want me to come with you this afternoon? I can get someone to cover my shift at Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him, but my scarf didn\u2019t turn with me. \u201cNo. Mindi\u2019s parents are here. They\u2019re going to make sure everything\u2019s taken care of for both of us. They even offered to get me a hotel room\u2014they\u2019re keeping Mindi there with them for the next week, and then taking her directly back home after finals. Her dad\u2019s moving her stuff out of her dorm tonight. Erin says they may withdraw her permanently.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t do any good to point out that this could have happened anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMaybe once they get over the shock of it. But Mindi might not want to come back here, even if that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d he mumbled, staring straight ahead as we walked.</p><p>We were silent until we got to the small building where my Spanish class was located. \u201cI wish I could skip again today, but we have oral presentations that count as part of the final.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, reaching out to loosen a stubborn strand of hair that clung to my lip. I couldn\u2019t get it with my gloved fingers. His index finger was faintly gray, and I guessed that he\u2019d been sketching in class today. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you, before you go home. Outside of Saturday\u2019s class, I mean.\u201d His finger trailed my jaw, dipping into the pool of scarf and tucking beneath my chin.</p><p>I felt my stomach drop to my feet. I\u2019d become familiar with non-verbal farewells recently, and goodbye was in his eyes. I wasn\u2019t ready to see it. \u201cI have a solo performance for a final grade tonight, a mandatory recital to attend on Friday, and my ensemble is performing Saturday. But I can come over tomorrow night, if you want.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, staring into my eyes, looking like he might kiss me. \u201cI want.\u201d Students still hustled to their classes all around us. I wasn\u2019t late to class yet, this time. He pulled my scarf back into place over my chin and smiled. \u201cYou look like a partial mummy. Like someone was interrupted while winding you into your shroud.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A full smile from Lucas was so rare. Used to his ghost smile, dark scowls and intense stares, I was so stunned that my breath faltered. And then I smiled back, and even if he couldn\u2019t quite see my mouth I knew the crinkles around my eyes replicated those around his, the darker blue of my eyes connecting with the his gray-blue. \u201cMaybe I did a hammer-fist strike and bloodied his nose before he could do all that gruesome mummy stuff to me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, holding the warm smile in place, and I leaned toward him like a flower to sunlight.</p><p>\u201cYou are fond of that hammer-fist strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not as fond as Erin is of all things groin strike related.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed again and leaned to kiss my forehead, letting me go swiftly and glancing around. His smile faded, and I thought I\u2019d probably be willing to do almost anything to bring it back. \u201cText me when you\u2019re done this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I would find when I googled Lucas\u2019s name Wednesday night. I hoped for an obituary that would give me a starting point, which I found. Like many obits, the one for Rosemary Lucas Maxfield didn\u2019t give a clue to how she died. No \u201cin lieu of flowers please send a donation to\u201d with the name of some awful young-mother-killing illness at the end. I googled her name, expecting nothing\u2014but multiple articles popped up, all dated eight years ago. The titles knocked the breath from me. I chose one and clicked\u2014my heart thumping so hard I could feel the individual beats\u2014while I wished these commentaries were about someone else\u2019s mother. Someone I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>TWO DEAD IN MURDER-SUICIDE</p><p>Authorities have confirmed the horrific details of a murder-suicide that took place during an apparent home invasion in the early hours of the morning on Tuesday. Police say that Darren W. Smith, a local handyman, broke into the home of Raymond and Rosemary Maxfield through a back window around 4 a.m. Tuesday morning. Dr. Maxfield was away on business. After restraining her son in his room, Smith raped Rosemary Maxfield repeatedly before slashing her throat. Cause of death was massive blood loss from multiple sharp force injuries. Smith then fatally shot himself. Weapons found at the scene included a seven-inch hunting knife and a 9 mm pistol.</p> <p>Smith was one of a group of contractors working on the Maxfield home earlier this summer. There appears to have been no other connection between Smith and the Maxfields, despite surveillance-type photos of the family found yesterday by investigators at Smith\u2019s home. Police believe that Smith was aware of Dr. Maxfield\u2019s absence from home.</p><p>Unable to get in touch with his wife or son by Tuesday evening, Raymond Maxfield requested that family friends Charles and Cindy Heller check on them. At approximately 7 p.m., the couple discovered Rosemary Maxfield in her bedroom, covered in blood, with Smith near her, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. The minor child was taken to County Hospital and treated for dehydration, shock, and minor injuries relating to the restraints, but was otherwise unharmed.</p><p>Heller made a short statement earlier this evening, requesting that the press and the community allow Maxfield and his son privacy to process the shocking manner in which they lost their 38-year-old wife and mother. \u201cI was in the army. Special Forces. I\u2019ve seen some atrocious stuff. But this was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever come across, and I\u2019ll always regret taking my wife with me that night,\u201d Heller said. The Hellers and Maxfields have been close friends for sixteen years. \u201cRose was an adoring wife and mother, a loving and wonderful friend. She\u2019ll be terribly missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me outside office hours.\u201d I took a deep breath and sat, hands clenched in my lap. \u201cI need to talk to you about Lucas. There\u2019s something I need to know about him.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Heller\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can divulge. If it\u2019s of a personal nature, you should probably ask him.\u201d</p><p>I was afraid he\u2019d say this, but I needed to know more before I saw Lucas again. I needed to know if that night had been the catalyst for the scars on his wrists, or if there was something more. \u201cI can\u2019t ask him. It\u2019s about... what happened to his mother. To him.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Heller looked as though I\u2019d sucker-punched him. \u201cHe told you about that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I googled his name, looking for her obituary. When it didn\u2019t give a clue how she died, I googled her name. Yours was in the article I found.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cMs. Wallace, I\u2019m not willing to talk about what happened to Rose Maxfield just to appease someone\u2019s morbid curiosity.\u201d</p><p>I took another shaky breath. \u201cThis isn\u2019t curiosity.\u201d I scooted to the edge of the chair. \u201cHis wrists\u2014they\u2019re both scarred. I\u2019ve never known anyone who tried... that, and I\u2019m afraid to say the wrong thing. You\u2019ve known him all of his life. I\u2019ve only known him a few weeks, but I care about him. A lot.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment, and I knew he was weighing what to tell me, staring at me from under his bushy brows. It was hard to imagine that this soft-spoken, doughy man had once been a member of Special Forces. Hard to imagine he\u2019d been the one to discover one of his closest friends, savagely murdered.</p><p>He cleared his throat, and I didn\u2019t move. \u201cI became good friends with Raymond Maxfield in grad school. We were both PhD-track, but while I planned to go the more typical teaching and researching route, Ray was bound for a more lucrative, non-academic career.</p><p>\u201cWe attended a small gathering at the home of one of our professors, whose daughter was an undergrad, living at home. She was stunning\u2014all dark hair and dark eyes\u2014so when she passed through on her way to the kitchen, Ray got up with an excuse to get ice, and I followed. He was my best friend, but I wasn\u2019t letting him call dibs on a girl like that. It was every man for himself.\u201d He chuckled softly.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes later, I was feeling damned sure of my chances. He\u2019d asked her major, and when she\u2019d answered, \u2018Art\u2019, Ray had blurted out, \u2018Your father is Dr. Lucas\u2014one of the foremost minds in modern economics\u2014and you\u2019re studying art? What the hell are you gonna do with a degree in art?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, his eyes unfocused, remembering. \u201cShe drew herself up to all five foot two, eyes flashing, and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to make the world more beautiful. What are you going to do? Make money? I\u2019m so impressed.\u2019 She whirled around and left the kitchen. For days, Ray was furious that he hadn\u2019t formulated a single retort while she was standing there.</p><p>\u201cA week later, I ran into her in the coffee shop. She asked if I was as anti-art as my friend. I\u2019m no dummy, so I exclaimed, \u2018No way\u2014I know how essential art is in the expression of the human condition!\u2019 So she invited me to an exhibit she was having, and told me I could bring Ray. I immediately regretted telling him at all, because he was determined to impart those clever comebacks he\u2019d been formulating since the night they met.</p><p>\u201cThe gallery was squeezed between a liquor store and a furniture rental place. As we walked to the door, Ray made a remark about the \u2018more beautiful world\u2019 she wasn\u2019t making, and I wanted to kick myself again for bringing him.</p><p>\u201cRose walked up wearing a gauzy dress, her hair twisted up\u2014very art student. With her was a smartly dressed blonde\u2014Ray\u2019s usual type\u2014who she introduced as her best friend, and also a finance major. Ray barely noticed the other girl. \u2018Where\u2019s your stuff?\u2019 he asked Rose. His question seemed to take the bite out of her. She was fidgety as she led us to the wall showcasing her paintings\u2014watercolors. We all waited, tense, for Ray to pronounce judgment.</p><p>\u201cHe examined each piece without comment, and then he looked down at her, and said, \u2018They\u2019re beautiful. I don\u2019t think you should ever do anything that isn\u2019t this.\u2019 She graduated three months later, and he had a ring on her finger that night. Once he finished his doctorate, they got married, and he started his career with a vengeance, as he\u2019d always planned to do.</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I ended up with the pretty finance major, and we married not long after they did. The four of us stayed close friends. Landon is like an older cousin to our three.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Heller stopped and took a deep, sad breath, and my uneasiness returned.</p><p>\u201cRay was working for the FDIC. Lots of travel. I was teaching at Georgetown; we lived maybe twenty minutes from each other. When he couldn\u2019t get in touch with them that night, Cindy and I drove over to check. We found Rose in her room, with Smith\u2019s body, and Landon in his room.\u201d Dr. Heller swallowed and I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cHe was so hoarse from screaming he couldn\u2019t speak, and his wrists were zip-tied to the bed post. He\u2019d dragged that bed until it ran into other furniture and couldn\u2019t go any further. His wrists were lacerated, trying to get loose from those ties to get to his mother. There was dried blood on his arms and the corner of the bed. That\u2019s where the scars came from. He\u2019d been like that fifteen, sixteen hours.\u201d</p><p>My stomach heaved and tears streamed down my face, but Dr. Heller\u2019s voice was flat. I sensed he was holding himself apart from the memory as much as he could. I felt cruel for making him relive such a horrible night.</p><p>\u201cRose was the emotional heart of the three of them. Ray adored her, and losing her that way, when he wasn\u2019t there to protect her... He shut down. He\u2019d made tremendous strides in his career, but he quit it all. Moved the two of them to his dad\u2019s place on the coast, went back to the fishing boat he\u2019d been so determined to never have any part of when he left home at eighteen. His father died a couple of years later, left him everything.</p><p>\u201cLandon shut down in a different way. Cindy and I tried to tell Ray that he shouldn\u2019t be uprooted from everything he knew, that he surely needed therapy, but Ray was out of his mind with grief. He couldn\u2019t stand to be in that house or that city.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me then, pulling a tissue box from a desk drawer when he took in my face. \u201cI think you need to get the rest from Landon\u2014I mean, Lucas. He changed his name to his middle name\u2014his mother\u2019s maiden name\u2014when he came here for college. Trying to reinvent himself, I guess. An eighteen-year habit is hard to break, and he hasn\u2019t called me on it enough in the past three years.\u201d He peered at me and exhaled. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen you leaving his apartment. As far as I\u2019m concerned, any student/tutor restrictions are over. Just... so you know.\u201d</p><p>I dabbed a tissue under my eyes and thanked him.</p><p>University restrictions were the least of my worries.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good cook.\u201d I grabbed the empty glasses and followed Lucas to the sink. He rinsed the bowls of pesto remains and turned to take the glasses from me.</p><p>\u201cPasta\u2019s easy\u2014the college-version gold standard for impressing a date with your mad culinary skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is a date?\u201d Before he could do an about-face, I added, \u201cAnd you made the pesto from scratch\u2014I watched you. That was impressive all on its own. Besides, you\u2019ve never lived in a dorm, where the pasta choices are usually Chef Boyardee from a can, or two-for-a-dollar ramen noodles. The occasional Lean Cuisine. Trust me, your skills are positively epicurean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed, treating me to the full smile I craved. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>I returned the smile, but it felt counterfeit\u2014as though someone else had shaped my mouth into a happier contour than I was capable of feeling. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Every minute, I battled a mounting dread over what I\u2019d learned on the Internet the previous night, and from Dr. Heller hours before. Lucas had been through such hell, and shared it with no one, as far as I knew. He\u2019d said there were things I didn\u2019t know about him that he might never be able to reveal, and instead of respecting those secrets, I\u2019d unearthed them. I wanted to be the one he let in, but my prying could easily be turned into an excuse to shut me out.</p><p>\u201cI guess it would wreck my standing as a top chef if I told you I made brownies from a box for dessert.\u201d His expression was stern.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI love brownies from a box. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to maintain a severe demeanor and failing. \u201cYou\u2019re full of contradictions, Ms. Wallace.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him and arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019m a girl. That\u2019s part of the job description, Mr. Maxfield.\u201d</p><p>He dried his hands on a dishtowel and tossed it on the counter, pulling me closer. \u201cI\u2019m very aware of the fact that you\u2019re a girl.\u201d His fingers threaded through mine and he restrained both of my hands behind me, gently, pressing them into my lower back. My breathing quickened along with my heart rate as we stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cHow would you get out of this hold, Jacqueline?\u201d His arms surrounded me and my body bowed into his.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you did want to. How would you?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and visualized. \u201cI would knee you in the groin. I would stomp on your instep.\u201d I opened my eyes and calculated our relative heights. \u201cYou\u2019re too tall for me to head-butt, I think. Unless I jump up like they taught us to do in soccer camp.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cGood.\u201d He leaned down, our lips inches apart. \u201cAnd if I kissed you, and you didn\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>I wanted him to so badly my head swam. \u201cI\u2014I would bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he breathed, his eyes closing. \u201cWhy does that sound so good?\u201d</p> <p>I leaned in and up, as close as I could get, but his lips were still out of reach, and my arms\u2014trapped behind me\u2014couldn\u2019t stretch to pull him down. \u201cKiss me and find out.\u201d</p><p>His lips were warm. He kissed me carefully, nibbling and sucking my lower lip. Drawing the tip of my tongue along the inner edge of his mouth, I swept it over the the slim ring, lightly, and he groaned and pulled me in so tight I could barely breathe. My hands were suddenly freed and he grasped my hips, lifting me onto the counter so that our angles were reversed.</p><p>Thrusting my fingers into his hair, I pressed my tongue into his mouth, cautiously, tracing over the hard palate just behind his teeth while wrapping my arms and legs around him. He sucked my tongue into his mouth and I gasped. I\u2019d never kissed anyone like that; I\u2019d never been kissed like that. One hand at the back of my neck, directing me, the other balancing me on the edge of the counter, he coaxed me to do it again and when I did, he caressed my tongue with his own, grazing his teeth over the surface, biting it softly as I withdrew.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I moaned before he drove his tongue into my mouth, finally, and I tightened my grip on him everywhere, wanting to cry from how right it felt.</p><p>Plucking me from the counter, he strode into his room and we fell onto his bed, my legs still locked around him. Braced over me, he kissed me deeply, stroking the interior of my mouth until I was writhing under him. He pulled me up and removed my sweater and I unbuttoned his shirt. Leaving it hanging open, he started to unzip my jeans, stopping to scan my face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was no hesitation in my voice.</p><p>He pulled the zipper down slowly, watching me; I felt the pressure of it as I lay still, panting softly, staring up at him. One hand on my thigh and the other stilled at the base of the zipper, he murmured, \u201cI haven\u2019t tried this with anyone... significant in a long time. It\u2019s never worked before.\u201d</p><p>I tried to rein in the disbelief all too evident in my tone. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex before?\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes and sighed, his hands moving to grip my bare waist. \u201cI have. But not with anyone I cared about or... knew. One-time things. That\u2019s all.\u201d He raised his eyes to mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all\u2014ever?\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly, his fingers running just inside the perimeter of my loosened waistband. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019ve been tons of them. There were more before, in high school, than there have been the past three years.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to reply to that. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything but the feel of his index fingers hooking into the belt loops at the side of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cLucas? I said yes, and I meant it. I want this\u2014as long as you have protection, I mean. I want this, with you. So this is okay.\u201d I was babbling, worried that it would end as it had six days before. I exhaled a breath and spoke just above a whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me to say stop.\u201d</p><p>Staring down at me, he pulled and I lifted my hips. My jeans slid down my legs and he tossed them aside, shrugged out of his shirt and removed his jeans. \u201cI want it to be better than okay. You deserve better than okay.\u201d After grabbing a condom from a box in the nightstand and tossing the small square on the bed, he settled between my legs. I was shivering like I had no experience whatsoever. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking, Jacqueline. Do you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I put my trembling fingers over his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m just a little cold.\u201d And a whole lot nervous.</p><p>He pushed the covers down beneath me and dragged them back up, over us. His weight pressing into me, he kissed me thoroughly before staring into my eyes, his fingers drifting over my face. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, my fears dissolving with his touch, the anticipation climbing faster than it had minutes ago in the kitchen. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As his thumb caressed my temple, his fingertips teased into my hair. His eyes were so pale this close that I could see every fragmented facet. \u201cYou know you can say it.\u201d His voice notched lower, softer. \u201cBut I\u2019m not asking you to, this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I answered, lifting my head to capture his mouth, my hands kneading up and over the hard muscles of his back before trailing my nails down the center from his shoulder blades to his hips.</p><p>His earlier hesitation gone, he removed the last scraps of fabric we were wearing, fixed the condom in place, kissed me fiercely and rocked into me.</p><p>Had this been Kennedy, it would have been over in a few minutes.</p><p>My last coherent thought, as Lucas took his time kissing and touching every part of me he could reach and my body arched into his, was oh... so this is what all the fuss is about.</p><p>We lay facing each other, snuggled under the covers, shoulders peeking out. I watched his gaze drift over my face, stopping on each feature as if he was memorizing it: ear, jaw, mouth... chin, throat, curve of shoulder.</p><p>He came back to my eyes then, lifting his hand and tracing over the individual attributes while watching my response. When his fingers trailed over my lips, they edged the border before rubbing across the lower one, and I swallowed and concentrated on breathing. His eyes fell there and he stared for a long moment before cupping the back of my neck, moving closer and kissing me so softly I hardly felt it, until the thin connection caught and ricocheted through me, shooting to my toes like a current.</p><p>I sighed and our breath mingled. Pushing the covers to my waist, he urged me onto my back before propping his face on his hand and continuing his perusal. My exposed skin should have been cold, but I warmed under his examination. \u201cI want to sketch you like this.\u201d His voice was as gentle as his touch\u2014now skirting across my collarbone, back and forth, before moving lower.</p><p>\u201cCan I assume it won\u2019t end up on the wall?\u201d</p><p>He smirked down at me. \u201cEr, no, this one wouldn\u2019t go on the wall, as tempting a thought as that is. I\u2019ve done several sketches of you that aren\u2019t on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see them?\u201d</p><p>He gnawed his lower lip, fingers tracing along the curves of my breast and then following the bumps of each rib. \u201cNow?\u201d His warm hand curved around my waist and he pulled me closer.</p><p>I looked into his eyes as he lay over me. \u201cMaybe, in a little while...\u201d</p><p>He scooted lower. \u201cGood. \u2019Cause I\u2019ve got a couple things I\u2019d like to do first.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on his dark boxer briefs before padding out to the kitchen. I heard the front door open and close a moment later, his voice a low murmur mixed with Francis\u2019s insistent meows. He came back with a tall glass of milk and a plate of brownie squares.</p><p>Handing me the plate, he took a sip of the milk before setting it on the bedside table. I sat with the sheet held over my breasts and watched him move across the darkening room. He flicked on the desk light and picked up the sketchbook. Stacked in a corner of the desk, there were several just like the one he held.</p><p>In the center of his upper back was a gothic-looking cross, not quite high enough to peek out of a t-shirt neckline. The remaining tats were tiny scripted lines surrounding the cross, not meant to be read from a distance, just like the poem on his left side. His skin was clear from his shoulder blades down. Turning, he caught me studying him\u2014I couldn\u2019t look away, so there was no hiding my appraisal.</p><p>He crawled onto the bed, propping the pillows and sitting behind me, his legs on either side of my hips under the covers. While I lay back against his chest and nibbled a brownie, he opened the sketchbook and flipped through pages, some containing little more than shapes, lines and vague forms, others detailed portrayals of people, objects or scenes. A few were finished and dated, but most were partially complete.</p><p>Finally, he opened to his first sketch of me\u2014which he must have done during class, when I sat next to Kennedy. My chin was propped in my hand, elbow on the desktop. I took the book from him and browsed page by page from there, slowly, amazed at his skill. He\u2019d sketched two of the oldest buildings on university grounds, a guy skateboarding down the drag, and a panhandler on the outskirts of campus talking to a couple of students. Interspersed with these were meticulous illustrations of mechanical things.</p><p>I turned the page to another sketch of me, this one very close-up\u2014facial features and the suggestion of hair, but little else. Scrawled in the bottom corner was a date, two or three weeks before Kennedy dumped me.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you\u2014that I was watching you before you knew me at all?\u201d His tone was guarded.</p><p>I found it impossible to be bothered by anything at the moment, wrapped up in him as I was. I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re just observant, and for some reason you found me an interesting subject. Besides, you\u2019ve sketched a lot of people who didn\u2019t know you were scrutinizing them so closely, I assume.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that makes me feel better or worse.\u201d</p><p>Leaning to the side, propping my head against his inked bicep, I looked up at him. Still clutching the sheet to my chest in a belated show of modesty, or insecurity, I watched his heated gaze flick there before rising to my face. \u201cI\u2019m not mad anymore that you didn\u2019t tell me you were Landon. The only reason I was angry was because I thought you were playing me, but it was the opposite of that.\u201d I let the sheet drop, and his searing gaze dropped with it. Lifting my fingers, I brushed them over the smooth skin along his jaw. He must have shaved just before I came over. \u201cI could never be afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he took the plate from my lap and the sketchbook from my hand before lifting and turning me onto his lap. Arms surrounding me, his mouth moved over my breasts as my hands tangled in his hair. I ignored the reproach in my mind\u2014the one insisting that I was the one withholding information now, and while I might not fear Lucas directly, I feared his desertion if I told him what I knew, and how I knew it.</p><p>Inhaling the now-familiar smell of him, I dragged my fingers across the words and designs on his skin as he kissed me, banishing my shrill pang of conscience to a distant drone.</p> <p>Chapter 23</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s...\u201d Benji\u2019s voice trailed off when I glanced at him, and he finished his sentence with a quick head angle toward Lucas\u2019s unoccupied seat and a characteristic eyebrow waggle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s final review day, so he doesn\u2019t have to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled, leaning over the arm of his desk and lowering his voice. \u201cSo... since you know that bit of inside info, and you two left class together the last couple of days... can I assume that somebody\u2019s getting a little private tutoring now?\u201d When I pinned my lips together, he snorted a laugh, held up a fist and sing-songed, \u201cNailed it!\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I bumped his knuckles with mine, knowing he\u2019d hold his fist aloft between us until I did. \u201cGod, Benji. You\u2019re such a bro-it-all.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned, eyes wide. \u201cWoman, if I was straight, I would steal you from him so hard.\u201d</p><p>We laughed and prepared to take macroeconomics notes for the last time.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacqueline.\u201d Kennedy slid into the empty seat next to me and Benji gave him a narrow-eyed stare that he didn\u2019t deign to notice. \u201cI wanted to give you a heads up.\u201d He sat sideways in the desk, facing me, keeping his voice low. \u201cThe disciplinary committee decided to let him stay on campus for the next week, as long as he abides by the restrictions of the restraining orders\u2014because he\u2019s pled innocent, and because there\u2019s only a week left in the semester. He has to vacate the premises as soon as finals are over, though.\u201d</p><p>I already knew Buck was out on bail, and that he\u2019d been served the temporary restraining order on Thursday afternoon\u2014Chaz had called Erin to tell her, and she\u2019d passed the information to me, as well as to Mindi and her parents.</p><p>\u201cAwesome. So he\u2019s staying in the house?\u201d We\u2019d all hoped he would be kicked off campus, but administration was embracing an innocent-until-proven-guilty stance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, for the next week, but then he\u2019s gone. The frat doesn\u2019t have to be as impartial as university officials do.\u201d He smiled. \u201cApparently D.J. saw the light after Katie told him off. Dean finally agreed. Letting Buck stay for finals week was the only compromise they made\u2014and he\u2019s only allowed to go to his scheduled finals and back.\u201d Laying his warm hand over mine, he stared into my eyes. \u201cIs there... is there anything I can do?\u201d</p> <p>I knew my ex well enough to know what he was actually asking, but there was no second chance for him in my heart. That place was filled, but even if it hadn\u2019t been, I was sure that I\u2019d rather be alone than be with someone who could desert me as he\u2019d done. Twice. I withdrew my hand into my lap. \u201cNo, Kennedy. There isn\u2019t. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shifted his gaze from my face to his knees. Nodding, he looked at me one last time, and I was both gratified and saddened to see the full realization of what we\u2019d lost in his familiar green eyes. Standing to go to his seat, he excused himself to edge past my late-arriving neighbor who, for once, had nothing to say about her weekend plans.</p><p>Freshman year weeded out musicians who\u2019d ruled their high school orchestra, band, or choir without a lot of practice\u2014the ones who came to college believing themselves to be above mundane technical proficiencies like scales and internals, let alone music theory. Most music majors were devoted to perfecting our skills, so we spent hours a week practicing\u2014often hours a day. Nothing was ever perfect enough to risk slacking off.</p><p>I\u2019d come to campus a little spoiled. At home, I\u2019d practiced whenever I wanted to; mom and dad had never limited me, though admittedly, I was reasonable in my practice times. Unable to keep my furniture-sized bass in my dorm room, I had to procure a locker for it in the music building and schedule booth times to play. I quickly learned that evening spots went fast; though the building was open nearly 24/7, I didn\u2019t want to trudge across campus at 2 a.m. to practice.</p><p>Scheduling jazz ensemble rehearsals was even more of a pain. Beginning freshman year, we met two or three times a week. Recently, it had become obvious why Sunday morning studio reservations were easy to get: Sunday was hangover day for much of the student body, and fine arts majors weren\u2019t immune. By halfway through the fall semester, most of us had skipped Sunday morning rehearsal once or twice. What worked freshman year wouldn\u2019t work at all by the time we were juniors.</p><p>Just before the peer recital began on Friday night, I reiterated to one of our horn players why I couldn\u2019t make the hastily assembled last-minute rehearsal on Saturday morning, even though our performance was that evening. \u201cI have a class tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. Your self-defense class. Fine. If we suck tomorrow night, it\u2019s on you.\u201d Henry was undeniably gifted, as if he\u2019d been born with a saxophone in his long-fingered hands. His pompous attitude backed by genuine skill, he usually intimidated the hell out of all of us. In that moment, though, I was tired of him being an ass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Henry.\u201d I glowered at him as he slouched smugly on the other side of Kelly, our pianist, who\u2019d opted to stay out of the argument. \u201cI only missed one rehearsal the entire semester.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cBut it\u2019s about to be two, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Before I could reply, the recital began. I sat back in my seat, gritting my teeth. I was as much of a serious musician as anyone else in our group, but Saturday was the last self-defense class, the culmination of everything we\u2019d learned. It was important.</p><p>Erin was stoked about the one-on-one matches Ralph had planned between each of the class members and either Don or Lucas. \u201cI\u2019ll try to get Don,\u201d she\u2019d promised while she got dressed for work and I got ready for the last mandatory peer recital of the semester. Squinting one eye into the mirror while applying a layer of mascara to the other, she\u2019d teased, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna wreck your boy-toy\u2019s vital parts before you\u2019re done playing with him!\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard from Lucas all day, though we were both so busy that I almost didn\u2019t have time to dwell on the absence of communication and what it meant. Almost.</p><p>A year ago, I hadn\u2019t thought I would ever sleep with anyone but Kennedy. He\u2019d been with other girls before me\u2014if nothing else, his experience during my first time made that clear. That fact hadn\u2019t bothered me, much, though we\u2019d never actually spoken about it. Lucas, too, was obviously experienced, though he told me none of those previous girls had been significant. If Kennedy had ever confessed something like that, I\u2019d have been relieved, if not thrilled. Lucas\u2019s encumbered history made his revelation heartbreaking, instead, and I was uncertain what it meant for him, for me, and for us.</p><p>At the beginning of class, we reviewed every move we\u2019d learned while Ralph circulated the room, giving tips and encouragement. Don and Lucas were absent for the first portion. Ralph wanted us to remain emotionally separated from them, so we wouldn\u2019t feel awkward inflicting violence on them in the last hour. I wondered, though, how many of us wasted precious seconds worrying that we were overreacting\u2014tiny, valuable ticks of time spent not defending ourselves, thinking, but I know this guy.</p><p>My heart in my throat, I watched as each of my classmates used their newfound defense techniques on a fully-padded Lucas or Don. As we took our turns on the mats, each of us benefitted from a bloodthirsty eleven-person cheering section, while the guys took turns so they could rest up from being pummeled, kicked, and verbally reviled. Since the padding cushioned our blows, they had to do a bit of acting\u2014adjusting their reactions as though each landed punch or kick had done its job. So when Erin saw an opening and swung a perfect sweep kick to the groin, Don crumpled to the ground as if incapacitated.</p><p>Eleven voices screamed, \u201cRun! Run!\u201d But Don\u2019s big, padded body blocked a straight escape to the designated \u201csafe zone\u201d by the door, and Erin hesitated for a split second. He rolled toward her and we screamed even louder. Roused, she leapt onto his chest like it was a springboard and launched herself, turning when she landed and kicking him two more times before running away.</p><p>When she reached the far door, she pumped both fists in the air and bounced up and down while everyone cheered. Ralph clapped her on the shoulder as she rejoined us, and I glanced at Lucas. Wearing his ghost smile, he watched her. One more woman, empowered. One more given the ability to defend herself against attack. One more who might not meet his mother\u2019s fate. His eyes found mine, and I wondered if these single, hopeful moments would ever be enough to alleviate the ache that haunted him. The ache about which I was presumably unaware.</p><p>Pulling his gaze from me, he went to wait for the next potential victim to walk onto the mats. There were two of us remaining\u2014a very soft-spoken secretary named Gail from the student health center, and me.</p><p>Ralph eyed the two of us. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Gail stepped forward, trembling visibly. While Ralph murmured subtle tips\u2014something he hadn\u2019t done for anyone else\u2014Lucas went easy on her. Our booklet said that having the confidence to fight back was a critical part of self-defense training, and I knew they were giving her that. The more punches and kicks she landed, the louder we cheered her on, and the harder she fought. When she returned to the group and accepted our emphatic praise, there were tears on her face and she was still wobbly\u2014but she wore a mile-wide smile.</p><p>I went last, against Don. My adrenaline spiked the moment I stepped onto the mat, and I wondered if the tiny shockwaves running through me were visible to everyone, like Gail\u2019s unsteady hands had been as she held her small body in defense mode. I knew Lucas and Erin were watching me closely; they were the only ones who knew exactly what had brought me there.</p><p>The entire thing was over in a minute, maybe two.</p><p>Don circled me once, mumbling hey, baby comments\u2014part of the scenario. I kept my eyes on him, my whole body taut, waiting. Suddenly, he swerved toward me and tried to grab my arm. I did a wrist block, then screwed up a snap kick and ended up in a front bear hug. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was in my head or actually shouted\u2014because everything seemed slow-motion and muted, like we were under water\u2014but I heard Erin\u2019s voice yell, \u201cNUTSACK!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I brought my knee straight up, tearing from Don\u2019s grasp when he grunted and released me. Running to the door, I heard Erin\u2019s cheerleader-voice rising over everyone else\u2019s. She bounded across the room to hug me when I reached the safety zone, and over her shoulder, I watched Lucas\u2019s expression. He\u2019d removed his headgear and combed his sweaty hair back, so I could clearly see his face, and the familiar barely-there smile.</p><p>Lucas: You did well this morning.</p><p>Me: Yeah?</p><p>Lucas: Yeah</p> <p>Me: Thanks</p><p>Lucas: Coffee sunday? Pick you up around 3?</p><p>Me: Sure :)</p><p>Saturday night\u2019s performance demanded my full attention, distracting me until I was in my room. Erin hadn\u2019t returned from yet another sorority gathering, but was due back soon. The entire dorm was wide awake, studying for\u2014or freaking out about\u2014finals, enjoying the last full weekend before break, or well past ready to go home. The voices in the hall alternated between pre-finals tension and pre-holiday excitement.</p><p>A deep-toned bass line seeped through the wall opposite my bed, and my fingers moved with it. Occasionally, the fact that I played the bass would come up with strangers, who typically imagined an electric instrument and a garage band. Lucas looked more suited to that part than I did\u2014dark hair falling into his eyes, small silver ring following the full curve of his bottom lip, not to mention the tattoos and lean, defined muscle that would look so hot onstage, peeking from a thin t-shirt. Or no t-shirt.</p> <p>Oh, God. Never. Getting. To. Sleep.</p><p>My phone beeped and displayed a message from Erin.</p><p>Erin: Talking to Chaz. May be late. You ok?</p><p>Me: I\u2019m good. YOU ok?</p><p>Erin: Confused. Maybe I\u2019d feel better if I just kicked him.</p><p>Me: NUTSACK!!!!!!!!!</p> <p>Erin: Exactly.</p><p>\u201cThose people are crazy.\u201d Knees pulled to my chest, I cuddled close to Lucas as he sketched a couple of kayaks out on the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be even colder out there on the water than it is sitting here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached behind me to pull my coat\u2019s hood up over the wool and cashmere scarf and hat I was wearing. \u201cYou think this is cold?\u201d He crooked an eyebrow at me.</p><p>I scowled and touched my gloved fingers to my nose, which had the anesthetized feeling that comes from a shot at the dentist, right before they drill a tooth. \u201cMy nose is numb! How dare you scoff at my sensitivity to ice-age temperatures. And I thought you were from the coast. Isn\u2019t it warmer there?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he stuck his pencil above his ear, under his cap, closed the sketchpad and laid it on the bench. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely warmer on the coast, but that\u2019s not where I grew up. I\u2019m not sure you could survive a winter in Alexandria if you\u2019re this much of a candy-ass.\u201d</p><p>I gasped in pretend outrage, punching him in the shoulder while he feigned being unable to block the blow.</p><p>\u201cOw, jeez\u2014I take it back! You\u2019re tough as nails.\u201d He turned and slid his arm around me, rewarding me with that full smile. \u201cTotal badass.\u201d</p><p>Between his proximity in the physical sense, and his embrace in the emotional sense, I hummed happily and cuddled closer, closing my eyes. \u201cI throw a mean hammer-fist,\u201d I mumbled into his hoodie. His leather jacket lay folded on the bench next to the sketchbook. He\u2019d insisted it wasn\u2019t cold enough to need it, except on the motorcycle.</p> <p>He echoed my hum, tipping my head back with an ungloved, curiously unfrozen finger. \u201cYou do. I\u2019m actually a little scared of you.\u201d</p><p>Our faces were inches apart, his breath mingling with mine in one evaporative cloud between us. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be scared of me.\u201d The words I couldn\u2019t bring myself to add swirled through my mind: talk to me, talk to me. Barring that, I wanted him to kiss me so I wouldn\u2019t feel the guilt escalate, threatening to spill out in one irrevocable confession. As if I\u2019d made that request aloud, he lowered his head and kissed me softly.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Most people would take off as soon as they handed in the last final. Erin was leaving on Saturday, but I was staying because my favorite middle school student had invited me to his concert Monday night\u2014he\u2019d made first chair, and wanted to show off. We were required to vacate the dorms for winter break by Tuesday, so I would be going home that day, whether I wanted to or not.</p><p>Maggie, Erin and I met in the library to study for our last astronomy exam of the semester. Around 2 am, Maggie flopped face-down onto her open textbook with a dramatic sigh. \u201cUuuuugh... If we don\u2019t take a break from this shit, my brain is going to be a black hole.\u201d</p><p>Erin said nothing, and when I looked at her, she was checking her phone, scrolling through a text, and then replying. She hit send and noticed I was looking at her.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Her brown eyes were a little wide. \u201cUm, Chaz was just letting me know the guys are taking turns keeping an eye on Buck. Making sure he doesn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t talking to Chaz,\u201d Maggie mumbled sleepily\u2014eyes closed, cheek pressed to the page we were reviewing.</p><p>Erin\u2019s eyes landed anywhere but mine, and I knew she\u2019d abandoned that plan. I decided to let her fidget a little longer before I let her off the hook. I\u2019d always liked Chaz and could only fault him so much. I wouldn\u2019t want to believe my best friend was a monster, either.</p><p>Checking my phone, I reread the texts I\u2019d sent Lucas earlier, and his replies.</p><p>Me: Econ final: PWNED</p><p>Lucas: All because of me, right?</p><p>Me: No, because of that Landon guy.</p><p>Lucas: ;)</p><p>Me: My brain hurts. I have three more exams.</p><p>Lucas: One more for me, friday. Then work. See you saturday.</p><p>\u201cMindi\u2019s last final is tomorrow.\u201d Erin doodled a design around an equation in her notebook.</p><p>\u201cI heard her dad is sitting in the hall during all of her finals,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>I\u2019d heard the same rumor. \u201cI can\u2019t blame him, if that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>We watched Erin, who knew the truth between fact and campus gossip. She nodded. \u201cHe is. And she\u2019s not coming back, except to testify. She\u2019s transferring to some small community college back home.\u201d The regret in her eyes was bottomless. \u201cHer mom said she\u2019s still having nightmares every night. I can\u2019t believe I just left her there.\u201d</p><p>Maggie sat up. \u201cHey. We left a lot of people there. It wasn\u2019t our fault, Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d I made Erin look at me. \u201cPut the fault where it goes. On him.\u201d</p><p>I finally told my parents about Buck. I hadn\u2019t talked to them since before Thanksgiving. Due to something left out of order in the pantry, Mom figured out that I\u2019d been home, and called me. I guess she wanted to make sure a stranger hadn\u2019t broken into the house and un-alphabetized her grains and condiments, so I had to fess up.</p><p>\u201cBut... you told me you were going to Erin\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Instead of telling her that she\u2019d come to that conclusion by herself\u2014that I\u2019d only mentioned Erin once, that she\u2019d never bothered to verify what I was actually doing over Thanksgiving break\u2014I lied. It was easier for both of us that way.</p><p>\u201cComing home was a last-minute decision. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>She started jabbering about the things we needed to do over the break\u2014I was due for a dental appointment, and my truck\u2019s registration would expire in January. \u201cDo you need an appointment with Kevin, or have you found a stylist there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Instead of answering her question, I blurted it all out\u2014Buck\u2019s assault in the parking lot, Lucas saving me, Buck raping another girl, the charges we were pressing, the upcoming criminal case. There was no stopping it, once it started.</p><p>At first I thought she hadn\u2019t heard me, and I gripped my phone, thinking I\u2019m not repeating all of that, if she\u2019s too damned busy decorating for her party to listen to me for ten seconds.</p><p>And then she choked out, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>She knew why, I think. I didn\u2019t need to say it. They hadn\u2019t been the best parents; they hadn\u2019t been the worst, either.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m telling you now.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for another strained moment, but I heard her moving through the house. They were hosting their annual catered holiday party on Saturday, and I knew how control-freak and anal Mom was about the house being perfect for that. Growing up, I\u2019d learned to make myself scarce during the entire week leading up to that party.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Marty right now to tell him I\u2019m not coming in tomorrow.\u201d Marty was Mom\u2019s boss at her software consulting firm. \u201cI can be there by eleven.\u201d I recognized the sound of her dragging her wheeled suitcase out from the closet under the stairs.</p><p>I gaped into the phone for a moment before sputtering to life. \u201cNo\u2014no, Mom, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be home in less than a week.\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook when she answered, shocking me further. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jacqueline.\u201d She said my name as though she was trying to find some way to touch me through the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.\u201d My God, I thought, she\u2019s crying? My mother wasn\u2019t a crier. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here for you when you came home. You needed me and I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Alone in my room, I sat on my bed, dazed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. It\u2019s not like you knew.\u201d She\u2019d known about my breakup with Kennedy... but I was ready to let that go, too. \u201cYou raised me to be strong, right? I\u2019m good.\u201d I realized as I said it that it was true.</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2014can I set up an appointment for you, with my therapist? Or one of her partners, if you\u2019d rather?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten Mom\u2019s occasional therapy sessions. She\u2019d been diagnosed with an eating disorder when I was really young. I didn\u2019t even know what it was\u2014bulimia, anorexia? We\u2019d never really talked about it.</p><p>\u201cSure. That would be good.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and I thought I heard relief. I\u2019d given her something to do.</p><p>After we finished several cartons of Chinese takeout and a conversation about how we chose our respective majors, Lucas fished his iPod from his front pocket and handed me the earbuds. \u201cI want you to hear this band I just found. You might like them.\u201d We were sitting on the floor with our backs to my bed. Once I was plugged in, he pushed play, watching me as I listened.</p><p>His eyes locked with mine as the music swelled in my ears. I couldn\u2019t hear anything outside of it, couldn\u2019t see anything but his eyes on me. He leaned closer and I inhaled the soothing scent of him. Cupping my face in his hand, he moved his mouth to mine, kissing me at a leisurely pace that somehow matched the rhythm of the song. He tasted like the wintergreen Tic Tacs he\u2019d been sucking on.</p><p>Handing me the iPod, he picked me up, deposited me on the bed and lay next to me, drawing me into his arms and kissing me until the first song bled into the next, and the next. When he pulled back to trace a finger over the edge of my ear, I removed an earbud and handed it to him. We lay side-by-side on my narrow dorm bed\u2014the length of which only just accommodated the length of his body comfortably\u2014listening together, immersed. He opened a new playlist, and I knew that the song he chose was something for me\u2014beyond a band he wanted to share, or something for us to discuss musically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart reached for him as we listened, staring at each other, and I felt the threads of connection between us\u2014fragile filaments, so easily snapped. Like the poem etched into his side, we were each curving to fit inside the other, and this melting and reshaping could be deeper, more resilient. I wondered if he felt it, and when I listened to the lyrics of this song that he chose, I thought maybe he did. Now don't laugh \u2019cause I just might be... the soft curve in your hardline.</p><p>The hallway outside my door was mostly silent, finally, after a day of people packing up and moving out that had begun early. We talked\u2014recent history only\u2014and Lucas relayed the story of how Francis came to be his roommate. \u201cHe showed up at the door one night, demanding to be let in. Napped on the sofa for an hour, then demanded to be let out. It turned into a nightly ritual, with him staying longer and longer, until at some point I realized he\u2019d moved in. He\u2019s basically the most brazen squatter ever.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and he kissed me, laughing, too. Still smiling, he kissed me again, hands wandering over my waist and hip. As we started to make out, I panted out the fact that Erin wasn\u2019t leaving campus until tomorrow\u2014and therefore could walk in any moment.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said she was leaving today.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cShe was. But her ex-boyfriend is charting a relentless campaign to get her back, and he wanted to see her tonight.\u201d</p><p>His hand wandered under my shirt, exploring. \u201cSo what happened with them? Why did they break up?\u201d</p><p>My lips parted when his hand cupped one breast, molding it to his palm as though it was meant to fit there.</p><p>\u201cOver me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened slightly and I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cNo\u2014not like that. Chaz was... Buck\u2019s best friend.\u201d I hated how my body clenched when I thought of Buck, how my teeth clenched when I said his name. Without even being present, he triggered responses I couldn\u2019t quell, and that infuriated me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone now, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe\u2019s left campus?\u201d Transferring his arm to my back, Lucas pressed me closer, his hand at the back of my neck.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I burrowed my head beneath his chin, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be allowed to come back next semester, even before the trial,\u201d he said.</p><p>I breathed him in, closing my mouth tight and inhaling the scent of him through my nose. I felt sheltered by him. Safe. \u201cI\u2019m always looking over my shoulder. He\u2019s like one of those jack-in-the-box clowns... I never told you about the stairwell, did I?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the only one incapable of suppressing physical reactions. His body stiffened, and his grip on me was suddenly less gentle, more charged. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Mumbling the story into his chest, trying to stick to facts and nothing else so I could temper my own response, I ended with, \u201cHe made it look like we\u2019d done it in the stairwell. And from the looks on everyone\u2019s faces in the hall... from the stories that circulated after... they believed him.\u201d I forced the tears back. I didn\u2019t want to cry over Buck anymore. \u201cBut at least he didn\u2019t get into my room.\u201d</p><p>Quiet for so long that I thought he wasn\u2019t going to comment, he finally pushed me onto my back, wedging one knee between mine and kissing me roughly. His hair tickled the side of my face, and I wrenched my hands\u2014trapped between us\u2014free, plunging them into his hair as though I could pull him closer.</p><p>The way he kissed me felt like a brand. Like he was tattooing himself under my skin.</p><p>He knew all of my secrets, and I knew his.</p><p>But that seeming reciprocity was a lie\u2014because he hadn\u2019t been the one to reveal his own. I\u2019d excavated them, and worse, he was unaware of it.</p><p>My guilt mushroomed between us, along with my longing for him to share that part of himself. To trust me with it. I was going home in three days. I couldn\u2019t bring this up with miles and hours between us, or keep it to myself for weeks longer.</p><p>When we slowed again, wrapped up in each other and allowing our libidos and heart rates time to decelerate, I saw an opening.</p><p>\u201cSo you sort of live with the Hellers, and they\u2019re family friends?\u201d</p> <p>He watched me and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did your parents meet them?\u201d</p><p>Turning onto his back, his teeth slid over the ring in his lip and he sucked it into his mouth. I recognized this as his stress-disclosing equivalent of Kennedy\u2019s neck-rubbing.</p><p>\u201cThey went to college together.\u201d</p><p>The earbuds had been dislodged sometime during the last half hour. He turned the iPod off and wound the wires around it tightly.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve known them all of your life.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the iPod into his front pocket. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Images of what I\u2019d read, and what Dr. Heller had revealed, flashed in front of my eyes. Lucas needed comforting\u2014I\u2019d never known anyone who needed it more\u2014but I couldn\u2019t console him over something he hadn\u2019t shared.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your mother like?\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling, and then closed his eyes, unmoving. \u201cJacqueline\u2014\u201d</p><p>The scrape of a key in the door startled both of us. The room was unlit, except for a low-watt desk lamp. When the door opened, a block of light, filled with Erin\u2019s silhouette, fell across the floor in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cJ, are you already asleep?\u201d She whispered, her eyes still adjusting from the bright hallway, or she\u2019d have seen that I wasn\u2019t alone on the bed.</p><p>\u201cUm, no...\u201d</p><p>Lucas sat up and swung his feet to the floor, and I followed. Timing is everything, I thought.</p><p>After tossing her purse on her bed and kicking off her shoes, Erin turned back toward us. \u201cOh! Hey... er. I think I might have some laundry I need to do...\u201d She shrugged out of her coat and grabbed her nearly-empty laundry basket.</p><p>\u201cI was just leaving.\u201d Lucas bent to pull on his black boots and lace them up.</p><p>Mouthing, Oh my God I\u2019m so sorry! over his head, Erin was the picture of contrition.</p><p>I shrugged and mouthed back, It\u2019s okay.</p><p>Following Lucas into the hall, I gripped my opposite arms, cold after the warmth of lying next to him. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He zipped his leather jacket before turning to me, his lips set firm. His eyes slid from mine and I felt the wall between us then, too late. Our gazes connecting, he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s officially winter break. We should probably use it to take a break from each other as well.\u201d</p><p>I tried to form an intelligible protest, but wasn\u2019t sure what to say. I\u2019d just pushed him to this, after all. \u201cWhy?\u201d The word rasped from me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving town. I will be, too, for at least a week. You need to pack up, and I\u2019ll be helping Charles get final grades posted over the next day or so.\u201d His justification was so logical; there was no concealed thread of emotion I could wrench free. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re back in town.\u201d He bent to kiss me, quickly. \u201cBye, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>As I drove to Lucas\u2019s apartment Sunday night, I reviewed the numerous reasons why popping up unannounced and uninvited was a bad idea: he might not be there, he might be busy, he thinks he scared me away, he thinks we said goodbye. On the other hand, I was only going to be in town until Tuesday morning, and I couldn\u2019t let him dismiss me without a fight.</p><p>After I knocked, I heard the bolt turn and then Lucas\u2019s harsh voice through the door. \u201cWho is it, Carlie? Don\u2019t just open the door\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d The door swung open and a pretty, blonde, dark-eyed girl was framed in the doorway. She blinked at me, clearly waiting for an explanation of who I was and what I wanted. I couldn\u2019t speak. I was sure my heart had lodged itself in my esophagus and stopped beating.</p><p>Lucas came up next to her, scowling. When he saw me, his brows rose into the hair hanging over his forehead. \u201cJacqueline? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>My heart revved to life and I turned to tear down the stairs. Suddenly I was airborne, my bicep caught in his grip, swinging me from the top step as he brought me against his chest and I almost, almost stomped on his instep.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Carlie Heller,\u201d he said into my ear, and I stilled. \u201cHer brother Caleb is inside, too. We\u2019re playing video games.\u201d</p><p>My heart still pounded fight-or-flight as his words sunk in and I slumped against him, feeling like a jealous idiot. I dropped my forehead to his chest. His heart was pounding as hard as mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled against his soft t-shirt. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t have come without telling me, but I can\u2019t be sorry to see you.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. \u201cBut you said...?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were silver under the porch light. \u201cI\u2019m trying to protect you. From myself. I don\u2019t do...\u201d he swung a finger back and forth between us \u201c...this.\u201d</p><p>My teeth chattered when I spoke. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Just because you haven\u2019t before doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t.\u201d Too late, I apprehended a different, more likely reason for his words. \u201cUnless... you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and released his grip on my arm to run both hands through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not... that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrrr! Are y\u2019all coming in, or what? \u2019Cause I\u2019m closing this door.\u201d I peeked around Lucas. Carlie Heller looked young, but she didn\u2019t look that young. She didn\u2019t seem resentful, though. And she appeared to be curious.</p><p>\u201cWell, you asked for it.\u201d Threading his fingers through mine, Lucas turned toward the door and pushed it wider. \u201cWe\u2019re coming in.\u201d</p><p>Carlie darted to a corner of the sofa where Francis lay across a blanket. Scooping him up, she flopped him over her shoulder like he was an inanimate object. After climbing under the blanket, she rearranged the cat on her lap and picked up the controller. Next to her sat a scowling boy with the same dark eyes, a bit younger than (but just as sullen as) my middle school boys.</p><p>\u201cTake all day,\u201d he mumbled in Lucas\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cRude.\u201d Carlie elbowed him and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>Lucas took his controller from the sofa cushion, gesturing for me to sit in the corner opposite Carlie. \u201cGuys, this is my friend, Jacqueline. Jacqueline, these monkeys are Caleb and Carlie Heller.\u201d Carlie and I exchanged hellos and Caleb mumbled something in my direction. I pulled my feet beneath me and watched the game over Lucas\u2019s head.</p><p>When Carlie ushered Caleb out fifteen minutes later, his sulking hadn\u2019t decreased. He glanced back at me. \u201cI can\u2019t have girls alone in my room.\u201d</p><p>She swatted the back of his head. \u201cShut it. Lucas is a grown-up, and you are just a horny pre-adolescent.\u201d</p><p>I tried to disguise my laugh as a cough as Caleb\u2019s face flushed red, and he shot through the door and pounded down the steps.</p><p>Carlie turned to hug Lucas and beam at me. \u201cY\u2019all have a good night,\u201d she chirped, disappearing through the door.</p><p>He watched her walk across the yard and into the house, saying goodnight before shutting and bolting the door. He turned, leaning back against it, and stared at me. \u201cSo. I thought we said we were taking a break?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem angry, but he wasn\u2019t happy, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said we were taking a break.\u201d</p><p>His lips flattened. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to check out of the dorm for several weeks?\u201d</p><p>I remained in my spot on the sofa, curled up into the corner. \u201cYes. I\u2019m only here for two more days.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the ground, his palms flat on the door behind him.</p> <p>I tried to swallow but couldn\u2019t, my speech turning shaky. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you.\u201d His voice was soft, and he didn\u2019t look at me when he spoke. \u201cI lied, earlier, when I said I was protecting you.\u201d His chin came up and we stared at each other across the room. \u201cI\u2019m protecting myself.\u201d He took a visible breath, his chest rising and falling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your rebound, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>The memory of Operation Bad Boy Phase crashed into me. Erin and Maggie had hatched the plan for me to use Lucas to get over Kennedy, as though he had no feelings of his own, and I\u2019d gone along with it. I had no idea then that he\u2019d been watching me the whole semester. That once we began talking, his interest would grow stronger. That finally, he would feel the need to turn away from me because of the depth of those feelings, not because he felt nothing.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you assuming that role?\u201d I unfolded myself from the tight little ball I\u2019d become in the corner of his sofa, and walked across the room, slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I want, either.\u201d As I approached, he remained frozen in place, sucking the ring on his lower lip into his mouth.</p><p>Straightening, he stared down at me as though he thought I might disappear in front of his eyes. His hands came up to cup my face. \u201cWhat am I gonna do with you?\u201d</p> <p>I smirked up at him. \u201cI can think of a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s name was Rosemary. She went by Rose.\u201d</p><p>His disclosure brought me back to earth. Lying pressed to his side, I\u2019d been distractedly tracing the dark red petals over his heart, wondering how to tell him what I knew. Or if. \u201cYou did this in memory of her?\u201d A lump stuck in my throat as my finger outlined the stem.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was low and weighty in the dark room. He was so heavy with secrets that I couldn\u2019t imagine how he survived it day after day, never sharing the burden with anyone. \u201cAnd the poem on my left side. She wrote it. For my dad.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung. No wonder his father had shut down. From what Dr. Heller told me, Ray Maxfield was a logical, analytical person. His only emotional exception must have been his wife. \u201cShe was a poet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p> <p>My head on his arm, I watched his ghost smile appear in profile, and it looked different from that angle. His face was scruffy, unshaved, and several places on my body boasted the slightly chafed evidence of it.</p><p>\u201cUsually, she was a painter.\u201d</p><p>I fought to ignore my conscience, which wouldn\u2019t quit babbling that I should tell him what I knew. That I owed him the truth. \u201cSo she\u2019s responsible for those artist genes all mixed up with your engineering parts, eh?\u201d</p><p>Turning onto his side, he echoed, \u201cEngineering parts? Which parts might that be?\u201d A mischievous smile tugged at his mouth.</p><p>I arched a brow and he kissed me.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any of her paintings?\u201d My fingers followed an orbit around the rose, and the hard muscle beneath it flexed with my touch. Pressing my hand to his skin, I absorbed the measured thump-thump of his heart.</p><p>\u201cYeah... but they\u2019re either in storage, or displayed in the Heller\u2019s place, since they were close friends of my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad isn\u2019t still friends with them?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, watching my face. \u201cHe is. They were my ride home at Thanksgiving. They can\u2019t get him to come here, so every other year, they all go there.\u201d</p><p>I thought about my parents and the friends and neighbors with whom they socialized. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t have any friends close enough to be incorporated into actual holidays.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling. \u201cThey were all really close\u2014before.\u201d</p><p>His grief was so tangible. I knew in that moment that he\u2019d not worked through it\u2014not at all in the eight years it had been. His protective wall had become a fortress holding him hostage rather than giving sanctuary. He might never fully recover from the horror of what happened that night, but there had to be a point where it wouldn\u2019t consume him.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I need to tell you something.\u201d His heart drummed under my hand, slow and steady.</p><p>Other than shifting his gaze to me, he didn\u2019t move, but I felt his withdrawal as he waited. I assured myself that the disconnection was all in my mind\u2014a product of my guilt and nothing more.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know how you lost your mother, and I could tell it upset you to talk about it. So... I looked online for her obituary.\u201d My breathing went shallow as the seconds ticked by and he said nothing.</p><p>Finally, he spoke, and his voice was undeniably flat and cold. \u201cDid you find your answer?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, but my voice was a whisper. \u201cYes.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hear myself over the rapid thud of my heartbeat.</p><p>He shifted his eyes from me and lay back, biting his lip, hard.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and exhaled, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my next confession.</p><p>I closed my eyes and blurted it out. \u201cI talked to Dr. Heller about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His body was like rock against mine.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I\u2019m sorry if I invaded your privacy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d He shot up, unable to look at me, and I sat, pulling the covers up with me. \u201cWhy would you go talk to him? Weren\u2019t the gory details in the news reports sickening enough for you? Or personal enough?\u201d He pulled on his boxers and jeans, his movements rough. \u201cDid you want to know how she looked when they found her? How she\u2019d bled out? How even when my dad ripped out the carpet with his bare hands\u2014\u201d he exhaled harshly \u201c\u2014there was a yard-wide circle of bloodstained flooring underneath that couldn\u2019t be sanded deep enough to get it all?\u201d His voice broke and he stopped talking.</p><p>In shock and out of words, I could hardly breathe. He sat on the edge of the bed, silent, his head in his hands. He was so close that I could have reached out to stroke the cross that ran along his spine, but I didn\u2019t dare. I scooted carefully from the bed and got dressed. I pulled on my UGGs and walked to stand at the foot of the bed.</p><p>His elbows pressed into his thighs, his hands obscuring his face like blinders. I stared at the dark hair grazing his shoulders, the flexed muscles of his arm and the ink circling his bicep and flowing down his forearm, his beautiful, lean torso and the words etched into his side like a brand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d I surprised myself, uttering the words with a steady voice.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I thought he would say no, or say nothing. I was wrong, either way.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The tears started flowing then, but he couldn\u2019t see them. He didn\u2019t move from his position on the bed. I couldn\u2019t even be angry, because I\u2019d crossed a line and I knew it, and meaning well wasn\u2019t good enough. I grabbed my purse and keys from the kitchen table and my coat from the sofa, ears pricked for the sound of him coming after me, telling me to stay. There was nothing but silence from his room.</p><p>When I opened the door, Francis shot inside, along with a burst of cold air. I pulled the door shut behind me before a sob broke free. Gulping the frigid air and wondering how I\u2019d managed to screw this up so thoroughly, I was determined not to cry until I was in my truck. I slid my hand along the railing as I rushed clumsily down the steps, because I couldn\u2019t see through the combination of a moonless night and my tears. A splinter pierced my hand two steps from the bottom.</p><p>\u201cOw! Dammit.\u201d The physical pain provided the ideal excuse for the sobbing to start. I sprinted down the long, curved driveway, unsuccessful in my attempt to curb my tears long enough to get into the truck. \u201cDamn. Damn. Damn. Fuck.\u201d I jammed my key into the lock by feel.</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. That was the first thing I thought when I felt myself propelled across the bench seat. That was where the resemblance ended, though.</p><p>Buck shut the door behind him and slapped the automatic lock. His weight immobilized my lower legs and he had my left wrist in his hand before I could make out who he was, though I knew. \u201cGood enough to spread your legs for anybody but me, huh Jackie?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>On my back, with my head at an awkward angle against the passenger door, I jerked at my arm and struggled without success to move my legs. \u201cGet off!\u201d I yelled the words, knowing they would be meaningless to him. I was parked in the street\u2014too far for anyone else to hear me. \u201cGet out of my truck!\u201d I\u2019d dropped my keys onto the truck floor when he\u2019d shoved me into the truck, and I searched the floor with my right hand, intending to use them as a weapon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He grabbed my right wrist and shook his head like he could read my mind. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere until we\u2019re done talking. You and your lying cunt friend have ruined my fucking life.\u201d</p><p>And then, I heard Ralph\u2019s voice in my head. Your body is already a weapon. You just need to know how to use it. Abruptly, I stopped struggling and took stock: I couldn\u2019t kick. I could possibly get my wrists free by rotating and jerking them straight down, but then what? He would just grab me again, immobilize me further.</p><p>I needed him closer\u2014the last thing I would naturally seek. I turned my eyes away.</p><p>\u201cListen to me when I\u2019m talking to you, goddammit!\u201d He grabbed my chin roughly, his fingers digging in as he leaned over me and forced me to face him.</p><p>Right hand free.</p><p>While shoving my hand between us, grabbing and twisting his balls and yanking up as hard as I could, I slammed my forehead into his nose with as much force as I could manage in a straight upward trajectory.</p><p>The night in the frat parking lot, everything had happened so quickly that getting my bearings was impossible until it was over. This time, everything was in slow motion\u2014so for an impossibly stretched space of time, I was positive that nothing I\u2019d just done had worked.</p><p>And then he screamed, and his nose started gushing. I had never seen so much blood so close-up. It poured out of him as though I\u2019d opened a faucet full-blast.</p><p>Left hand free.</p><p>He was listing to the side. Still yanking up on his balls, I raised my left knee and turned into him, shoving his shoulder with my left hand. He fell sideways into the cramped crevice in front of my truck\u2019s bench seat. The feeling rushed back into my legs, tremors wracking through me, and I went for the door, shoving it open so violently that it almost bounced all the way back.</p><p>Just before I cleared the door, his right hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, like the never-quite-dead psycho in a horror movie. I spun and smashed my fist down on the sensitive spot on his upper forearm, inches down from his the crook of his arm, and he released me, bellowing angrily and attempting to flail himself into an upright position.</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to see if he succeeded. I vaulted from my truck and ran. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This would have been an ideal time to scream, but I could barely gasp breaths. I heard his footsteps pounding unevenly behind me and I focused on Lucas\u2019s door at the top of those steps. I was halfway down the driveway when Buck lunged from behind and grabbed at my hair, yanking me to a stop painfully. I yelped as we went down, immediately turning onto my side as Lucas had taught me, dislodging him.</p><p>Suddenly, Lucas was there. Like a dark avenging angel, he yanked Buck away from me and threw him, and then installed himself between us. I scrambled backwards, crab-like. He spared me one glance, his colorless eyes flaring in the dim light cast by the flood lights at the side of the house, before he turned back to Buck, who\u2019d rolled to his feet. Blood coated the space between his nose and mouth and was smeared on his chin, but there was little on him aside from that.</p><p>A second floodlight at the corner of the house popped on, illuminating the scene.</p><p>Panting, I glanced down at my chest and started. My pink and white knit shirt was stained dark from the neckline to the top of my belly. Because of our positions when I\u2019d slammed Buck\u2019s nose, my chest had caught the majority of blood that gushed from his face.</p> <p>I battled the urge to rip my shirt off in the Heller\u2019s front yard.</p><p>Crouching, he tried to circle Lucas. Rather than turn with him, Lucas moved sideways, remaining with his back to me, blocking Buck from getting any closer to me.</p><p>Buck\u2019s voice was a gruff snarl. \u201cI\u2019m gonna bust that lip wide open, emo-boy. I\u2019m not fucked up this time. I\u2019m stone-cold sober, and I\u2019m gonna kick your ass before I fuck your little whore nine ways from Sunday\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>Lying bastard.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t rush him, and didn\u2019t respond at first, and then I heard his very controlled voice. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Buck.\u201d Never shifting his eyes from him, Lucas unzipped his leather jacket, shrugged it off and tossed it aside. As he shoved the sleeves of the dark long-sleeved t-shirt above his elbows, I noted the worn jeans he\u2019d pulled on earlier and the shit-kicker cowboy boots he grabbed when he was in a hurry, because they didn\u2019t require the time-suck that lacing his black combat boots involved.</p> <p>Buck threw a wide punch and Lucas blocked it. He tried again with the same result, and then rushed forward to pin Lucas in a hold. One kidney punch and left ear cuff later, and Buck staggered to the side, pointing at me. \u201cBitch. Think you\u2019re too good for me\u2014but you\u2019re nothing but a whore.\u201d</p><p>Lucas tracked him, staying between us. When Buck jabbed, Lucas grabbed his forearm and turned, wrenching Buck\u2019s arm in a direction arms aren\u2019t meant to go before turning him to deliver a quick uppercut to the jaw. Buck\u2019s head rotated so far he was almost looking backward over his shoulder. He turned back and Lucas snapped another blow straight into his lip. Holding his defensive stance and cocking his head once to each side, Lucas\u2019s ghost smile took on a menace it didn\u2019t imply when he turned it on me.</p><p>Buck roared and lunged forward, and they went down. Height-wise, they were evenly matched. Weight-wise, Buck had a clear forty or fifty pound advantage, and he used it to pin Lucas, punching him in the side of the head twice before Lucas twisted, tossing Buck onto the top of his skull. Flopping onto his back, Buck shook his head twice, like he was trying to clear it.</p><p>Lucas tackled him, held him down, and slugged him four times in quick succession. The sound made me think of dad texturing steaks, and my stomach turned. Buck\u2019s face was quickly becoming unrecognizable, and though I couldn\u2019t feel sorry for it, I was afraid Lucas was crossing into what might be construed as deadly force.</p><p>\u201cLandon! Stop!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Heller was tearing down the driveway.</p> <p>He pulled Lucas off Buck, who wasn\u2019t moving. For a split second, Lucas fought back, and I was afraid Dr. Heller was toast, but I\u2019d underestimated my professor and his Special Forces background. His arms a band around Lucas\u2019s chest and arms, he barked, \u201cStop. She\u2019s safe. She\u2019s safe, son.\u201d When Lucas sagged, Dr. Heller loosened his hold.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes found me instantly and he lurched in my direction. Sirens sounded in the distance, closing in quickly. I heard them turn down the far end of the street at the same time Lucas dropped to the grass beside me. He was shaking violently, the adrenaline still pumping through him with nowhere to go. Breathing heavily, he stared at me, lifting a hand cautiously, like he was afraid I might recoil.</p><p>My jaw throbbed, and I deduced from his expression that it must have looked bad. His fingers grazed over it and I flinched. He snatched his hand back and I came up on my knees.</p><p>\u201cPlease touch me. I need you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to ask twice. His arms came around me, pulling me onto his lap and cradling me against his chest. \u201cHis blood? From his nose?\u201d He pulled the shirt away from my chest, and it stuck, the blood already drying, to the bra underneath, and my skin.</p><p>I nodded, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d His arms slid around me again. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so fucking amazing.\u201d</p><p>I thought of Buck\u2019s blood on my skin and I pulled at the shirt as my stomach heaved again. \u201cI want it off. I want it off.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed. \u201cYes. Soon.\u201d His fingers moved gently over my face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jacqueline. Jesus Christ, I can\u2019t believe I sent you out the door like that.\u201d He choked up, his chest rising and falling. \u201cPlease forgive me.\u201d</p><p>As he caressed me, I turned my head under his chin, folding into him as small as I could get. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for looking her up. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, baby... not now. Just let me hold you.\u201d He pulled me tighter still after grabbing his jacket from the grass nearby and draping it over me, and we stopped speaking.</p><p>An ambulance arrived, and the EMTs roused Buck, who at least wasn\u2019t dead. Arms crossed dispassionately, one of the officers monitored his care as he was transferred onto a stretcher while his partner conferred with Dr. Heller over the altercation.</p><p>\u201cLan\u2014Lucas,\u201d he called. \u201cYou and Jacqueline need to give your statements now, son.\u201d Lucas stood carefully, pulling me up with him, supporting me fully. Dr. Heller reached a hand to his shoulder. \u201cThis young man is the son of my closest friend. He rents the apartment over the garage.\u201d He glanced at us with an odd look before continuing. \u201cAs I said, that fella\u2014\u201d he pointed at Buck, who was being loaded into the ambulance \u201c\u2014has a restraining order filed against him on behalf of this young lady, which he violated by coming to her boyfriend\u2019s home.\u201d Ah, there was the reason for the look.</p><p>The officers\u2019 eyes widened when they took in my bloody shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s his blood,\u201d I said, pointing toward the ambulance.</p><p>One of them smiled and echoed Lucas. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into Lucas, and he tightened his arms around me. The officers, already softened by Dr. Heller, couldn\u2019t have been more sympathetic. Twenty minutes and all of our statements later, they, and Buck, were gone, and Lucas and I were gathering my things from my truck and the road after assuring Dr. Heller and his family that we would see to each other\u2019s injuries.</p><p>Without speaking, Lucas led me up the stairs, into his apartment and straight into the bathroom. He turned on the shower and lifted me onto the counter to pull off my boots and socks. Without pausing, he removed my shirt and bra and tossed them in the trash. His shirt, speckled with droplets of blood\u2014both his and Buck\u2019s\u2014followed.</p><p>Standing between my knees, he turned my face towards the light and inspected my jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bruise. We\u2019ll put some ice on it to get the swelling down, after you shower.\u201d His jaw clenched tight. \u201cDid he... hit you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, which made it throb a bit. \u201cJust grabbed it really hard. It\u2019s sore, but actually the spot where I head-butted him hurts more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d He brushed the hair back from my face and kissed my forehead so gently I couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. I want you to tell me about it, when you can... and when I can stand to hear it. I\u2019m still too angry right now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers over the back of my neck. \u201cI knew I\u2019d fucked up. I was getting on my bike, coming after you\u2014and then you were running up the driveway.\u201d His jaw compressed and flexed. \u201cWhen he tackled you... I wanted to kill him. I think if Charles hadn\u2019t stopped me, I would have killed him.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t move from the counter until he\u2019d undressed. He pulled me down, slid my jeans and underwear off, and led me to the shower, where he washed and inspected every part of me. We were both bruised and abraded in unexpected places, and I could barely lift my arms.</p><p>\u201cThat's normal,\u201d he said, wrapping a towel around his waist and folding another around me. \"During a fight, you don\u2019t realize all the places you catch a punch, land wrong, or slam into something. The adrenaline deadens it\u2014temporarily.\u201d</p><p>His dark hair grazed his shoulders, dripping lines of water down his back and chest. He sat me down to dry my hair, and I watched as thin rivulets snaked over his inked skin, flowing over the rose, cutting through the scripted words, and moving into the line of hair on his abdomen before finally soaking into the towel.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cThe last time anyone dried my hair for me was in sixth grade, when I broke my arm.\u201d</p><p>He lifted each strand gently, pressing the towel around it to absorb the water without tangling it. \u201cHow did you break it?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI fell out of a tree.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the sound reduced the pain of every sore place on my body to the dullest ache. \u201cYou fell out of a tree?\u201d</p><p>I squinted up at him. \u201cI think there was a boy and a dare involved.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>He squatted in front of me. \u201cStay here tonight, Jacqueline. I need to keep you here, at least tonight. Please.\u201d He took one of my hands in his, and I brought the other to his face, wondering how his eyes could look like chipped ice and still warm me to my core. A bruise was forming near one eye, and the skin was scuffed and split high on his cheekbone, but his face was otherwise unhurt.</p><p>His next words were a whisper. \u201cThe last thing my father said to me, before he left, was, \u2018You\u2019re the man of the house while I\u2019m gone. Take care of your mother.\u2019\u201d My eyes filled with tears and so did his. He swallowed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t protect her. I couldn\u2019t save her.\u201d</p><p>I pulled his head to my heart and folded my arms over him. On his knees, his arms slid around me while he cried. As I stroked his hair and held him tight, I knew this night had struck a chord at the heart of his pain. What tormented Lucas went further than the horror of that night eight years ago. What haunted him was guilt, however insanely misplaced.</p><p>When he grew quiet, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay tonight. Will you do something for me, too?\u201d</p><p>He fought back his instinctive wariness\u2014I\u2019d seen him do this before, but never from such close range. He inhaled a shaky breath, shoring up his courage. \u201cYes. Whatever you need.\u201d His voice was gritty and hoarse. When his tongue rolled over his lip ring, I wanted him so badly that it was difficult to waste time talking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo with me to Harrison\u2019s concert tomorrow night? He\u2019s my favorite eighth-grader, and I promised him I\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow and blinked. \u201cUm. Okay. Is that all?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>He shook his head and stood, leveling the ghost smile on me. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab a couple of ice packs from the freezer. Why don\u2019t you go get in bed?\u201d</p> <p>I stood, laying my hand on his chest and staring up at him. \u201cIs that a dare?\u201d</p><p>He laid one hand over mine and pulled me closer with the other. Leaning down, he kissed me gently. \u201cIt absolutely is. No falling out of it allowed, though.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>The middle-school auditorium was packed with camcorder-wielding parents, bored siblings, and a smattering of grandparents. Skirting around clusters of people standing in the aisle, Lucas and I took aisle seats halfway between the stage and the back exit doors. I glanced down at the photocopied holiday green program. Harrison was in the highest orchestra, which meant it would be a while before he was onstage. I gave lessons to two of the other boys in the lower orchestras, though, and I\u2019d never had the chance to see any of them actually perform. I was nervous on all of their accounts.</p><p>I leaned close to Lucas so no parents would overhear. \u201cI should probably warn you that many of these kids have only been playing a few months\u2014especially in the first orchestra\u2014so they might be a little... inexpert.\u201d</p> <p>The corner of his mouth turned up, and I wanted to lean up and kiss him, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs that your polite way of saying to prepare for some nails-on-a-chalkboard sounds?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I heard Harrison\u2019s voice then from a roped-off section on the right side of the auditorium. \u201cMiss Wallace!\u201d I searched for him amongst a sea of black polyester-tuxedoed boys, and girls with ankle-length school-color purple dresses. I located his blond head about the same time he noticed Lucas sitting next to me. His wave froze and his eyes widened. When I smiled and lifted my hand, he waved back once, dolefully.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is one of the ones crushing on you.\u201d Lucas stared down at the boot balanced on his knee, scratching at a worn seam and trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat? They all crush on me. I\u2019m a hot college girl, remember?\u201d I laughed and his eyes burned into mine.</p><p>He leaned in close and whispered into my ear. \u201cSo hot. Now you\u2019ve got me thinking what you looked like this morning, when I woke up with you in my arms, in my bed. Would it be too greedy to ask you to stay tonight, too?\u201d</p> <p>My face warmed from his compliment as I met his gaze. \u201cI was afraid you weren\u2019t going to ask.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and held it, balanced on my thigh, as the orchestra director took the stage.</p><p>An hour and a half later, Harrison found me at the back of the auditorium. He was holding a cluster of long-stemmed red roses, the color of which were identical to the blotchy, embarrassed shade of his face.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you these,\u201d he stammered, thrusting the flowers into my arms. His parents stood about fifteen feet away, allowing him to deliver his gift alone.</p><p>I took the roses and smelled them as he shifted a cursory look at Lucas. \u201cThank you, Harrison. These are beautiful. You made me so proud tonight\u2014your vibrato was awesome.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tried not to, which gave him a sort of manic appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s all \u2019cause of you, though.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou did the work, and put in the practice.\u201d</p><p>He shifted from one foot to the other.</p> <p>\u201cYou sounded great, man. I wish I could play an instrument,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Harrison eyed him. \u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled, frowning. Even though my student was taller than me, he was lanky next to Lucas\u2019s filled-out frame. \u201cDid that hurt? On your lip?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cNot too much. I said a few choice four-letter words, though.\u201d</p><p>Harrison smiled. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>As we lay in the semi-dark hours later, we faced each other, sharing his pillow. I took a deep breath and prayed I wasn\u2019t about to drive Lucas away again. I\u2019d never felt more connected to anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think of Harrison?\u201d</p><p>He studied me closely. \u201cHe seems like a good kid.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe is.\u201d I trailed my fingers along the side of his face, and he pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d He smirked. \u201cAre you leaving me for Harrison, Jacqueline?\u201d</p><p>Watching his eyes, I asked, \u201cIf Harrison had been in that parking lot that night, instead of you, do you think he\u2019d have wanted to help me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes locked to mine. He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIf someone had told him to watch out for me, do you think they would ever, ever blame him, if he\u2019d not been able to stop what would have happened that night?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lucas. You\u2019re hearing it, but you don\u2019t know it. There\u2019s no way your father actually expected that of you. There\u2019s no way he even remembers saying that to you. He blames himself, and you blame yourself, but neither of you is to blame.\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled and he swallowed heavily, his grip on me hard. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how she sounded that night.\u201d His voice was choked with tears. \u201cHow can I not blame myself?\u201d</p><p>My tears spilled over onto the pillow between us. \u201cLucas, think about Harrison. See yourself for the boy you were, and quit blaming him for not stopping something a grown man might have been unable to stop. What have you told me, over and over? It wasn\u2019t your fault. You need to talk to someone, and figure out how to forgive yourself for responsibility your mother never would have wanted you to accept. Will you try? Please?\u201d</p><p>He brushed my tears from my face. \u201cHow did I find you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m exactly where I should be after all.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving me.\u201d Erin plopped next to me on the Heller\u2019s sofa. Lucas\u2019s graduation party was a backyard cookout, and we were escaping the heat and humidity for a few precious, air-conditioned minutes.</p><p>I leaned my head on her tan shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go with me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and leaned her head on top of mine. \u201cThat\u2019s as silly of an idea as you staying here. You have to go do your great things, and I have to stay here and do mine. That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck, though.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d applied to three music conservatories for transfer in the fall. None of it felt real until after the audition that I nailed at Oberlin\u2014my top choice\u2014and the email I received a couple of weeks ago, notifying me that I\u2019d been accepted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you need to stay here and keep an eye on Chaz, too.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s opposition to Chaz\u2019s breakup-reversal efforts ended on Valentine\u2019s Day, when he\u2019d shown up with reservations for \u201ctheir\u201d B&amp;B, after having flowers delivered every day for two weeks, turning our dorm room into a hothouse. With Erin\u2019s help, Chaz had weathered his ex-best friend\u2019s impending rape trial\u2014and the associated rumors and innuendoes. Buck\u2019s recent pre-trial plea bargain for a lesser assault charge was a relief to everyone, though he probably wouldn\u2019t serve half of his two-year sentence.</p><p>Through the open French doors, we watched our boyfriends talking in the back yard. They\u2019d never be best friends, but they got along well, as opposite as they appeared.</p><p>Lucas had been so sure, when he\u2019d encouraged me to apply for transfer into music performance programs, that we would be fine. He was still sure, and I believed him, but that didn\u2019t mean I wanted a two-year long-distance relationship. Dead-set against me making an academic decision based on his plans, he wouldn\u2019t accept me staying, and he wouldn\u2019t tell me where he\u2019d applied or interviewed for jobs.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask you to give up what you want for me, Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you,\u201d I\u2019d mumbled, knowing he was right; I had no logical defense. In some ways, he was his father\u2019s son.</p><p>Ray Maxfield had become one of my favorite people. Lucas had taken me home over spring break, and I\u2019d never seen him more nervous. For some reason, though, his father and I hit it off. I could see Lucas\u2019s tutor persona in him\u2014his dry sense of humor and intelligence. The night before we left, Ray rummaged through the beach house attic and brought down a trio of framed watercolors of a small boy playing on the seashore. Rosemary had signed the paintings of her only child in the corners of each\u2014Rosemary Lucas Maxfield. We\u2019d hung them in Lucas\u2019s bedroom, over his desk.</p><p>Even stranger, Ray was sitting outside with Charles and Cindy. He\u2019d taken a break from the fishing boat for his son\u2019s graduation\u2014his first since he\u2019d left Alexandria.</p><p>\u201cI accepted a job on Friday.\u201d</p><p>This was it. After applying for dozens of jobs during his final semester, Lucas had several interviews, and a few second interviews. A week ago, I\u2019d overheard Charles telling Cindy that he\u2019d gotten a solid offer from an engineering firm in town. I\u2019d been waiting for him to tell me.</p><p>When I left for Oberlin in August, we would be twelve hundred miles apart.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I avoided looking at him, afraid I would burst into tears.</p><p>Stuffing the leftovers Cindy sent with us into his fridge, I made no further comment, and he leaned against the kitchen counter, watching me. Finally, everything was stored away, and I couldn\u2019t delay the inevitable any further.</p><p>At the look on my face, he caught my hand. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>As he led me to the sofa, I blinked back tears and gave myself a stern lecture that mostly consisted of stop crying stop crying stop crying.</p><p>Leaning into the corner, he pulled me into his arms. I halfway listened as he relayed the technical aspects of the job, the size of the company, the impressive pay, and the start date\u2014the second week in July. Mostly I was wondering how often I would have the time to fly home. Free weekends were almost unheard of as a music student. Mandatory recitals and performances to perform or attend were unremitting.</p><p>\u201cSo my only question is this\u2014do I want to live in Oberlin and commute to Cleveland, or live near Cleveland and commute to you?\u201d His head propped on one bent arm, he gazed at me, waiting.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled innocently. \u201cOh\u2014didn\u2019t I tell you that part? The company\u2019s located in Cleveland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleveland, Ohio? You accepted a job in Cleveland, Ohio?\u201d Cleveland was just over half an hour away from the college.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with tears. \u201cBut, why?\u201d</p><p>Arching a brow, he brought his free arm down and hooked my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou heard the pay, right? And also, to be near you.\u201d Thumbing a tear from my cheek, he added, \u201cMostly, to be near you.\u201d</p><p>I considered everything I\u2019d learned from following Kennedy, everything Lucas had sworn he\u2019d never ask of me. \u201cBut all that stuff you said about me not giving up what I want to be or what I want to do to be with you\u2014doesn\u2019t that apply to you, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>He cupped my face in his palm and stared into my eyes, sighing. \u201cFirst, this is a great job, and I\u2019m excited about it.\u201d When he tugged me closer and kissed me, I leaned across his chest, one hand slipping under his t-shirt. I forgot that he hadn\u2019t finished his explanation until he whispered into my mouth, \u201cSecond, I\u2019m ambitious, but I can succeed almost anywhere.\u201d Standing, he continued kissing me as he carried me into his room. When he let me slide from his arms to the floor, I yanked my tank top off, scooting into the center of the bed and watching him pull his t-shirt over his head. I could put him on replay doing that and watch it all day... if I didn\u2019t know what was coming next.</p><p>Crawling up from the foot of the bed, he lay over me slowly, dragging both of my arms above my head, gently, as he had the very first time he sketched me. With one hand, he crossed and secured my wrists. He\u2019d taught me every possible way to escape this hold, but there was no way I wanted to get away. He was in a slow-motion mood\u2014one of my favorites, though it meant I\u2019d be driven crazy before we were done. I chewed the edge of my lip in anticipation.</p><p>He stared down at me, and I examined his beautiful eyes up close, something I\u2019d never tire of doing. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t do anywhere is be with you.\u201d Leaning closer, he ran his tongue over my lips and his fingertips over my skin until I arched up and captured his mouth with mine.</p><p>He released my wrists, and I wrapped my arms around his neck, feeling our hearts beat in sync as lips followed a meandering path from my ear down. \u201cChoosing to be with you isn\u2019t a difficult decision, Jacqueline,\u201d he breathed, pulling back one final time to stare into my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. Incredibly easy.\u201d</p>   </body></html>"]
