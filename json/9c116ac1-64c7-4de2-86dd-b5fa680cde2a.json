He knew he was being a grouch, but it was only the third day of their little vacation, and he wasn\u2019t ready to take off back home just because some stupid alarm had gone off signaling a minor break-in at the barn back home. Theneighbor who\u2019d been watching things for them called and said he had taken care of everything, and there was no need to interrupt their trip. Still, nothing would satisfy his mother except to get up in the middle of the night and head back home.</p><p>Gabe turned into the rest stop area on the highway, bumping along on the flat tire. They\u2019d taken his mother\u2019s car rather than his old truck, and she\u2019d neglected to tell him before they left thatthe spare was flat. She\u2019d dropped that little tidbit only after the tire blew in the middle of nowhere. They\u2019d be lucky if the rim wasn\u2019t destroyed.</p><p>He got the car as close as he could to the rest rooms, and she hopped out with a fond, apologetic glance back at him.\u201cGo get yourself something to drink and a candy bar, honey, while you\u2019re waiting. You always get grouchy when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d She hurried up the sidewalk to the deserted rest rooms.</p> <p>Gabe sighed and got out of the car to stretch. He\u2019d taken his mother on a week-long trip to the North Georgia mountains as a celebration that summer had arrived, and school was over for another semester.</p><p>His mother and father had been to these same mountains years ago on their honeymoon. With his father gone, this was a trip of nostalgia for her. She\u2019d spent the days shopping in the little stores, and Gabe put in some time at the motel pool, working on his tan. It had been a nice, relaxing trip after his grueling finals, and he was looking forward to a summer\u2019s break from school.</p><p>When their neighbor called in the middle of the night, his mother insisted on getting up and driving home, despite the hour, and despite his vehement protests. He was still a little angry they couldn\u2019t have stayed a couple more days. After all, he\u2019d turned down a trip with his friends to the beaches in Florida to take his mom on this trip, and she was ruining this for him too.</p><p>Gabe walked toward the vending machines to get something to drink, but before he could get to them he heard a strange animal-like growling coming from behind him. It sounded close\u2014 very close. He whirled around to look, but saw nothing. The woods beyond the paved area were dark and deep, but he could see nothing moving. The quiet surroundings made the howl that vibrated through the air next all the more blood-curdling. His reasoning mind told him it probablywasn\u2019t anything to worry about. It had to be some coyote that ventured a bit too close to the rest area. Then a second howl shot reason all to hell. Gabe trotted back for the safety of the car, but not soon enough. A dark form slammed into him, knocking him down with a vicious swipe of teeth grazing his shoulder. Gabe threw his arms up instinctively, only to feel fangs sink deeply into his forearm, as his head struck the pavement. The feel of saliva dripping in his face was the last clear thing he knew for a few horrifying minutes. He was vaguely aware of someone screaming as he tried to fight the monster off. The world tilted. He was flipped from his back to his stomach and his faceslammed down on the pavement. He didn\u2019t know anything else until he came to, covered in his own blood, headlights shining on him. His mother\u2019s still form lay beside him on the sidewalk, and men shouted as they ran toward them. Gabe crawled to his mother, grinding his teeth so as not to scream in pain, refusing to accept what was happening, too overwhelmed with the shock.</p><p>\u201cI pulled in here to make a trafficstop and saw the guy on top of you,\u201d someone said, touching him lightly on the shoulder as another uniformed officer knelt beside his mother.</p> <p>Gabe tried to sit up, crying out in pain, too devastated for tears as he watched the officers make a valiant attempt to save his mother. A trucker who seemed to come from nowhere tried to stop the bleeding from themost obvious and worst of Gabe\u2019s wounds on his arms and shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that thing?\u201d the trucker asked.</p><p>\u201cSome freakin a Halloween costume, I guess,\u201d the officer answered, still panting for breath.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what did he use to cut them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The officer glanced up at Gabe, his eyes drifting down to his nakedness from the waist down and darting quickly away.\u201cSorry, son, she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>With a pool of blood spreading beneath where he sat and a scream starting in his throat, Gabe wished he\u2019d died as well.</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>Gabe Sullivan raised his head and opened one bleary eye to look around him. Groaning, he closed the bloodshot eye and fell back on the pillow. He had no idea whose bed he was in. Nor did he have a clue who the guy was snoring softly beside him. Gabe eased his legs over the side of the bed and sat up, immediately wishing he hadn\u2019t. Shit, how much did he have to drink the night before? He spotted his clothes on the floor beside him and pulled on his jeans as fast as he could, considering he only had use of one eye. The other one, throbbing in time with the heavy metal drum pounding in his head, he had to keep tightly shut. Picking up his shirt and his shoes, he tiptoed to the door\u2014except for when he stumbled over the other guy\u2019s shoes, stubbed his toe, and did a little impromptu dance on one foot before crashing into the wall. The dude in the bed must have been really drunk or pretending hard to be asleep. He never moved. In fact, if not for the steady rising and falling of the bed sheet in time with the snores, Gabe might have gone over to check his pulse. That crash had been epic.</p><p>Gabe got the door closed behind him with a minimum of noise considering he was still pretty damn wasted himself. He slipped into his shoes, jammed his arms into his shirt sleeves and stepped out of the house, hoping like hell his old truck was outside somewhere. Sure enough, he saw it right away, pulled more or less into the driveway behind a sleek, black BMW. He looked around the upscale neighborhood and failed to recognize it. Making his way to his vehicle, he found the keys still in the ignition. Thank God for the nice neighborhood, though it was doubtful anyone would want to steal his battered 1985 pickup truck. Still, it was all he had. He drove slowly down the street, hoping to find a landmark to tell him where the hell he was.</p><p>Once he got out onto a street with more traffic, it didn\u2019t take long to see he was in Dunwoody, one of the wealthier northern suburbs of Atlanta and very distant in a lot of significant ways from the Stay Lodge on the interstate, his current abode. As he drove slowly home, he watched the rear view mirror for any signs of a cop. His breath would still probably blow way over the legal limit, and the last thing he needed was to get put in jail for another DUI. He tried to remember what had happened the night before.</p><p>He could recall drinking. And dancing. Lots of dancing. Slow, dirty grinding on the crotch of a guy with a hell of a bulge in his jeans. He couldn\u2019t even picture his face or remember how they\u2019d met in the little gay bar he\u2019d been frequenting for the past two weeks he\u2019d been in town. He wondered briefly if he was the one whose bed he woke up in, then shrugged in irritation. The blackouts were getting worse, and he wondered if he should be worried about them, then decided the hell with it.If he was lucky, he\u2019d drink himself to death soon.</p><p>He\u2019d sure be en trying to ever since the attack the year before had turned him into a monster. Not bad enough the fucker had killed his sweet mother.He\u2019d also raped him violently enough that he\u2019d torn him, even though Gabe had healed incredibly fast, leaving the doctors scratching their heads. If that hadn\u2019t been enough, the bastard\u2019s bite had turned him into the same kind of beast, waking every full moon.</p><p>Mentally clicking through a calendar in his head, he remembered today was Saturday, no work, thank God. A few more days before the full moon, probably the reason he was feeling restless and ready to move on. The temporary roofing job had lasted a few days longer than he\u2019d expected, due to some problems the boss had run into.When they\u2019d pulled off the old shingles, the decking underneath was rotten in places and had to be replaced. Gabe was cutting his departure a little close, and he needed to be out of town and far away from people before he shifted.He\u2019d thought he\u2019d pack his belongings and get out of the city this morning, and he still needed to, but it would be a few hours later than he\u2019d planned. He\u2019d head toward the North Georgia mountains. He hated the place after what had happened there a year ago, but it was close by and offered plenty of places to get lost for a few days. Despite his hatred of the area, he was strangely drawn to it more and more on these full moon nights. He had to wonder what the conflicting emotions were all about.</p><p>He had his camping gear in the back of the truck. All he had to do was swing by the motel, pack his few possessions, pay his bill, and get on the road by noon. He headed up Georgia 400 toward Gainesville.Figured he\u2019d stop there and get something to eat while he decided how to get to the closest hiking trails.</p> <p>He used to live in Alabama, in a little town called Centre, just across the Georgia line. He\u2019d been going to school at Jacksonville State, studying agriculture, and he\u2019d always planned to settle down to work his family\u2019s farm, find a little house close by, and figure out how to tell his mama he was gay.He\u2019d known she\u2019d cry a little and then find a way to be okay with it. She loved him, and she wanted him to stay close to home and help her with the farm. His father died of cancer when he was in the tenth grade, and she\u2019d been running the farm ever since, with his help and the help of some hired hands, and she\u2019d done a pretty good job too. She was getting older, though, and was looking forward to the day she could hand the reins over to her only son.</p><p>But now his mama was dead and gone like the rest of his life, destroyed by a crazy, vicious, ravening beast of a werewolf. The monster had ripped out her throat and left him for dead lying beside her\u2014or at least he was interrupted before he could finish the job.</p><p>By lunchtime, he sat in a drive-in in Gainesville, a medium-sized town in the foothills of the North Georgia mountains, eating a hamburger and trying to figure out where to go. Poring over the map, he found what looked like a large forest near the Georgia/North Carolina border which looked even more remote than the camping sites he\u2019d been to before. He figured out the best route to take to the Nantahala National Park, not too far away and offering plenty of hiking trails where he could lose himself for a few days. The park was perfect for his purposes. Large and sprawling, the national forest would offer him plenty of trails to lose himself on. He would need to stay off the main trails and confine himself to the more remote areas, but the park was wild and parts of it so rugged and remote he could shift in relative safety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like in all the horror movies he\u2019d seen since he was a kid, shifting was a painful process for him and turned him into something not quite human.He\u2019d once glanced into a calm lake and seen himself during a full moon.He\u2019d been horrified. He still had a human body, though it was covered in hair, but his face was bestial with a wolf-like snout and horrible fangs descending from his mouth. Sickened by the hideous image, he had dashed the water with his fist and run away. Since then, he\u2019d tried never to look at himself again while the beast was on him.</p><p>Mentally, he still retained most of his intellect when he changed, his sense of who he was, but when he shifted he became unreasonably angry and brutal. Small obstacles became large, insurmountable ones, and he wanted to fight somebody. Hurt somebody. Anybody really. He was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide from anyone who came too close. Instead he might jump out of hiding and attack.He was terrified the bite had made him a killer like the monster who\u2019d killed his poor mother.He didn\u2019t know much about this thing, and there sure wasn\u2019t anybody to ask.He\u2019d figured out most of it on his own after the first traumatic shift alone in his home.</p><p>He finished his lunch, started the truck, and pulled back out into traffic. Making his way back to the highway, he figured he could make it to the park in another hour or so and have plenty of time to hike up and find a campsite by nightfall. His werewolf vitality had helped him make it this far after a night of smoking pot and drinking way too much, but he could feel himself wearing down, and the tequila alligator was chasing him hard. As soon as he made camp, he promised himself he would sleep for hours. Tomorrow night was the full moon.</p> <p>Gabe woke up to utter darkness. He shrugged off his sleeping bag and stuck his head outside the small tent. With no hint of moon or stars peeking through the cloud-blanketed sky, it took his eyes a few seconds to adjust. The cool night air kissed his skin, and the air was fresh and sweet, so what the hell smelled so rank? It took him a few confused seconds to figure out the sour, sweaty smell came from his own body.</p><p>He\u2019d picked this campsite specifically for remoteness and its proximity to a mountain stream. He could hear the water tumbling over the rocks and murmuring to itself. The clouds parted, and the moon came out, lighting up the scene enough for Gabe to see the trail leading down to the little stream, probably left by deer. Peeling off his jeans first, he made his way to the small creek. It was way too shallow to immerse himself, so he squatted over it and splashed the icy water over his body till he shivered, but he did wash away some of the stink from the night before.</p><p>As he stood looking up at the stars, he got the feeling someone was watching him and looked nervously around in all directions, his senses heightened. Seeing and hearing nothing, he climbed out of the stream and stood on the bank for a moment, enjoying the soothing sound of the water splashing on the rocks. The crack of a branch somewhere close by brought him back to alertness and he moved quickly back to his tent, wanting the assurance of a weapon in case someone was stalking him. He knew he was strong enough since the change to handle most anyone or anything, but he was still human enough to want the feel of a gun in his hand if he had to face an adversary.</p><p>He emerged from his tent with his daddy\u2019s old twelve gauge shotgun, and his eyes swept the dense forest around him. He was in a tiny clearing, off the trail by a good fifty feet and wellhidden from the casual observer by the small pines growing around the campsite. He listened again, and he could hear\u2014nothing at all. No sound of cicadas or frogs or the usual nighttime sounds of a southern forest in June. His senses heightened even more.</p><p>A deep voice behind him and to his left made him swerve quickly in that direction and lift the shotgun to his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my territory, rogue?\u201d</p><p>A figure out of a dream walked toward him. Tall, broad-shouldered, and handsome, he stepped out from the tree line and crossed his arms over his chest. Incredibly he was totally naked, and his large erection bounced up to hit him on the stomach as he walked.Gabe\u2019s mouth fell open at the sight. He was a big guy, strong and powerful,and Gabe\u2019s nose twitched immediately. Wolf. How could he have missed the smell? He must have been downwind of him, the only explanation for missing his strong, musky wolf scent, and not only the animal scent teased his nose. An underlying smell of something sweet, too, almost like burnt sugar filled his nostrils. Unreasoning fear gripped him for a moment, and he pushed it back down.He wasn\u2019t the same weak young boy he\u2019d been the last time he came up against a wolf. His hatred for the bastards remained the same though. He opened his mouth and let some of the hatred spill out.</p><p>\u201cThis is a public park, and I have every right to be here. Who the fuck are you, asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re some kind of wolf, so you must recognize who I am. Lower that gun before I take it away from you and wrap it around a tree.Let\u2019s try this again, and watch your mouth. What are you doing in my territory without permission?Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Gabe could feel a flush travel over him as he lowered the gun.\u201cI don\u2019t need the gun anyway to handle you, whoever the fuck you are. And who said this is your territory? Must be news to the park service.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped closer, sauntering nearer to Gabe to show he feared nothing. Gabe had time to notice his ripped body, cut and perfect. He looked to be in his late twenties, maybe, with dark hair and eyes, and a face like a male model. The smell radiating off him got even stronger as he came closer. Instinctively, Gabe took a couple of steps back before he caught himself and was angry for giving ground.</p> <p>\u201cI say it\u2019s my territory, that\u2019s who. This is Dark Hollow Wolf Pack territory, from here all the way to Asheville, North Carolina and stretching over into Tennessee. Every wolf on the East Coast has heard of us. I\u2019m Alpha of this branch of my pack, and any wolf or Werekin crossing my land needs my permission.I don\u2019t recall you asking me. Which makes you a rogue and subject to discipline.\u201d</p><p>Gabe laughed in nervousness and a chill went down his spine.The man\u2019s eyes were steely, and his face was set, not in anger, but in determination. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about all this shit\u2014 alphas and territory and rogues. For Christ\u2019s sake, all I want is to be left alone. I came out here to get away from people because of the full moon. That\u2019s all. You say this is your territory. Okay, fine.I\u2019ll pack up and get out. I\u2019ll find another spot. But like I said, the full moon is coming, and I have to get away from people.I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody or get killed myself. If it\u2019s all the same to you,I\u2019ll just pack my stuff and get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Moving so fast Gabe never even saw him coming, the man was beside him and grasped his wrist in a steely grip. Before Gabe could react, he took the shotgun from his hand and threw it to the side, twisted Gabe\u2019s arm around behind him and brought his naked body slamming against his. He caughtGabe\u2019s flailing other wrist and pushed it behind him to join the other, holding both with one of his huge, incredibly strong hands. Gabe was shorter by a good four inches, and his cock hit the man at thigh level. He opened his thighs, and clampedGabe\u2019s cock between his thighs, trapping him neatly. After a few moments of brief struggle, Gabe experienced only pain and frustration, and damn it! Why was his cock getting hard?It must be the friction from the man\u2019s thighs. Had to be. That and the rock-hard dick pressing into his stomach. Controlled and helpless, he couldn\u2019t free his hands or his dick. He threw his head back and looked up at the man who had him imprisoned.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, damn it! What the fuck do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you are yet, rogue, and until I am, you\u2019re coming with me. Do you want to walk or do you want me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you! Leave me the hell alone!\u201d Defiantly, Gabe struggled, succeeding in creating more friction and pressure against his cock, making it even harder. Breathing hard in frustrated fury, he tried to stomp the man\u2019s foot. A dumb move, he discovered ruefully. He was barefoot, and the guy had a body like steel. Bruising his own instep was all he managed to do. He hissed his breath, and the wolf shook him hard.</p><p>\u201cStop it. You\u2019re hurting yourself!\u201d The wolf dropped his wrists and pulled him into a bear hug, squeezing Gabe tight and the air out of his lungs. He squeezed tighter and tighter, cutting off Gabe\u2019s breath until his vision went black, and all Gabe could see was little sparkling stars, swirling in the darkness. His knees gave way, and he was sweptup and thrown over the wolf\u2019s shoulder, landing on his stomach with a little whoof as the last bit of oxygen left his lungs, and he passed out.</p><p>Zack was headed home from a run along the perimeter of his territory when he smelled it \u2014 some kind of wolf for sure, but something more. The scent stopped him dead in his tracks and beckoned him like a siren\u2019s call. His senses screamed mate. Pure testosterone flooded his wolf\u2019s body. The smell was sweet. It smelled like mine! His brain screamed the word at him, making him almost stumble and fall.</p> <p>He always shifted to make the runs once every few months, and it took days to cover the entire perimeter. He loved the feeling of freedom and solitude during them, but never before had he caught a scent like this.</p><p>Zack was one of the alphas of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack. Each division had its own alpha, and Zack took his responsibilities seriously. From Hunters to rogues and rogue packs springing up occasionally in their territories, the Dark Hollow Pack faced near continual challenges to their authority. It was a good idea for an alpha to know his perimeters well and be able to detect any encroachment as soon as it happened. He had his regular patrols out, but he liked to do some of the work himself.</p><p>Whoever he\u2019d found didn\u2019t smell exactly like a wolf, but something more, something unknown and unexpected. Another smell layered over that too, the smell of his mate. Whoever or whatever he was, he had to get to him and fast. Overwhelmed with the need to have sex, his erection sprang up urgent and painful. He shifted back into his human form and cautiously approached the campsite. Sensing movement up ahead, he slowed his steps even further. He smelled water just ahead and heard splashing in a stream. Standing behind a tree, Zack got his first look at the man. The smell definitely radiated off him.Along with the man\u2019s own sweet, almost sugary odor, Zack shifted through layers of cigarette smoke, beer, and spunk. He hated the smell of smoke and beer, but the last smell made him furious,the smell of someone else\u2019s jizz coming off his mate. His mate had been with a human male and recently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hope you enjoyed it, baby, becausehe was the last man who\u2019ll ever touch you besides me. Possessive jealousy and the urge to punish the man for being with someone else swept over him. Luckily his rational mind knew he was being unreasonable.It didn\u2019t make him feel much better.</p><p>The man was young, just into his twenties, he would guess. He was naked in the moonlight, kneeling down and splashing himself. The sight almost made Zack lose control.He wasn\u2019t very big, but his body was amazing, with broad, muscular shoulders tapering off to a small waist. There was almost no hair on his chest, but even from where he stood Zack could see the faint black treasure trail leading from his navel downward. He stood up and turned around, giving Zack a good view of his rounded little ass and perfect legs.</p><p>He turned again, and Zack\u2019s mouth went totally dry. His mate\u2019s very respectable cock was drawn up a bit from the icy cold water, but was still very nice. His balls were large too, and he had a thatch of black hair covering his groin.Zack\u2019s own cock grew uncomfortably hard. He shifted his feet to adjust himself and a stick beneath his feet cracked loud enough to cause the young man to tense and look around him warily.</p> <p>Zack watched him silently until he settled down and climbed back up the bank to his tent. He hadn\u2019t fooled him, though. He came back out carrying a shotgun. Zack experienced a little sense of pride in his mate for being smart and fearless.</p><p>Moving quietly up near his tent, Zack watched him scan the tree line. He didn\u2019t want to scare him, but he needed to challenge him, find out who he was and what pack he belonged to. It didn\u2019t matter who he belonged to, really, because from this point on, the man was his. He made his first words harsh and challenging, wanting him so much and fighting the urge to throw him on the ground and make love to him for hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my territory, rogue?\u201d Actually, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was rogue or even if he werea wolf or a pet, but he almost hoped he wasn\u2019t a member of any pack. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about complicated negotiations with his alpha. He wasn\u2019t quite sure of his mate\u2019s status, but he was no alpha, even if he did offer up a defiant remark to his challenge.</p><p>Zack was puzzled by the conversation that followed. He thought any Werekin would recognize the alpha of a pack, and he\u2019d just told him it was his territory. This young man acted like he knew nothing about pack life, being belligerent and challenging, yammering on about the full moon. If he didn\u2019t know how to give proper respect,he wasn\u2019t going to learn any younger. Smarting off to an alpha could get you severely reprimanded unless you immediately apologized and showed signs of submission.This young whelp wasn\u2019t showing the proper respect. A lesson was definitely in order.</p><p>He stepped up closer to him, hearing him continue to run his smart mouth with only half an ear. He was looking at his gorgeous, pale blue eyes sparkling in the moonlight, and at the way he bit his full lower lip when he got nervous. Zack\u2019s crotch got tighter every minute. When the boy started backing up and talking about leaving, Zack paid closer attention. Oh, hell no.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d He grabbed him and held him close, but the little fool kept struggling. Zack had both his mate\u2019s arms trapped behind him and drew him up to his body where he fucking belonged. Withthe man\u2019s dick between his thighs, Zack almost came from the sweetness of holding his naked mate close in his arms, his delicious scent beneath the other smells seriously testing his control. The damn man wouldn\u2019t be still and even stomped his foot. All he succeeded in doing was hurting himself, and holding him, Zack felt the pain radiating through his sweet body.</p><p>Knowing his mate would continue to struggle, Zack couldn\u2019t allow him to hurt himself any further. He had courage, he thought proudly. A suitable mate for an alpha. He caught him up in a bear hug and squeezed him till he passed out, cradling his sweet body as he collapsed.</p><p>He laid him back on the ground and quickly gathered his few belongings. He found a duffle bag inside the small tent and looked for some clothes to put on him, but everything reeked of unpleasant smells.He\u2019d take them back to be washed before he could allow his mate to wear any of them. He found a blanket and wrapped it around him, picked him up, and threw him across his shoulder.Picking up the boy\u2019s duffle and his gun in one hand, Zack began the ten-mile trek back to his home.</p><p>Gabe woke up, thinking for a moment he was having a crazy dream. He was hanging upside down, being carried through the woods like a sack of potatoes. He yelled and cursed, trying frantically to move his arms and get away, but his arms were trapped at his sides, and he was wrapped tightly in a blanket. He reared up, bucking his body, and got a hard swat on the ass for his troubles.</p><p>A voice called out, harshly, \u201cCut it out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, you crazy fuck!\u201d Another hard swat on the backside caused him to yell out in pain.\u201cOw! Stop hitting me. Damn it,fight me like a man!\u201d The man carrying him ignored his orders and taunts. He tried again.\u201cAre you afraid to fight me like a man? Is that it? Crazy wolf bastard!\u201d</p> <p>The man carrying him stopped and lowered him to the ground. Gabe tried to get his arms out but the asshole kept the blanket bunched tightly in his hand as he pushed down on his chest, keeping him firmly in place. Damn, the son-of-a-bitch was strong. How could there be so much difference in their strength? He was a werewolf himself. Wasn\u2019t he? As Gabe stared up at him, the man sank long fangs into his own wrist, and Gabe watched, fascinated as the blood poured out. He put his wrist down to Gabe\u2019s mouth and held it there.</p><p>\u201cDrink!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Gabe pressed his lips together tightly and thrashed his head, but the big wolf followed his every movement. He was supernaturally quick, his bloody wrist following him no matter which way Gabe tried to move. Even worse, his forearm was pressing against his nose, blocking his air. To get a breath, he opened his mouth, and the wolf pressed the bloody wrist right between his teeth, wedged his mouth open more and prevented him from closing his jaw. God, the smell was overpowering in its sweetness. Blood dripped onto his tongue, and the taste was like nothing he\u2019d ever tasted before. Instead of being disgusting, as he expected, the blood was sweet and delicious, almost like honey.</p><p>His tongue curled, and his lips sealed to suck. He was lost in seconds, transported into a dreamlike state, flying high in the sky where the oxygen was thin. The wrist at his mouth was the only thing keeping him alive, and he drank from it to keep the sweet air flowing into his lungs. From far away, he heard a voice he almost recognized as someone very important calling to him.</p><p>\u201cEnough,sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The wrist was pulled away. Gabetried to grab it and hold on but couldn\u2019t. He was pulled down toward Earth again, down and down into soft darkness.</p><p>The next time he awoke, he was on a cot of some kind in a darkened room. Wait a minute, not a room, but a cell. Gabe had been in jail before and knew exactly what a jail cell looked like. This one was no different. A cot, a pillow, and a blanket adorned the cell, but not much else. A toilet sat on the side against the bare gray walls. He was still naked, wrapped up in the same blanket, though not so tightly. Swinging his legs over the side of the cot, he sat up, listening. He could hear nothing. Slowly getting to his feet, he wobbled over to the toilet to piss. He felt hung over like he\u2019d just awakened from an all-nighter. Finishing, he made his way to the bars of his cell. He gave the door a shove to make sure it was locked. It would be pretty stupid to stay in here for days and discover the door was unlocked all along. He rattled the bars. It was locked all right.</p><p>\u201cHey, let me out of here!\u201d he yelled, and down the long hallway, he heard someone coming closer.</p> <p>A large, unfamiliar young man with dark hair, dressed in jeans and T-shirt peered through the bars at him. His expression was neutral, and he walked up to the cell and opened the door with a key he pulled from his pocket. Gabe tried to rush past him, but his large, solid body blocked the opening.</p><p>\u201cLet me out! You have no right to keep me here!\u201d Gabe made his voice loud and defiant, but the man gazed at him furiously. Gabe took an involuntary step backward. What the hell had he done to get this guy so pissed? If anyone should be angry, it was Gabe. He was minding his own business when he was attacked, kidnapped, and abused by the big dude on the mountain.</p><p>\u201cYou need a bath, boy. Your stink is fouling up the whole area.Follow me and I\u2019ll take you to the bathtub. I\u2019ve just prepared it for you and was coming to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!Get out of my way before I knock you out of it.\u201d</p><p>The man rolled his eyes, sneering at him. Gabe could see him flex his hands.\u201cZack said you\u2019d be difficult. He told me to tell you if you don\u2019t cooperate, he\u2019ll come downstairs and bathe you himself. What do you want to do?Should I call for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is Zack?\u201d Gabe asked, stalling for time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our alpha.He brought you here.\u201d</p><p>Memories of being carried over the brute\u2019s shoulder and whacks on his ass came flooding back. He had no doubt the asshole would make good his threat to bathe him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about all this alpha shit. I\u2019ll leave, I promise. I just want to get out of here,\u201d Gabe said, trying to reason with the guy in front of him.</p><p>\u201cBath,\u201d the man said implacably. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Gabe yelled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d the man said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go get the alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! II\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Casting him a furious glare, he motioned for Gabe to precede him down the hall. He waited with thinned lips added to the glare, watching Gabe make a break for it and run up against a locked steel door at the end of the hall. Gabe had to make a walk of shame back to where the man stood with his arms folded over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got that out of your system, go inside and get in the tub.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stomped his way through the door into a kind of bedroom. A large bed was in the center of the room, and the room was nicely appointed, though windowless. An open door led off to a bathroom where the tub waited. Gabe pulled off his blanket and showed his body to the man. He knew he had a very nice body, and maybe he could seduce the guy into letting him go. He stepped up close to the guy and looked up at him from under his long lashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going to get in with me?\u201d He put his hand out to touch the man, but the guy gasped and jerked away like Gabe was a poisonous snake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d He turned his face away and covered his nose with his hand.</p><p>Damn, I must stink worse than I thought. The guy turned his face back toward him with an obvious effort and spoke to him through almost gritted teeth.</p> <p>\u201cYou belong to the alpha, and you\u2019d better remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belongto anybody but myself!\u201d</p><p>The large wolf pointed toward the bathroom.\u201cPlease go in and get in the tub, so I don\u2019t have to make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.Damn!\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Gabe turned around and made his way to the steaming tub. He stepped in gingerly and lowered himself into the water. Some kind of flowery bath salts had been used. He snorted through his nose. Talk about stink. When he got out of the tub,he\u2019d smell like fucking roses all day.</p> <p>The large wolf stood at the door and pointed out the shampoo and soap.\u201cUse plenty of those.Scrub yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, keepyour shirt on. Damn, I don\u2019t smell thatbad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the large man said firmly. \u201cYou do.\u201d He retreated into the other room, but Gabe could hear him close by.</p><p>Gabe snorted and soaped himself all over. Maybe he really did stink, not that he gave a shit. Since he was there, though, he may as well take advantage of the tub. The hot water really did feel great. He allowed himself to sink back into it for a few moments and just soak. It had been a long whilesince he\u2019d had time for that kind of luxury. Most nights during the past year, he\u2019d been either too tired or too drunk to do much more than grab a quick shower. He sat forward after a bit and reached for the shampoo. After lathering and rinsing in the tub, he turned a dripping face toward the door.\u201cCould you hand me a towel at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart.\u201d The deep voice from the night before sounded too close for comfort,and Gabe\u2019s eyes flew open. He flinched in surprise. Instead of the large wolf from before, the alpha stood lounging in the doorway, looking even bigger and more powerful than Gabe remembered. Dressed in jeans and a white button-up shirt, he wasn\u2019t naked this time, at least. He snagged a towel from a rack on the wall and walked toward Gabe.</p><p>Gabe fought hard to resist the impulse to lower his head in submission when the man approached him. Where did that even come from? He vaguely remembered drinking blood directly from the guy\u2019s wrist the night before. Had he been changed again in some way?</p> <p>He made himself take the towel and wipe his face as calmly as he could, his hands trembling slightly. When he looked up, the alpha leaned against the wall, looking down at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just fuckin\u2019 great,\u201d he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201cI highly recommend being beaten up, kidnapped, and thrown in a jail cell. Youshould try it some time.\u201d</p><p>The alpha continued to study him with interest.\u201cDo you always respond this way when you\u2019re frightened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck said I was frightened?\u201d</p><p>The alpha continued to regard him closely and stepped further into the room, making Gabe flinch back involuntarily.\u201cCalm down. No one here is going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe snorted.\u201cWell, that\u2019ll make a nice change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d His voice was calm and completely unmoved by Gabe\u2019s sarcasm.</p> <p>\u201cWho wants to know? Tell me what the fuck I\u2019m doing here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want your mouth washed out with the bar of soap in your hand, I suggest you stop all the cursing. Settle down and answer me.What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>Gabe fought a real battle with himself. On the one hand, he hated obeying this guy, but on the other, he figured the man was crazy enough to do exactly as he said. He was plenty big enough to get the job done too, not to mention the dude from before, who probably still lurked around somewhere close by in case his help was required.He\u2019d have to bide his time and pretend to cooperate.</p><p>He sat up straighter and lowered his gaze, not wanting to see any look of triumph on the alpha\u2019s face. \u201cMy name is Gabe, Gabe Sullivan\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pack are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t have any fuck\u2014any pack.I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d</p><p>A silence followed--long enough for Gabe to sneak a glance at the alpha to make sure he was still there. He was, standing tall and strong, his arms crossed over his muscular chest.</p><p>\u201cWho made you, Gabe? You\u2019re not a wolf, so you must be some kind of pet or Werekin. Who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>Gabe bit his lower lip as painful thoughts of his mother seared through his body. His voice, when he was able to speak, came out harsh and ragged.\u201cI told you I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! I am a damned werewolf\u2014a fucking monster just like the one who bit me and my mother!\u201d</p><p>The alpha\u2019s voice was soft as he asked the next question. \u201cYour mother? Where is your mother, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to Gabe\u2019s eyes, and he angrily dashed them away, managing to get soap in his eyes. They burned and filled with moisture.\u201cShe\u2019s dead!\u201d he choked out. \u201cMurdered by the filthy monster who bit me! I guess he thought he\u2019d killed me too,but I wasn\u2019t quite dead!\u201d He laughed,a strange, hysterical sounding laugh even to his own ears. \u201cI fooled him! I woke up bleeding from my wounds while my p-poor mom...\u201d He sputtered as he tried to keep the sobs from bursting from his throat, visions of his mother\u2019s bloody body in his head.</p><p>\u201cThey tried to save my mother, but...\u201d Gabe looked up with blurry vision into the sympathetic gaze of the alpha, and the tears streamed down his cheeks.He hadn\u2019t ever cried like this about it, not even just after it happened.</p><p>Picked up out of the water, he was cradled against a strong, hard chest. Grabbing a huge towel off the rack, the alpha carried him in his arms to the bed and sat down with him. He wrapped the towel around Gabe\u2019s shivering body and held him close, letting him cry against his chest. It only took a moment for Gabe to understand what was happening, and he reacted with violence.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d Gabe said furiously, struggling in his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody! Especially not some damn wolf!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Gabe\u2019s words, the alpha held onto him, murmuring something to him in his ear. Soft wordshe couldn\u2019t even make out, but the murmuring sound was soothing. He stopped struggling and leaned into him even closer. It had been a long time since anyone had touched him with anything other than lust, nothing like this sweet, sympathetic kindness being shown to him.</p><p>He was tired\u2014exhausted from running from the truth of what he\u2019d become. He relaxed into the alpha\u2019s arms, feeling safety and power radiating off the man. He closed his eyes\u2014just for a minute\u2014and drifted gently down into a soft, dark sleep.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The moon was full, and the shift was later that night. The whole pack was edgy as a result. Some disagreements had broken out earlier, and Zack had spent most of the day arbitrating and soothing ruffled feelings while Gabe slept.</p><p>A pack rule required that any unknown newcomer spent some time isolated before the pack members let him near their mates and children, even the alpha\u2019s new mate. His scent was strange and unhealthy, too, and noneof them, including Zack, knew exactly what to make of him. He\u2019d sent his cousin down to deal with him in his place that morning, intending to go down later and talk with his mate.</p><p>Unable to stop thinking about him, Zack decided to take the time to go downstairs. He \u2019d told Tim to call if there were problems. Timhadn\u2019t called, but a nagging, uneasy feeling made Zack go down to check. Aggravated with his distraction, he entered the bathroom, but his irritation only lasted until the moment he saw his mate again, his body slick and wet and his head covered in soap suds.He\u2019d stood there in the doorway of the bathroom, watching him rinse away the soap and get some in his eyes.He\u2019d turned toward the door to ask for a towel with an adorable squint.</p><p>When Zack spoke to him, he was still angry and hurt \u2014damaged. It brought out every one of Zack\u2019s strong, protective urges. When Gabe had burst into tears, hehadn\u2019t hesitated to pick him up and cradle him next to his body.</p><p>Zack was heartsick as he held his sweet mate to his chest. He mentally kicked himself for not finding out more about his new mate before leaving him to fend for himself. He\u2019d had no idea this young man had been so abused and damaged by one of Zack\u2019s own kind, another wolf. The strongest pack law forbade preying on humans, an offense punishable by death. His outrage and fury warred with his sympathy and regret for what his mate had been through. He laid him gently down on the bed and covered him with blankets before leaving the room and going out to pace the hallway. Having what they thought might be a new young whelp to care for so close to the full moon had thrown them all for a loop, but to realize the newcomer was an abused human Werekin\u2014it was almost unimaginable.</p><p>Tim sat in a chair by the door, watching Zack warily as he paced up and down. \u201cIs something wrong, Zack? Did he do something to upset you?I didn\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>Zack glanced over at his cousin\u2019s worried face. Touching another wolf\u2019s mate was forbidden by the pack.Even though he hadn\u2019t gone through the mating ritual as yet, he had claimed him, and Tim respected that claim. He wondered if Gabe had flirted with Tim. The idea made him surprisingly jealous and possessive. Though Tim was his younger cousin and the only wolf Zack trusted enough to allow unsupervised around Gabe, Tim had been reluctant to take on this chore. He told Zack he knew how bad his temper could be if something went wrong.</p><p>Tim was another alpha male, but he suppressed his dominant tendencies to be able to stay with the pack. Some years ago, they had faced each other in the ancestral ring to see which of them would lead the pack when the time came. Zack had won quite easily, and Tim left the pack for over two years, going to live and work with the North Carolina wolf pack. Once Tim came home, Zack put him on the council, and he became an important council member. Zack relied on him a great deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, Tim, it\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s Gabe. He told me he was bitten and left for dead by a wolf. The same bastard killed his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! The poor kid. He doesn\u2019t even know what he is or what\u2019s happened to him? No wonder he seems so lost and angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I didn\u2019t help any by grabbing him and throwing him over my shoulder like a caveman. The blood lust was strong in me last night, and I was afraid I\u2019d take him right there. I just wanted to get him back here and get some distance between us for a while so I could control myself. I must have scared himto death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is he, exactly, Zack? He smells soodd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s feral. I\u2019ve heard about them, but I\u2019ve never actually seen one. I heard Marco, the western North Carolina alpha, had a pet who went feral last year, though he recovered fine. He was the first one we knew about for over a century, though we know a little more about the condition today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeral? What is that, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means no one ever cared for him properly, and after the wolf attack, it changes him into a kind of half-wolf creature. All of the ones I\u2019ve ever heard of become savage and crazy, just like the TV shows about werewolves. This is the first time I heard of them changing only with the moon and then changing back, though.Marco\u2019s pet changed when he got angry, I think, but there\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know about the condition. There\u2019s a mystery here, and I mean to get to the bottom of it. He must be very strong mentally and emotionally to have survived alone as long as he has, keeping himself away from other humans when he changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he...will he shift tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if I can help it. Our blood is supposed to keep them from changing.He\u2019s been fed once, and I\u2019ll feed him again before tonight. I\u2019ll put him in restraints and lock him in this room, too, just in case, but I won\u2019t put him back in the cell.He\u2019s been through enough already. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll keep the other pets safe.\u201d He hesitated before adding, \u201cKeep this between you and me for now, Tim. No one else needs to know.\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded, seemingly reassured.\u201cI just feel bad about the way I treated him. I thought he was only being a brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Zack took a deep breath and turned back to the room.\u201cAnd he was,\u201d he said, smiling at the memory of his defiance.\u201cBut at least it\u2019s a little more understandable. I\u2019m going to spend some time with him before the moon comes up. Go back upstairs and cover for me if any problems come up.\u201d</p><p>Tim left right away, leaving him alone with his mate.</p><p>Zack opened the door and walked back into the room. Gabe was curled up on his side, tear tracks still evident on his sweet face. Zack pulled back the covers and lay down beside him, spooning him. Gabe snuggled back into him with a little moan. He stirred restlessly and then turned to open his blue eyes and stare at Zack. He rolled to his back, and the wide blue gaze stayed carefully trained on Zack\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI must admit you\u2019re better looking than most guys I wake up with. Did you...did we...uh?\u201d</p> <p>Zack stirred restlessly, hating the idea of his beautiful mate waking up with other men. \u201cNo,\u201d he said more roughly than he\u2019d intended. \u201cI\u2019m not a rapist. When we mate,you\u2019ll definitely know it, and it will be becauseyou want me more than you\u2019ve ever wanted anyone before in your life. A good thing, becauseI\u2019ll be the last man you ever sleep with too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Possessive much? Who are you, really, and why did you bring me here? I told you, I\u2019d leave quietly and get out of your territory you seem to beworried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,though, and it\u2019s hard with your cute little naked ass in my crotch.Let\u2019s get up and get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>Zack swung his feet over the side of the bed and crossed over to the dresser. He rummaged through the dresser drawer and found Gabe\u2019s jeans and T-shirt, washed and folded neatly. He threw them over to Gabe.\u201cPut these o n.\u201d</p><p>Gabe caught them and pulled them on quickly before sitting back down on the edge of the bed while Zack watched.\u201cOkay, talk.It can\u2019t be too much longer till the full moon, though, and I need to get outside soon.\u201d Gabe looked around the room.\u201cUnless you want your house destroyed.I usually make a bit of a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs shifting painful for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. I hate every second of it.Isn\u2019t it the same for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a born shifter. Shifting comes naturally to me, and it feels\u2014wonderful. Freeing and familiar, like coming back home after I\u2019ve been away a long time.But I\u2019m a wolf, and not a feral creature, like I thinkyou\u2019ve become.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe stared at him with narrowed eyes.\u201cWhat do you mean? There\u2019s more than one kind of werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of our people who aren\u2019t wolf shifters are called Werekin. They\u2019re non-shifting kin. Some are humanswe\u2019ve adopted and mated with, and some were born of a wolf and a Werekin or Werekin parents without the inheriting the genes necessary to shift. We\u2019ve been around just as long as humans and coexisted peacefully the whole time. Over the centuries, we\u2019ve had our outlaws, our killers, just as humans do. These wolves exist outside our packs, and when we find them we punish them. These murderers, like the one who attacked you and your mother, sometimes attack humans as weaker prey. It\u2019s possible he was even trying to mate with you. Did he\u2014did he rape you, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>Gabe frowned and turned his head away. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about what the son-of-a-bitch did to me.\u201d</p><p>Zack was silent for a moment, giving him time.He wished he didn\u2019t have to press him, but he needed some answers before he could mate with him. Even if some other wolf had claimed his bloodmate before, it wouldn\u2019t matter in the long run. He had abandoned him, and Zack would still have him, no matter what. It might take longer to develop a mating bond, however, and could make it even more painful for Gabe when he claimed him with the ritual while his essence eradicated the other\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDid he try to give you a mating bite? It\u2019s important, Gabe. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck do I know?I don\u2019t know what a mating bite is!\u201d At Zack\u2019s steady look, Gabe sagged a little and sighed.\u201cOkay, he bit me on my arms and hands, when I tried to throw him off me. The doctors were amazed at how I healed so fast without scarring. Hurt like hell though. He ripped my pants off and forced himself on me when I was unconscious. I was fighting him and screaming, and\u2014that\u2019s when my mother must have\u2014\u201d He bit his lower lip and looked down at his hands clenched on his lap. \u201cShe must have tried to help me. How could he do something so vicious to her? She was such a little thing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with tears, and Zack kept his voice soothing and soft.\u201cI can\u2019t explain why it happened\u2014no more than you could explain a human killer to me.I\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart, but I need you to focus for me. The one who attacked you bit you and mingled his saliva with your blood and changed you into Werekin.\u201d The mating ritual involved more than that, just as the roguetaking Gabe\u2019s blood created a connection in the wolf, but Zack wasn\u2019t going to confuse him any more by going into details.</p><p>\u201cWerekin? Is thatthe creature I turn into at the full moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. It means your body has changed forever, and you\u2019ve become part of the wolf clans\u2014the Werekin. Adopted Werekin, or humans who have undergone the change, turn feral if they aren\u2019t fed regularly. In other words, they become like the monster you say you turn into. You can live a good life, though, a long, happy life. We can take you into our clan. As long as a wolf cares for you properly and feeds you,you\u2019ll be fine. It all works better, of course if the wolf mates with you. I have to ask again, did he bite you on the neck?\u201d He held off asking if they\u2019d been tied up for any length of time. Knowing if the wolf gave the bite was enough.</p><p>Gabe shook his head,\u201cNo, not on the neck. Just my shoulder\u2014my arms and hands. Defensive wounds the doctor called them.\u201d He hesitated a moment, seeming to consider all Zack was telling him.\u201cBut slow down. I can take care of myself.I mean, it\u2019s nice of you to want to take me in and all, but I\u2019m doing just fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>Gabe wasn\u2019t getting it, yet. \u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t want to just take you in. I want you for my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a sex partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just a sex partner, a life partner. In your world it would be like a marriage.\u201d</p><p>The word startled a brief laugh from him.\u201cI just met you, dude.\u201d Zack stared steadily back at Gabe for so long he started to fidget.\u201cLook, like I said, I appreciate the offer and all. Hell, you\u2019re gorgeous, so I\u2019ll have sex with you, if you want, but Ican take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Zack shook his head.\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand, Gabe.If you don\u2019t drink wolf blood from time to time, I think your body will continue to force the change on you\u2014painfully, as you said, and not always just with the full moon. I think it can happen when you experience strong emotion too. Let\u2019s say you were suddenly cut off in traffic or got mad at your boss. You could spontaneously change wherever you were. I think a full mating is needed to provide you with complete protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying you think these things will happen.How come you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never actually met a feral creature before. It\u2019s very rare. Actually, we always thought a human Werekin who went feral died right away. Maybe the shock was so great to many, they did, but we know now that doesn\u2019t always happen. Until now, we didn\u2019t know you could change back to human after becoming feral. We obviouslyhaven\u2019t had much experience with the phenomenon, butI\u2019m pretty sure if you mate withme, you won\u2019t shift anymore at all. The chemicals you receive from me should dominate then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d Gabe said excitedly, rising to his feet.\u201cYou mean, if I drink your blood, like I did earlier, I won\u2019t ever have to become amonster again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy bloodor any other wolf\u2019s, and no, not if you drink it regularly\u2014every couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want it. Quick, give me some morebefore tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, be very sure. I already fed you a little to calm you down when I brought you here. As I said, I\u2019m notsure it\u2019s enough. Giving you my blood affects me as well, and I want you so much, I wouldn\u2019t be able to control myself. The bloodmatch is too strong with you. There are other wolves here who could feed you, but we\u2019d have to lock you up until we\u2019re certain a simple feeding is enough to stop the shifting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Gabe said quickly, surprising Zack.\u201cI want your blood. I tasted it already, and I liked it. As for the mating thing, you\u2019re not exactly hard to look at. I can do this.I\u2019d rather be with you than anybody else, I guess, and I don\u2019t want to go through that even once more.\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled a slow, sexy smile at him.\u201cYou guess, huh? Baby, I don\u2019t think you realize the seriousness of what I\u2019m telling you. Once we mate, you\u2019ll belong to me forever, and I would settle for nothing less with you. Wolves mate for life.You\u2019ll move in here and live with me. I\u2019ll take care of you,and you\u2019ll join our clan.\u201d</p><p>The amount of longing in Gabe\u2019s eyes surprised Zack. He remembered how young Gabe was and how he\u2019d been on his own for a long time.</p><p>Gabe shrugged and said softly, \u201cOkay, sounds good. Might be nice for a change to belong somewhere for a change.To be with others who are like me.\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled down at him.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to stand here and talk you out of it. If you think you\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>Gabe nodded confidently.\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Gabe shucked off his clothes as quickly as he\u2019d put them on a few minutes before and soon stood deliciously naked in front of Zack.\u201cWell, c\u2019mon, babe, let\u2019s do this.\u201d He patted the bed beside him.</p><p>Zack smiled indulgently as he stood, pulled off his shirt and unbuttoned his jeans.\u201cOkay, babe, we\u2019ll do this as you say. Remember, once you become my mate, it\u2019s for life. I wish you had more time to make a proper decisionand didn\u2019t feel rushed. I don\u2019t know if I could let you go, though.\u201d He took a deep breath and took Gabe\u2019s hand. \u201cOne more thing. No more other men for you after this\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He grinned.\u201cYou look like you might be more than enough for me. As far as being sure, it\u2019s not like I have much of a life anyway with this werewolf thing hanging over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf blood alone may be enough to prevent it, Gabe. You can feed from another wolf.\u201d Zack had to force himself to say the words, and in reality he had no idea what he would do if Gabe agreed. The idea of his matewith another wolf made his stomach clench. Damn it, he\u2019d kill them both.\u201cWe can wait and test it tonight, see if stops you from shifting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m positive. You attract me a lot, and damn, do you use some kind of sweet cologne or something? You smell so damn good.\u201d</p><p>Filled with overwhelming relief, Zack pulled him into his arms. He still wore his boxers, and heenjoyed Gabe\u2019s expression of lustful delight as he rubbed against the large bulge in front of them.\u201cYou smell good to me too, Gabe. Irresistible, in fact. It\u2019s the mating scent. My blood sings to yours and yours to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you like to top, \u2019cause I want some of that.\u201d His hand slipped between them almost reverently touchingZack\u2019s large bulge. \u201cI\u2019m more of a bottom man, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll top you, as you say,sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He lifted Gabe by the ass and held him effortlessly.Gabe\u2019s legs wrapped around his waist, Zack\u2019s bulge nudgingGabe\u2019s hole. Gabe let his head fall back and wiggled, trying to work the head through the slit of Zack\u2019s boxers.</p><p>\u201cSlow down. There are other rules you\u2019ll have to follow. No more drinking or smoking and abusing your body.You\u2019ll live with me, and I warn you,I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well thatgoes both ways, babe.\u201d Gabe dropped his head to nibble at Zack\u2019s ear and whispered.\u201cHey, are you going to fuck me or talk me to death?\u201d</p><p>Zack growled at him and threw him down on his back on the bed. He crossed over to the side table and pulled out a tube of lube.\u201cTurn over and let me prepare you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d Gabe said, twisting around and propped himself up on his hands and knees, putting his ass in the air provocatively. He looked over his shoulder to see if Zack was paying attention.</p><p>Zack popped his ass playfully.\u201cBe still, whelp. I\u2019m getting you ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, babe. I\u2019m not a virgin. Just smear a little lube on and let\u2019s get this show on the road. Take off those shorts and let me inspect themerchandise.\u201d</p><p>Zack slapped his butt again, and Gabe laughed.\u201cOh,baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like a spanking.I have a feeling you\u2019ll be getting a lot of them in the months to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises. I\u2019ll give you some too, honey. All you got to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled and shook his head. He opened the lube and squirted out a good glob of it in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need much. I told you it\u2019s not my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I will.\u201d</p><p>Zack turned to face himand pushing his boxers down, giving Gabe his first look at a wolf\u2019s penis.Gabe\u2019s eyebrows flew almost to his hairline, and he fell down on the bed to twist around and look at Zack more closely.\u201cWhoa, baby, you\u2019re hung like a horse, and what the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>Zack looked down at himself and tried to imagine what his mate must be seeing. Around the base of his larger than human cock was a large, circular knot, a bulbus glandis found in every canine species, including the wolf. The knot was nature\u2019s way of ensuring conception for the male and female of primitive species by tying the two together long enough for the sperm to be effective. In shifters, the gland also secreted hormones to create the bond. The same hormones sealed a bond in male matings with the added benefit of providing incredibly long, intense orgasms in the way it affected the prostate. Though the secretions only occurred in the mating bond, the bonus of exceptional climaxes occurred whenever the knot was embedded strictly for pleasure, an involved explanation Zack was not going to take the time for then.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my knot, sweetheart, and it will hurt like hell going in, but you can stretch to take it. I\u2019ll go slow and be careful. I promise.Once it\u2019s in, you\u2019ll have a lot of orgasms, and they\u2019ll be very mind blowing.Just hang on and try to ride it out till it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Gabe went back to his hand and knees, stuck out his ass, and wiggled it again.\u201cMultiple orgasms? Let\u2019s do this! Oh and don\u2019t forget the condom. I\u2019m not suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a condom, baby, and neither do you. Our blood affords us immunity from most diseases.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou mean we can always go bareback?Damn, that\u2019s a perk!\u201d</p><p>Zack laughed out loud, proud of his adventurous, sexy little lover. He lubed him up well and put his fingers in to stretch him before nudging the large head of his cock inside. Gabe twisted to look at him, taking his width without difficulty. A wave of love washed over Zack. He thrust deeply inside him, right up to the knot. Gabe pushed back on him. Zack took the opportunity to push in deep and hard, forcing some of the knot inside him. Gabe cried out and tried to pull away. Zack\u2019s hand, clutching Gabe\u2019s cock and balls, pulled him back. The other hand worked in the knot.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, baby. Push back against me, honey. Bear down and push out. You can take it.\u201d While Gabestopped trying to get away, he moaned pitifully and almost broke Zack\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, darlin\u2019.I don\u2019t mean to hurt you, but it\u2019s the only way. One more push.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Gabe back into him with one hand while he eased a finger in to help lever the knot inside with the other. With a pop, the knot slid past its thickest part and rammed deep inside him. Gabe arched his back and cried out with an immediate and intense orgasm, his prostate rubbed and bathed in the chemicals released from the gland. He reared back against Zack, lifting up to his knees.</p><p>His own body pulsing, filling Gabe with his cum, Zackpulled Gabe\u2019s head to the side by his hair, neck up to meet his mouth. He bit down on the side of his neck sharply, giving him the deep mating bite, ensuring Gabe was his forever. Gabe cried out in surprise and pain, followed quickly by a deep-throated groan of pleasure.</p><p>His climax ebbing, Zack released the bite, licking at the wound on Gabe\u2019s neck, taking his sweet blood. Zack held to Gabe\u2019s body, twisting out of control. Making mindless whimpering sounds, Gabe\u2019s breath came in big hitches as his body processed the chemicals flooding into him. Zack lowered him down, going with him as Gabe collapsed to the bed, their bodies tied together.</p><p>Wave after wave of bliss engulfed Gabe. He cried out a lot from an experience too intense to last\u2014except it did. On and on it went until he thought he might die. Zack wedged his hand under him and wrapped his hand around his cock, stroking it gently and soothingly. One orgasm started to ease off and another took its place. Gabe thought he might have howled a time or two, but most of the time he wanted only to be held and comforted by the very man who was killing him! He begged Zack to end it, but Zack murmured to him instead. The feelings grew too powerful, and he lost himself in a faint.</p><p>He woke up in the middle of another orgasm. Too tired to fight it, he let it take him over and rode it like a wave. Another, then another and Zack whispered to him, soothed him, told him over and over he was his sweetheart, his lover, his mate.</p><p>Gabe wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d survive until the pressure in his ass eased, and Zack pulled out, stroking his back to relax him. Zackbit into his wrist and held it to Gabe\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cDrink, sweetheart. It will help tomake you mine completely.\u201d</p><p>Gabe let the bright sweetness spill over his lips. He remembered the taste and musk of honey, thick and delicious as he closed his eyes and latched onto Zack\u2019s wrist. The blessed lassitude came over him in waves, soothing the pain and making him feel boneless and totally relaxed. He was flying again, higher than before. He soared up into the clouds, and they thickened around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He awoke slowly, sensuously, feeling more relaxed than he\u2019d been in months even with a raging hard-on. He stretched and tried to roll over on his side\u2014and came instantly awake. His left wrist was handcuffed to the bedpost. What? Was he kidding? Wide awake and fuming, Gabe tried to twist his wrist out of the restraint without success.</p><p>Looking around him for something to use to help him break free, he realized how very dark it was. Considering it was the night of the full moon, it wasn\u2019t as dark as it should be. A soft light came through a casement window high on the bathroom wall. The moon was shining brightly outside. For a moment, his body tensed as he waited for the pull of the moonlight, but it didn\u2019t come. No hint of the change came over him, no feelings of bestial savagery. He breathed a sigh of relief. At least that much was true. Zack had promised him the shifting would be over after he mated with him. Apparently he hadn\u2019t been lying.</p><p>Why in the hell had he handcuffed him? The idea made him furious. He would not be anyone\u2019s prisoner\u2014not even Zack\u2019s no matter how crazily his body cried in need of him. Impotently, Gabe pulled at the cuff and gripped his hard-on for relief. From outside, he heard the distant howling of wolves, and it made him shiver. What if one of them came in here and attacked him? Another distant howl and his mind traveled back to the night a little over a year ago when he\u2019d heard that sound before\u2014the night his mother was murdered. If one of those murdering wolves came in, he\u2019d be a sitting duck. Shaking, he forced his mind not to think about what might be lurking outside the walls of the room. He pulled desperately at the handcuff. His hand slipped a tiny bit down into the cuff, and an idea was born. The lube still lay within reach on the bedside table.</p> <p>As wonderful as running through the woods with his pack was, Zack\u2019s thoughts kept straying back to his sweet mate. If there hadn\u2019t been the pressure of the full moon coming so soon, he would have waited, making sure they had time to learn more of each other before mating. He promised his cousin he wouldn\u2019t endanger the other mates and children and handcuffed Gabe to the bed once he fell asleep, in case the mating wasn\u2019t strong enough. He hoped Gabewouldn\u2019t wake up until after he got back home to remove the restraints. It might upset him. The last thing he wanted.</p><p>He made his way back home way ahead of the rest of the pack, excited to see Gabe. Shifting quickly, he grabbed his clothes and almost ran to the basement, anxious to move him to what would be their new bedroom. A little nervous, he hoped Gabe would like his new home and settle into his new life. He knew it would be quite an adjustment to get used to pack life, particularly considering the traumatic and tragic way he was made. Experience and tradition had proved wolves and Werekin were ultimately happier within a pack, following rules and laws. Rogues were those who didn\u2019t assimilate for whatever reason and some became the equivalent of human outlaws, refusing to obey the laws of wolf or human, often violent and destructive.</p><p>Zack wished he could make Gabe\u2019s turning right to him somehow, but he couldn\u2019t erase the pain and horror of the attack. No one could bring back his poor mother. He would like to help Gabe find the murdering rogue, not only for his sake, but for the sake of other humans the rogue might encounter.</p><p>In the meantime, he would try to help Gabe understand pack life and assimilate into it gradually. He figured he was going to be a handful as a mate. He certainly had a mind of his own.</p><p>He opened the door to the basement room and stopped in horror. The bed was empty, and the cuff he\u2019d used to restrain his mate hung discarded by the bedpost. He turned in a panic to run from the room, when a slight noise from the bathroom stopped his wild flight. Crossing quickly to the door, he flung it open to see Gabe standing calmly by the sink, wearing only a towel and shaving. He cast Zack a frowning look in the mirror and kept at his task, not bothering to even acknowledge him otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cGabe? Honey?\u201d Gabe finished and rinsed his face carefully before turning to look at Zack. \u201cDon\u2019t honey me. You handcuffed me to the bed!I\u2019m not your fucking prisoner, so you may as well get used to the idea right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabe , thatwasn\u2019t why I handcuffed you. Honestly, I was afraid the mating and the blood might not totally work at first, and I had to leave to shift with the pack.I didn\u2019t want to put you back in the cell, but I couldn\u2019t leave the other mates and the children unprotected, in case something went wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Humph.If I didn\u2019t want you to come over here and kiss me so much, I\u2019d probably make you grovel a little more, but okay, I can understand.This time.\u201d He pointed a finger at Zack. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do itagain.\u201d</p><p>Zack walked over to him and took the finger in his mouth, enjoying the little sigh slipping from Gabe\u2019s lips before he took him next, bending him back in his arms to kiss him thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cAm I forgiven then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little.\u201d He pushed Zack away.\u201cStand over there,\u201d he said, nodding toward the door. \u201cYour damn bite and blood has me feeling loopy. All I want to do is lick you all over.I can\u2019t think straight with you so close.Go on.\u201d He made a little shooing motion with his hand and waited until Zack went to stand by the door, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re doing very well,\u201d Zack said. \u201cSurprisingly so.I thought you\u2019d still be sleeping. Usually when humans are mated, it takes them days to come out of heat. Your system must be totally different from most humans. It must be because you werealready turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the rogue monster bit me?\u201d He sagged against the sink. \u201cI\u2019ve been running with the full moon for almost a year. Damn, I hope it\u2019s really all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, honey, I promise.As long as you feed from me occasionally and let me care for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what happens next? I can care for myself, you know. I keep telling you.We\u2019ve mated, like you said, and you told me I\u2019d be part of your pack from this point on. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll move upstairs to my room, and we\u2019ll need to go get your car soon. I\u2019ve already sent someone out to gather up your camping gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy truck, but yeah. I left it in the campground parking lot. Where are the rest of my clothes? And my gun? The shotgun belonged to my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought your gun with us.It\u2019s upstairs in our room. I\u2019m having your clothes washed for you. Uh...about that, our new pets usually wear leather pants. Your ass will look fine in leather, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh...okay, back up. First of all, what the hell is a pet? Second of all, are you kidding me?I\u2019m not your dog, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, and I figured you wouldn\u2019t like the idea. We call our non-shifting pack members pets.It\u2019s just a name, though a lot of new pets don\u2019t understand and get all torn up about it. In a mating, it\u2019s a mark of ownership, too, soother wolves will know you\u2019re taken\u2014well, that and the collar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in dog collar? So not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Gabe, honey...\u201d Zack began to say, shifting his feet uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Gabe honey me, either.I don\u2019t mind the leather pants much, because yes, my ass will look fine in them, but no collar. This is not S&amp;M, or it better not be. I mean, I like a little kink and all, but I\u2019ve never seen the point in a collar.\u201d</p><p>Zack lost his patience, never long to begin with, and shouted.\u201cThe point is to let others know to keep their damn hands off you, because you\u2019re mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear one only if you wear one too!\u201d Gabe shouted right back. \u201cAnd the leathers, come to think of it, sinceI\u2019d like to look at your ass in leather just as much as you like to look at mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Zack grumbled, turning around to go back and sit on the bed. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Gabe came out of the bathroom and sat beside him on the bed, smiling as he pulled off his towel.\u201cI\u2019m worth it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Zack said, snarling and pulling Gabe to him. \u201cProve it .\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Zack sat at the head table, watching Gabe eat. The young man had a voracious appetite. He dug into his second steak and showed no signs of being full. His metabolism must be amazing to burn off all those calories. Zack almost wished he would put on a little weight, maybe even get a little pot belly. He wouldn\u2019t have to be as jealous all the time of the attention his handsome mate received.From the moment they\u2019d walked into the dining room, almost every eye had been on him and not just from curiosity. What had pissed Zack off even more was the fact Gabe looked back. Not really flirting, he did let his eyes roam more than once to a good-looking young gamma as he passed by, making Zack furiously jealous.</p><p>Zack had always considered himself to be nice looking, having been told he was handsome numerous times. Like all the wolves he was large and well built, muscular like a body builder, though Zack\u2019s muscles came from hard work, not from lifting weights. He had the family trait of dark hair and deep brown eyes, along with high cheek bones, supporting the long held family belief that Native American blood ran through their veins. Gabe, on the other hand, was simply beautiful, as different from Zack as night from day. He was smaller, though probably only in relation to the huge wolves roaming around the compound. Probably of average human height, he had a beautiful body, slim, but ripped and cut all along his chest and abs, tapering down to a small waist. His midnight black hair and his icy blue eyes made Zack want to sit and stare at him all night. The combination was striking and beautiful. His lips were full and soft, almost pouty, and his nose was short and straight. Gorgeous, Zack thought, and all mine, though Gabe needed reminding constantly.</p><p>The night before had been their mating ceremony. Gabe had actually agreed to wear the white robes, but only if Zack had worn one too. No amount of frowning, growling, or attempts at intimidation worked. Finally Zack slipped a robe on over his bare chest, and Gabe had done the same. No collaring, though.He\u2019d been absolutely adamant on the issue. Zack was still trying to figure out a way to bribe him into that one. He didn\u2019t want to force him so early in their relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabe had quickly figured out something it took most pets years to learn. For all their posturing and tough talk, wolves were powerless against their pets. Sworn to protect and serve them, they were completely unable to deliberately hurt them physically or even emotionally. Any pain they doled out would only hurt them just as much, since wolves were unable to stand seeing their mates upset in any way. Most used intimidation and threats as their weapons, even spankings, but with Gabe, these tools didn\u2019t work in the least. Actually, Zack hadn\u2019t tried a good spanking yet. He had the feeling Gabe would enjoy it too much, taking away all its power as a tool of intimidation. Still, sometimes, like tonight, his hands itched to spank that ass.</p><p>The night before, they had stood in front of the entire assembled pack, some fifty strong, and Zack had repeated the traditional words as he held Gabe\u2019s hand in his. \u201cThis is Gabriel, and I hold him to my heart where he will lodge forever. I pledge to him my love and faith, and my promise to always care for him, always protect him. My soul has found its mate, and I will never forsake him. Even unto death, my heart will follow his.\u201d</p><p>Gabe had dropped his head as he said the words to him, refusing to meet his gaze, yet when he\u2019d finished speaking and tipped up Gabe\u2019s chin to kiss him, his beautiful eyes were suspiciously wet. Zack whispered in his ear as he held him close.\u201cWe\u2019re your family from now on, sweetheart.You\u2019ll never be alone again.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe had shuddered and wrapped his arms tightly around Zack\u2019s waist. Zack left him then as he and the pack went outside to shift, a tradition after a mating ceremony, and he thoughthe\u2019d detected a tightening of Gabe\u2019s lips and a disapproving glance. He\u2019d been in the throes of strong emotion, though, and by the time he and the pack returned from their moonlit run much later during the night, Gabe was sound asleep.He hadn\u2019t awakened him, just slid in beside him and held him close the rest of the night.</p><p>Tonight they were having the wedding feast, with dancing afterward. Zack had been kept busy all day with pack concerns and had hardly seen Gabe until an hour before the feast. Gabe had been in the shower when he came in and had opened the shower door enticingly when he heard Zack.</p><p>\u201cWant to come in and get a shower with me?\u201d he\u2019d asked seductively, thrusting his hips toward him.</p><p>A strangled sound came from Zack\u2019s throat at the sight of his mate\u2019s gorgeous body, with his large cock bobbing around in front of him. Zack had backed away with drops of pre-cum already leaking from his cock. \u201cHell, no. If I get in there with you, neither one of us is making it to the feast.\u201d</p><p>Gabe closed the door and laughed, pressing his erect, rigid cock up against the glass.\u201cAre you sure? I could use a little help in here.I actually think it\u2019s your duty as my mate to make sure I don\u2019t miss cleaning any spots, especially those hard-toreach places.\u201d</p> <p>Growling, Zack tore his clothes off and climbed in, wrapping his arms around his mate and pulling his hot, wet body up against his own.He lowered his mouth to Gabe\u2019s throat, kissing and sucking his way downward to his cock. He spent some quality time with it before flipping a breathless, weak-kneed Gabe around and bending him over to brace himself on the wall. Zack soaped his hands and his cock before putting a finger up his mate\u2019s rosy little hole.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I believe in hygiene. Don\u2019t you, sweetheart? I think you need a thorough cleaning, and I\u2019m just the man for the job.\u201d Zack touched Gabe\u2019s prostate, just sweeping a soapy finger over its surface and held him tightly around the waist as he bucked his hips.</p><p>\u201cSettle down. You asked for this. I have to make sureyou\u2019re nice and clean everywhere.\u201d He nudged his swollen cock up inside and pushed hard, lodging himself in deep. He waggled his hips in a circular motion.\u201cGetting all the little nooks and crannies, baby. Just hold on.\u201d</p><p>Gabe gasped for breath.\u201cOh, you asshole!Oh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel good, baby? Here, let me get thisone little dirty spot again.\u201d He pulled his cock back across his prostate, and Gabe screamed, pounding his hands against the tiled shower. Zack reached around in front of him and took his weeping cock in hand, giving it only two pulls before Gabe reached a shuddering climax, clawing helplessly at the wall in front of him. Zack thrust into him in earnest then, his climax followed in seconds, holding Gabe up as his knees sagged beneath him.</p><p>Zack continued to hold him up as they rinsed their bodies of soap and cum, and helped him from the shower. They laughingly dried each other off. The trouble erupted when they started to dress.</p> <p>Gabe took a pair of leather pants from the drawer and tossed them to Zack.\u201cHere, put these on. I had a hard time getting some in your size.I had to ask around everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Zack caught them and tossed them on the bed.\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cPets wear the leathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my pet, so put \u2019em on.\u201d Gabe picked them up and advanced on him with the pants in his hand.\u201cC\u2019mon, babe. You\u2019d look great in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me explain this to you again. Traditionally\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the hell with tradition! Let\u2019s start something new! From this time on for special occasions, wolves and pets both wear the leather pants.Do it for me?\u201d He batted his long eyelashes at Zack.</p><p>Zack snatched them from his hands and threw them back on the bed.\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>Gabe thinned his lips and turned away, going back over to the dresser.\u201cYou just have everything your way, don\u2019t you? You even left me after the ceremony minutes after saying you would hold me to your heart forever. Yeah, right\u2014so long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with a night out with the wolf boys.\u201d</p><p>Zack cleared his throat, nervous, worried about what Gabe might do. He was so unpredictable. \u201cI thought you understood about the ceremony and our traditions. I guess you\u2019ll say youwon\u2019t wear the leather pants,either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019ll wear them.\u201d He smiled sweetly at Zack, which should have been his first warning.</p><p>Zack quickly dressed in his jeans and a white shirt and looked over his shoulder at Gabe as he left the room.\u201cI have to check on things. Is...uh...everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust peachy.\u201d Gabe gave him another toothy smile and lay back on the bed.\u201cI\u2019ll get dressed and be there in a minute.I want to rest awhile first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re sure you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be? I\u2019ll be theresoon.\u201d</p><p>Zack was still uneasy at Gabe\u2019s quick compliance. Usually, he would have argued with him about it for an hour or more, probably ending in a screaming fight.Tonight, he\u2019d given in awfully fast.He\u2019d like to believe Gabe was finally accepting things, acknowledging Zack as his alpha and doing as he told him to do.He\u2019d like to believe it, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019d had a feeling Gabe was up to something.</p><p>He found out when the feast started.About twenty minutes into it, just when he\u2019d decided to go find his mate, he heard a buzzing in the room, and Gabe made his entrance. He wore the leather pants all right\u2014at least two sizes too small.God alone knew how he\u2019d managed to squeeze his round little ass into them. They showed off his bubble butt and his bulging package nicely, just barely making it up over his hips. He twisted those hips as he walked toward Zack. He wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, and he sported rings in both his nipples. Where in the hell had those come from?Apparently, he\u2019d had them somewhere in his duffle bag, along with the dark eyeliner around his eyes and the peach colored lip gloss on his full lips. The rings had little blue stars dangling from them, hitting his chest as he walked.</p><p>On his feet he wore combat boots, with the legs of his pants stuffed down inside them. Clunky and at odds with his makeup, they made him look androgynous and hot as hell. His short, black hair was spiked up with gel, and he looked a little like a sexy rocker someone had plopped down incongruously in the middle of the woods. Twisting his ass, he walked over to Zack and smiled, pirouetting in front of him.\u201cDo I look all right, babe?\u201d</p><p>Zack growled at him. \u201cDamn it, Gabe.You\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud.\u201cThen I\u2019d better be careful not to get burned.\u201d He put a finger to his tongue, wet it, and touched it to his ass.\u201cSsss...yep, pretty damn hot stuff.\u201d He laughed as he patted Zack\u2019s cheek. Spotting the buffet table against the wall, he said,\u201cSomething smells good, and I\u2019m starving. Go fix me a plate, will you, babe?I\u2019m still tired from earlier.\u201d He winked at Zack and sat down, playing with his nipple ring.</p><p>Zack slapped his hand down and got up. \u201cI\u2019ll fix your plate, honey. Then since you\u2019re so tired, you can go on up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the dancing? Not a chance.\u201d As if on cue, the music from the stereo started up, some Lady Gaga song the younger pets liked.\u201cAre you kidding? I love this song!\u201d</p><p>Some of the younger wolves and their pets were already on the dance floor, and Gabe jumped up to join them. He pulled a few others onto the floor and soon he had a large group dancing around him. With no one dancing with anyone in particular, Zack allowed it, but watched his pet carefully, his eyes hooded, his arms folded over his chest.</p><p>Gabe put his arms over his head and gyrated his hips until Zack could feel his cock about to burst through his pants from watching him.He saw more than one wolf\u2019s eyes on his mate as he ran his hands seductively down his naked chest and bent over to bump and grind his ass in the air.</p><p>Unable to stand it a second longer, Zack jumped to his feet and moved over to stand behind him, pulling the ass in question right up against his rigid cock.\u201cGrind this,\u201d he whispered in Gabe\u2019s ear, pulling his body close to him.</p><p>Laughing, Gabe turned in his arms and ground his cock obligingly into Zack\u2019s before pulling away and dancing in front of him, just out of reach.\u201cThere are children watching, babe. Remember where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood advice you should take yourself,\u201d Zack grumbled and looked around him. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the only ones watching, either.\u201d Several male members of his pack watched Gabe.\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve made your point, and everyone has seen how sexy you are. Can you sit down?Please?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabe danced by him on the way back to their table.\u201cSince you said please, I\u2019ll sit down and have something to eat, but we\u2019re dancing later. I have plans for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at you, baby. Nowsit your little ass down, please.\u201d</p><p>Zack watchedhis mate eat the plate he\u2019d filled for him, wondering how he\u2019d lost control so easily. Gabe really did look amazing in those tight pants, but those would be kept in their bedroom from this point on for private showings only, and Zack was reconsideringGabe\u2019s wearing leather and going shirtless at all.</p> <p>\u201cI knowwhat you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Gabe said with a smile.\u201cBut I\u2019m wearing these every day until you agree to put yours on too. When you do, I\u2019ll wear the proper size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? You\u2019re making the rules? What about what your alpha thinks?\u201d Zack\u2019s voice had dropped down low and menacing, a voice which made all of the wolves in his pack shiver with fear. Gabe was unimpressed.\u201cI\u2019m not a wolf. Not anymore.I\u2019ve been making rules for myself for a long time. Oh, by the way, I have an idea about the collar you keep nagging me about. I\u2019ll show you when you take me to town. When are you taking me, by the way? I need to get my truck out of the parkinglot before they think it\u2019s abandoned.\u201d</p><p>Zack\u2019s voice was still gruff as he answered him. \u201cTomorrow, I guess. Will that suit you, your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it will.\u201d He wiped his mouth with his napkin.\u201cAnd stop being so grouchy.I\u2019ll suck your cock for you when I get you upstairs.\u201d He grinned and winked at him.</p><p>Zack had to shift in his seat to adjust himself.\u201cDamn it, Gabe! Don\u2019t say stuff like that. Somebody willhear you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet \u2019em.\u201d He stood up and stroked his hand over the bulge in his tight leathers.\u201cC\u2019mon, babe. I want you to rub this for me on the dance floor for a while before we go upstairs for the blow job I promised you.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand and waggled his fingers. Zack stood up, sighing.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with you.\u201d He took Gabe\u2019s hand, but swatted his ass as Gabe led him onto the floor.</p><p>Gabe reached up to put both arms around Zack\u2019s neck, rubbing himself on Zack\u2019s erection. \u201cJust love me, babe. It\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>Gabe gave his T-shirt a tug. Back in what he called his civvies for a trip to town, he actually missed the feel of the soft leather pants. Not that he\u2019d tell Zack. He yawned widely as he ate his muffin and drank a large glass of milk.The milk was Zack\u2019s idea. He made him drink some every morning, sayinghe didn\u2019t think he looked healthy enough. Gabe thought he was trying to make him gain a little weight. Jealous ass. Gabe smiled to himself. Good luck with that. His mother had fussed for years over the fact he could eat pretty much anything and never gain weight. Besides, he loved milk. He only pretended not to, to let his sexy man think he was bossing him around a little.</p><p>They got a late start, after Zack kept him up \u2014literally\u2014half the night. The man was insatiable, but Gabe loved every minute of it. He was beginning to care very deeply for this man, which was a good thing, he supposed, since he was mated to him for life, as Zack kept reminding him. He needed Zack to tell him he loved him first, though, to say the words, before he admitted how he felt about Zack.He\u2019d been hurt before too many times to put his heart out there to be trampled on again. No, Zack was going to have to work a little harder for it.</p><p>Zack f inished his coffee and put his hand under Gabe\u2019s jaw in a soft caress. \u201cAlmost finished?I had one of the guys bring my truck around the front.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe swallowed the last bite of muffin and got to his feet.\u201cReady to go. Can we go into town first? I had an idea about the collar I wanted to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling this is going to cost me some money? What kind of idea, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>They walked out the front of the building together and got into Zack\u2019s year-old black pickup. Compared to Gabe\u2019s old truck, the newer truck was luxurious. Gabe sat back in the leather seat and arched a look at Zack.\u201cCan I drive this sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, darlin\u2019. What\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really mean it?\u201d Gabe\u2019s voice was low and hesitant.</p><p>Zack looked over at him in surprise.\u201cOf course I do. We\u2019re mates, baby. Everything I have is yours.I\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Zack? You hardly knowme, really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knowyou,\u201d Zack said indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate. It waslove at first sight for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove? I knowyou don\u2019t mean it, really.More like lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thattoo.\u201d Gabe made a little sound of disapproval, and Zack turned to him smiling. \u201cOh, c\u2019mon baby, lighten up. You were standing in the moonlight when I first saw you, naked, splashing water on your luscious body. What did you expect? Then, of course, I got to know the real you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, and I loved you in spite of it.Ouch!\u201d He yelled as Gabe gave him a punch on the arm.\u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stared out the window as they traveled down the mountain and got very quiet. Zack touched his arm.\u201cI love you, Gabe. I have almost since the first minute I saw you. Not just lust. Love.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s heart thumped in his chest, and he got a funny butterflies feeling in his stomach. Zack was saying it, justlike he\u2019d wanted him to, but now the moment was here, it left him flustered. He wanted to say it back, but he was still afraid. Stalling for time, he laid a hand on Zack\u2019s thigh. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know how I feel yet.I mean, I think I do, but I\u2019d like to be sure before I say it. Is that all right for now?\u201d</p><p>Zack squeezed his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll say it when you\u2019re ready. Okay, where do you want to go? Clayton is the closest town to us. Is that all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as they have jewelry stores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zack said.\u201cI knew this was going to cost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you I\u2019m worth it, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and I keep telling you to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I proved it already. Guess I\u2019ll have to remind you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could pull over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Take me to the jewelry store.We\u2019re going to work on settling this collar thing once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they arrived in Clayton and drove around looking for a jewelry store. Finally spotting one, Gabe made Zack pull in, and they went inside, Zack following Gabe around, a little puzzled as he passed by the chains and made straight for the wedding rings. He found one right away, a plain, white gold band, not too expensive.\u201cCan we see this one, please?\u201d</p><p>The store clerk got it out for them, looking back and forth between them. He seemed a little uncomfortable and out of his depth. Homophobe, Gabe thought, and decided to ignore him.</p><p>He held the ring out to Zack.\u201cTry this on.\u201d When Zack slipped it on his finger, Gabe smiled.\u201cI like it. Give us a minute, please,\u201d he said to the clerk. Turning to Zack, he smiled shyly, choosing his words carefully, not making any promises. \u201cI might agree to do this collar thing\u2014I\u2019d only be doing it to make you happy, not because I\u2019m your possession or anything\u2014if you do something for me.I\u2019d give it more consideration if I had my mark on you too, with a wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled.\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll wear a wedding ring. I\u2019ve told you, honey, you\u2019re it for me. I\u2019ll never even look at another person, male or female. If it makes you happy, then let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Gabe turned back and signaled to the store clerk.\u201cWe\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. I didn\u2019t say I liked this one.\u201d Zack handed the ring back to the clerk, and Gabe got a mutinous look on his face.\u201cShow me this one.\u201d He indicated a yellow gold band with three rather large diamonds across it. The clerk pulled it out, and Zack slipped it on his finger. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>The clerk said, \u201cThese are called Forever Bands. The stones represent past, present, and future.\u201d He looked Zack up and down, taking in his casual jeans and T-shirt.\u201cThis particular ring is rather expensive.We have cheaper ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we\u2019ll take two of these. One for me and one for him. Nothing is too expensive for my darlin\u2019.\u201d He pulled out a credit card and gave it to the clerk, who took it and moved away to the register.\u201cClose your mouth, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said to Gabe with a sideways glance.</p><p>They had two of the right sizes in stock and soon the clerk handed the rings over to Zack. Zack slipped them in his pocket and strolled down to another counter where gold, silver, and yellow gold chains were displayed. Picking out a heavy wide yellow gold collar, he told the clerk to charge it as well.</p><p>When they got outside to the truck, Zack took out the rings, handing his ring to Gabe.\u201cPut this on me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Not trusting himself to speak, Gabe wordlessly slipped the ring on Zack\u2019s finger.</p><p>Zack took Gabe\u2019s ring, kissed it tenderly, and slipped it on Gabe\u2019s finger. \u201cForever, I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded, tears standing in his eyes. It had been so long since he thought anyone cared if he lived or died. He hadn\u2019t expected anything like this when he set out to test Zack.</p><p>Zack pulled out the yellow gold collar in its heavy box.\u201cThis is for you, whenever you decide.I\u2019m going to give you a little more time to get used to the idea, because I\u2019m such a good master.\u201d</p><p>Gabe punched Zack in the arm, but he laughed, and his eyes blurred with tears.He hadn\u2019t fooled Zack a bit. Zack tilted his chin up to plant a kiss on his lips. \u201cI love you, Gabriel. Please don\u2019t doubt me, honey.\u201d</p><p>Hescooted over and tried his best to climb into Zack\u2019s lap and cover his face with kisses.</p><p>Zack laughed, pulling him up close by his hips.\u201cDamn, baby, is jewelry what it takes to win you over?I wish I\u2019d known a week ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the jewelry, although I love it.\u201d Gabe held out his hand to admire the ring. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s everything! I\u2019m beginning to think you really do love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeginning to think? If you\u2019re not absolutely positive by this time, I\u2019m not doing something right.I may have to take a little more time with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gabe said, nuzzling his neck.</p> <p>Zack lifted him off his leg and firmly pushed him over to his side of the truck.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before they call the cops and tell them we\u2019re making out in their parking lot. We still have to go get your truck.\u201d</p><p>They started out of town, stopping at a quick shop to get Gabe something to drink and a candy bar he told Zack he needed to fortify him for the trip to the park. The rangers were used to vehicles being parked for long periods of time, but it wasn\u2019t a good idea to leave your vehicle for too long, in case someone decided to vandalize or steal it. Not a common occurrence, but it had been known to happen.</p><p>They located the old truck right away, and Gabe climbed out of Zack\u2019s vehicle. Zack opened his own door, climbed out, angled a look over at Gabe, and handed him his pickup keys.\u201cYou can listen to some CDs as we go up the mountain.Radio reception isn\u2019t the greatest up here. Hell, do you even have a radio in this piece of junk?\u201d</p><p>Gabe snatched the keysfrom Zack\u2019s hand without question and tossed his over, pleased Zack had remembered his request to drive his truck.\u201cYes, I have a radio. It may not be top of the line, but it\u2019s not that bad. I\u2019ll have you know this old truck is a classic. I read somewhere that after twenty years, a car or truck becomes like an antique\u2014a classic collector\u2019s item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. A classic junkyard item, maybe.Okay, okay, we\u2019ll take it back up the mountain. I reallydon\u2019t want you driving it until we can have a mechanic check it out anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs thatthe reason you\u2019re letting me drive this truck?\u201d he demanded, losing part of his excitement.\u201cDamn, I\u2019m not a kid, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. Just humor me on this. Maybe we can get you a new truck? Wouldn\u2019t you like a new vehicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve bought me enough. I like this old truck. My mom helped me pick it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t drive it around on these roads until we can have it checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, since you asked nicely.\u201d He angled his face up for another kiss.</p><p>Instead Zack picked him up and pulled him up close so he could grind his erection against his.\u201cShit, I can\u2019t get enough of you. We may have to stop on the way up the mountain. I know a nice little secluded spot by a stream.A nice day to go skinny dipping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Gabe said with a little blush. Even if the over-protectiveness about drove him nuts, he loved how Zack constantly showed him how much he loved him. Maybe tonight he would admit how crazy he was about Zack too.\u201cLead the way, babe,\u201d Gabe said with a little seductive smile.</p><p>Zack got into the old truck, and Gabe got behind the wheel of the big new one. Sitting in the luxurious seats, his new ring glittering in the sun coming through the windshield, and music blasting through the radio, Gabe thought he could definitely get used to all this. He wanted to pull his own weight though, and he thought as long as they were getting along so well, he might ask Zack about finishing college to get his degree. Maybe he could take some online courses to get him back on the track he was on before he was attacked. Zack would have to loan him the money, but he could convince him he was good for it. So far, he\u2019d really denied him nothing he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>He wondered if there was anything he could do for the pack with the knowledge he had about agriculture.He\u2019d noticed a rather scraggly vegetable garden out in back of the big lodge they all lived in. Maybe he could start there and let Zack see what a green thumb he had. The area was large enough to supply all their needs and even have some left over to sell in the local farmers\u2019 markets if it was utilized right. He really wanted Zack to be proud of him.</p><p>He followed Zack up the twisty mountain roads, admiring how easily the big truck hugged the curves. Zack seemed to be having a little more trouble with Gabe\u2019s old truck.They\u2019d almost reached the top where the road ran along the ridges, going up and down along the natural slopes. They just reached one such ridge and were descending, when Zack took the curves a little too fast. Gabe could barely keep up with him. Another car passed them on the opposite side of the road, and Zack almost sideswiped it. Looking on with growing alarm, Gabe realized Zack had no brakes!</p><p>Zack crossed the center line and swerved into the side of the mountain, turning the wheel at the last second to just glance off the high bank. In horror, Gabe saw what he was doing\u2014trying to slow the truck by crashing it into the cliff wall. Gabe turned down the blaring radio to hear Zack blowing the horn wildly in an attempt to warn oncoming traffic. Fear clutched at Gabe, but all he could do was follow helplessly and hope Zack could figure a way to stop the truck. Zack managed to careen around another curve, but Gabe could see a long straight slope coming up. The truck would only pick up speed going down it and make things worse.</p><p>Gabe pushed his foot down on the accelerator and caught up to him. Praying nothing was coming, he swerved in front of his old truck and put on the brakes, not stopping totally, but slowing way down. He hoped the bulk of the bigger truck would be enough to stop the old truck. He remembered how heavy the older ones were, though, with their mostly metal parts, unlike the newer trucks with all the fiberglass paneling. His old truck slammed into the bumper, rocking him backward, and he hit his head hard on the back glass. He fought to control the wheel and stop both trucks. Though they skidded and swerved all over the road, it seemed to be working. A car came from the other direction and thankfully the driver saw what was happening, pulling well off the roadway to let them pass.</p><p>Finally, the road leveled out and even began to climb again. Gabe was able to gain control and stop them. The two trucks, locked together by their bumpers, came to a grinding halt. Gabe sat in the truck, shocked and trembling, unable to move once it was over. His head and neck hurt a little, and he wanted to throw up. The car door wrenched open next to him, and Zack leaned in, taking his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Why did you do such a stupid thing? Are you crazy? I could have probably stopped it at the next runaway truck ramp!Damn, you could have killed yourself!\u201d Zack\u2019s face was furious, and his hands ran all over his neck and shoulders as he yelled at him.</p> <p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know about a truck ramp...thought you were going to crash.I don\u2019t feel so good, Zack.\u201d He must have looked as bad as he felt, because Zack turned him toward the ground and held his forehead while the soda and candy bar came up. When it was over, he helped him from the truck and over to sit down on the side of the road. Several cars had stopped by then, and people stood around on their cell phones, no doubt calling 911.</p><p>Zack told him to sit still and went back over to the trucks. Gabe lay back down on the grassy shoulder of the road and let it all swirl around him. He heard people talking to him, but he had to concentrate on not vomiting again, ignoring most of their well-meaning advice.</p><p>Paramedics came up beside him, Zack with them, telling them what happened. The EMTs wrapped a collar aroundGabe\u2019s neck and lifted him onto a backboard. They made Zack sit down, too, to be fussed over and put them both in the back of an ambulance together at Zack\u2019s insistence. When they reached the hospital, they made Zack go in another cubicle, and Gabe closed his eyes to rest. He could hear Zack complaining loudly through the curtains and smiled. His man was worried about him.</p><p>In another minute or two, Zack was beside him, the hospital staff having abandoned their efforts to stop him. He heldGabe\u2019s hand possessively, snarling every time the doctor suggested he might want to step out. He had to let him go to X-ray, but he was there waiting when he came out. When the doctor told them he was fine, no cracked vertebrae, just a mild case of whiplash, he put a cervical collar on him with orders to wear it for a few days and come back if there was any pain, finally allowing them to leave.</p><p>Zack had refused treatment altogether, and already the small cuts and abrasions on his face were healing over. Wolves healed supernaturally fast, and Zack was no exception. They all tried to avoid any kind of examination, to conceal what their bodies would expose in human tests they\u2019d want to give him.If the accident hadn\u2019t been so public, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to the hospital at all.As it was, he couldn\u2019t very well avoid it, but he could and did refuse treatment. He held Gabe\u2019s hand as they walked outside to find the car and driver sent for them by the pack.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I get you home, I\u2019ll feed you. My blood will help you heal faster. Are you sure you\u2019re feeling all right?\u201d Zack sat beside him in the back seat, his arm firmly around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, I\u2019m fine. You worry too much.It\u2019s the vehicles you should be worried about. I guess my truck is pretty much totaled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey, I\u2019m sorry. My truck\u2019s in better shape, though it needs some body work and a new back bumper.\u201d</p><p>Gabe straightened up in the seat in panic. \u201cOh, wait! Stop the car!\u201d</p><p>The driver glanced nervously back at them, and Zack asked in alarm,\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gold necklace collar thing!It\u2019s stillin the truck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it. Calm down. You were worried about it, huh? Must mean you kind of like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, of course, I was worried about it, idiot. It\u2019s an expensive necklace. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll wear it, necessarily.\u201d</p><p>Zack looked so disappointed Gabe had to laugh at him. He stopped pretty quickly though, when he felt a sharp twinge in his neck as he threw his head back.\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cServes you right,\u201d Zack grumbled, pulling him back into his arms.\u201cJust rest until we get back to the lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resting, damn it. I\u2019m not exactly running alongside the car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Zack leaned over to kiss him thoroughly to shut his smart mouth.\u201cIf I have to, I can keep this up all the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...sounds good tome.\u201d Gabe said, as he leaned his upper body back for another kiss, cursing the uncomfortable collar.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Zack looked in on Gabe for probably the third time in an hour, only to find him still sound asleep.He\u2019d made him keep the cervical collar on, even though they\u2019d had a huge fight about it. After Zack fed him, Gabe said he wasn\u2019t even sore anymore, but Zack wanted to follow at least some of the doctor\u2019s orders. He insisted he wear the collar for a minimum of twenty-four hours, just to make sure. The resulting fight had been ugly, with Gabe trying to kick him and head-butt him as he held him down until Zack had to stretch out full length on him to hold him in place and stop him from hurting himself. Gabe was so furious it took him almost half an hour to go to sleep even after drinking Zack\u2019s blood.</p> <p>Zack got such a cockstand from it he had to take a cold shower. God, Gabe was stubborn. Zack hoped he had given him enough blood so he\u2019d sleep for a good while.He\u2019d been worried about his neck, and he\u2019d maybe given him a little too much.</p><p>He went back to his office where his top aides waited for him. His beta was Jamie, a taller than average wolf, with a shock of red-gold hair. Zack trusted his good judgment with his life. Tim, his cousin and lead gamma, was also present, along with Scott, another gamma leader and his best fighter, an expert on the Hunters. They were his team, and he relied on them for help in solving problems\u2014like who was trying to kill his mate.</p><p>Scott spoke up from the end of the table. \u201cIs he still asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I hope he\u2019ll stay asleep for a while.He\u2019s wearing me out.\u201d He pulled out a packet of old fashioned headache powders from his pocket, opened the paper, and swallowed the powder down, chasing it with a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cHave a headache, Zack?\u201d Jamie asked.</p> <p>\u201cHell, yeah. He\u2019s rightnext door.\u201d</p><p>The men around the table all smiled.They\u2019d never seen their normally rough and tough alpha so frustrated by anybody before.Since Gabe had arrived, he\u2019d been run ragged trying to keep him safe and satisfied, and the whole pack was amused by it. Not thatthey\u2019d ever openly let Zack know it\u2014they valued their own skin too much.</p><p>Scott shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t see how you take those things. They taste terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fast, and I don\u2019t taste them.I just swallow them.\u201d He looked around the table. \u201cOkay, answer my question.Who do you think is trying to kill my mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think someone is trying to kill him?\u201d Tim asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t it possible the cut brake lines were just simple vandalism?\u201d</p><p>Scott spoke up thoughtfully.\u201cAnything\u2019s possible, I guess, but there\u2019s nothing simple about it.You\u2019d have to knowwhat you were doing, and you\u2019d have to be pretty vicious to do something like it,willing to kill or seriously hurt somebody.\u201d Scott leaned forward as he spoke, his green eyes glittering dangerously.\u201cAnd if it was just vandalism, why not break some windows or spray paint the truck? No, I think Zack is right. I think it wasdeliberate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho would want to hurt Gabe, Zack?\u201d asked his beta.\u201cDo you have any idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and that\u2019s what bothers me.According to what he\u2019s told me, he\u2019s totally alone in the world. His parents are both dead, no brothers or sisters, or any close relatives.He\u2019s been a nomad, no close friends, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who would even knowwhere he was?\u201d Tim asked.\u201cIt has to be a coincidence, Zack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but I want a twenty-four hour a day guard on him. Scott, can you handle that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Alpha. I\u2019ll put my best men on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Until then, everybody needs to keep their eyes and ears open.It\u2019s possible someone has been snooping around the lodge.I don\u2019t knowwhat the hell\u2019s going on, but I won\u2019t rest until I find out. Thanks everyone, and we\u2019ll meet again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Zack went back to his room and thankfully found Gabe still asleep. He was pretty exhausted himself and didn\u2019t feel up to fighting with Gabe again. He took off his clothes and lay down next to him, wanting to spoon him, but knewGabe would probably rather he didn\u2019t. He\u2019d been spitting mad when Zack held him down earlier.Honestly, the man was the most stubborn he\u2019d ever met. Pack life required a certain amount of obedience to the alpha, even for the alpha\u2019s mate. An obedience Gabe chose to ignore outright. Zack was going to have to do something about his behavior and soon,or Gabe was never going to be a proper mate. Trouble was he didn\u2019t know what to do. In most of the packs, the old ways were still followed. If a mate really started acting out, the dominant mate would spank them and put them in restraints. As hard as it made his cock to think of Gabe\u2019s sweet ass over his knee, he knew it wouldn\u2019t work too well with the man.If he really thought Zack meant it as more than love play he\u2019d go ballistic, and Zack could hurt him trying to restrain him. Hecouldn\u2019t bear to harm him, and Gabe knew that fact very well. Locking him up somewhere didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. Once he got out, he\u2019d leave and never look back.</p><p>Tossing and turning, he tried to remember what his father did with his mother, another strong-willed human who agreed to submit her own dominant tendencies to his father out of her deep love for him. Two dominant personalities found it next to impossible to mate, unless one of them willingly submitted. The nature of wolves was to protect and dominate their mates, while the mate was the spoiled submissive partner, the beloved mate who had to defer to the wolf in all major decisions. Gabe refused to accept the role.</p> <p>His independent mother had found it very difficult to submit to his father. The conflict had nearly wrecked his parents\u2019 marriage. He remembered one occasion when he was a small child. His mother had gotten in the habit of threatening to leave, and one day his father had simply called her bluff. He told her if she wished so much to leave him, he would no longer stand in her way. She had to make a decision then to stay and submit or leave and live her life somewhere without him.In the end, she\u2019d chosen to stay, deciding she loved his father more than she loved her wish for control. While it would be scary as hell to give Gabe the chance to leave him, he thought he had to do it, for both their sakes.</p><p>The next morning, he was awakened by the cervical collar being thrown into his face. Gabe was on his feet next to the bed, already dressed in his old clothes, and as predicted, mad as hell.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you treat me like I\u2019m some kind of not very bright child! I won\u2019t stand for you manhandling me every time I disagree with you!I won\u2019t! I\u2019m giving you fair warning, Zack!\u201d</p><p>Zack sat up. He had never been a morning person, and this was not a pleasant way to wake up. Not in the least. He glared at Gabe.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be treated like a child, why do you persist in acting like one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asshole! I\u2019m going out for a walk to clear my head. I need some space!\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat down, pulled on his shoes, and stomped to the door, giving Zack one long backward dirty look as he walked out. Zack rubbed his forehead. His headache was coming back.</p><p>Getting out of bed and getting dressed, he made his way downstairs for coffee. He saw Tim and Scott and sat down beside them with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Scott asked.\u201cYou look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn headache is back. Maybe some coffee will help.\u201d</p><p>Tim looked out toward the patio.\u201cWe saw Gabe leave a few minutes ago. Said he was going for a walk.Scott\u2019s got one of the guys following him, from a distance, of course.\u201d</p><p>Zack nodded.\u201cGood.\u201d Distracted, he gazed out toward the door Gabe had left by. Where was he going, and when would he come back? Pretty bad when he couldn\u2019t stand to be away from him even for a short time.</p><p>Tim\u2019s phone rang, and he took the call, speaking into the receiver for a moment. He put his hand over the small mouthpiece and looked over at Zack.\u201cThis is Gabe\u2019s guard. He\u2014uh\u2014he says Gabe is out in the woods smoking. You said to let you know if he did anything against the rules.\u201d</p><p>Zack pressed his lips together in a grim line.\u201cDamn him. Tell the guard to confiscate the cigarettes and bring him back in here. He has my permission to put hands on him if he refuses. Don\u2019t hurt him, but use force if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tim spoke into the phone and disconnected, glancing over at Zack. Whenever the alpha was upset, it made the whole pack nervous, and Zack was definitely upset. He stood up and spoke to the men tersely.</p><p>\u201cTell the guard to bring him upstairs to our room. I\u2019ll be waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked quickly back upstairs. He knew Gabe would be right behind him. Gabe was doing everything he could to deliberately defy him. Where in the hell did he even get the damn cigarettes? He remembered he went into the quick shop alone to buy his drink and candy. He either picked up the cigarettes then, despite the trip to the jewelry store, or had them hidden in his duffle bag all along. Zack hoped, at least, he\u2019d had them hidden.</p><p>He heard Gabe shouting on the stairwell long before the door opened. The guard had been pushing him along ahead of him by holding both his arms pulled behind him. Gabe was furious. The minute the guard opened the door and shoved him inside, he whirled around and swung on him. The guard managed to duck and get the door closed before he could swing again.</p><p>Gabe turned and took out his fury on Zack.\u201cThat does it. I hate you! I hate this stupid lodge, your stupid pack, and everything about you stupid wolves!I\u2019m leaving!Don\u2019t you dare try to stop me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave whenever you want to, Gabe. I won\u2019t stop you. Obviously, this is not working out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gabe had stopped in mid-rant and stared at him.\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, you know. I\u2019ll really leave.\u201d</p><p>Zack shrugged.</p><p>Gabe got a mean look in his eye.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t give a shit! I see how you are. It was all lies, wasn\u2019t it? Yesterday when you said, \u2018I love you Gabe, don\u2019t ever doubt me.\u2019 You never meant any of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did mean it, and I do love you, butI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not going to work. You're beautiful, honey, but you rely on your beauty a little too much. What you want is for me to love you just because you're so desirable. The problem is, aside from all yourbeauty, there\u2019s not too much to love.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s mouth fell open in shock. \u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You're rude, hostile, and sullen. Not to mention sneaky and dishonest. You knew I didn\u2019t want you to smoke, and you promised you wouldn\u2019t. Basically you lied to me. You outright refuse to give me the respect every Werekin owes their alpha. I know you want someone to look past your behavior to see the real person underneath, but the only reason anyone would bother to look past all of it is because you're beautiful. That\u2019s the irony, Gabe. You say you hate pack life and you hate me. You refuse to accept me as your alpha, despite knowing how important it is. As long as you won\u2019t, it won\u2019t work between us. Unless you can change, I\u2019m fighting a losing battle.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe still hadn\u2019t said a word. He simply glared, his eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cI release you from your vows, Gabriel.\u201d Zack took off his ring and laid it gently down on the bedside table next to him.\u201cI\u2019m more sorry than you\u2019ll ever know.I\u2019ll provide you with a new vehicle and some money to get a new start.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stood in the middle of the floor, trembling. His chin actually quivered, and it broke Zack\u2019s heart. Taking every bit of self-control he had to not grab Gabe\u2019s hand and beg him to forgive him, he shoved his hands in his pocket to keep from reaching for him. This was a turning point for them. Gabe had to choose to stay with him and not stay because he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I can\u2019t leave.\u201d Gabe\u2019s voice was low and heartbreaking.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s the issue of blood, and something can be worked out there. You may have to agree to settle down around Clayton or one of the adjoining towns, so I can arrange for you to be fed once every couple of weeks. You\u2019d be free otherwise to live your life the way you want.It\u2019s the only thing I can think of, baby, but I\u2019d never just abandon you to the beast. I\u2019ll find someone to feed you regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe stood there for another moment, glaring at him, hurt feelings in every line of his body. His anger came to his aid. He turned and went to the dresser, yanked it open and pulled out his clothes. He whirled around with tears standing in his eyes and stalked to the closet.</p><p>Zack stayed silent, not trusting himself tospeak for fear he\u2019d break down, throw himself at his feet, and beg him to stay.</p><p>Gabe pulled out the duffel bag and crossed back over to the dresser to throw his clothes inside. When he finished, he stood facing Zack.\u201cI\u2019m ready to go. Can you at least take me down the mountain or do I walk?\u201d</p><p>Zack picked up the phone by his bed, dialed an internal number, and spoke into the receiver. \u201cScott, can you bring a car around? Gabe is leaving us.\u201d He hung up and got to his feet. Without looking at Gabe, he said over his shoulder.\u201cGo down to the front and wait.I\u2019ll make sure Scott has everything you need.\u201d</p><p>Gabe hesitated for a long moment while Zack held his breath. He thought Gabe almost backed down, but in the end he was just too stubborn. Without a word, he marched to the door and stopped. Pulling off his ring, he threw it on the bed where it bounced on the cover and landed on the floor. They both watched it roll across the floor and stopat Zack\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cKeep your damn ring. You\u2019re not the only one who can take it off like it\u2019s nothing!\u201d He turned on his heel, hurried through the door, and slammed it behind him. Zack bent over and picked up Gabe\u2019s ring, putting it on his little finger. He put his own ring back where it belonged. He had no intention of letting Gabe go far, but he had a point to prove. He hoped it would work or else he\u2019d have to go after him and drag him back, then throw himself at his feet and beg forgiveness.He simply couldn\u2019t live without him, but he didn\u2019t want Gabe to know it just yet. He went slowly down the steps after Gabe and saw him sitting forlornly outside on the front porch chairs.</p> <p>Scott came up to Zack with a worried look on his face.\u201cAlpha? Did you mean it about the car?I\u2019ve got one ready, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Gabe to town and get him a nice hotel room somewhere. Tell him it will take some time for me to get him an apartment and a car, and in the meantime he\u2019s to stay at the hotel. Give him some money.\u201d He reached in his pocket and drew out a couple of one hundred dollar bills. \u201cThen watch him.Don\u2019t let him out ofyour sight, but don\u2019t let him know about it. Keep a low profile and call me if you need any help.I\u2019m going to give him until tomorrow to calm down before I talk to him again.\u201d</p><p>Scott nodded and turned to leave. Zack stopped him.\u201cRemember, don\u2019t let him out of your sight, Scott. You know what we talked about earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Alpha.\u201d Scott turned and went out to speak to Gabe, who handed him his bag and looked back over his shoulder at Zack without any more anger. He raised his hand and gave Zack a sad little wave.It almost broke Zack\u2019s heart, and he had to grip the back of a chair to keep himself from going to him.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed slowly, more like ten years than a few hours. Scott texted him the hotel and room number when theyarrived, but it didn\u2019t help a bit. Everywhere he looked he saw Gabe or heard his teasing laughter. Around six thirty, his cell phone rang, and Scott was on the line.</p><p>\u201cUh, Alpha, I think you might want to get down here right away.\u201d</p><p>Zack jumped to his feet and started running for the door.\u201cIs he hurt? What hospital are you at? God, I should never have let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not hurt. At least not physically, although he cried all the way down the mountain. Didn\u2019t want me to see it, but he was in bad shape. It must have been a hell of a fight you two had.\u201d At Zack\u2019s angry growl he continued. \u201cOh, uh, anyway,I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 him every minute like you told me. He stayed in his room for a long time, then came out and walked down to this little country western bar about a block from the hotel. You know the one\u2014the Dew Drop?He\u2019s wearin\u2019 the tightest damn pants I ever saw, and he\u2019s been gettin\u2019 really plastered. Doesn\u2019t look like a little thing like Gabe could hold so much liquor.I think he\u2019s going to spend all the money you gave him on booze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon. Don\u2019t let anything happen to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t. The thing is he\u2019s dancin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing?\u201d Zack was in the car, starting it up to race down the mountain. \u201cWho the hell is he dancing with?I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d Zack wasn\u2019t too sure if he meant Gabe or whoever dared to touch his mate. Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cNot really with anybody. See, he\u2019s kind of up on the bar.\u201d</p><p>Zack groaned loudly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and everybody in the place is watchin\u2019 him. He\u2019s puttin\u2019 on quite a show. Some of the girls are puttin\u2019 dollar bills in his waistband. These are a bunch of good old boys in this bar, but the way some of them are lookin\u2019 at him, he might get a few to follow him home.\u201d</p><p>Zack actually felt his claws extend and hair sprout out on the back of his neck.\u201cMine!\u201d he growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cSir, you know I know!I won\u2019t let anybody get near him. I\u2019m watchin\u2019 him, like I said, and he\u2019s still dancin\u2019. I\u2019ll call you back if he goes on the move.\u201d</p><p>Zack made it down the mountain in fifteen minutes, a drive which usually took half an hour. Pulling into the parking lot on two wheels, he tried to calm himself down and barely succeeded. He could already smell his mate, his own unique scent layered over with tequila, lots of tequila and cigarette smoke. Zack practically ran inside the bar, and what he saw nearly made him shift into his wolf right there and then.</p><p>Gabe was certainly wearing the tightest pair of jeans he\u2019d ever seen, Scott wasn\u2019t exaggerating.He looked like he\u2019d been poured into them. Where in the hell had those come from? He should have gone through his duffle bag, the only place they could have come from. Not only were they skin tight, but on one leg had little tears all along the back where his ass met his thigh, and that delectable part of his anatomy was on full display. He was commando, of course.</p><p>He had his shirt off, displaying his hot little body for the world to see, and dollar bills were sticking out of his pockets and waistband. He had a bottle of tequila in one hand, holding it by the bottle neck, and a half-smoked cigarette in the other. Head thrown back, he gyrated his hips in time with the music, singing along at the top of his lungs to a Trace Adkins song about honkytonks and something called badonkadonks, and shaking his beautiful ass. He had his eyes closed, never knowing when Zack came to stand under him. He was right at the point in the song where the singer asks,\u201cLord have mercy, how\u2019d she even get them britches on?\u201d Zack wondered the same thing himself.</p><p>Scott came over to stand beside Zackand grinned until he saw the look in his alpha\u2019s eye. He dropped his head and shuffled his feet.</p><p>Zack raised his voice above the music and yelled at Gabe.\u201cHey,baby, having fun?\u201d</p><p>Gabe opened his eyes and glanced down Zack, before doing a double take. His reaction was almost comical except for the fact he fell off the bar still holding onto his bottle and would have hurt himself if Zack hadn\u2019t caught him. Zack flipped him over his shoulder and carried him straight out of the bar with Scott trailing along behind them. Catcalls and hoots sounded off as Zack strode out. Gabe even had the nerve to rise up and wave to the crowd.</p><p>Zack dumped him in the front seat, removed the cigarette from his hand, and threw it on the ground. He pulled the bottle of tequila away and handed it to Scott without comment before goingaround to the driver\u2019s side and starting the car.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, baby.\u201d Gabe called out drunkenly, slurring his words and lunging for the bottle.\u201cI was gonna use that tequila. I thought you might gimme a tequila backdoor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zack looked at him steadily.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite, what the hell is a tequila backdoor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, it\u2019s nice, babe. You just sprinkle a little salt on my rim, pour on a little tequila, gimme a squirt of lime,and enjoy, baby!\u201d Gabe fell back in the seat laughing uproariously at his own joke.</p><p>Rolling his eyes and not saying a word, Zack drove down the road to the hotel where Scott said he was staying,took him upstairs to his room the same way he\u2019d taken him out of the bar, and locked the door behind them.</p> <p>Carrying Gabe straight to the bathroom, Zack started the shower, and pushed Gabe inside, clothes and all. The water was ice cold, and Gabe put up one hell of a fuss, fighting to get out and cussing. Zack held him in with a steely grip on the back of his neck, keeping him from turning the water off until Gabe shivered and his teeth clacked together. He turned off the water and helped him to strip off the skin tight jeans. Wrapping him in a big towel, he pushed him out to the bedroom and sat him down on the bed while he sat in the only chair in the room.</p><p>Zack sat there brooding, staring at him until Gabe finally spoke.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? What are you doing here, Zack? Just leave me alone.You said you didn\u2019t want anything else to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s voice suddenly choked with tears. \u201cYou told me to go.\u201d</p><p>Zack sighed.\u201cNo, honey, it\u2019s not what I said at all.I said I wouldn\u2019t stop you, and I released you from your vows if you were really so unhappy. I love you. I\u2019ve told you again and again. You\u2019re my mate, and I\u2019ll never want anyone else. Obviously it\u2019s not anything you really wanted. You\u2019ve never said you love me, and I could have even lived with that, but you constantly fight me on every little thing.I\u2019ve tried to compromise. I\u2019ve really tried while you disrespect me all the time in front of my pack. Packs have hierarchy, Gabe, which you well know.I\u2019m the alpha, and I have to have the respect of my people.They\u2019ll soon lose respect for me if your contempt and disrespectful attitude continues.If you\u2019re really miserable, I can\u2019t, in good conscience, force you to stay.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe sat looking at him, but made no more comments. Zack had called his bluff, and he could see Gabe hadn\u2019t really wantedto leave, but didn\u2019t know how to get out of the situation he\u2019d created. Afraid his sheer stubbornness would overrule his heart, Zack helped him out.</p><p>\u201cOf course, if you changed your mind and wantedto stay, I\u2019d be very happy. Really happy. You only have to tell me.You\u2019d have to decide being with me is something you want, and it will be forever, Gabe. Make no mistake about it. If you come back home, you\u2019ll have to agree to some things. If you stay, you\u2019ll take orders from me in the important issues. I\u2019ll try not to be too bossy, and I\u2019ll always respect your opinion, but I\u2019m the alpha, as well as your mate. As your alpha, I\u2019m owed your obedience and allegiance.\u201d</p><p>Gabe was silent for a long moment, obviously thinking it over. Zack was careful to keep his face neutral.</p><p>\u201cSo if I decided to stay\u2014and that\u2019s a big if\u2014you\u2019d still want me as your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll always want you as my mate. I love you, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would take your ring off. I would nevertake mine off.\u201d Gabe turned his head away, biting his lip, completely disregarding the fact he had taken his own off and thrown it across the room. Zack could see tears standing in his eyes. Since hedidn\u2019t trust himself to say anything in response, he simply held up his hand and showed him the rings.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still wearing it. I have yours right here too.\u201d Zack could see Gabe really wanted the ring back on his finger.</p><p>Gabe sighed heavily.\u201cIf I decided I wanted to stay with you, what would happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappen? Well, you\u2019d need to apologize to me, accept your discipline for disrespecting me so badly and promise to try harder to be a good pack member and obey my direct commands. In return, I\u2019d promise to protect you and provide for you always.I\u2019ll never put this offer on the table again.It\u2019s a one-time good deal. This marriage is not going to be a revolving door. If you don\u2019t want me, if you want to leave, this is your chance. Your one and only chance. If you come back home, and don\u2019t change, the offer is no good any more.Next time I\u2019ll lock you down and spank you every day until you straighten up.\u201d</p><p>Gabe flushed and angled a strange look at Zack.\u201cWhat about you apologizing to me? You treated me like a not too bright child. I ought to be able to decide for myself if I want to wear a damn cervical collar.\u201d</p><p>Zackdropped his gaze, considering his mate\u2019s words. He nodded and glanced back up at him.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I admit I was being overprotective.I\u2019m sorry, and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the threats to spank me? I don\u2019t respond to threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a threat, Gabe. It was a promise. If you agree to be my mate, then you are agreeing to accept my discipline. Think it over. This is your decision. If I feel it\u2019s in the best interests of both of us, I will discipline you\u2014it\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>Zack noticed Gabe\u2019s cock had hardened as he spoke. Did he like the idea of being dominated? Or was it just the spanking? Zack filed that idea away for later and focused all of his attention on his mate.</p> <p>Gabe sat sulkily on the bed, his eyes cast down.\u201cOkay then. I accept the conditions, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Zack felt a tidal wave of relief rush through him. Still he had to keep his face stern.</p><p>\u201cYou are? Sorry for what?\u201d Zack prompted.</p><p>Gabe blew out a long breath and looked away from Zack.\u201cSorry for disrespecting you and not being a good pack member and saying I hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><p>Gabe pressed his lips tightly together and then whispered.\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zack hesitated for a long moment before he asked the next question.\u201cDo you love me?\u2019</p><p>Gabe bit his bottom lip and dropped his gaze.Zack\u2019s heart fell. He had resigned himself to giving Gabe more time to come to love him, but was still disappointed. Maybe Gabe would come to love him in time. Then his ears pricked up as Gabe whispered a word very softly. A single word that made Zack\u2019s heart almost jump out of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? Yyou love me?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI said yes, okay?\u201d</p><p>Zack took a deep breath, reminding himself to calm down, to not rush him.\u201cAnd do you remember what your promise is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to try harder and obeyyour commands.\u201d Gabe practically spit out the words, but he said them, and for Gabe it was a major accomplishment.\u201cAnd my discipline? What might that be exactly?\u201d He shifted on the bed and tried to hide his erection with his arms.\u201cSpanking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had the feeling Gabe would enjoy that too much. \u201cTake a chair and go sit in the corner for an hour. One hour, with no music, no TV, and no books. Face tothe wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding! That\u2019s just humiliating and stupid. You\u2019re putting me in a corner? I\u2019d hate it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea. Decide. What\u2019s it to be? Do I put your ring back on, and we make this work, or do I leave hereand walk away forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you see it that way.I\u2019ve already said I won\u2019t just leave you high and dry. I\u2019ll make sure you have an apartment, a car, and money to get started again. If you decide to stay, it\u2019ll be because you want to\u2014because you want to be my mate and a pack member. If you want the same things I do, then take your naked little ass over to the chair, sit it in the corner, and face the wall. No talking. Not one word.One hour.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat on the edge of the bed fuming for a long time, shooting Zack looks which would peel paint from the walls. Zack had begun to despair and worriedhe\u2019d gone too far. Gabe was still pretty drunk after all, but Zack wanted to try to give him time to sober up. The hour in the chair would do that. He wanted Gabe to know exactly what he was doing.</p><p>A lifetime passed for Zack before Gabe stood and stalked over to the chair, dragged it across the floor, and turned it to the wall. Dramatically, he threw himself down in it and faced the wall, his chest heaving up and down.</p><p>Zack almost was sorry for him, but Gabe had a huge erection when he threw himself onto the chair. Well, his boy liked a little discipline. Zack smiled, watching the clock next to him. He lay back on the bed, knowing full well Gabe was sneaking peeks at him from the corners of his eyes. He called out the time in increments of fifteen minutes and was treated each time to some very unrepentant huffs and puffs.</p><p>When the hour was up, Zack sat up on the side of the bed and spoke to Gabe very softly. \u201cYour time is almost up, Gabe. When I call time, you will pick the chair up and place it back by the table.Then you\u2019ll put on a shirt and pants\u2014ones that fit you properly\u2014and go back up the mountain with me. From this time on, if you have a problem with me, you will speak to me about it in private. In public you will treat me with the respect due to my rank. As soon as we get there, you will change into leathers\u2014not the tight ones either\u2014and wear them until I tell you differently. In addition, for the next week, you will start your mornings by sitting in a chair facing the corner in our bedroom for one hour.\u201d</p><p>Gabe jumped to his feet and stood with his fists clenched.\u201cThat was not part of the deal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it became a part of the deal when you made all the inappropriate noises. Sit your ass back down until I call time.\u201d</p><p>Gabe threw himself down again and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYour hour is up.\u201d</p><p>He jumped back to his feet and dragged the chair across the floor, rather than picking it up, glancing over at Zack to see if he reacted. When Zack made no comment, he went over to his bag and pulled out a pair of jeans and a black T-shirt. He stuffed his wet jeans right on top of the others in the bag and zipped it shut. Gabe was going commando just to irritate him, Zack was certain, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Slipping his feet into his combat boots, but not lacing them, Gabe turned and grabbed his bag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Zack walked over to him and took him into his arms. He resisted at first, struggling and turning his head, but in the end, he allowed Zack to kiss him for a very long time. When his knees started to sag, Zack put one arm around him.\u201cHold out your hand, baby.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, Gabe held it out, and Zack put his ring back on his finger. Somewhat mollified, Gabe leaned against Zack for a moment before Zack escorted him out to his car. Behind his back, Zack breathed a huge sigh of relief. Life with Gabe was certainly interesting.Since he\u2019d won this particular little skirmish, when they got back to the lodge, he was going to push the envelope a little. He thought about the collars at home in his dresser.After all, he\u2019d told Gabe once he\u2019d made his decision, he couldn\u2019t go back. In for a penny, in for a pound, he thought ruefully. It would seem Gabe still had a few more lessons to learn, and Zack knew just what he had to do to make sure Gabe learned them. He was going to have to make a quick trip down the mountain in the morning.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Gabe went downstairs the next morning in a fury, barely acknowledging all the greetings from the rest of the pack.He didn\u2019t know exactly how he felt, really. Part anger at being bossed around by Zack, part relief he wasn\u2019t being sent away from Zack. He also had an erection refusing to go away and making it difficult to walk. The day started with Zack rousing him out of bed before the sun was fully up. He\u2019d just spent an hour in a chair facing the wall, while Zack watched him. It was infuriating. It was maddening. Shit, it was sexy as hell. The idea of Zack making him sit there naked and watching him do it was a turn on. Probably why his dick was still so hardeven after the extra hours of sleep he\u2019d put in after Zack left.</p><p>Damn, did he like being bossed around and controlled by his mate? A little part of him did, and he had to admit it. He appreciated the fact Zack had given him a choice of whether to stay or not. Of course he wanted to stay.He\u2019d only been bluffing when he threatened to leave, and it made him furious and damn near ripped his heart out when Zack had called his bluff.</p><p>O nce he\u2019d agreed, Zack\u2019s dominant nature came out to make him toe the mark. He liked that too, though he\u2019d never admit it to Zack. There was a real need inside him to surrender his will to someone who would care for him and protect him, but not let him get away with some of the outrageous things he was compelled to do sometimes. Maybe it was because of the traumatic experience of the attack on him. His mother was killed right in front of him and he wasn\u2019t able to do anything to stopit. He wasn\u2019t sure, but whatever caused it, he had a self-destruct button inside him, and he needed someone strong enough to prevent him from pushing it. Still, it was his nature to tease and be as defiant as he could get away with. It also kept Zack\u2019s attention firmly on him, which was the real point. He craved Zack\u2019s attention and seriously couldn\u2019t do without acting up, to make Zack notice him.</p><p>He got some toast at the buffet table and a glass of milk and sat down to eat a late breakfast. Aware ofZack\u2019s presence, he glanced up to see him walking toward him with determination. Excitement rippled through him, but he kept his eyes down and pretended to ignore him. Zack veered off to go to the buffet table. In a few minutes a plate plopped down in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cNot just toast. I\u2019ve told you repeatedly. Eat these eggs too. Toast won\u2019t last halfway through the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Gabe snapped back. \u201cAnything you say, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being a smartass or you\u2019ll go back upstairs to our room and I\u2019ll put you over my knee.\u201d Zack sat next to him and began to calmly eat his breakfast. Gabe glanced down at his hand and a flood of relief swept over him as he saw his ring on his finger. Still he was angry he\u2019d taken it off in the first place.</p><p>Gabe finished his meal in silence and started to get up when Zack reached for his hand.\u201cNot yet.We need to talk about some things, and I\u2019ll be busy the rest of the day. My beta, Jamie, and I are going up to the mine to check on operations.I won\u2019t be back until late afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mine? What mine? What exactly do you do up here anyway?You\u2019ve never really told me.\u201d</p><p>Zack glanced over at him.\u201cYou never asked. We own mines all over north Georgia. The most productive one is the one we\u2019re going to today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of mines are they?\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled.\u201cGold mines, mostly. A few sapphire mines and some ruby mines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold mines?\u201d Gabe said quietly.\u201cYou actually own gold mines?\u201d He started laughing, hard enough he fell up against Zack.</p><p>Zack smiled and nodded his head. \u201cYep. Gold mines. It\u2019s why I bought gold rings and you a gold collar.Sort of symbolic, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about some things, like I said. If you\u2019re finished, let\u2019s go up to my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour office? This must be really official.You\u2019ve never asked me to your office before.\u201d</p><p>Standing up and drawing out Gabe\u2019s chair, Zack looked confused. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be asked to come to my office. You can go anywhere you want.You\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.I\u2019ll remind you of it someday when I crash one of your meetings with all your big, scary wolves.\u201d</p><p>Zack leaned over and whispered in his ear.\u201cYou never have to be scared of anyone, baby. Anyone who messes with you messes with me. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>A little thrill went through Gabe at the words, but he tried to look unimpressed. He allowed Zack to take his hand, but he was still angry with him.He just hadn\u2019t decided how he\u2019d show it yet. Agreeingto stay didn\u2019t mean he was going to be a door mat. Oh, hell no.</p><p>He followed Zack to his office and sat down across from him, feeling a little nervous. This all seemed so official, somehow. Zack didn\u2019t sit behind his desk. Rather he perched on the desk in front of Gabe and looked down at him.</p><p>\u201cI have something I want to talk to you about, but I don\u2019t want you to freak out. I\u2019m handling the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the brakes on your truck were deliberately tampered with. In fact, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeliberately tampered with? Who would do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could tell me. Are there some enemies you haven\u2019t told me about? No matter what it is, you can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have no idea. No one I know has any clue where I am, and if theydid, they\u2019d have no reason to harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone did try. It could have been a random act, but until we know more, I want you to have a guard on you at all times. After I leave this morning, Scott will have one of his best men sent up to guard your door and go with you everywhere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can, but I\u2019d feel better if you had a guard.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugged.\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Zack looked relieved. Gabe wondered if Zack really thoughthe\u2019d fight him on this?</p><p>\u201cOne morething.\u201d He pulled a black leather collar from his pocket.\u201cI know I told you I could wait till you\u2019re sure. As far as I\u2019m concerned you made your decision yesterday, and you belong to me.You\u2019ll wear this one until you earn the gold one. Put it on.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked up at him in fury.Actually, he\u2019d already decided to wear the gold collar after coming so close to losing Zack in the crash. He knew he loved him to distraction, but with recent events, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell him. He hated Zack ordering him to wear this ugly leather one. Until he earned the gold one? Bullshit!</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, shooting a defiant look at Zack. \u201cIf I wear one, it\u2019ll be the gold one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we established the fact that you don\u2019t make the rules, baby.\u201d He tossed the black collar onto his lap. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d Gabe tossed the collar back at Zack.</p><p>Zack stood up with a stern expression on his face, giving Gabe warning. He was in big trouble. Still, Gabe folded his arms and stuck out his lips in a pout.</p><p>In one swift move, Zack picked him up in his arms and carried him to the adjoining bedroom. He literally kicked the door open and threw Gabe onto the bed. Not giving him a chance to recover, Zack bent over him and ripped his shirt over his head and tugged down his pants, while ignoring the blows being rained on his head and shoulders by his furious mate. He straightened and began to take off his own clothes, stopping only one time when Gabe scooted toward the edge of the bed.</p><p>Zack pointed a finger at him and growled.\u201cDon\u2019t you move!\u201d</p><p>Gabe sank back down and considered his options.There didn\u2019t seem to be many. He knew he was about to get fucked into the mattress, and the idea excited him. Hecouldn\u2019t wait to see what other interesting things Zack might have in mind for him.</p><p>\u201cLie down on your back\u2014knees up.\u201d</p><p>Gabe lay down and pulled them up, expecting the lube to come next. Instead, Zack went to the closet and pulled something down from the top shelf. He came over to the bed with something in his hand, a rigid steel bar, with a long chain hanging from the middle and double cuffs on either end. A sex toy!Gabe\u2019s excitement grew exponentially as his cock hardened. He couldn\u2019t hide his cock, but he could hide the big grin he felt coming on.</p><p>\u201cWhat-what areyou going to do?\u201d Even to him, his voice sounded quivery and scared.</p><p>\u201cSit up and don\u2019t you dare fight me. I\u2019ve had enough out of you. Take hold of your ankles.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat up, giving token resistance, pulling back slightly with each hand and foot while Zack opened the twocuffs on one end and put Gabe\u2019s left ankle in one and his left wrist in the other. He pulled back a little harder, anxiety building when his other wrist and ankle got the same treatment. He was going to get fucked, he knew, but Zack had never pulled out any sex toy before, making Gabe even more interested in what else was going to happen. His legs were held wide apart so no amount of struggling would close them. With his hands cuffed helplessly beside his ankles, he was basically hog tied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did you get a spreader bar?\u201d Even more, he wanted to know, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>On his knees on the bed, Zack took the chain in his hands and moved toward the headboard, forcing Gabe to his back, pulling his legs and arms off the bed. The farther he pushed the chain, the more Gabe struggled, uselessly. Zack didn\u2019t quit until a link in the chain slipped over a hook Gabe had never seen before, at the top of the tall headboard,leaving Gabe\u2019s ass up in the air. He could roll a little from side to side, but that was about it.. Zack took pillows and wedged them under him and at his sides to prevent him from even rolling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to remind you who\u2019s the alpha.\u201d Zack answered the second question. He drew back his hand and gaveGabe\u2019s butt cheeks a hard spank.</p><p>\u201cOw! No, stop!\u201d Gabe yelled, wiggling his ass. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you when I get out of this!\u201d</p><p>Zack got off the bed and returned to the closet, drawing out a short flogger, made of soft suede. Zack returned and dragged the strands slowly across the backs ofGabe\u2019s thighs and the cleft between his spread legs, dangling the soft ends in feather light touches on his throbbing cock.\u201cWant to apologize, baby? Tell me how very much you want to wear my collar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really going to beat me with that, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s designed to give more heat than pain. I\u2019m going to heat up that bottom of yours until you beg me to put the collar on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d Gabe spat back at him.</p><p>Zack smiled down at him.\u201cStill not too late to stop it, baby. Say the three little words I want to hear\u2014please collar me\u2014and it all stops.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Gabe spat at him and wiggled violently, trying to get out, knowing damned good and well he couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t too sure he hadn\u2019t broken off more than he could chew.</p><p>Zack watched him until his head fell back on the pillow, defeated, before he raised the flogger and gave him two licks on each butt cheek. Gabe was furious, but he had to admit, the flogger didn\u2019t really hurt. Like Zack said, it warmed his bottom for him pretty good, but there was no real pain. The pain came from the humiliation and thought of giving in to a battle of wills, and Zack had to know it.</p><p>\u201cYou never gave me a safe word! You\u2019re supposed to give me a safe word, and if I say it, everything stops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...you do seem to know a lot about this. That\u2019s a conversation we need to have later on. No, baby, you don\u2019t need a safe word. I\u2019m not going to really hurt you, and you know it. And you already know the three little words that will make it all stop.\u201d</p><p>Gabe made a loud, frustrated noise.\u201cI hate you! And I hate this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle liar. Bad boys lie, baby. You love every minute of this, and you know it. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to give in like a good little boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooohh! When I get out of this, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby. Time foranother reminder.\u201d The flogger came down again and again, and his ass was beginning to get uncomfortable. Gabe threw back his head and was horrified to feel tears streaming down his face, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He could hear the whimpers coming from his throat. His back, ankles and wrists were beginning to ache. He was also so fucking hot he thought he might come all over himself.</p><p>Zack stopped and leaned forward to put his face right over Gabe\u2019s. \u201cGot anything you want to say, honey?\u201d</p><p>Gabe bit his lips and turned his head. Zack sighed and laid into him again, until it was actually getting pretty painful. Gabe knew his ass would be sore for a week. Zack stopped after a few more strokes and by then, Gabe was breathing in short hitches.</p><p>\u201cBaby? Sure you don\u2019twant to ask Daddy something?\u201d</p><p>Gritting his teeth, his throat catching on a sob, Gabe forced out the words.\u201cWould you...would you please ccollar me?\u201d</p><p>Zack unhooked the chain, bringing Gabe\u2019s ass down on the bed. He opened the cuffs on first one side and then the other, freeing his wrists and allowing him to ease the strain on his back. Releasing his ankles and removing the spreader bar, he said,\u201cSit up, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Gingerly, his ass burning, Gabe sat up. Zack put the black leather collar around his neck and fastened it on.\u201cYou only take this off to bathe and then right back on. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded, too angry and frustrated to speak, and so horny he was about to explode. The collar was heavy and warm on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhen you learn to be a good boy, you can have the gold one. Say thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Gabe mumbled.</p><p>Zack smiled down at him.\u201cDon\u2019t you look pretty wearing my collar and nothing else? I think from now on in our morning sessions, you\u2019ll be wearing only your collar. Then afterward, I\u2019ll let you suck my dick.\u201d</p><p>Gabe glanced up at him, barely controlling himself. \u201cCan I get up, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I\u2019ve never been thishard in my life.\u201d He grabbed him around the hips, picked him up and flipped him over. Zack pushed the pillows up under his stomach, bent down, and kissed his reddened ass.\u201cYour little ass looks perfect this way, baby.\u201d He rubbed his hands over the tender flesh.\u201cSo beautifully spanked.\u201d</p><p>He kissed each of his butt cheeks and trailed the kisses over to his rim. He lavished attention on it with his tongue until Gabe squirmed and panted.Gabe\u2019s cock was rock hard too. Zack took hold of it gently, sliding his hand in an up and down motion, moving his mouth to the backside of Gabe\u2019s balls, which he thoroughly licked and teased with his tongue.</p><p>He lay over Gabe\u2019s back and put his tongue in his ear before whispering to him. \u201cDo you want this, baby?\u201d</p><p>Gabe hesitated for only a few seconds before he spoke, his voice ragged with need.\u201cYes, I want it, dammit.\u201d</p><p>Zack couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face.\u201cThen ask me to fuck you, baby.Don\u2019t forget to call me sir.\u201d</p><p>Gabe groaned.\u201cSir, will you please fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Gabe had wanted to say no. He really had. Every brain cell he had was screaming at him to tell Zack to go fuck himself. But all those other pesky tingles tormenting his cock and his balls\u2014 even his damn toes curled at the idea\u2014came from the fact that Zack made him beg to wear the damn collar. They were cheering him on. What a fucking turn-on.</p><p>Zackleft Gabe\u2019s balls and rim and headed up toward his mouth, making him turn his head so he could nip at Gabe\u2019s bottom lip. His tongue traced the crease in his mouth until it fell open. He thrust his tongue\u2014his goddamned, magical, wicked tongue\u2014inside his mouth and swept over the inside until he was needy and sweating.</p><p>Zack turned his attention back to his ass, and Gabe\u2019s ass rose in the air of its own accord and thrust itself back at him. Zack kissed around the rim again before he put a well slicked finger up his ass and crooked his finger, searching for the spot he knew would drive Gabe crazy with need. He found it and had Gabe writhing under him in seconds, grinding out his name through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, baby? Do you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Zack! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what, honey?Do this?\u201d He swept his finger over the spot again, and Gabe\u2019s hips bucked uncontrollably.He was about to go, and he couldn\u2019t stop it. Zack\u2019s hand slid around to his cock and squeezed the base with his forefinger and thumb until Gabe could breathe again. \u201cNo, not yet. Settle down, baby.\u201d</p><p>Gabe thought if he didn\u2019t stick his cock in him quickly, he was going to die from spontaneous combustion. How in the hell would that look to the coroner?\u201cZack,\u201d he groaned. \u201cPlease do something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, darlin\u2019. All in good time.\u201d He bent over and licked his ass from his balls to the top of his crease. Gabe screamed, and Zack tightened his grip on his cock.\u201cNo more backtalk, okay? No more tight pants wiggling around in front of the other wolves either. No more drinking or dancing on tables.This is my little ass, and I won\u2019t have you flaunting it around.\u201d</p><p>He rolled Gabe over to his side and put his mouth over the tip of his cock and sucked it hard. \u201cSay,\u2018Yes, Zack.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet baby Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, \u2018Yes, Zack,\u2019 or I\u2019ll suck your brains out through your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit! Yes, Zack!\u201d</p><p>Zack rolled him back over and spread more lube inside his ass, raking his sinful fingers over his prostate again. When Gabethought he\u2019d pass out from wanting him, Zack thrust his big cock up Gabe\u2019s ass and pounded him hard. After only three of his thrusts, Gabe spurted all over the mattress, spurted until he was bone dry, but he couldn\u2019t stop shuddering. Zack pounded a few more times and then stiffened as his orgasm overtook him, grinding into Gabe and burying himself deep inside.</p><p>He collapsed on top of him, way too heavy, pushingGabe\u2019s face down into the mattress, but it didn\u2019t matter at the moment. Gabe could die happy,secure in the knowledge he\u2019d been well and truly fucked to within an inch of his life. Zack rolled off him and pulled his body up close, throwinghis leg over Gabe\u2019s thighs and began snoring in seconds.</p><p>Gabe lay on his stomach for about a minute, sweaty and sticky with his own cum under him and Zack\u2019s cum leaking out his ass. He panted hard to catch his breath, but he felt pretty damn good. He turned over, got up stiffly and went into the bathroom to clean himself up and even brought a warm cloth out and took care of Zack.</p><p>Zack opened one eye as he worked on him and mumbled something which Gabe took for a thanks. He crawled back in bed and cuddled up close to Zack, who opened his arms and pulled him in tightly, settling his dick in the crease ofGabe\u2019s ass.</p><p>Gabe touched the collar around his throat.He\u2019d already decided to wear the gold one, and it didn\u2019t really matter about the leather one. Still he hadn\u2019t like the earn it remark, and he\u2019d make Zack pay for it a bit. He\u2019d wanted to play with Zack a little though he\u2019d almost got more than he\u2019d bargained for with the spreader bar, cuffs, and a flogger. Of course he still really wanted the gold collar, because he liked jewelry, damn it, and Zack knew that very well. No matter\u2014he\u2019d get it soon. He\u2019d make sure of it. In the meantime, the weight of the leather collar made him feel safe and protected. He snuggled his ass further back against Zack and heard him whimper a little in his sleep. The collar was definitely a mark of ownership. The question was who owned whom? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zack finished his business at the mine early, and he and Jamie started back to the lodge. All afternoon, his mind had been on Gabe, and what had happened that morning.He really didn\u2019t know what to expect when he got home. They\u2019d had their first really serious fight, and he\u2019d pushed Gabe\u2019s limits to the max. He had worked his little man over pretty good and punished him most of the morning, starting with the time-out in the corner and ending with restraining and then flogging him\u2014not to mention the mind-blowing sex.He\u2019d left him asleep on their bed around noon, wearing nothing but his new collar, and he had no idea what to expect when he got home.</p><p>He really didn\u2019t want to punish him anymore. He loved him so much, and he wanted to just take care of him and make his life easier.Gabe\u2019d had such a hard time since the attack and his mother\u2019s passing. But before he could do any of what he wanted to do, Gabe had to assimilate into the pack. He had to follow the orders of his alpha.</p><p>Every member of the wolf pack had a place in the hierarchy, and Gabe was no different. He was the mate of the alpha, and as such he had certain obligations, not just to Zack, but to the entire pack. He needed to show a good example for the other pets. He should actually be a leader and a spokesperson for the pets,much like Zack\u2019s mother had been. Zack\u2019s mother had sat in on the council meetings and spoke up for any inequality she noticed. One of the most important aspects of being mate to the alpha was to cooperate and obey his wolf mate, so long as the wolf was reasonable and acting in his pet\u2019s best interest. Even the alpha\u2019s pet didn\u2019t get any free passes, or it would cause jealousy and dissention in the entire pack.</p> <p>As soon as he got home he went in search of Gabe. He found him in the bedroom, working on Zack\u2019s laptop, wearing his collar and snug, but not overly tight, leathers. He looked up and smiled tentatively at Zack as he walked in, and Zack grinned widely back at him, relieved and happy to seehe didn\u2019t seem to be holding a grudge.</p><p>\u201cHello, baby. Are you feeling okay?\u201d Gabe laughed. \u201cDo you mean is my ass sore? A little, but in a good way.\u201d He reached up selfconsciously and touched his collar, but didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>Zack came over closer to him.\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you on Facebook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I stopped posting on Facebook after I left home like I did. I think most people think I\u2019m dead or something, but it\u2019s okay. I guess I don\u2019t have much in common with them anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at classes online. I\u2019d like to take a few if you don\u2019t mind spotting me some cash.I can pay you back when I graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay me back, honey. You can take classes if you want to. Just let me know, and I can let you use my credit card to sign up.What kind of classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgriculture. It was my major\u2014you know, before.I don\u2019t have many more credits to get my degree. I don\u2019t know exactly what I could do with it. I\u2019d always planned to run our farm at home.\u201d</p><p>His voice took on the lost quality Zack hated to hear. He crossed over to him and sat down beside him, touching his leg.\u201cYou can do anything you want to do. You decide, and I\u2019ll support you.Maybe you could farm on some of our land here. Whatever you decide, I\u2019ll be there behind you if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe closed the laptop and looked up at him.\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight anymore, Zack. I feel like I\u2019ve been fighting everything and everyone for the past year, and I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>Zack touched his jaw and rubbedhis fingers along it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight either, darlin\u2019. I just want to love you.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe hesitated for only a few seconds before he threw his arms around Zack\u2019s neck and held on tightly.\u201cI was scared when you sent me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I didn\u2019t send you away. I gaveyou a choice. I didn\u2019t want you to think you had no alternative and wind up resenting me for it. You had no need to be scared, either. I would have always watched out for you, no matter what your choice was. You\u2019re my mate, baby. I can\u2019t not protect you and worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came for me, though. I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>Gabe gave him a wicked little smile.\u201cUh-huh. I wondered how long it would take Scott to call you.He didn\u2019t for the longest time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew Scott was watching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. It\u2019s pretty hard to hide a wolf. You\u2019re all pretty damned big. I figured when I got up to dance on the bar he\u2019d call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you little...\u201d Zack pulled him up in his arms, and Gabe wrapped his legs around Zack\u2019s waist, his arms around his neck, cuddling his face into his neck. With both hands on Gabe\u2019s ass, Zackmassaged the cheeks slowly and sensuously. \u201cI really should punish you again for your little stunt and for drinking so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm...with the flogger? Yes, please.I really have been bad.\u201d</p><p>Zack put back his head and laughed. \u201cYes, you certainly have. What am I going to do with you?\u201d He dropped him down a bit, rubbing their cocks together and nibbled at his neck.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me again?\u201d</p><p>Zack smiled and kissed his nose. \u201cTry and stop me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stretched luxuriously and reached over for Zack, but he was already gone. Pouting a little, he rolled over in bed and smiled over the delicious sting on his butt. Their lovemaking the night before had been hot and wild. Gabe had talked Zack into using some of the other sex toys Zack told him he\u2019d made a special trip to town to buy. Gabe was determined to try each and every one of them out.He\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. He wondered idly what else he could do to get Zack mad enough to give him a little more of his undivided attention.</p><p>He heard a knock at the door and got up to answer, pulling on his pants and smoothing down his hair.</p><p>Scott looked frantic.\u201cGabe, you\u2019d better come quickly. Zack just collapsed downstairs. We carried him to our infirmary, but the doctor hasn\u2019t been able to bring him around yet.\u201d</p><p>The last words were yelled at Gabe\u2019s back as he raced downstairs, his heart racing even faster. Scott caught up with him easily and passed him on the stairs, which was a good thing, since Gabe had no idea where he was going. He followed Scott down into the basement and into a small room set up like a hospital. He stopped in the doorway and stared, clutching himself around the waist. Zack was still and white on his back on the bed, some men standing around him, all looking concerned and upset.</p><p>Gabe hesitated only a second in the doorway before he raced across the room and flung himself on top of Zack\u2019s body, wrapping his arms around his waist.</p><p>The doctor standing next to him cried out.\u201cNo, no, young man, you must get off him! I\u2019m still examining him and running tests. We\u2019ll know more soon, but please control yourself.\u201d</p><p>Scott motioned him gently down to a chair beside Zack\u2019s bed and stood close by to keep him in place. He leaned over to whisper in his ear.\u201cSettle down, Gabe. The doctor knows his stuff, even if he is a tightass.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat stunned, listening with half an ear to the talk swirling around him.He couldn\u2019t lose Zack\u2014he wouldn\u2019t. The very idea was unthinkable. He stood up and turned to the doctor, his voice steady and firm.\u201cWhat happened to him?Tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looked at him with irritation and spoke instead to Scott.\u201cWill you please keep this pet out of my way?I\u2019m trying to work here.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stepped forward,grabbed a handful of the doctor\u2019s shirtfront, and pushed his face up into his. His voice came out low and menacing.\u201cListen up, asshole. This is my mate on this bed. You talk to me,or I\u2019ll rip out your throat.\u201d</p><p>The doctor sputtered a few times and looked to the men standing around the bed for help. None of them made a move to stop Gabe. One or two even looked a little impressed at his aggression.</p><p>Seeing no help was forthcoming, the doctor put up both hands in a placating gesture.\u201cAll right, all right!Please release me and I\u2019ll tell you what I know.\u201d</p><p>Gabe let go of him begrudgingly, but stayed close, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cUh...well, these men here told me the alpha collapsed at the breakfast table. He clutched his stomach and just fell over. From my examination,even though it seems impossible, I\u2019d say he\u2019s been poisoned.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like he\u2019d been hit in the gut with a fist, Gabe turned to the men standing beside the bed.\u201cWho was with him?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Jamie, the beta, spoke up.\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Scott nodded.\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was fine when he left our room this morning. What was he eating?\u201d Gabe addressed his question to Scott, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNothing the rest of us didn\u2019t have. He ate some eggs and toast. A little fruit, I think. We were all having the same thing. He said he had a little headache from staying up too late last night. He took some headache powders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadache powders?\u201d Gabe sounded puzzled.\u201cYou mean the powdery stuff in those little packets?Where\u2019s the package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry his pocket. I think I saw him get them out of there.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rifled through his pockets and came out with a small packet of old fashioned headache powders.\u201cThese?\u201d he asked. Scott nodded.\u201cDo you know if the box was already open? Think, Scott!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I don\u2019t know. He had it in his pocket. I think he keeps a box in his office. He just opened one up and threw it back like he does.\u201d</p><p>Gabe turned to the beta.\u201cDid he vomit anything before he collapsed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just as he started to get up. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and...\u201d The beta yelled to one of the guards.\u201cGo upstairs and find me some samples. Don\u2019t let anybody clean it up. We need to get the samplesto a lab.\u201d He turned back to Gabe.\u201cYou think he reallywas poisoned?\u201d</p><p>Gabe shook his head miserably.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but like I said, he was fine when he left our room.It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doctor shook his head.\u201cSo far nothing to indicate any kind of illness or attack. He\u2019s very weak, though. He must be given blood immediately if he is to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give him some, damn it!What the hell are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZack\u2019s an alpha, Gabe.\u201d Scott told him. \u201cOnly another alpha\u2019s blood will work. Jamie\u2019s his beta, and he gave him some already, but it wasn\u2019t enough, and there\u2019s only one other alpha in our pack\u2014Tim\u2014but he\u2019s not here. He left early this morning for the mine,and we haven\u2019t been able to reach him on his cell phone.Jamie\u2019s blood is the strongest we have to give him, and it\u2019s probably the only thing keepinghim going this long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet some more damn alpha blood then! Howcan we?\u201d</p><p>Jamie spoke up.\u201cThe nearest alpha is in North Carolina, another alpha of the Dark Hollow Pack, named Marco.I\u2019ve called him already, and both he and his battle commander, another alpha, agreed to come and are on their way. Trouble is, it will take at least a couple hours for them to get here on the mountain roads.I don\u2019t know if I can keep him going long enough.\u201d</p><p>A tiny sob burst from Gabe\u2019s throat, but he quickly stifled it and turned to Scott. \u201cLoad him into a car, Scott, and call the alpha back.Tell him we\u2019re on our way from here,and we\u2019ll meet him halfway. It should cut our time in half.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and Scott looked startled over not thinking of the idea themselves. Scott ran from the room to make preparations while Jamie pulled out his cell phone.</p><p>Racing along the mountain roads, Zack\u2019s head in his lap, Gabe never was more frightened in his life. Not of the breakneck speed with which Scott was taking the curves, but of the possibility of losing the loveof his life, the one person he simply couldn\u2019t live without.</p> <p>When he left the compound a few days before, he\u2019d cried going down the mountain at some of the hurtful things Zack had said to him, however true they might have been.He\u2019d been a little scared too, that too much had been said, and he\u2019d pushed Zack too far.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d known deep down Zack would come for him. They both knew it was an elaborate game they played and though feelings may get hurt and tempers might flare, in the end they would work it out. There simply was no other option.</p><p>This was different, and Gabe was too wounded for simple tears. His grief at Zack\u2019s possible loss was stark and desolate. He gazed down into Zack\u2019s face, watching his breathing, listening to Jamie on the phone while Scott drove like a madman on the mountain roads, lights flashing and horn blaring.</p><p>Jamie hung up and turned to Gabe. \u201cThat was the doctor. He says cyanide traces are in the packet, crushed up into a fine powder like those headache powders.If it hadn\u2019t been for his strong wolf metabolism it would have killed him immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Scott banged his hand on the steering wheel.\u201cWe were within the compound\u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be safe!\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked over at Gabe.\u201cWe\u2019re questioning everyone, and nobody knows anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomebody does,\u201d Gabe said tersely. \u201cAnd when we find them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with Marco and Casey\u2019s driver. Marco and Casey are the alphas from North Carolina.We think we\u2019re about fifteen minutes away from each other. I\u2019m going to give him some more of my blood.It\u2019s not helping much, but if it can just keep him going there\u2019s a chance.\u201d</p><p>Jamie got on his knees, leaned over the front seat, bit into his wrist, and placed it next to Zack\u2019s mouth. Gabe applied pressure on the hinges ofZack\u2019s jaw to get him to open up enough to let the blood in, and then massaged his throat over and over to get him to swallow. A slow process, but it helped Gabe to be able to do something\u2014anything\u2014other than just sit and wait helplessly.</p><p>Jamie smiled at him encouragingly.\u201cWhen Zack wakes up, he\u2019s going to be so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since they got in the car, Gabe\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cOh,Jamie,\u201d he whispered.\u201cDo you really think he might wake up?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.\u201cI really do, Gabe. He\u2019s one of the strongest people I ever met, and he\u2019s got an awful lot to live for.\u201d Defying pack law, he reached over with his left hand and squeezed Gabe\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t give up. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Scott called out excitedly. \u201cI see them ahead! I\u2019m pulling over. Brace yourself,Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, still bent over the front seat, grabbed hold of the seat with one hand and held on tight as Scott swerved onto the shoulder of the road. He jumped out and opened the back door. Things started happening quickly.</p> <p>The door beside Gabe opened too, and a tall, very good looking man stood there looking down at him with compassion.\u201cI\u2019m Marco. If you\u2019ll move, I can get in to help him.\u201d</p><p>His voice was kind, but Gabe couldn\u2019t bring himself to move. He had a sudden, unreasonable fear if he moved, he\u2019d never see Zack alive again. Marco was shoved out of the way and a beautiful face looked in. The young man was blond with startlingly blue eyes, and he smiled sympathetically at Gabe, his voice low and soothing.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Gabe, let me help you get out.\u201d He took hold of his arm and tugged gently.\u201cMarco is here to help Zack,and he won\u2019t let him die. Will you, Marco?\u201d</p><p>The big man shifted his feet nervously.\u201cI certainly...\u201d A sharp elbow to his ribs made him straighten up rapidly and then bend back down to look at Gabe.\u201cNo, Gabe, I won\u2019t let anything happen to him. Okay?Just let me get in there to him.\u201d</p><p>Gabe allowed them to help him from the car and almost collapsed when he tried to stand, his knees buckling under him. Instantly, two arms went around his waist, holding him up, and he looked up to see the beautiful blond on one side and a very cute brown-haired young guy on the other. They took him back to their car, and Nicky, the blond, as Gabe found out, put his arm around him and started babbling about when Marco had been shot a year before and about how scared he had been.</p><p>Gabe was aware of how the blond and the brown-haired guy kept exchanging worried glances over his head, but he couldn\u2019t seem to be able to speak, not until he found out how Zack was. It seemed to take a very long time, and finally Nicky sent Rory, the other man, out to check on things. Calmed down a little, Gabe could tell that Rory was a wolf too, though not quite as big as the others. Gabe wondered how Rory had come to be the mate of another wolf, deciding there must be a story there he\u2019d like to hear someday. If only Zack...Gabe bit his lip and tried not to think of what might be happening in the car in front of them. Rory came back in just a few minutes and smiled encouragingly at Gabe.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still giving him blood. My mate, Casey, is feeding him now. He\u2019s about half- conscious and cooperating more in drinking. It\u2019s a very good sign.\u201d</p><p>Nicky squeezed Gabe\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSee?I knew he\u2019d be okay. Marco and Casey are really strong. Right,Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Casey is, for sure,\u201d he laughed. \u201cA little too strong sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like Marco. I hear your mate, Zack, is really something too.I just know he\u2019ll be all right!\u201d</p><p>Gabe leaned into Nicky\u2019s shoulder a little, comforted by his kindness, but exhausted and beginning to shiver. He still was wearing only a pair of skin tight leather pants.</p><p>He shuddered, and Nicky patted his shoulders, taking charge again.\u201cRory, give me a blanket from the trunk, Gabe is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so scared,\u201d Gabe mumbled as Rory hurried out, \u201ceven more than when I went feral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were feral?\u201d</p><p>Gave gulped and nodded, \u201cBut Zack said it would be better if no one ever knew. Don\u2019t repeat it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, butit\u2019s something I\u2019d like to hear more about it when we\u2019re alone. I went feral one time too. Scary shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZack saved me from that. God, I love him so much. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if...\u201d</p><p>Rory opened the door and handed Nicky a blanket. Nicky draped it around Gabe and launched into a story about the weather, for God\u2019s sake, but Gabe was actually grateful. Not only did it show Nicky would keep his secret, but he didn\u2019t want to think about what was going on in the car ahead of them. He listened to Nicky\u2019s chatter, knowing he was only giving him a chance to recover by distracting him.</p><p>After about another ten minutes, Scott came and looked in the back seat where the three young men sat.\u201cHe\u2019s awake, Gabe, but just barely.They\u2019re going to get him to shift so he\u2019ll heal faster.The two alphas are shifting with him and taking him into the woods.\u201d</p><p>They got out of the back seat in time to see the two alphas, Marco and Casey, supporting Zack between them as they headed toward the trees. They could see Zack walking, if a bit unsteadily. Scott went with them and came back in a few minutes, carrying their clothes. Nicky walked up to the tree line and yelled for Marco. He had to yell a couple of times, but finally, a huge silver wolf stood in the shadows, looking out at them.</p><p>\u201cGabe needs to see Zack, Marco, if only for a minute. You can imagine how he\u2019s feeling. Go get Zack, please.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stepped up beside Nicky and touched his arm, at a loss for words. He did need to see his mate, but hadn\u2019t known what to do to make it happen. Nicky smiled down at him.\u201cWolves. Beautiful, but dumb as dirt sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Rory punched him in the arm.\u201cHey!\u201d he said, playfully.</p><p>Nicky smiled at him.\u201cPresent company definitely not excluded!\u201d</p><p>A large wolf stepped up almost out of the shadows and looked straight at Gabe. It was the first time Gabe had seen Zack\u2019s wolf, and he was almost speechless at his beauty. He was gray and black, and his eyes were the same color as Zack\u2019s dark ones. Gabe ran over to him and put his arms around his neck, luxuriating in the feel of his soft fur. The wolf swayed a little, nuzzled his nose into Gabe\u2019s neck, and nipped ever so gently at his skin. Then he pulled away and was gone, joining the others, their howls sounding far away and echoing through the hills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Gabe, we need to get you back to your lodge. Marco and Casey will bring Zack home once he\u2019s healed. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d Nicky led the younger boy to his car. Scott and Jamie helped them all in and took off back toward the lodge. Gabe put his head back on the seat, suddenly unable to keep his eyes open, and no one spoke on the short journey back home.</p><p>Zack sat with the other two alphas, Marco and Casey, at a large table in the common room, watching their mates dance. Casey had a proud, appreciative look on his face, as Rory in his tight blue jeans and T-shirt swayed provocatively to the music. Sexy, but refined and respectable, he had eyes only for Casey as he beckoned him out on the dance floor. Casey declined with a wave of his hand, but his eyes rarely left his mate.</p><p>His voice was warm and proud as he spoke of his mate. Casey told them, \u201cRory used to be too self-conscious to dance, especially out there with the other pets, but he\u2019s overcome much of his shyness in the months sincewe\u2019ve been together.\u201d</p> <p>Marco, on the other hand, had an expression of dismay, much as Zack suspected he looked, as they watched their beautiful pets strut their stuff on the dance floor. Both Gabe and Nicky had taken off their shirts to show off their nipple rings. Gabe had come up with another pair of the damn things for Nicky to wear.Nicky\u2019s blond hair and Gabe\u2019s midnight black hair whipped around together as they bumped and ground their way through an old school Donna Summer disco number.</p><p>Rory came back and sat down after just one dance and leaned his back up against Casey, while Casey stroked his arm and whispered something in his ear to make him blush.</p><p>Watching them together, Zack sighed, wishing his pet could be a littlemore like Casey\u2019s, instead of flaunting his sexy little ass all over the dance floor.</p><p>Marco saw the expression on Zack\u2019s face and laughed, clapping a hand on his back.\u201cGet used to it, Zack.If he\u2019s anything like Nicky, your life just got very interesting.\u201d He stood.\u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em,\u201d he said over his shoulder, \u201cjoin \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Behind Nicky, Marco grabbed his waist and pulled him sharply up into his crotch. Whatever he said in Nicky\u2019s ear made Nicky smile and cuddle his butt even closer into Marco\u2019s bulging crotch. That left Gabe out there dancing alone, his eyes on Zack as he danced closer to where he sat.Zack\u2019s legs opened up as he came closer, and Gabe stepped in between them, his bulging crotch almost even with Zack\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like a lap dance, baby?\u201d Gabe didn\u2019t bother to lower his voice.</p><p>Zack\u2019s face flamed. He pushed Gabe into the chair next to him and growled into his ear.\u201cI may be recovering, but I can still spank that ass.Stop showing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, honey, I\u2019m just having a little fun. I like to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like it when you dance that wayin public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you, Zack. Nicky and I were just having some fun.\u201d Gabe sat next to Zack, his chin in his hand watching Nicky and Marco dirty dancing. He sighed a little, and Zack groaned, pulling him over to put an arm around him and whisper in his ear.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be such a grouch, honey.I guess I\u2019m just frustrated, becauseI can\u2019t get out there with you yet like Marco\u2019s doing with his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t take it out on you. I keep going over and over in my mind how this could have happened.This is my pack\u2019s home, Gabe. I\u2019m the alpha. I\u2019m responsible for my pack\u2019s safety\u2014for mymate\u2019s safety. Hell, I can\u2019t even protect myself.\u201d</p><p>Scott appeared at the door and crossed quickly over to Zack. He glanced nervously at Gabe, who leaned against Zack contentedly.\u201cUh, Alpha, could I speak to you privately?Over there?\u201d</p><p>Zack, a little irritated over the interruption, nodded and followed Scott to the side of the room.\u201cWhat is it, Scott?Did you do the search of the house like I asked you to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, and it\u2019s what I have to talk to you about. You know how you said to search everybody\u2019s room while most of them were down here celebrating your recovery?\u201d</p><p>Zack nodded impatiently.\u201cWell? Did you find something?What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like this, sir. We searched every room like you said. We even searched your room, Zack. Tim insisted we do every room.Anyway, we found this.\u201d He held out a small plastic zip bag containing small white crystals.\u201cWe think this is the cyanide.\u201d</p><p>Zack shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m not understanding. Are you saying you found this in my room? Are you saying I poisoned myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It-it wasfound in Gabe\u2019s boot, sir, stuck all the way down in the toe.\u201d</p> <p>Zack turned shocked eyes to his gamma.\u201cWhat? Are you trying to say Gabe poisoned me? No, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d He shoved the bag away and started back to the table, but Scott pulled on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWait, sir, please. Just at least let us talk to him. Question him some. Jamie is upstairs waiting, along with Tim. Of course, you can come with him.It\u2019s just he\u2019s an outsider, and nothing like this ever happened in our pack before he came.\u201d</p><p>Zack snarled and turned such a furious gaze on him he backed up a step or two.</p><p>Scott tried again.\u201cI like him, Zack. I like him a lot, but he never wanted to come here, and the way you two fight sometimes...I heard you say he\u2019s never told you he loves you, even when you were so sick. Hell, he cried all the way down the mountain when you made him leave, but when we all thought you were dying, Inever saw him shed one tear. Not one, Zack.\u201d</p><p>Zack\u2019s face was red with fury, and his hands trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He strode furiously over to where Gabe was sitting and took his arm.\u201cCan I see you a moment, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>Marco, who was back at the table with Nicky, looked up curiously as Zack turned to him.\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, Marco, everyone. We\u2019ll be back later. Pack business.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded.\u201cOf course. We can entertain ourselves.Actually, it\u2019s getting late, and we need to be on our way early tomorrow.We\u2019ll just see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Zack nodded and drew Gabe quickly out of the room, only speaking to him once, sharply, as he pulled him along behind himup the steps. \u201cPut on your shirt, Gabe. We\u2019re going to talk to the council.\u201d</p><p>Scott followed quietly along behind them.</p><p>Zack burst into the council room, holding Gabe\u2019s hand tightly and spoke to the wolves assembled there.\u201cI understand you have an accusation to makeabout my mate.\u201d</p><p>Gabe turned startled eyes on Zack and at the people sitting around the table.\u201cAccusation? What is it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie, Zack\u2019s beta, had the good grace to blush, but he held his ground.\u201cAlpha,\u201d he said formally.\u201cDo we have permission to question your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not!\u201d Zack said firmly. \u201cAll you need?\u201d</p><p>Tim jumped to his feet.\u201cZack, don\u2019t be foolish. This man doesn\u2019t care for you. It\u2019s plain for all to see. He argues with you constantly, disrespects you, and flaunts himself in front of the other wolves.He makes a fool of you!\u201d</p><p>Gabe gasped in anger and took a step forward, his fist held back at his side.\u201cShut your mouth, Tim!You don\u2019t know a goddamned thing about me!\u201d</p><p>Zack pulled him back beside him.\u201cBe quiet, Gabe. Let me handle this.\u201d He turned back to face Tim.\u201cDo you have any other evidence to present against him other than those crystals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat crystals? Zack, I have a right to knowwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Zack ignored him and spoke louder.\u201cWell? Is there any other evidence against him or any other accusations?\u201d He glared around the table and tugged Gabe to the door.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he yelled back over his shoulder.</p><p>Gabe stopped and jerked his arm away from Zack\u2019s grip. Backing up into the room he held up a hand.\u201cWait a minute! Just wait one damned minute!If I\u2019m being accused of something, I want to know what it is. Right this damn minute!\u201d</p><p>He turned toward Zack as he came back for him.\u201cZack, please. I\u2019m not trying to disrespect you.I\u2019m not! I know you\u2019re only trying to protect me, and I appreciate it.\u201d He whirled around to face the other wolves.\u201cBut I have nothing to be protected from! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and I defy each and every one of you to prove I did!\u201d</p><p>Tim stepped nearer to him, stopping a few feet away when Zack\u2019s growls warned him away. He glanced over at him and back at Gabe.\u201cWe found a bag of cyanide\u2014the same substance that poisoned our alpha\u2014in your closet. In your damned boot! How the fuck did it get there if you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s feet went off the floor. Zack held him around the throat with one hand, his face within inches of Tim\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever cuss at him!He\u2019s mine! If you can\u2019t show him the respect he deserves you can get the hell out of my pack!\u201d He threw Tim back down, choking and coughing, as Jamie came around the table and touched his arm, putting himself between the two.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Alpha. No one means to show disrespect to your mate. Can we all please just sit down for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! The discussion is over!\u201d He turned on his heel and would have walked out if Gabe hadn\u2019t been standing in his path.</p><p>\u201cZack, honey, please. Let me answer their accusations. I know you believe me, but they need to believe me too.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat down at the council table.\u201cAll right. I\u2019m ready. What do you have to say to me?\u201d Zack went to stand protectively behind him, but Gabe pulled him down in the chair next to him. \u201cI want them to tell me the truth, Zack. They won\u2019t if you intimidate them.\u201d</p><p>Zack glared down the table.</p><p>Gabe started the discussion by turning to Jamie.\u201cThat\u2019s it? A bag found in my boot? Is this all you got?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, his face red.\u201cIt\u2019s the only real evidence. There\u2019s circumstantial evidence...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scott spoke up.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabe, but you know yourself how much you two argue, and the whole house can hear you fighting sometimes. And...well, I sort of thought you might be more upset when we thought Zack was dying.I didn\u2019t see you crying any like you did when you left him that time.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked disgusted.\u201cSeriously? Did it ever occur to any of you dimwits our arguments are just between us?They\u2019re more lovers\u2019 quarrels than anything else if you must know, and some of those times you say the whole house hears us isprobably me screaming when we\u2019re having sex.\u201d</p><p>All the men at the table dropped their gaze in embarrassment, looking shocked, and Zack actually groaned a little. Gabe turned to him.\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of it,darlin\u2019. You\u2019re a wonderful lover, and we\u2019re mated. We have every right to enjoy each other. They need to get over it.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe looked at Scott menacingly.\u201cAs for me not crying or being upset when I thought my mate was dying, you\u2019re full of shit. I was beyond tears! Whose idea was it to put Zack in the car and meet the other alphas halfway when all of you were standing around with your thumbs up your asses? It was my idea. That\u2019s who!\u201d He stood up and stared at each man in turn.\u201cI have no idea who planted the shit in my boot. You should be out looking for him instead of wasting your time in here.\u201d He slammed his hand down on the table.\u201cAnd the next motherfucker who implies I don\u2019t love my husband is getting my foot up his wolf ass!\u201d</p><p>Zack jumped to his feet and pulled Gabe away. He came reluctantly, still spoiling for a fight. Zack was a little worried he\u2019d jump on one of them, and they might defend themselves and bring about their deaths when Zack had to kill them. He put his arms around Gabe and led him from the council room and into their bedroom down the hall. As he closed the door, Gabe reached the throwing stage. Things were flying around the room as he threw books and kicked shoes and generally wrecked the room. The only way Zack got him to stop was by wrapping his arms around him and sitting down with him in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHoney? Please calm down, okay?I\u2019m so proud of you, baby. You stood up to all of them and you were like a tiger in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSons-of-bitches sayingI don\u2019t love you. That burned me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, baby, you\u2019ve never exactly told me you loved me.\u201d</p> <p>He turned on Zack.\u201cDon\u2019t you start! Of course I have! You know I do! How can you even say something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey,\u201d Zack replied. \u201cI asked you once, and you said yes. Not exactly the same thing.\u201d Seeing he was upsetting Gabe again, Zack did the only thing he knew to do. He pushed Gabe\u2019s head back and kissed his mouth, running his tongue inside and teasing Gabe\u2019s tongue until he sighed against his mouth and wiggled his cock onZack\u2019s crotch. \u201cBut I\u2019m very glad you do, sweetheart.\u201d Zack picked him up and carried him over to the bed.\u201cClothes off,\u201d he ordered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Gabe scrambled to shed his jeans and shirt, while Zack pulled off his clothes, never taking his eyes from Gabe\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve been teasing me with your little ass all night long, and by God, I\u2019m going to tear it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that right?\u201d Gabe said teasingly, scooting back up on the bed.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re going to scream like I\u2019m killing you, and we\u2019ll probably wake the whole house up. What do you think about that?\u201d Zack crawled onto the foot of the bed and up toward him.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, baby? Speak up. I want to know about this love stuff. You love me, huh? Really love me?Isn\u2019t that what you said? Oh and something about me being a wonderful lover? Yeah, I want to hear all those wordsagain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Gabe lay on his back, looking intimidated as hell as Zack prowled toward him.</p><p>Zack bent over and engulfed his dick in his mouth, held him down with his weight and showed him no mercy. He took him in all the way to the root of his shaft, and he tasted so damn sweet. Gabe arched his back and moaned, but Zack pushed him back down and held on to his hips. He moved up and down on his cock until he had him writhing under him, releasing him for Gabe to pump his hips in a screaming orgasm. Zack sucked down every drop and licked up any remainders before leaning up on one elbow and smiling down at him.</p><p>\u201cJerk yourself off for me while I watch, baby. You say you love me. You need to show me. Get hard for me again.C\u2019mon, hot stuff. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>Gabe whimpered as he put his hand around his half-hard cock and pulled at it. Zack knew it must be almost painful for him as hard as he\u2019d come, but watching him was the hottest thing he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThat\u2019s right, pump it for me, baby. You\u2019re doing just fine. It\u2019s so hot, darlin\u2019. Get yourself ready for me again, cause I\u2019m about to fuck you hard.\u201d He bent over and teased Gabe\u2019s nipple, ring and all, with his tongue, making Gabe whimper.\u201cYou like that, baby?\u201d He bit the other nipple, causing Gabe to stop stroking himself, shuddering.Covering Gabe\u2019s hand, Zack moved it up and down his cock again.\u201cDon\u2019t stop, baby. Get yourself ready for me. Show me how much you love me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe came up again. Zack nipped at his thighs and his balls until Gabe almost cried with need, his cock hard and weeping with pre-cum.\u201cSweet, baby, very sweet.\u201d Gabe arched his ass back at him, and Zack laughed.\u201cYou need something? You need my cock up your little ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Zack...please...\u201d</p><p>Zack rolled him over and rubbed a finger over his pre-cum covered slit for lube. He put his finger inside his sweet, teasing hole, and crooked it, finding his prostate, enjoying his groans.</p> <p>\u201cPlease what, baby? Do this?\u201d Sweeping his finger over his sweet spot, teasing and playing with it, he drove Gabe crazy, just like he wanted him, crazy with need. He nipped at his ass, making him cry out.\u201cOr this?\u201d He bit him all over the insides of his thighs, biting hard and licking the bite until Gabe sobbed. \u201cKeep stroking,baby. You\u2019re doing so good.\u201d Zack licked all the way up the crease in his ass, lapped to moisten it and get him ready.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Zack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst you got to tell me how much you love me. Tell me, baby, or I won\u2019t let you come for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I love you, Zack!I love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy and whose ass is this,darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d he whimpered.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight! I love you too, baby, and this is all mine.\u201d</p><p>He lined up his cock and drove balls deep into Gabe\u2019s sweet ass, pumping him and rocking him hard, the bed groaning in protest. He pounded him, holding Gabe by the hips so he couldn\u2019t move away. They both came in an explosive orgasm, rocking Zack to his core.</p><p>Zack stayed deep inside him even as he softened, kissing him on the back of the neck before gently pulling out. Gabe cuddled back into him, breathing hard. Zack bent over his ear.\u201cSay it again, sweetheart.I can\u2019t get enough of it.Tell me how much you love me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe turned his head, not even bothering to open his eyes.\u201cLove you so much. Always have from the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Zack murmured, delighted with his answer, kissing him on the back of the neck.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm. Smell good\u2014like burnt sugar.\u201d</p><p>Zack laughed softly.\u201cHoney, that\u2019s how you smell to me too. God, I love you, darlin\u2019.\u201d Zack wrapped his arms tight around him and put his nose up into his soft hair. Within minutes, he was asleep.</p><p>Something nudged Zack on his leg, insistent, demanding, something hard and sharp. Zack looked up and froze with fear. Standing beside the bed, holding Gabe against his chest, stood his cousin, Tim, a long, wicked-looking knife in the other hand.\u201cMove and he\u2019s dead, Zack. I swear to God, I\u2019ll finish him this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW -what have you done to him?\u201d Gabe was completely limp, his naked body slumped in Tim\u2019s hold, lookingsmall next to Tim\u2019s bulk. Zack was immediately terrified.\u201cGive him to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. He\u2019s not dead\u2014yet\u2014but I\u2019ll kill him if you attack me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Tim?\u201d Zack fought against every instinct he had to leap up and tear Tim\u2019s throat out .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking what\u2019s mine. He\u2019s been mine for over a year, long before you ever saw him.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Zack snarled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who changed him. Me! It was my bite that made him Werekin.I\u2019m claiming</p><p>what\u2019s mine. You\u2019ve taken everything else away from me, but you\u2019re not taking him! I knew him for mine from the moment you brought him here. Hissmell almost drove me crazy!\u201d He laughed shortly.\u201cI even tried to put floral scent in his bath to drown out the smell, but it didn\u2019t help.If you hadn\u2019t come in when you did, I\u2019d have taken him and finished what I started back at thatrest stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, Tim, what are you saying?You\u2019re the one who raped him? Who murdered his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to stop me. I smelled him when he got out of his car, and I had to have him. I would have made him mine if we hadn\u2019t been interfered with.\u201d He bent his head down, as if he couldn\u2019t help himself and buried his nose in Gabe\u2019s hair for a moment.</p><p>Zack was murderous. His claws and fangs descended, and he could feel the hair springing out of the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou shift, and I\u2019ll kill him. If I can\u2019t have him, then at least you won\u2019t ever touch him again. Do you know how I felt seeing you with him? My God, to listen to him tell me what a wonderful lover you are!I thought I\u2019d shift and kill both of you right then.\u201d</p><p>Zack made a conscious effort to calm himself. Tim was unstable, obviously insane. What he was doing was totally irrational and without forethought. There\u2019d be no way he could just walk out of there with Gabe, and there was no way of knowing what he\u2019d do next. Zack had to watch, his nails digging into his palms, while Tim licked hismate\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI tried to kill you, but you wouldn\u2019t fucking die! I fixed the brakes on his truck, because I knew you\u2019d play the big man and let him drive your truck. Then I poisoned you, but you even survived that. I thought if I planted the cyanide in his closet, you might reject him, and I could have him.\u201d He glared wildly at Zack.\u201cInstead you took him in here and fucked him! The whole house could hear his screams.\u201d He pulled Gabe closer and kissed the side of his face.\u201cI came for you as soon as I could, baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zack tried to make his voice low and calm.Tim still had the knife, pressing it against Gabe\u2019s heart.\u201cTim, if you love him, don\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk! I know you beat him, and you had no right. He was mine! I saw him first, but I didn\u2019t get the chance to complete the mating, and then I couldn\u2019t find him. I searched everywhere. He just disappeared when he left the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim, put him down and let me call a doctor for him. Don\u2019t let this go any further.\u201d Gabe stirred, moaning a little, and it terrified Zack even more. If Tim let Gabe know he was the one who killed his mother, there was no telling what Gabe might do.He\u2019d ignore the knife pressed to his heart and attack Tim. Zack had to act before he woke up, but he didn\u2019t know how to end their standoff.</p> <p>A knock at the door saved their lives. Caught off guard, Tim turned toward the door for a split second, snarling, long enough for Zack to shift to his wolf and launch himself, his jaws and fangs clamping down onthe hand holding the knife to Gabe\u2019s chest. He bit down hard, causing Tim to howl and drop the knife and Gabe to the floor. Tim started to shift, but Zack\u2019s lunge took him to his back and Zack ripped at his throat, the hot, slippery blood spurting out, bathing his fur. Vaguely, Zack was aware of shouting voices, but he threw himself over the body of his mate and growled viciously at the men crowding into the room. The only thought running through his lupine brain was to protect his mate.</p><p>Others in his pack shifted, whining and snarling with the emotions of their alpha.Zack\u2019s wolf lay over the body of his mate, his animal blood savage and strong, unable to make the shift back to human.</p><p>Someone touched him gently, and he snapped up his head, his eyes looking into the still human face of the alpha, Marco. He spoke to him, soothingly, softly. In his primal state, Zack couldn\u2019t totally understand what he said, but he recognized another alpha male. He growled and hunched over his mate more closely. Other scents came closer\u2014pets. He was unable to hurt a pet, even in his wolf. Following the second strongest of the pack laws, he whined and turned his face away as they gently tugged at his mate\u2019s body. He allowed them to pull Gabe away, though he hated the idea, and jumped to his feet to pace anxiously back and forth. They put Gabe on the bed, and Zack jumped up next to him, laid a paw on his leg and slowly regained control. The shift came over him, and he reverted to his human form.</p><p>Gabe got up from the bed and stole softly into the bathroom. He woke up with his bladder bursting, and he knew Zack wouldn\u2019t allow him to get out of bed without a damn escort. He was still a little weak, but much better, the excruciating headache almost gone. Tim had hit him on the head as he slept and given him a serious concussion. The doctor said he was lucky not to have been killed by the blow.</p><p>Zack had been feeding him his blood daily since the attack, and he was getting sick of it. Not the taste, he never grew tired of Zack\u2019s taste, but of the feeling of lassitude and weakness it brought on.He\u2019d done nothing much more than sleep for the past three days. Alphas were notorious for over-feeding their mates when they were ill, Nicky and Rory told him when they visited, and Zack was certainly living up to that reputation.</p> <p>He finished and was about to go back to the bedroom when the light turned on, and Zack came in, sweeping him up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d His voice was gruff and demanding.</p><p>\u201cUh, what does it look like?I don\u2019t need you to carry me around everywhere, honey, though I do appreciate the sentiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said you were almost killed. I have to take care of you.\u201d Zack laid him tenderly down on the bed and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know, darlin\u2019, and I\u2019m better, really. Lie down here beside me and let\u2019s make love. My head\u2019s not hurting anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zack shook his head.\u201cToo soon, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d He kissed his neck and trailed kisses down to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fuck me, stop teasing me,\u201d Gabe said, laughing. \u201cTell me what\u2019s been happening while I\u2019ve been asleep. I only remember snatches of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know? Tim was buried yesterday after the doctor finished his autopsy.He didn\u2019t find any anomalies, no reason for him to do the things he did. We know he killed your mother, and we think he was responsible for some other deaths while he was away from us. The pack is still investigating. I regret killing him like I did, but he would have been executed anyway by the pack for attacking and killing humans. He was totally out of his mind, Gabe. It\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I would have killed him if you hadn\u2019t. He killed my mother and destroyed my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. I\u2019m can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am about your mother.\u201d They were silent for a few moments, as Zack trailed his fingers along Gabe\u2019s abs. Gabe understood his need to touch him. They had been almost inseparable over the last few days, having come so close to losing each other twice in a short time.</p><p>\u201cNicky and Rory said to say goodbye. They all left yesterday.They\u2019re the ones who pulled you away from me after...afterward and got the doctor up to look at you. Oh, and Scott and Jamie are anxious to apologize for doubting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were trying to protect you.Tell them I understand.\u201d</p><p>Zack\u2019s fingers trailed down to Gabe\u2019s cock, lightly skimming over the sensitive skin.Gabe\u2019s erection quickly filled his hand, and Zack looked down into his eyes.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling better? Don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe grinned wickedly.\u201cI\u2019m feeling fine, or I would be if you\u2019d take care of me like a good alpha.\u201d</p> <p>Zack made a sound in his throat, half growl, half moan, as he got to his knees and pushed Gabe\u2019s legs apart. Gabe closed his eyes and arched his back as Zack bent down to taste him, swirling his tongue over the head of Gabe\u2019s cock in a tease.\u201cLook me in the eye, then, like a good pet.\u201d</p><p>Gabe kept his eyes closed tightly, playing along with the game, his chest rising and falling in passion. Zack waited him out, his lips just brushing over the sensitive head until Gabe finally opened his eyes and looked straight at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right baby, my sweet boy.I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Zack kissed Gabe\u2019s lips, surprised for a moment by the searing possessiveness of Gabe\u2019s mouth. He bent back down to his task, and Gabe smiled. His alpha was really coming along quite nicely.He\u2019d have him trained in no time.</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
