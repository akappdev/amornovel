Some of his clients were at home in the rookeries his crew haunted. Others were most comfortable in the palace. This particular prospective client appeared to be one of strong faith since he\u2019d designated St. George\u2019s as the location of their assignation. Jasper suspected it was considered a \u201csafe\u201d place, which told him this person was ill at ease with retaining an individual of dubious morality. That suited him fine. He would probably be paid well and kept at a distance: his favorite sort of commission.</p><p>Alighting from his carriage, Jasper paused to better appreciate the impressive portico and Corinthian columns of the church\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. Muted singing flowed outward from the building, a lovely contrast to the frustrated shouts of coachmen and the clatter of horses\u2019 hooves behind him. His cane hit the street with a thud, his gloved palm wrapped loosely around the eagle\u2019s-head top. With hat in hand, he waved his driver away.</p> <p>Today\u2019s appointment had been arranged by Mr. Thomas Lynd, a man who shared Jasper\u2019s trade and confidence for many reasons, not the least of which was his mentorship of Jasper in the profession. Jasper would never presume to call himself a moral man, but he did function under the code of ethics Lynd had taught him\u2014help those in actual need of it. He did not extort protection money as other thief-takers did. He did not steal goods with one hand in order to charge for their return with the other. He simply found what was lost and protected those who wanted security, which begged the question of why Lynd was passing on this post. With such similar principles, either of them should have been as good as the other.</p><p>Because Jasper had an inordinate fondness for puzzles and mysteries, he was too intrigued by Lynd\u2019s motives to do anything besides follow through. This, despite the location being one that necessitated his handling the inquiry personally, which was something he rarely did. He preferred to work through trusted employees to retain the anonymity necessary to his greater personal plans.</p><p>Mounting the steps, he entered St. George\u2019s and paused to absorb the wave of music that rolled over him. Near the front on the right side was the raised canopied pulpit; on the left, the bi-level reading desk. The many box pews were empty of the faithful. Only the choir occupied the space, their voices raised in musical praise.</p><p>Jasper withdrew his pocket watch and checked the time. It was directly on the hour. In his profession, he found it highly useful to be a slave to punctuality. He moved to the stairs that would take him up to the right-side gallery for his appointment.</p><p>When he reached the landing, he paused. His gaze was drawn to and held by wild tufts of white hair defying gravity. One hopelessly overworked black ribbon failed to tame the mass into anything but a messy, lopsided queue. As he watched, the unfortunate owner of the horrendous coiffure reached up and scratched it into further disarray.</p> <p>So fascinated was Jasper with the monstrosity of that hair, it took him a moment to register the petite form beside its owner. Once he did, however, his interest was snared. In complete opposition to her companion, the woman was blessed with glossy tresses of a reddish-blond hue so rare it was arresting. They were the only two people in the gallery, yet neither had the tense expectation inherent in those who were awaiting an individual or event. Instead they were singularly focused on the choir below.</p><p>Where was the individual he was scheduled to meet?</p><p>Sensing she was the object of perusal, the woman turned her head and met Jasper\u2019s weighted gaze. She was attractive. Not in the exceptionally remarkable way of her hair but pleasing all the same. Deep blue eyes stared at him from beneath thick lashes. She had an assertive nose and high cheekbones. When she bit her lower lip, she displayed neat white teeth, and when her lips pursed, she revealed a tiny dimple. It was a charming face rather than beautiful, and notable for her seeming displeasure at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond,\u201d she said, after a slight delay. \u201cI did not hear you approach.\u201d</p><p>One could blame the choir\u2019s singing for that. However, the truth of it was that he walked silently. He\u2019d learned the skill long ago. It had saved his life then and continued to do so in recent years.</p><p>Standing, she moved toward him with a determined stride and thrust out her hand. As if cued, the singers below ended their hymn, leaving a sudden silence into which she said, \u201cI am Eliza Martin.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice surprised him. Soft as a summer breeze, but threaded with steel. The sound of it lingered, stirring his imagination to travel in directions it shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He shifted his cane to his other hand and accepted her greeting. \u201cMiss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your courtesy in meeting with me. However, you are exactly what I feared you would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Taken aback by her direct approach, he found himself becoming more intrigued. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn every way, sir. I contacted Mr. Lynd because we require a certain type of individual. I regret the need to say you are not he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you object to my request for elaboration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe points are too numerous,\u201d she pronounced.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, a man in my position seeks predictability in others but fears it in himself. Since you state I am the epitome of what you did not want, I feel I must request an accounting of the criteria upon which you based your judgment.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Martin seemed to ponder his response for a moment. In the brief time of introspection, Jasper collected what his instincts had recognized upon first sight: Eliza Martin was intensely aware of him. Without her cognizance, her baser senses were reacting to him much the way his were to her: her delicate nostrils flared, her breathing quickened, her body swayed with the undercurrent of agitation...a doe sensing the hunter nearby.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, with a catch in her voice. \u201cI can see why that would be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true. I never lie to clients.\u201d He never bedded them either, but that was about to change.</p><p>\u201cYou have not been engaged,\u201d she reminded, \u201cso I am not a client.\u201d</p><p>The man with the frightening hair intruded. \u201cEliza, marry Montague and be done with this farce.\u201d</p><p>With the voicing of that one name, Jasper knew why he\u2019d received the referral and how little chance Eliza Martin had of dismissing him.</p><p>\u201cI will not be bullied, my lord,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cInvite Mr. Bond to sit, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Skirting her, Jasper settled into the pew behind the one they occupied.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond...\u201d Miss Martin gave a resigned exhalation. \u201cMy lord, may I present Mr. Jasper Bond? Mr. Bond, this is my uncle, the Earl of Melville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Melville.\u201d Jasper greeted the earl with a slight bow of his head. He knew of Melville as the head of the Tremaine family, a lot renowned for their eccentricities. \u201cI believe you will find me to be highly suitable for any task in want of a thief-taker to manage it.\u201d</p><p>Miss Martin\u2019s blue eyes narrowed on him in silent reproach for attempting to circumvent her. \u201cSir, I am certain you are capable in most circumstances. However\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the many points...?\u201d he interjected, circling back. He disliked proceeding when there were still matters left unaddressed.</p><p>\u201cYou are overly tenacious.\u201d She remained standing, as if prepared to show him out.</p><p>\u201cAn excellent trait to have in my profession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t mitigate the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rest?\u201d</p><p>The earl\u2019s gaze darted back and forth between them.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cCan we not simply leave it at that, Mr. Bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather we didn\u2019t.\u201d He set his hat on the seat beside him. \u201cI have always taken pride in my ability to manage any situation put before me. How will I provide exemplary service if I can no longer make that claim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, sir,\u201d Miss Martin protested. \u201cI did not say you are unsuitable for your trade as a whole, only in regards to our situation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matter of some delicacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot assist you if I am ignorant of the details,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI do not want your assistance, Mr. Bond. You fail to collect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you refuse to explain yourself. Mr. Lynd thought I was suitable and you trusted his judgment enough to arrange this meeting.\u201d Jasper would pay Lynd handsomely for the referral. It had been far too long since he\u2019d felt this level of interest in anything beyond his need for vengeance.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lynd does not have the same considerations I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, you are exasperating.\u201d</p><p>And she was fascinating. Her eyes sparkled with irritation, her right foot tapped against the floor, and her fisted hands moved often as if to rest on her hips. But she resisted the urge. He found her resistance most appealing. What would it take to break it and see her unrestrained? He couldn\u2019t wait to find out.</p><p>\u201cI will compensate you for your time today,\u201d she said, \u201cso all is not a complete loss to you. There is no need to continue this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou overlook the possibility that I might have intended to assign a member of my crew to you, Miss Martin. I would, however, need to know what your situation is so I can determine whose skills would best suit your requirements.\u201d He intended to service her himself, but he wasn\u2019t above a little subterfuge when the prize was this delicious.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bit her lower lip again. \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noted.\u201d</p><p>Miss Martin finally sank back onto the pew in a movement of eminent grace. \u201cJust so we are clear you won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear.\u201d He set his cane between his legs and placed his hands atop it, one over the other. \u201cAt least, not to me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his lordship, then\u2014reluctantly\u2014back to Jasper. \u201cYou force me to say what I would rather not, Mr. Bond. Frankly, you are too handsome for the task.\u201d</p><p>He was stunned into momentary silence. Then, he relished an inner smile. How delightful she was, even when cross.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lynd was less conspicuous than you,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou are quite large and, as I said, far too comely.\u201d</p><p>Lynd was a score of years older and average in height, features, and build. Jasper looked to the earl and found the man staring at his niece with confusion. \u201cI fail to see what bearing my face has on my investigative skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition\u2014\u201d her voice grew stronger as she warmed to the topic of his faults, \u201c\u2014it would be impossible to disguise the air about you which distinguishes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray tell me what that is.\u201d He was beginning to find it difficult to hide his growing enjoyment of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou are a predator, Mr. Bond. You have the appearance of one, and you carry yourself like one. To be blunt, you are clearly capable of being a dangerous man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Fascination deepened into captivation. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t so innocent, after all. He spent obscene amounts of coin on his attire, deliberately crafting an appearance so polished very few saw past it to the rough edges underneath.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you would be effective at your profession if you were not possessed of both predatory and dangerous qualities,\u201d she qualified in a conciliatory tone.</p><p>\u201cAnd many others,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Miss Martin nodded. \u201cYes, I suspect the trade requires you to be well versed in a multitude of skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, your masculine beauty negates all of that.\u201d</p><p>Jasper was ready to move forward. \u201cWould you get to the point, Miss Martin? What\u2014exactly\u2014did you intend to hire me to accomplish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit, actually. Protection, investigation, and...to act as my suitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Bond\u2019s voice rumbled through the air between them.</p><p>Eliza was flustered and out of sorts, and her state was entirely his fault. She had not anticipated that he would be so persistent or so curious. And she had certainly not expected a man of his appearance. Not only was he the handsomest man she had ever seen, but he was dressed in garments fit for a peer and he carried his large frame with a sleek, preda-ceous grace.</p><p>He also regarded her in a manner that would only lead to trouble.</p><p>To receive such an examination from a man who looked like Jasper Bond was highly disconcerting. Men such as he usually dismissed women of average appearance the moment they saw them. That was why she took such pains to be as unobtrusive in her attire selections as possible. Why encourage responses she was ill-equipped to deal with?</p><p>Perhaps his interest was engaged by the color of her hair? Her mother had posited that some men had a peculiar preference for specific parts of the female body and for tresses of a certain hue.</p><p>\u201cRepeat yourself, please, Miss Martin,\u201d Bond said, watching her with those dark and intense eyes.</p><p>It was her curse to feel compelled to gaze directly at the person with whom she was speaking. She found it difficult to think quickly when awed by Jasper Bond\u2019s perfection. Stunning as he was from the shoulders down, he was more so from the shoulders up. His hair was as thick and dark as her favorite ink, and blessed with a similar sheen. The length\u2014 slightly overlong\u2014was perfect for framing his features: the distinguished nose, the deep-set eyes, the stern yet sensual mouth. It was a testament to the way he carried himself that he could be so formidable with such a pretty face. He was very clearly not a man one wished to cross.</p><p>\u201cI need protection\u2014\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestigation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d her chin went up, \u201c\u2014a suitor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded as if that were a mundane request, but the glitter in his eyes was anticipatory. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza...\u201d The earl stared at his clasped hands and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Bond began in a casual tone. \u201cWere you aware of the nature of Miss Martin\u2019s inquiry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying times these are,\u201d Lord Melville muttered. \u201cTrying times.\u201d</p> <p>Bond\u2019s precise gaze moved back to Eliza. Her brow lifted.</p><p>\u201cIs he daft?\u201d Bond queried.</p><p>\u201cHis brain is so advanced, it stumbles over mediocrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s tangled by your reasoning in this endeavor?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders went back. \u201cMy reasoning is sound. And sarcasm is unproductive, Mr. Bond. Please refrain from it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d His tone took on a dangerous quality. \u201cAnd what is it you hope to produce by procuring a suitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not in want of stud service, sir. Only a depraved mind would leap to that conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStud service...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not what you are thinking?\u201d</p><p>A wicked smile came to his lips. Eliza was certain her heart skipped a beat at the sight of it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, no.\u201d</p><p>Wanting to conclude this meeting as swiftly as possible, she rushed forward. \u201cDo you have someone who can assist me or not?\u201d</p> <p>Bond snorted softly, but the derisive sound seemed to be directed inward and not at her. \u201cFrom the beginning, if you would please, Miss Martin. Why do you need protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have recently found myself to be a repeated victim of various unfortunate\u2014and suspicious\u2014events.\u201d</p><p>Eliza expected him to laugh or perhaps give her a doubtful look. He did neither. Instead, she watched a transformation sweep over him. As fiercely focused as he\u2019d been since his arrival, he became more so when presented with the problem. She found herself appreciating him for more than his good looks.</p><p>He leaned slightly forward. \u201cWhat manner of events?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pushed into the Serpentine. My saddle was tampered with. A snake was loosed in my bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand it was a Runner who referred you to Mr. Lynd, who in turn referred you to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I hired a Runner for a month, but Mr. Bell discovered nothing. No attacks occurred while he was engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would want to injure you, and why?\u201d</p> <p>She offered him a slight smile, a small show of gratitude for the gravity he was displaying. Anthony Bell had come highly recommended, but he\u2019d never taken her seriously. In fact, he had been amused by her tales and she\u2019d never felt he was dedicated to the task of discovery. \u201cTruthfully, I am not certain whether they intend bodily harm, or if they simply want to goad me into marriage as a way to establish some permanent security. I see no reason to any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wealthy, Miss Martin? Or certain to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Which is why I doubt they sincerely aim to cause me grievous injury\u2014I am worth more alive. But there are some who believe it isn\u2019t safe for me in my uncle\u2019s household. They claim he is an insufficient guardian, that he is touched and ready for Bedlam. As if any individual capable of compassion would put a stray dog in such a place, let alone a beloved relative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppycock,\u201d the earl scoffed. \u201cI am fit as a fiddle, in mind and body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, my lord,\u201d Eliza agreed, smiling fondly at him. \u201cI have made it clear to all and sundry that Lord Melville will likely live to be one hundred years of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hope that adding me to your stable of suitors will accomplish what, precisely?\u201d Bond asked. \u201cDeter the culprit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that by adding one of your associates,\u201d she corrected, \u201cI can avoid further incidents over the next six weeks of the Season. In addition, if my new suitor is perceived to be a threat, perhaps the scoundrel will turn his malicious attentions toward him. Then, perhaps, we can catch the fiend. Truly, I should like to know by what methods of deduction he formulated this plan and what he hoped to gain by it.\u201d</p><p>Bond settled back into his seat and appeared deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI would never suggest such a hazardous role for someone untrained,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cBut a thief-taker, a man accustomed to associating with criminals and other unfortunates...I should think those who engage in your profession would be more than a match for a nefarious fortune hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, her uncle murmured to himself, working out puzzles and equations in his mind. Like herself, he was most comfortable with events and reactions that could be quantified or predicted with some surety. Dealing with issues defying reason was too taxing.</p><p>\u201cWhat type of individual would you consider ideal to play this role of suitor, protector, and investigator?\u201d Bond asked finally.</p><p>\u201cHe should be quiet, even-tempered, and a proficient dancer.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, he queried, \u201cHow do dullness and the ability to dance signify in catching a possible murderer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say \u2018dull,\u2019 Mr. Bond. Kindly do not attribute words to me that I have not spoken. In order to be acknowledged as a true rival for my attentions, he should be someone whom everyone will believe I would be attracted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not attracted to handsome men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond, I dislike being rude. However, you leave me no recourse. The fact is, you clearly are not the sort of man whose temperament is compatible with matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite relieved to hear a female recognize that,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone doubt it?\u201d She made a sweeping gesture with her hand. \u201cI can more easily picture you in a swordfight or fisticuffs than I can see you enjoying an afternoon of croquet, after-dinner chess, or a quiet evening at home with family and friends. I am an intellectual, sir. And while I don\u2019t mean to imply a lack of mental acuity, you are obviously built for more physically strenuous pursuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, one has only to look at you to ascertain you aren\u2019t like the others at all! It would be evident straightaway that I would never consider a man such as you with even remote seriousness. It is quite obvious you and I do not suit in the most fundamental of ways, and everyone knows I am too observant to fail to see that. Quite frankly, sir, you are not my type of male.\u201d</p><p>The look he gave her was wry but without the smugness that would have made it irritating. He conveyed solid self-confidence free of conceit. She was dismayed to find herself strongly attracted to the quality.</p><p>He would be troublesome. Eliza did not like trouble overmuch.</p><p>He glanced at the earl. \u201cPlease forgive me, my lord, but I must speak bluntly in regard to this subject. Most especially because this is a matter concerning Miss Martin\u2019s physical well-being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right,\u201d Melville agreed. \u201cStraight to the point, I always say. Time is too precious to waste on inanities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Bond\u2019s gaze returned to Eliza and he smiled. \u201cMiss Martin, forgive me, but I must point out that your inexperience is limiting your understanding of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInexperience with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen. More precisely, fortune-hunting men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have you know,\u201d she retorted, \u201cthat over the course of six Seasons I have had more than enough experience with gentlemen in want of funds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why,\u201d he drawled, \u201care you unaware that they are successful for reasons far removed from social suitability?\u201d</p><p>Eliza blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen do not marry fortune hunters because they can dance and sit quietly. They marry them for their appearance and physical prowess\u2014two attributes you have already established I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently, you do not, so I shall explain.\u201d His smile continued to grow. \u201cFortune hunters who flourish do not strive to satisfy a woman\u2019s intellectual needs. Those can be met through friends and acquaintances. They do not seek to provide the type of companionship one enjoys in social settings or with a game table between them. Again, there are others who can do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they strive to satisfy in the only position that is theirs alone, a position some men make no effort to excel in. So rare is this particular skill that many a woman will disregard other considerations in favor of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, say no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFornication,\u201d his lordship muttered, before returning to his conversation with himself.</p><p>Eliza shot to her feet. \u201cMy lord!\u201d</p><p>As courtesy dictated, both her uncle and Mr. Bond rose along with her.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to call it \u2019seduction,\u2019\u201d Bond said, his eyes laughing.</p><p>\u201cI call it ridiculous,\u201d she rejoined, hands on her hips. \u201cIn the grand scheme of life, do you collect how little time a person spends abed when compared to other activities?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her hips. The smile became a fullblown grin. \u201cThat truly depends on who else is occupying said bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear heavens.\u201d Eliza shivered at the look Jasper Bond was giving her. It was...expectant. By some unknown, godforsaken means she had managed to prod the man\u2019s damnable masculine pride into action.</p><p>\u201cGive me a sennight,\u201d he suggested. \u201cOne week to prove both my point and my competency. If, at the end, you are not swayed by one or the other, I will accept no payment for services rendered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent proposition,\u201d his lordship said. \u201cNo possibility of loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Eliza contended. \u201cHow will I explain Mr. Bond\u2019s speedy departure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us make it a fortnight, then,\u201d Bond amended.</p><p>\u201cYou fail to understand the problem. I am not an actor, sir. It will be evident to one and all that I am far from \u2019seduced.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The tone of his grin changed, aided by a hot flicker in his dark eyes. \u201cLeave that aspect of the plan to me. After all, that\u2019s what I am being paid for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you fail? Once you resign, not only will I be forced to make excuses for you, I will have to bring in another thief-taker to act in your stead. The whole affair will be entirely too suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had the same pool of suitors for six years, Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not just state the many reasons why you feel I am not an appropriate suitor for you? Can you not simply reiterate those points in response to any inquiries regarding my departure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are overly persistent, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d he nodded, \u201cwhich is why I will discover who is responsible for the unfortunate events besetting you and what they\u2019d hoped to gain.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cI am not convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. It is fortuitous, indeed, that Mr. Lynd brought us together. If I do not apprehend the culprit, I daresay he cannot be caught.\u201d His hand fisted around the top of his cane. \u201cClient satisfaction is a point of pride, Miss Martin. By the time I am done, I guarantee you will be eminently gratified by my performance.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cThere are times when I impress myself with my own brilliance,\u201d Thomas Lynd crowed when entering Jasper\u2019s study with hat in hand.</p><p>One could always trust Lynd to eschew the services of a formal butler. He preferred lackeys over servants whose training in deportment exceeded his own.</p><p>Jasper settled back in his chair with a smile of welcome. \u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself this time.\u201d</p><p>As usual, Lynd\u2019s garments were overdone in style and underwhelming in fit. The result of a poor tailor provided with expensive material yet lacking the knowledge of how best to utilize it. Regardless, Lynd presented a decidedly more refined appearance than others of their profession. He walked a fine line, one that enabled him to remain respected and welcomed by the lower classes, while presenting himself in a way the peerage found nonthreatening.</p><p>Lynd dropped into one of the two seats set in front of the desk. \u201cThe moment she mentioned Montague, I had no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Although he visited Jasper\u2019s home with regularity, he surveyed the room as if seeing it for the first time. His gaze lingered on the mahogany bookshelves lining the far wall and the sapphire-hued velvet drapes framing the windows opposite. \u201cBesides, she wanted a bloody lapdog, and none of our acquaintances can boast your pedigree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastardy is no advantage in any situation.\u201d Jasper straddled the line Lynd traversed so well, which worked\u2014sur-prisingly\u2014to Jasper\u2019s benefit. He was often hired by those who wanted his services to go unnoticed and were capable of paying the added expense such stealth required. That proclivity enabled him to work with Eliza Martin, because his face was not well known.</p><p>\u201cIt is in this one.\u201d Lynd ran a hand through brown hair as yet unaffected by the graying of age. \u201cIt takes breeding to tolerate the sorts of pompous asses Melville\u2019s niece expects you to rub along with, and you will be far less noticeable in the venues she will expect you to attend than anyone else I could think of.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Jasper moved to the console table by the window where decanters of liquors and crystal tumblers waited. Lynd was one of very few individuals who were aware of Jasper\u2019s lineage. He had Jasper\u2019s confidence because he\u2019d once shown Jasper\u2019s mother a kindness when she desperately needed it.</p><p>As Jasper poured two rations of Armagnac, his gaze took in the two disreputable-looking lackeys who waited out on the street. Lynd\u2019s men.</p><p>It had taken Jasper some time to locate a respectable neighborhood that would accommodate his activities without undue strain. His neighbors tolerated the endless comings and goings of his crew because they found his presence useful in minimizing footpad crimes in the immediate vicinity. He considered his services to the community a small price to pay to avoid residing in the areas surrounding Fleet Street and the Strand, where Lynd and many other thief-takers lived. It was nigh impossible to abide the stench from the sewer ditch, which was an inescapable odor embedded into the very walls of the surrounding buildings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Returning to his seat, Jasper set Lynd\u2019s glass at the edge of the desk. \u201cI have an appointment with Miss Martin this afternoon. I\u2019ll learn then how serious Montague is about winning her hand. Perhaps he has grown desperate enough to become foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreposterous,\u201d Lynd scoffed. \u201cThe whole affair. If someone is so determined to marry the chit, he should ask her outright. But then, I suppose the entire lot of hopefuls is daft or desperate beyond reason to mix their lineage with the Tremaines\u2019. She should be grateful her late father\u2019s fortune has attracted suitors to her. She would have a devil of a time enticing a man without it.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s brow went up. He\u2019d been enticed the moment she first opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d Lynd went on, \u201cshe should just pick a poor fellow and be done with it. Any other woman would. Been allowed to run amok, that one. She took it upon herself to engage a thief-taker to intercede and his lordship is too preoccupied with the maze of his mind to rein her in. Melville\u2019s participation in my interview was only with himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a point to this disparagement of my client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix weeks will seem a lifetime, I vow. No compensation can restitute the loss of your sanity. She is contrary in the extreme. Unnatural in a female. She had the gall to look down her nose at me\u2014a feat, I must say, since I\u2019m taller\u2014and tell me I would do well to hire a decent tailor. No polish to her at all. I could barely tolerate her for the length of the interview. Made my teeth grind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood of you to decline the post, then,\u201d Jasper drawled. \u201cClearly you would not have made a convincing suitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you manage to be, I\u2019d say you missed your true calling as a man of the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as Montague fails to acquire the funds he needs to regain his marker from me, I can do whatever is required.\u201d It was a delectable twist that the best way to foil Montague\u2019s suit was to woo Eliza Martin himself.</p> <p>\u201cRevenge has a way of eating at you, my boy, like a cancer. Best to keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Jasper smiled grimly.</p><p>Shrugging, Lynd said, \u201cBut you\u2019ll do as you like, you always have.\u201d</p><p>The marker Jasper held was for a deed to a parcel of land in Essex that boasted only a modest home and was by far the smallest property Jasper laid claim to. Regardless, its value was priceless. It represented years of meticulous planning and the retribution due him. And in a mere six weeks it would be irrevocably his to destroy or flaunt at his whim.</p><p>Jasper withdrew a waiting coin purse from his desk drawer and pushed it to the edge of the desk.</p><p>Lynd hesitated before collecting the silken bag. \u201cI wish I could afford not to accept this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense. I owe you more than I could ever repay.\u201d</p><p>Rounding his desk, Jasper escorted Lynd to the foyer and saw him off. Once his visitor was gone, he shot a quick glance at the clock above the mantel in his office.</p><p>He was only a few hours away from paying a call on Miss Eliza Martin. He was anticipating it far more than was seemly. He should not be thinking of her at all, a woman who inferred he was more brawn than intellect. His goals were met by dealing with each challenge at the proper time and with the whole of his attention. Eliza\u2019s appointed time was later; there were other items needing to be addressed now. Yet he stood on the threshold of his office where pressing matters awaited him, thinking instead of how he should attire himself to call on her, contemplating whether he should dress to impress or whether mimicking her somber style would better achieve his aim.</p><p>Jasper found himself wanting to meet with her approval. It would be hard won, which made it worth the effort.</p><p>\u201cThe trone d\u2019amour,\u201d he murmured to himself, touching his cravat. Decided on a style, Jasper headed to his desk and determined he wouldn\u2019t think of his newest employer for at least an hour.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s foot crossed the threshold of the Melville front door at precisely eleven o\u2019clock. Snapping his pocket watch shut, he waited only a moment while the butler dealt with his hat and cane. But it was a moment he relished for the expectation weighting it. He\u2019d considered the possible reasons why he should be so confoundedly eager to reach this portion of his schedule and come to the conclusion it was Eliza Martin\u2019s ability to surprise him that he enjoyed.</p><p>The realization came with the sudden understanding that nothing surprised him anymore. He knew precisely what others would say before they said it and how they would respond before they did so. It was the way of the world, the rules of decorum, and his own acute appreciation of human nature. Socializing was like a scripted play, with all the actors aware of what their lines were and when they should be spoken.</p><p>Eliza had yet to say anything he expected her to say.</p> <p>\u201cThis way, sir.\u201d</p><p>Jasper followed the butler to a study and paused on the threshold while he was announced. With his hands clasped at the small of his back, he took in the room, noting how the heavy masculine furniture was offset by flowery pastel drapes and artwork featuring picturesque country landscapes. As if the space had once been a man\u2019s domain and was no longer.</p><p>\u201cAh, good morning, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>The butler bowed and stepped aside, exposing the slender woman who\u2019d been hidden by his tall frame. Eliza sat at a walnut desk so large she appeared dwarfed behind it. Her gaze was downcast, her hair piled high in soft curls, and her shoulders partially hidden by the fine lace decorating a modest bodice.</p><p>Jasper entered fully and moved to one of the two carved wooden chairs facing the desk. Before he sat, he glanced down at what occupied her. Ledgers. She worked over them studiously, filling the columns with impressive speed and painfully neat numerals.</p><p>\u201cOnce again,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou are precisely on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother of my faults?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced up at him, studying him beneath the veil of thick auburn lashes. \u201cWould you care for tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She set her quill aside and waved the butler away. \u201cThe trait of punctuality simply tells me that you value time. It suggests you will value mine as well, which I appreciate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you value, Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how that signifies.\u201d</p><p>Jasper smiled. \u201cIf I am to be a lovelorn swain or even simply a fortune hunter who has set his cap for you, I am expected to know things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A slight wrinkle marred the space between her brows, then she said, \u201cI value my privacy, solitude, the books in my library, my horse, and my money.\u201d</p><p>He watched the way her fingertips tapped lightly atop the ledger in front of her. \u201cYou keep your own accounts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my father did before me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you not wed?\u201d</p><p>Eliza sat back and crossed her arms. \u201cAre you married, Mr. Bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d he corrected, wanting to hear his given name spoken in her soft, yet steely voice. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I ask the same question of you. Why have you not wed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe manner in which I live my life doesn\u2019t lend itself to matrimony. I keep odd hours and odder company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...Well, I have not wed because I\u2019ve yet to find an individual whose company is worth the expense.\u201d She lifted one shoulder in an offhand shrug. \u201cFrankly, marriage for me is an extremely expensive proposition. In addition to the loss of control over my own funds, I\u2019d be agreeing to spend an inordinate amount of time with another person. It makes me odd, I know\u2014or perhaps it just makes me a Tremaine\u2014but I find socializing with others is more exhausting than refreshing. I have to consider everything I want to say, and then filter it through my mind before I speak so what emerges from my mouth doesn\u2019t offend with its bluntness.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the key to wooing her into bed: encourage her to be herself. Not a problem for him at all, since he enjoyed her unpolished pronouncements and reasoned judgments. He looked forward to the challenge of unveiling the woman beneath the brain.</p><p>\u201cEliza,\u201d he purred, watching her reaction to his uninvited familiarity\u2014the slight dilation of her irises, the unaffected flutter of her lashes, and the quickening tempo of the pulse visible at her throat. \u201cI must confess, I was very much looking forward to our meeting this morning precisely because of what emerges from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Which led to thoughts of what else he liked about that particular feature. Such as the full curve of her bottom lip, and the way it pursed lightly when he goaded her. Even the way it moved when she spoke. The things he wanted to do to that mouth shocked even him. He wanted to feel it move over his skin, whispering lewd taunts and pressing soft kisses. Teasing. Suckling....</p><p>He inhaled sharply, displeased for the first time in his life with the finely honed instincts he\u2019d long relied on to survive. It was one thing to be sexually aware of a woman\u2014something he found quite stimulating and enjoyable. It was quite another to be physically affected by that awareness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare,\u201d he continued, forcing his thoughts back to the business at hand, \u201cfor a client to be so forthcoming. It makes my efforts far more effective when they are.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to the side, causing two curls to sway beside a delicately shaped ear. She seemed prepared to speak, but then she didn\u2019t. Instead, she withdrew a piece of paper from beneath her leather-bound ledger and offered it to him.</p><p>He leaned forward and accepted it, turning it around so he could read what was written. As with her bookkeeping, the columns were neat and tidy, yet the way in which she formed her letters was different. Highly slanted as opposed to straight, elongated at the highs and lows, bleeding at the point of ink refill as if she was too hurried to shake off the excess properly. He mulled this over as he read\u2014the care over numerals versus the carelessness over proper names was telling. The list catalogued her suitors by peerage rank\u2014if applicable\u2014as well as length of suit, age, brief but concise physical descriptions, and anomalous traits such as throat clearing and nose twitching. He would easily be able to put a name to a face with the information she provided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed with the thoroughness of your observation skills,\u201d he praised, looking up at her.</p><p>A ghost of a smile curved her lips, making him realize he had yet to see her smile in truth. \u201cThank you. I came to the conclusion last evening that this would be my final Season. I secured an agreement from my uncle long ago that six Seasons would be all he\u2019d ask of me...but I was undecided about holding him to the promise. He asks so little of me, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He should feel no guilt in enjoying her, then. He would not be ruining her if she was seated firmly on the shelf.</p><p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019ve also decided to utilize your services for the entirety of the six weeks remaining in this Season, Mr. Bond. If you will advise me of the cost of securing your services for that length of time, I\u2019ll see you are paid by the end of the day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jasper leaned back in his chair, considering. There was something about the way she eyed him that set off a quiet alarm. He appreciated being paid for services rendered\u2014as anyone did\u2014but he wondered if more than the balance of her accounts and a wish to absolve a debt was motivating her. He\u2019d dealt with members of the peerage who felt the act of paying him put him in his place. Once he\u2019d accepted money, he was no longer a businessman but a commodity they had rights and power over. In most instances, he cared not at all what clients told themselves to assuage their pride. In this case, he would not allow Eliza to think she could control him with her money.</p><p>\u201cWe have an agreement,\u201d he said, smiling slightly to soften the rigidity of his position on the matter. \u201cA fortnight without pay. If I have satisfied you at that time, you may make restitution then.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of wariness in her blue eyes. Barely there and then gone. \u201cBut I do not intend to replace you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I do not intend to be replaced.\u201d He held the list aloft. \u201cDid you, perchance, put these in order of most suspicious to least likely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She stood and rounded the desk.</p><p>He rose quickly, watching in surprise as she settled into the seat beside him. She leaned over the armrest and gestured for him to sit. \u201cIf you have any questions, I\u2019m most willing to answer them to the best of my ability.\u201d</p><p>As Jasper lowered himself back into the chair, he inhaled the rather exotic scent of her perfume, appreciating how different it was from her modest mode of dress. She was a study in contradictions, from her appearance to her voice to her handwriting. \u201cWhy is the Earl of Montague so near the bottom?\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s head tilted so she could better see where he pointed. It was the closest proximity they\u2019d shared yet, affording him the opportunity to note the smattering of light freckles over the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he be within the \u2018least likely\u2019 section? His lordship is handsome and charming and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperately in debt.\u201d It was by dint of will alone that he managed not to crush the foolscap in his hand. What natural attraction he felt for her was increased by a sense of possessiveness. Damned if Montague would get his hands on Eliza or her money.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know. But so are many of the men on the list. Those who are not in debt are of limited means.\u201d She saw his raised brows and another slight smile curved her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into the circumstances of every gentleman who calls upon me, even the ones whose motives are clear straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not have a bookkeeper, Mr. Bond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d he corrected, yet again.</p><p>Her shoulders went back. \u201cSuch familiarity is inappropriate in business dealings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so.\u201d It appeared he was correct about her wish for distance. \u201cAnd especially not in this instance. You should be more than a little fond of me. I collect that you find it difficult to contemplate, since I am not your type of male, but the use of given names and time spent in my company will help to alleviate any awkwardness you might feel, creating a more believable presentation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said to leave that aspect of the plan to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right. I will lead, you will follow.\u201d He used the tone of voice that never failed to pull others into line. He knew if he gave Eliza the slightest opportunity, she would run roughshod over him. \u201cNow, about how you acquired your information...?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. Clearly she was not a woman used to being managed. Been allowed to run amok, that one, Lynd had said. Jasper wouldn\u2019t change that about her, even if afforded the opportunity, but he also wouldn\u2019t be led around by the nose.</p><p>\u201cI have a man of affairs,\u201d she said, \u201cwho makes discreet inquiries for me as necessary. One cannot be too careful.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper leaned back, settling into a comfortable position to better enjoy the conversation. \u201cAnd what sort of information did you glean from these inquiries? Were you made aware of the full extent of Lord Montague\u2019s debts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough to be wary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why put him in such an elevated position on your list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, he is charming and could certainly secure a better match than me. I think he uses me to make other women jealous. My mother used to say, \u2018there\u2019s nothing so attractive as a man who belongs to another woman.\u2019 Montague may be financially troubled, but few know that. He\u2019s managed to hide it well. And he is handsome enough to cover many faults in some women\u2019s eyes.\u201d Her gaze narrowed, and she raked him from head to toe. \u201cIn fact, you two are similar in height and coloring. Build, too, although he is not nearly as...broad.\u201d</p><p>It took great effort not to tense and betray his unease at her perceptiveness. \u201cAnd yet you claimed others would see me and know straightaway I was not like your other suitors at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have an astonishingly good memory, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cYour sharp recollection is laudable...Jasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Eliza.\u201d He held back a satisfied smile at the tiny bit of progress. \u201cI\u2019ve found the skill quite useful. But I confess, I\u2019m perplexed by your contradictory statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said there were similarities, but they are not overly evident.\u201d She didn\u2019t intend for her perusal to be invigorating, but it most definitely was. \u201cHe is handsome, yes. As are you. But you are flamboyantly so. It\u2019s astonishing really, the way the first sight of you arrests the brain. Whenever I initially catch sight of you, it takes a moment to pull my thoughts together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am gratified you find me appealing.\u201d And relieved that the fraternal similarities she\u2019d noted were so quickly dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cFustian. I\u2019m certain you must be accustomed to all the attention by now. What is it like, by the way? Having people admire you when you enter a room or pass them by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t notice such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am usually intent on whatever purpose I have for being in any given location or situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Eliza nodded. \u201cYes, you are quite focused. Intensely so. It\u2019s another trait distinguishing you.\u201d</p><p>He swiftly utilized the avenue provided by her curiosity. \u201cTomorrow, I intend to take you to the Royal Academy of Art. You can see for yourself how others perceive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn outing?\u201d She frowned. Oddly, he liked that as much as her hint of a smile. Her face was so expressive, it took much of the guesswork out of wondering what was on her mind. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the best way to expose me and lure the culprit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never use you as bait. It\u2019s my intention to become the target instead.\u201d He took care to fold the list neatly. \u201cOver the next several weeks, you and I will be spending a great deal of time together. The more you are seen with me, the bigger a threat I will become.\u201d</p> <p>She watched him tuck the folded paper into a pocket of his waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cIn addition,\u201d he went on, \u201cI will need to meet with your man of affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men do not appreciate having their private matters examined, discreetly or not. And I must ask about your investments and Lord Melville\u2019s activities.\u201d</p><p>Her face took on an appearance of great interest. \u201cYou suspect another motivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. Malicious intent can be incited by many things: love, money, and vengeance are at the top of the list. You are wealthy, others are not. If any of your investments or ventures has caused an individual to feel wronged, there is motive there. If anyone holds ill-will toward Melville, hurting someone close to him could be motive as well.\u201d Jasper held her gaze. \u201cPersonally, I can understand why someone would go to great lengths to win you. But to take it to the point of injury against you...I cannot wait to learn the identity of our mystery assailant. I anticipate that introduction with great relish.\u201d</p><p>Eliza did not appear to be alarmed by his fervent hope for violence. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for your attention to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not accept anything less.\u201d</p><p>She stood, and he stood with her. Her head tilted back to maintain eye contact. \u201cMr. Lynd and the Runner I hired both seemed to think I was daft. It isn\u2019t a pleasant feeling to be treated as mentally inferior. It was a brief glimpse, I suppose, of what Melville bears with terrible frequency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that one of the reasons why you resist marriage? For your uncle\u2019s benefit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s quite capable of caring for himself, at least to the extent that he employs a trustworthy and efficient staff to manage the minutiae he has no patience for.\u201d Her gaze moved to the clock on the mantel. \u201cToday I am at home to callers. Will you be one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it settle your mind if I am?\u201d</p><p>Her head gave a slight shake. \u201cHere at home, I feel safe enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall refrain. I think it will be more effective if I\u2019m not one of the many. Tomorrow will be our first public appearance together, and you will be granting me your undivided attention. That will establish my connection with you in a more prominent way. We\u2019ll require a chaperone who gossips. Do you know of someone who will suffice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it. What do I say to those who ask about you? What reply can I give to inquiries about your people and situation?\u201d</p><p>He breathed in her scent with a deep inhalation, one last delay before revealing a truth no one else knew. \u201cYou may tell them I am the nephew of the late Lord Gresham of County Wexford, and our families are old friends from long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>Jasper knew little of his mother\u2019s relations. Diana Gre-sham had been disowned after her pregnancy became evident, a circumstance affording her no way out of the hell she\u2019d died in. When Jasper tracked Gresham down years later, the only regret he felt at learning of his lordship\u2019s recent passing was that he\u2019d lost the opportunity to repay his uncle in kind.</p><p>\u201cYou are a conundrum, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Eliza said softly. \u201cI should like to figure you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have a question, ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you answer?\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. When he heard her breath catch, his inner predator licked its lips and purred. For all her protests regarding the suitability of his appearance, it was undeniable that it pleased her. \u201cMy past and my future are irrelevant. You have my present. In that, yes, ask away. I will answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would be troublesome, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I believe you will resolve my dilemma, and I find a measure of relief in that.\u201d Rounding the desk, she resumed her seat. Her manner changed, became distant. She opened a drawer and withdrew a small book. \u201cHere is a copy of my social calendar for the remainder of the Season as it stands so far. I will keep a list of future invitations I accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour thoroughness is admirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you and I shall work well together. Is there anything else? Or are we finished for today?\u201d</p><p>He found himself wanting to linger, knowing it was still early in the day and the most interesting part of it would now be behind him. \u201cThese lists are sufficient at present. I\u2019ll need to be apprised of the other matters we discussed\u2014your investments, your man of affairs, and anything in Lord Melville\u2019s past that might put a loved one at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn investment pool managed by Lord Collingsworth and rental properties,\u201d she answered, with her head already bent and quill in hand. \u201cBoth residential and commercial. I can take you to them, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the day after tomorrow be soon enough for a tour and meeting with my man of affairs, Mr. Reynolds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite. I will also need a list of your tenants.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cYour attention to detail is very impressive.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI do try. I will call on you tomorrow at one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Turning about, Jasper moved to leave the room. On the threshold, he looked back, finding a small bit of pleasure in catching Eliza staring after him, despite the frown marring her brow. She looked down quickly.</p><p>When he reached the foyer, he pulled out his pocket watch and was startled by the time. He\u2019d overstayed his visit by nearly ten minutes, making him late for his next appointment.</p><p>Bloody hell. He had completely forgotten the time.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Eliza was compiling the list of property holdings Jasper had requested when her man of affairs was announced. She looked up at the somberly dressed but friendly-faced man in her study doorway, and gestured for him to take a seat before her desk. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent morning, Miss Martin.\u201d Terrance Reynolds sat and placed his satchel at his feet.</p><p>She shook her head at the butler, who\u2019d been waiting to relay a tea service request to the housekeeper. While she knew she should offer the courtesy, she truly didn\u2019t have much to say, and she dreaded the awkwardness that would arise when she couldn\u2019t fill the additional time with conversation. Some women possessed a talent for charming but meaningless discourse. Sadly, she was not one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou will be happy to hear,\u201d Reynolds began, \u201cthat I\u2019ve found a shopkeeper for the vacant space on Peony Way. A purveyor of soaps, candles, and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You are most efficient, Mr. Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She set her quill aside, noting how much more comfortable she was talking to Reynolds than she was to Mr. Bond...Jasper. Yet that wasn\u2019t to say she preferred the comfort of one over the excitement of the other, which made no sense, considering she\u2019d never been one to enjoy excitation overmuch. Her mother\u2019s life had forever been a series of crises and bursts of happiness interspersed with heated arguments and the depths of despair. Eliza had grown so weary of Georgina Tremaine Martin Chilcott\u2019s incessant drama that she\u2019d taken great pains to moderate her own life. She preferred private dinners to lavish balls, and the comfort of laying on her boudoir chaise with a book over literary luncheons. There was nothing at all soothing about Jasper Bond, and she was intrigued by the fact that she missed the heightened awareness she felt in his presence.</p><p>Eliza returned her attention to the man sitting across from her. \u201cYou mentioned last week that your brother\u2019s employer had passed on. Is he still in search of employment?\u201d</p><p>The males in the Reynolds family were all in trade as men of affairs and bookkeepers. She\u2019d been briefly introduced to another of the siblings, Tobias Reynolds, who was possessed of the same golden locks and green-as-glass eyes as Ter-rance. She had henceforth inquired about Tobias on occasion\u2014part of a well-meant but surprisingly arduous attempt to be more personable\u2014and she\u2019d learned of his misfortune in the course of those inquiries.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been assisting our father and other brother,\u201d Reynolds replied, \u201cbut yes, Tobias is without a permanent post at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to engage him, if he\u2019s so inclined. He will have to travel and leave quickly, but the recompense should be sufficient to mitigate such inconveniences.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds frowned. \u201cWhere would you like him to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounty Wexford. There is a person of interest there I would like to know better. Family, circumstances, community stature. Things of that nature.\u201d Eliza ignored the hint of unease that briefly plagued her. Yes, Jasper asserted that his past was irrelevant, and he was not a man one wished to cross. However, she had a right to know if she would be lying on his behalf, or if there was indeed more to her thief-taker than met the eye. \u201cAs always, discretion is the rule, but more so in this instance. I don\u2019t want Lord Gresham to be aware of my interest. And timeliness will be rewarded.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer me to see to it personally?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cNo. I need you here. We\u2019ll be advancing the monthly tour of my properties to the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Miss Martin. I will speak with my brother as soon as I depart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could also ascertain the extent of the allowance he feels will be sufficient to support the endeavor, I will ensure I have the amount available before he departs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d He didn\u2019t query her about the nature of her interest, which was why they worked well together. She did not like to justify her expenses to anyone.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She managed a smile. \u201cThat will be all for now, Mr. Reynolds. I appreciate you, as always.\u201d</p><p>After he left, Eliza glanced at the clock on her desk. Her nose wrinkled. The morning was gone, and the afternoon was rushing by as swiftly. Soon, she would be welcoming guests into her parlor and engaging in conversation so inane she wouldn\u2019t remember later what she discussed.</p><p>She was disappointed Jasper wouldn\u2019t be there. The time would be much more engrossing if he were. When she considered all the amusements used to enliven events that never engaged her\u2014the pianoforte, singing, card games, and chess\u2014she was taken by the realization it was a man best used as a blunt-force instrument who interested her most. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were some days when Eliza actually enjoyed riding through Hyde Park, despite the torturously slow pace of the congestion and the need for endless smiling that pained her cheeks. Today was one of those good days. The soft breeze and gentle warmth of the sun were refreshing, and the need to prepare quick and appropriate responses to greetings kept her thoughts free of Jasper.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be enjoying yourself today, Miss Martin,\u201d the Earl of Montague said from his seat beside her. He\u2019d arrived for their agreed-upon outing in a new and clearly expensive curricle. When he first began pursuing her in earnest, she\u2019d wondered why a peer of seemingly substantial wealth would show such dogged interest in her of all people. Then she learned he maintained the appearance of solvency through prudence\u2014and luck\u2014at the gaming tables. It was a clever ruse and one few bothered to delve into.</p><p>She looked at him with a frown, slightly chagrined by her inability to navigate the social waters without bumping into things. \u201cIs it so obvious that I usually do not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so obvious, no,\u201d he said, while deftly handling the ribbons. He maneuvered through the multitude of conveyances on South Carriage Drive with admirable skill. \u201cBut I\u2019ve taken to paying close attention to you, Miss Martin. And I collect that you have little interest in Society as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo put it bluntly, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Montague grinned, his teeth white despite the shadow cast by the brim of his hat. Of all her suitors, she would say he was the most attractive. His dark hair was so thick and glossy she thought it might feel like silk if she touched it, and his eyes were extremely expressive. Similar in color to Jasper\u2019s, but nowise near as shuttered.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat a woman loses a measure of freedom when she takes a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost vexing, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate your reticence. You see, I\u2019ve come to the delayed understanding that people in general perplex you.\u201d</p> <p>Eliza\u2019s brows rose. \u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize now I was going about this business of courting you all wrong. Most women want wooing\u2014flowers and tokens of affection, focused attention, and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flowers you send weekly are lovely,\u201d she said automatically, although she thought it a shame for such beautiful living things to be cut away from their source of nourishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gratified you think so. But I believe you wouldn\u2019t miss them if I ceased making the gesture. You would not experience hurt feelings or attribute emotional reasons to my actions based on conjecture.\u201d</p><p>He offered a genuine smile, and she stared, seeing a charm in it she\u2019d missed previously. It was an aftereffect of Jasper that she was now overly attentive to other males. She wanted to discern why the thief-taker affected her so strongly.</p><p>\u201cI am sorely inept at interpreting such things,\u201d she agreed, adjusting the angle of her parasol to better shield her face. The slightest touch of sun on her nose would result in more freckles.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you are perfectly reasoned,\u201d his lordship argued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I erred. I was pandering to your softer nature, when I should have been appealing to your intellect. Therefore, I will not insult your intelligence any further. I\u2019m in need of your fortune, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, she shifted on the seat to better study him. \u201cA novel approach, I must say. Quite bold.\u201d</p><p>His grin held shades of triumph. \u201cAnd you like it. For the first time in our acquaintance, I feel as if I have your attention in its entirety.\u201d</p><p>Montague paused to tip his hat to Lord and Lady Grayson as they passed. When he looked back at Eliza, there was a new gleam in his eye, reminiscent of the way Jasper looked at her. It lacked the ability to make her breath catch, but she recognized it for what it was\u2014the earl was suddenly more intrigued by her as well.</p><p>\u201cThe best approach to you is so obvious,\u201d the earl continued, \u201cthat I\u2019m quite put out by my failure to see it before. Whether or not I have elevated feelings for you isn\u2019t of enough value to you to equal what you believe you will lose. In the simplest of terms, I haven\u2019t shown you that I am a good investment.\u201d</p><p>Captured by the uniqueness of the conversation, Eliza wished they were not in public so she could fully enjoy the surprise without interruption. \u201cPlease, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst and foremost, the Montague lands are vast and with proper care would yield a tidy return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the estate supporting you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father suffered from a loose hand with coin, an untrustworthy steward, and a greedy mistress. I assure you, however, I am not my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but you are a gamester, my lord. You have managed to do well enough with your winnings.\u201d She gestured at his fashionable equipage. \u201cBut luck at the tables is a fickle thing, and certainly you would eventually contract mistresses of your own. Perhaps you will become smitten by a paramour who is also afflicted with avarice. I would not take kindly to destitution due to gambling or the waste of my funds on another woman who was enjoying the companionship of my husband. I expect to own the things I pay for, and I rarely lend them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so,\u201d he said softly, with another warm glance in her direction. \u201cYou know, Miss Martin, the more I know of you, the more taken I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I find myself enjoying your company as well. But forgive me, my lord, I have no desire to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other benefits.\u201d Outwardly, nothing changed, but Eliza sensed a new weight of expectation, as if he were debating whether or not to continue with his thought. \u201cAside from financial considerations, there are other ways in which a man and his wife reach an accord. I want to assure you, you would not find married life to be distasteful. I\u2019ve no wish for disharmony in my home. I would make every effort to see that you were satisfied in sharing your life with me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was perplexed by his statement. Did they not have an accord now? Then she recalled the conversation she\u2019d had with Melville and Jasper about the things women wanted from men. Which led her to thinking about the things a peer would want from a woman....</p><p>\u201cAre you referring to procreation, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Montague visibly jolted. Staring straight ahead, he seemed unable to respond. And then he laughed. It was a full, open-throated sound that drew stares from every quarter. \u201cNo wonder you find the usual discourse less than interesting. Speaking one\u2019s mind is much more stimulating.\u201d</p><p>Eliza opened her mouth to reply, then shut it again as her attention was snared by a familiar shade of blue velvet. Montague\u2019s carriage continued to move forward, but Eliza\u2019s eyes remained riveted to Jasper, who sat astride a black steed just off the Row, watching her with the fiercely intense stare that set butterflies to flight in her stomach. Her response was so strong, it was unnerving. Her palms grew damp, conveying a heat that had nothing to do with the weather. It was rather like spotting a crouched panther in the brush, its rapacious gaze following the prey it intended to pounce upon at any moment.</p><p>Without conscious prompting, she straightened in her seat and her hand lifted to the brim of her simple straw hat.</p><p>Jasper was such a compelling figure, even the dappled light afforded by an overhanging tree could not diminish his vibrancy. A thrill of awareness moved through her, as did a strong appreciation for the sight of him. How long had he been there? She could have sworn he hadn\u2019t been under that tree mere seconds before.</p><p>The earl spoke, drawing her thoughts back to him.</p><p>She tore her gaze from Jasper. \u201cI beg your pardon, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWed me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI will give you things you don\u2019t yet know you want. I understand you, Miss Martin. We are different in all the best ways. A collaboration between us would be to the advantage of us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a better idea. I will find you a more suitable candidate.\u201d</p><p>Montague\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cYou intend to play matchmaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion.\u201d Eliza was keenly aware of Jasper\u2019s gaze following her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin, I want to be clear about my intentions. I\u2019ve decided you will suit me best of all. I will not be easily dissuaded from my aim of proving I can complement you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d She sighed. \u201cPlease do not make a nuisance of yourself in the effort, Lord Montague. You\u2019ve always been one of the more agreeable of my suitors. I should like you to stay that way, if possible.\u201d</p><p>Montague laughed again and looked at her with sparkling eyes. \u201cYou are a delightful surprise. I wish I\u2019d been wiser earlier in the Season.\u201d</p><p>Eliza looked behind her to where Jasper had been.</p><p>He was gone, leaving behind a marked absence.</p><p>As Jasper urged his mount away from South Carriage Drive toward the adjacent Rotten Row, the member of his crew assigned to watching Eliza also turned with him.</p><p>\u201cShe has an eye for you,\u201d Aaron White said, gesturing at another crew member further up the Drive who would continue surveillance.</p><p>Jasper nodded. He had come without thought. It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d caught sight of Eliza that he realized why. A vague notion had played in his mind\u2014a budding desire to see her glorious hair in sunlight\u2014and somehow it led him here. Ridiculously sentimental. Completely out of character. Her time in his schedule had passed, and he had other matters to attend to.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Aaron continued, \u201cyou made certain she saw you.\u201d</p><p>Jasper could shine in a crowd or hide among it in the space of a breath merely by making miniscule changes in his deportment and posture. He\u2019d been an unnoticed observer until Montague said something to Eliza that snared her attention completely. Jasper had wanted to steal her regard, and he\u2019d done so. \u201cIt\u2019s best that she not seem too taken with any of her other suitors. Defeats the effectiveness of my plan to secure her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your pronounced interest in her has nothing to do with it,\u201d Aaron teased, holding his reins loosely in one hand while the other rested atop his thigh. He was a young lad, short and stocky, a hard worker with three small mouths to feed. For that reason, Jasper kept him away from the more hazardous assignments. Watching out for Eliza was perfect.</p><p>\u201cHer attractiveness makes the job more agreeable.\u201d That was all Jasper intended to say on the matter.</p><p>Aaron\u2019s gaze followed Montague. \u201cThe earl appears to agree. He seems genuinely taken with her.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Montague\u2019s recent laughter lingered in Jasper\u2019s mind, and his gloved grip tightened on his reins. \u201cShe would be miserable with him. He cares for nothing so much as his own self-interest. I\u2019m doing her a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of looking at the ruination of a proper society miss.\u201d There was amusement in Aaron\u2019s tone, which was understandable considering Jasper\u2019s rule against dallying with ladies of quality. It was a rule he was clearly intent on breaking.</p><p>\u201cI am not ruining her. She decided long ago she would never wed, and she reiterated that intention to me only hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll show her the joys of shagging, so she doesn\u2019t die ignorant? Another favor? By God, Bond, you\u2019re damn near saintly in your generosity.\u201d</p><p>Jasper shot the younger man a fulminating glare.</p><p>Aaron raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re a shrewd businessman above all. Makes me right curious as to why you plan to stop short of the big prize. Since you\u2019re taking her to bed, why not also take her to wife? Add her fortune to the other benefits of the association.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanting and wedding are two very different things. She would be equally miserable with me. I\u2019ve no notion of how to keep a woman happy outside of the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her out of bed. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely a suggestion.\u201d Aaron grinned. \u201cNot sure why I mentioned it, considering I benefit from your remaining just as you are now. If you became obscenely wealthy, you wouldn\u2019t work so hard, and I would have fewer opportunities to earn my wages.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s gaze followed Eliza until Montague\u2019s equipage was lost in the crowd. Out of sight, out of mind. He hoped. He withdrew his pocket watch and checked the time. Eliza would return home shortly and begin preparations for the evening.</p><p>How would she appear when dressed formally? Not that she would put any effort into it, which he found refreshing. Some women spent excessive amounts of time on their exteriors. Eliza\u2019s most attractive qualities weren\u2019t the most obvious ones. The hints of stronger passions were so subtle, even she was not aware of them. She was of the introspective sort, quietly curious and sharply intelligent.</p><p>Jasper, by contrast, preferred a more hectic pace of living. He kept his hours filled from the time he awoke until he couldn\u2019t fight sleep a moment longer. Such preoccupation afforded less time to ruminate on the thorn wedged in his side. Eliza both helped and hindered in that regard. When he was with her, he was so mindful of her there was no room for awareness of anything else. And that was a problem. He could not afford to lose his focus now. Not when he was so close to achieving his aims.</p><p>He growled and tugged his hat lower on his brow, hating to be in public while so disconcerted. Over a spinster who thought he was too handsome and too dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI shall leave Miss Martin in your capable hands,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou might consider occupying your hands with a visit to the upper floor of Remington\u2019s,\u201d Aaron suggested. \u201cTo take the edge off.\u201d</p><p>The prod to partake in the more carnal offerings at his favorite gentlemen\u2019s club came from keen observation. Although Aaron\u2019s observant nature was one of the reasons why Jasper had employed him, it was damned inconvenient when aimed in his direction. \u201cWatch her. Not me.\u201d</p><p>He turned about in search of another familiar figure. As luck would have it, he didn\u2019t have far to look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gentleman Jasper sought was en route to him, weaving through the many riders with one hand lifted to his hat brim in perpetual greeting. Gabriel Ashford, ninth Earl of Westfield, was a gazetted rake of prominent family and fortune, which ensured that an inordinate number of female stares were directed his way. Although his exploits were known to include nearly every vice, there were no signs of dissipation marring the features that incited some women to swoon. He looked fit and lean, and his easy smile was on full display.</p><p>As Westfield drew near, his countenance changed subtly. The fa\u00e7ade he wore so well slipped a little, revealing the true man beneath. A good and kind man whom Jasper had taken into his confidence. A gentleman he considered a friend.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Bond.\u201d</p><p>Jasper tipped his hat. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw you eyeing Montague.\u201d Westfield drew abreast of Jasper\u2019s mount. \u201cAre you worried he\u2019ll get his hands on Miss Martin\u2019s fortune and settle his debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was Miss Martin who held my interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I failed to collect that elusive bluestockings were to your taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaying clients are always to my taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Westfield\u2019s brows rose. \u201cWhy does Miss Martin require your services?\u201d</p> <p>Jasper spurred his horse into motion. The earl followed suit.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of her and her kin?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Tremaine brood is unquestionably an odd lot, which makes them fiendishly easy to gossip about. The males are known to be brilliant to the point of madness, and the females are blessed with that stunningly beautiful shade of hair. Miss Martin seems to have inherited a bit of both traits in addition to her sizeable fortune. As for her parents, Mr. Martin was a man of trade and Lady Georgina was known to be charming and vivacious. Although Miss Martin seems as indifferent to men as her mother was appreciative, I\u2019ve wondered if a deeper resemblance between them is simply untapped. Intriguing to contemplate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying her mother was indiscriminate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Georgina was known to have a fondness for the social company of men. Does that mean she took many to her bed?\u201d Westfield shrugged. \u201cI cannot say. However, she married Martin immediately following her presentation. She would have had her pick of peers, but instead jumped into matrimony with a commoner. Why, unless it was a love match? And if it was a love match, I doubt she would stray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of Mr. Martin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know his death was shocking to many. He was said to have a vigorous constitution. He was built like a laborer and often pitched in as one when the opportunity presented itself. A servant found him dead in his office when he failed to appear for supper. A weak heart was blamed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper decided he would have to dig further back, before Eliza\u2019s present-day suitors, to see if the trouble plaguing her had begun long before now.</p><p>Westfield inclined his head at a passing acquaintance. \u201cMany have speculated that the vagaries of the family he married into might have hastened him to his grave. His due, so to speak, for his lofty marital aspirations. After his passing, Lady Georgina married again, to another commoner.\u201d</p><p>A woman of high passions and a lack of prejudice. Did Eliza carry those inclinations? How delicious if she did...</p><p>Jasper shook off the tangential thought. \u201cMiss Martin has a stepfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad. Lady Georgina and Mr. Chilcott were killed together in a carriage accident before Miss Martin\u2019s first Season. The poor girl has been sorely afflicted with tragedy.\u201d</p><p>Did she grieve? Jasper wondered. Had she always been so detached from others or was that a recently acquired safety mechanism?</p><p>\u201cNow tell me,\u201d the earl said, \u201cwhat has Miss Martin engaged you to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has cause to fear for her safety.\u201d</p><p>Westfield\u2019s brows rose. \u201cTruly? Who would want to injure her? She\u2019s worth more alive than dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe believes someone\u2014perhaps an overzealous suitor\u2014 is trying to goad her into marriage as a means of protecting herself. I haven\u2019t yet decided if she\u2019s correct, but hearing about her parents\u2019 untimely demise only incites further concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow diverting,\u201d the earl said. \u201cCan I assist you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would ask.\u201d Jasper reached into his pocket and withdrew the small book containing Eliza\u2019s social calendar. It was an unavoidable fact that there were some doors he needed a peer to open. \u201cI must attend as many of these functions as possible.\u201d</p><p>The earl flipped through the small bound pages with one hand. \u201cI see I will have to refrain from arranging a liaison tomorrow evening, so I can squire you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your sacrifice,\u201d Jasper drawled.</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d Westfield\u2019s tone was droll. In truth, he enjoyed participating in Jasper\u2019s work when the circumstances allowed. He was even known to become somewhat of a pest, if Jasper went too long without enlisting him for some task or another. \u201cSee you at ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Eliza had just pulled on a dressing gown and settled in front of her vanity mirror when a knock came to her boudoir door. When bade to enter, a white-capped maid stepped in and curtsied. \u201cHis lordship asks for you, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Eliza watched the servant back out of the room. She\u2019d enjoyed tea with her uncle just an hour before, listening fondly as he spoke at length and with great animation about his latest botanical experiments. Once, their solarium had been filled with comfortable chaises and short bookcases. Now, it housed rows of long tables supporting various potted plants. Eliza didn\u2019t mind the loss of her former favorite reading spot, appreciating how the experiments in the glass space exposed his lordship to sunlight and fresh air.</p><p>What would cause him to ask for her now, at an hour when she was beginning preparations for the evening\u2019s social events? Perhaps he had an epiphany of some sort or something of a celebratory nature to share? He once woke her before sunrise because a splicing experiment yielded unexpectedly delightful results.</p><p>She stood and pulled a comfortable house gown out of the wardrobe. Then she called for her abigail, Mary, who entered the room from the bathing chamber and assisted Eliza in securing the row of buttons following the length of her spine. Despite skipping her chemise and stays, it took long moments to become presentable. Eliza tied a quick ribbon around her unbound hair and considered herself ready enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you wear tonight?\u201d Mary asked.</p><p>\u201cLay out three of your favorites.\u201d Eliza opened the door to the gallery. \u201cI\u2019ll pick one when I return.\u201d</p><p>She often left the selection of clothing to her abigail. It didn\u2019t matter what Mary chose\u2014Eliza always picked the gown on the farthest right. Her dresses were all impeccable, if unremarkable, having been created by a seamstress who was in high demand for her skill. The modiste had originally protested Eliza\u2019s selection of colors that, while fashionable, did little to emphasize the hue of her hair. But eventually the hopelessness of the objections became patently clear, and Eliza was spared from hearing them. She felt it was only fair to avoid giving anyone the notion she was attempting to entice or set a lure. Since the most popular shades were pastels and she looked best in darker colors, there was no excuse for her to dress with self-flattery in mind.</p><p>She left the room and headed directly to the family parlor on the same floor. The door was ajar. A fire crackled merrily in the grate, and his lordship paced before it in his usual state of dishabille\u2014mussed hair, lopsided cravat, and unevenly buttoned waistcoat sans coat.</p><p>Eliza entered with a brisk stride. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>He faced her with a distracted smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you, my dear, but you have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her hastily composed presentation. \u201cA visitor? Downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s voice. A shiver coursed down her spine at the sound. Pivoting, she found him standing behind the door. His gaze was narrowed, his face austere. He was dressed in the same riding garments he had been wearing when she\u2019d seen him in the park, but his cravat was less crisp and the outside of his boots bore traces of scuffing.</p><p>As they did every time she saw him, her thoughts skidded to a halt. It took her the length of several heartbeats to remember to speak.</p><p>There was no hiding the way her breath hitched when she greeted him. \u201cMr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself as promised, young man,\u201d Melville said, before hurrying from the room. Clearly, he was eager to return to whatever he\u2019d been doing before being interrupted. The door was left open, but Eliza doubted such measures would impede a man like Jasper if he was of a mind to act scandalously.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word, my lord,\u201d Jasper said softly.</p><p>There was a pregnant pause after the earl departed. Jasper raked her with a heated gaze, from top to toe and back again. Then he averted his head, exposing a clenched jaw and rapid pulse. Eliza realized he was aware she\u2019d skipped undergarments in her haste. He knew she was unbound and unfettered.</p><p>And it was adversely affecting him.</p><p>His reaction to her was creating a corresponding reaction to him. The tempo of her heartbeat increased.</p><p>Eliza covered her discomposure by moving to the settee and sitting. Smoothing her floral skirts with restless hands, she looked at Jasper\u2019s savagely masculine profile and said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cI apologize for not being more presentable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I accept an apology\u201d\u2014his gaze slowly returned to her face\u2014\u201cfor something that brings me such pleasure?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, hating that her mouth was so dry. His eyes followed the working of her throat. A thick, hot current of awareness flowed through her. It was difficult to see him there in the private room where only family and close friends gathered. An intimacy was established by his presence. She felt exposed without the stricture of her stays. Vulnerable in a way she\u2019d never known before.</p><p>Forcing her hands to be still, she said, \u201cI saw you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t confess that she\u2019d been smitten by the sight of him in his rakishly angled hat.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou should be cautious around Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely doubt he is the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is an intelligent man. He must be aware of more productive ways to win my hand. In fact, he said as much to me today. He believes he understands me now and presented himself as a sound investment. He\u2019s come to the conclusion that appealing to my reason is far more likely to yield the results he hopes for than attempting to engage my emotions.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s chest lifted and fell deeply. \u201cThe man gambles obsessively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who lose to him do so by their own choice. His skill is widely lauded. They know what they risk by playing against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to this point,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI considered you remarkably reasoned.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cYou are provoking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being frank.\u201d He approached, but his gait lacked the seductiveness she\u2019d come to anticipate. Instead, it was determined. \u201cIs Montague your favorite of your suitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy his lordship\u2019s company,\u201d she answered carefully. \u201cHowever, I enjoy most every gentleman who comes calling. I would avoid anyone whose companionship I didn\u2019t find agreeable. In fact, I warned Lord Montague this afternoon to be careful not to become troublesome.\u201d</p><p>He paused on the opposite side of the low table. \u201cWhat would prompt you to make such a statement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has become impatient to wed and claims he is determined to have me. His approach\u2014while unique\u2014did not sway me, but I seem to have become something of a curiosity to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Quality is ever in pursuit of relief from boredom. After all, it\u2019s so tedious to be blessed with the wherewithal to do anything one desires.\u201d</p><p>There was an undertone to his words that set Eliza on alert. Jasper wasn\u2019t simply voicing an offhand observation.</p><p>Exhaling harshly, he altered direction toward the grate, his boots thudding softly across the well-worn rug. Resting a forearm on the mantel, he stared into the glowing coals. His dark hair gleamed with vitality. The strands sweeping forward to frame his temples and brow were uniquely appealing despite the popularity of the style. Burnished by firelight, Eliza found the lines of his large body to be magnificent. He was exceedingly male, like a glass filled overfull. She wondered how women managed a sip without spilling all over themselves.</p><p>Not a poetic thought and definitely an unseemly one, but she chose not to delude herself. She was attracted to him. His mere presence made her highly conscious of her own femininity.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked, twisting to face his back.</p><p>There was a long hesitation, then he said, \u201cYour father\u2019s death. Did it come as a surprise to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Eliza\u2019s fingers linked together in her lap.</p><p>Jasper looked at her over his shoulder. \u201cYou answered too swiftly. I need you to be honest with me, if I\u2019m to succeed.\u201d</p><p>The way he stared at her gave her pause.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she amended. \u201cI was surprised and not. I knew he was unwell, but I believed he had an affliction of the mind. Not the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffliction of the mind, you say? Was he lacking reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t mad. Although I sometimes thought my mother was determined to drive him to it.\u201d</p><p>He focused more intently on her. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was unhappy, which contributed to an excessive fondness for strong spirits, but I did not collect how sick he\u2019d become until it was too late. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost both of your parents too early. I must be certain their fate isn\u2019t linked to your present situation in some way. Are you quite confident your father\u2019s death was natural in cause?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was expected,\u201d she qualified. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it natural. As you said, he died before his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother\u2019s death? Are you confident it was an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only surprise about her demise was how long it took to happen,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cEliza...\u201d Jasper came to sit beside her.</p> <p>The air around her became charged with his energy.</p><p>I never feel so alive as I do when I am the object of a man\u2019s desire, her mother had said, while spinning like a giddy girl with her skirts held in each hand. The blood sings, Eliza. The heart races. It is the most glorious feeling in the world.</p><p>Why did Jasper have to be the man to awaken such reactions in her? Why did he have to prove, just by breathing, that she wasn\u2019t immune to needing someone after all? She was so disappointed to realize there were indeed some shades of pleasure that could be colored only by another hand.</p><p>His dark eyes were warm with concern. \u201cPlease understand, I only wish to be thorough. Your safety is of the utmost importance to me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, believing the sincerity in his tone. A lock of her hair was dislodged by the movement, slipping free of her hastily tied ribbon to slide over her shoulder.</p> <p>He stood. Holding out a hand, he assisted her to her feet. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>As Eliza pivoted, she disturbed the air, allowing the primitive scent that clung to him\u2014horses and leather, tobacco and bergamot\u2014to tease her senses. She jumped slightly at the feel of his fingers against her nape. Awareness of him swept outward, flowing across her skin like warm water. He lifted the curl from her shoulder and rubbed it between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cLike fine silk,\u201d he murmured. He loosened the ribbon securing her hair, returned the errant lock to its former place, and retied the whole more securely.</p><p>Her gaze darted around the room, hyperaware of her surroundings. Everything was rendered in brilliant clarity, from the crystals hanging from the many ornate candlesticks to the inlaid mother-of-pearl glimmering from the tops of the end tables.</p><p>In the swirling confusion, she grasped the first thought that came to her. \u201cAre you one of those gentlemen who has an unusually strong interest in red hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an unusually strong interest in you.\u201d He pressed his lips to the bare skin between her shoulder and throat.</p> <p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she whispered, shocked by the violent quiver that moved through her. \u201cWhat are you doing? Why did you come now...tonight...when I\u2019ll be seeing you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>His hands fell to his sides. \u201cI saw the way you looked at Montague. What he said made you see him in a way you haven\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>Eliza faced him. He was more than a head taller, but his frame curved toward her in a way that made their proximity searingly intimate. As if he was about to twirl her into a waltz.</p><p>Her heart beat a little faster. Her breathing quickened. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and tilted her face upward. \u201cYou looked at him the way you look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Montague incited none of this turmoil.</p><p>\u201cI need you to regard me in the same manner with which I regard you.\u201d</p><p>She was arrested by the way he looked her over. So intent. With a gaze that was fierce. Fervent. His fingertips followed the path of his perusal. Touching her forehead. Tracing her brows. Following the bridge of her nose.</p> <p>Eliza, in turn, studied him unabashedly. His features were so perfectly formed, beautiful in their symmetry but masculine in their lines. It was such a pleasure to look upon him; he made her want to stare.</p><p>\u201cHow do I regard you now?\u201d she queried breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cToo aware. Trying to reason your way out of this attraction. Stop thinking,\u201d he murmured. Tilting his head, he lowered his mouth toward hers. The approach was slow and deliberate. His grip was loose and without force. \u201cLet yourself feel it.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled back, panting because she couldn\u2019t breathe when he was so close.</p><p>Jasper watched her retreat with hooded eyes. She was nearly beyond arm\u2019s reach when he growled and caught her back. His lips sealed over hers with a boldness that stole what was left of her air. With one hand at her nape and an arm around her waist, Jasper took her mouth as if he owned it. Undeniably skilled and...hungry. A slanting, suckling, ferocious possession that stunned her completely.</p><p>Eliza sagged into him, unable to comprehend the ardor with which he kissed her. His body was astonishingly hard, like warm marble. From shoulder to thigh, he pressed unyieldingly against her. Without the barrier of her stays the sensation was...Dear God, she couldn\u2019t describe the need she had to touch more of him. Her hands clenched and released at her sides, reaching for him, then falling away.</p><p>Where should\u2014could\u2014she touch him?</p><p>As if he understood, Jasper\u2019s hand at her nape followed the length of her arm down to her wrist. His fingers circled it, then lifted her hand to his chest. Between his coat and waistcoat he urged her palm to splay over his heart. His skin burned through the layers of clothing between them. His heartbeat raced with the same recklessness as hers.</p><p>Her other hand clenched the hem of his coat. She whimpered, overwhelmed.</p><p>Her capitulation gentled him. The press of his lips softened and his grip slackened enough to allow her lungs to expand. Teasing rather than taking, Jasper licked the lower curve of her lip, goading her to taste him back. She did, trembling, uncertain.</p><p>At the first flick of her tongue, he captured it with soft suction. Startled, Eliza jerked in his arms, her breasts flattening against his chest. His groan vibrated against her, tumbling across sensitized nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>The clock on the mantel began to chime on the half hour, but Eliza was lost to time, focused instead on the luxuriant licks stroking deep into her mouth. Her hand moved across Jasper\u2019s torso, feeling the muscles tense beneath her touch. A sound escaped her, a soft plea.</p><p>Jasper lifted his head, breathing hard. With heavy-lidded eyes, he studied her face.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cis how you should look at me, the way you look at no one else. As if you long for me to finish what I\u2019ve started. As if you ache to feel my mouth on you, my hands on you.\u201d</p><p>She did ache. And felt unappeased, as if she had an un-quenched thirst. Her skin was too sensitive. Her fingers trembled. She was far too hot.</p><p>He stepped back and turned away in a motion as elegant as it was powerful. She couldn\u2019t help but follow him with her gaze. He was such a large and finely built man, yet he moved with such grace.</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d Her pulse leaped at the look he shot her. \u201cTomorrow night...I will save the first waltz for you.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to say that. In retrospect, she wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d had anything to say at all. She simply felt the unaccountable urge to stay him and keep him just a little while longer. And she wanted to dance with him, to stand within the circle of his arms in a place where there was safety in numbers.</p><p>He returned. Reaching for her hand, he lifted it and pressed a kiss to the back, giving her fingers a squeeze that only added to the tingling his lips had evoked. \u201cI\u2019m not well versed in dancing. Let me rephrase: I do not know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Eliza was astonished by the pronouncement and the lack of education it implied. But he comported himself without fault and was well-spoken.</p><p>It would be weeks before Tobias Reynolds returned. How would she bear the wondering about his origins until then?</p><p>Jasper\u2019s smile chased her ruminations away and curled her toes. \u201cI shall endeavor to please you in other ways. Be assured, I will not rest until you\u2019re completely satisfied. Until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He departed the room. It was several minutes later before Eliza felt steady enough to do the same.</p><p>It was a beautiful afternoon. A brief spate of rain before the sun rose had cleared the worst of the soot from the air, leaving behind a pale blue sky. It was the kind of day that lightened moods and increased the proliferation of smiles.</p><p>But Eliza was nervous.</p><p>It was a rarity for her to feel out of sorts. There were very few things that affected her mood in a negative way, because reason so often provided the answers required to accept any given situation. But physical attraction had no reason. It was instinctual and separate from the mind. And she wasn\u2019t immune to it, as she\u2019d hoped she would be.</p><p>What was she to say to Jasper, who was waiting in the parlor to escort her about town for the day? She sighed and turned away from the cheval mirror. Perhaps it would be best to leave the opening of discussion to him. A man such as Jasper Bond must be familiar with such circumstances.</p><p>She descended to the ground-level floor with studiously controlled speed, her hand coasting along the top of the wooden handrail to support less than steady steps. She was still chastising herself for deliberately selecting a pale yellow gown, one of the few pastel colors that suited her. It hadn\u2019t been laid out on the far right. What did she hope to gain by encouraging Jasper\u2019s interest?</p><p>On the other hand, what did she have to lose?</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond,\u201d she said as she entered the parlor, steeling herself for the sight of him and finding the effort ineffective. When her brain stopped, her feet followed suit by abruptly halting their forward movement. She stumbled.</p><p>In the process of standing, Jasper was agile enough to lunge forward and catch her by the elbows. He steadied her with a frown. \u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She pulled free and stepped back, needing some distance to catch her breath.</p><p>How dangerously handsome he was. The fine cut and quality of his dark green velvet coat and the beautiful silver-threaded embroidery in his pale green waistcoat enticed the eye to linger and admire. His fawn-colored breeches hugged powerful horseman\u2019s thighs, a sight that made her feel things she oughtn\u2019t. But that was merely the packaging. It was the man inside the trappings who so appealed to her. The magnetism he exuded. The sense that at any moment something extraordinary would happen. The phantom tingling of her lips that brought heated reminiscences of his kiss to mind.</p><p>She looked away, seeking the clock to distract herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d She startled herself by feeling...pleased by that.</p><p>\u201cYou wreak havoc on a man\u2019s schedule,\u201d he said with a slight smile to soften the sting.</p><p>The tiny warmth in her chest blossomed.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely, Eliza.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cI wanted a few moments of your time before I\u2019m restrained by decorum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be restrained by me, young man.\u201d</p><p>Eliza turned as Regina, Lady Collingsworth, entered the room like a whirlwind. She was a guinea-blond matron with piercing blue eyes and cherry-red cheeks. A sweet and pleasant woman for the most part, she was capable of a great force of will, and she took in Jasper\u2019s appearance with a steely glance.</p><p>Wagging a closed fan at him, she said, \u201cYou are a pretty fellow, Mr. Bond. Accustomed to testing your boundaries and finding little resistance, I bet. But I will not tolerate such nonsense. You\u2019ll behave yourself. If you want the right to be naughty, you will have to provide more than charm and a smile.\u201d</p><p>The top of her ladyship\u2019s head barely reached Jasper\u2019s shoulder, but there was no doubt she could manage him.</p><p>Eliza quickly introduced them. \u201cHer ladyship and her son, Lord Collingsworth, will be escorting us today.\u201d</p><p>Jasper sketched a faultlessly elegant bow. \u201cA pleasure, Lady Collingsworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us see if you feel the same by the end of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>In short order they were on their way, comfortably seated in Lord Collingsworth\u2019s barouche with the men on one side, and Eliza and Regina on the other. Eliza studied the two gentlemen from beneath the shade of her wide-brimmed hat, attempting to resolve in her mind why she should be so attracted to one man above all others. Was it because Jasper seemed to be equally attracted to her? If so, perhaps the simplest solution was to discuss it with him and see if he wouldn\u2019t be willing to be less overt. He\u2019d given no serious indication that he was doing anything more than being very, very thorough about his work. And she knew she wasn\u2019t the sort of female who incited raging passions in men.</p><p>The thought had a depressive effect on her sprits.</p><p>Determined to be less maudlin, she moved her attention to Lord Collingsworth. The epitome of aristocratic excellence, his lordship was tall and slender with stern lips and an aquiline nose. His hair was as light as his mother\u2019s, but he lacked her liveliness. Collingsworth had lost both wife and unborn child a year ago, and the light of joy that once filled him had died along with them. His grief was reflected in the somberness of his clothing and the rarity of his smiles. Eliza was still trying to comprehend why the things that brought him happiness before his marriage were no longer capable of doing so now. Yes, he\u2019d lost what Lady Collingsworth had brought to him, but surely he retained the interests he\u2019d had as a bachelor?</p><p>Clearly, she was missing something required to reason out the answer. She was becoming resigned to the notion that she would never be capable of understanding romantic natures.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s boot tapped against the side of her foot. She met his gaze with raised brows.</p><p>Look at me, he mouthed with darkened eyes.</p><p>Did he not understand how difficult that was? Of course he didn\u2019t. He did not feel overheated and confused when he looked at her. He didn\u2019t struggle to understand why the act of pressing their lips together had created overwhelming feelings in other parts of the anatomy.</p><p>Frustrated, she crossed her arms and looked at the passing carriages.</p><p>The toe of his boot touched her ankle, then slid up along the back of her lower calf.</p><p>Eliza froze. Her lungs seized, holding her breath. A shiver moved up her leg to unmentionable places. Wide-eyed, she glanced at him.</p><p>Jasper winked. As indignation welled up within her, his tongue traced the curve of his lower lip in a slow, sensual glide. Her breath left her in a rush. Instantly and viscerally she recalled the feel of that talented tongue against her lips and in her mouth, thrusting deep and sure in imitation of a far more intimate act. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breasts grew heavy and tender. The beat of her heart quickened and her skin tingled from her head to the place where his boot stroked her. It suddenly struck her that Jasper was deliberately arousing her. In the middle of the day. In the center of town. Seated inches away from two other people.</p><p>His hand lifted to an unsecured button on his coat. Strong fingers grasped it, the pad of his thumb rubbing leisurely against the outer curve. She watched, mesmerized, imagining him touching her skin that way. On the curve of her shoulder, perhaps. Or somewhere else.</p><p>He would know the best place to focus that caress.</p><p>The thought of his skill thrilled her.</p> <p>Her face heated. She shifted restlessly on the squab, hoping to find a more comfortable position and worsening her predicament instead. She clutched her throat, rubbing it to facilitate her breathing. She felt as if she might pant, as if her stays were too tight and she might soon become dizzy.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s gaze settled on her gently heaving breasts. She knew she should look away and collect herself, but she could not. Her brain writhed in dismay, horrified that her body would so completely fail to function properly for no other reason than that Jasper Bond was undressing her in his mind. She knew he was remembering her as she\u2019d been last night. Partially dressed. Easily bared.</p><p>The barouche slowed to a stop.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Lady Collingsworth said with customary cheerfulness.</p><p>Jasper broke the connection first, his head turning toward Somerset House. Eliza looked down, watching as his foot withdrew from beneath her skirts.</p> <p>How she made the journey from the carriage to the interior of the edifice was a mystery to her. By the time she recovered the full use of her mental and physical faculties, they were entering the Exhibition Hall. Light poured into the large room from the arched windows high above the hall floor. The walls were covered in paintings, the gilded frames butting against each other, occupying every tiny bit of space.</p><p>As they neared the center of the room, Jasper slowed their progress to a standstill. Eliza looked at him, surprised to find him staring raptly at the images before him. His head was tilted back to the point that the rear of his hat brim nearly touched his back.</p><p>Eliza took stock of the room\u2019s other occupants, noting that the nearest individual was a few feet away. She leaned nearer to Jasper and whispered his name.</p><p>\u201cHmm...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember saying you would answer any question I asked, so long as it pertained to the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He did not cease his enthralled perusal of the art. \u201cAsk me anything.\u201d</p> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDo you...want to...mate with me?\u201d</p><p>He jolted so violently, the reaction shook her, too. His wide-eyed gaze darted to hers. \u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not see why you should look so astonished,\u201d she said, \u201cafter kissing me last night, and considering your actions during the ride here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze warmed. A smile curved his lips. He relaxed, focusing completely on her. \u201cForgive me. Your choice of wording combined with our location took me aback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have to discuss such things with you,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI apologize if I say things incorrectly. But I must know if you can refrain from provoking me. Does the thoroughness of our presentation have to be established with the tactics you\u2019ve utilized thus far or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014or do I indeed want to mate with you?\u201d Jasper\u2019s smile widened. \u201cIs that what you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Eliza nodded briskly, feeling anxious even though her question was perfectly sound considering their circumstances.</p><p>He squeezed her hand where it rested on his forearm. \u201cYou are wondering if I\u2019m manipulating the performance I want out of you, or if my blood is so hot for you I cannot bear for you not to feel similarly?\u201d</p> <p>She averted her gaze. Described in that way, her query sounded ridiculous. Jasper was a dazzlingly handsome man. Even now, as she looked around the room to avoid his stare, she found a number of women ogling him or casting surreptitious glances in his direction at regular intervals. He could have any woman he wanted. One who was charming and flirtatious. Knowledgeable.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Eliza turned her attention to the man who intruded on their conversation. \u201cSir Richard,\u201d she managed. \u201cHow lovely to see you here.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard Tolliver was an average man, neither young nor old, neither tall nor short, neither portly nor lean. His hair was a soft brown and his eyes a gentle green. He was quiet and unassuming, one of the least aggressive of her suitors.</p><p>\u201cYou remember my sister, Miss Amanda Tolliver,\u201d he said, with a sidelong glance at Jasper.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Good to see you, Miss Tolliver.\u201d Eliza made the appropriate introductions offhandedly. But when Jasper bowed over Miss Tolliver\u2019s hand and the young lady blushed to the roots of her lovely dark hair, Eliza found her mood altering drastically.</p><p>Sir Richard offered a tight smile. \u201cI see now why you declined my invitation to escort you to the exhibition, Miss Martin. I did not understand you had a prior engagement.\u201d</p><p>Eliza realized with some surprise that he was upset. He felt slighted, although that hadn\u2019t been her intent. She\u2019d simply been aware that accepting his offer of escort would lead to spending hours in the company of someone with whom she had nothing in common. She thought it best to spare them both the awkwardness.</p><p>That was not, however, the explanation she could give. Conversing in society had little to do with truth. It was more about keeping everyone\u2019s feelings as neutral as possible. For many, the truth was not a neutral topic.</p><p>She was considering how she could reply in an acceptable manner when Miss Tolliver batted her thick lashes at Jasper. Eliza froze with her mouth partially formed around a word. Suddenly she knew precisely how Tolliver felt, and how little sound reasoning had to do with it.</p><p>What a morass the art of courting was.</p><p>\u201cWill I see you tonight at the Lansing rout, Sir Richard?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you will be there, Miss Martin, I will certainly attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are obliged, I should like to save the first waltz for you.\u201d</p><p>Tolliver\u2019s sudden grin lit up the room. Eliza was slightly frightened by its fervency.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Mr. Bond?\u201d Miss Tolliver asked. \u201cWill you be at the Lansing rout? Shall I save a place on my dance card for you?\u201d</p><p>Eliza felt Jasper\u2019s forearm tense beneath her fingers. When he said nothing, she realized he didn\u2019t know how to reply. The truth he\u2019d shared so readily with her was not one he wished to share with others.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond was injured yesterday,\u201d she lied. \u201cHis horse was ill-mannered and stepped quite harshly on his foot. While he can walk, dancing is out of the question for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d Miss Tolliver did indeed look crestfallen. \u201cI hope you recover quickly, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded and bid the siblings farewell. He led Eliza away with a briskness that belied the injury she\u2019d invented for him. He drew to a halt when they reached a corner and glared at the painting in front of him.</p><p>His foot tapped against the floor. \u201cThe dance you gave to Tolliver was mine.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was confused. \u201cBut you do not dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoments ago,\u201d he said in a low, biting tone, \u201cyou were asking if I wanted to be inside you and the next, you\u2019re encouraging another man\u2019s obvious interest in you.\u201d</p><p>Astonished by the physical response she had to his choice of phrasing, she stared at the painting he was directing his ire at and tried to piece an explanation together.</p><p>\u201cI was not encouraging him,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cI was commiserating with him. I collected that he was perturbed and perhaps felt...marginalized.\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at her with a sardonically raised brow. \u201cYou know how he feels, but not how I feel. Care to explain why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Tolliver is clearly taken with you, and she\u2019s lovely and charming. As many times as we\u2019ve met before, today was the first time I resented those qualities in her.\u201d</p><p>He grew very still.</p><p>Unsure if that was a positive or negative sign, she pressed on. \u201cSir Richard must feel similarly in regards to you. How can he compete with a man such as yourself? I vow there isn\u2019t another male in the world who is as stunning. In the face of what must have been a crushing feeling of inferiority, offering a dance seemed the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s face gave away none of his thoughts. After a tor-turously long delay, he said, \u201cYou have no notion that the room just tilted on its axis, do you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Jasper watched as Eliza\u2019s gaze darted around the Exhibition Hall in search of proof to support his claim. A rush of tenderness tightened his chest and prevented him from explaining.</p><p>Eliza returned her attention to him. \u201cLady Collingsworth doesn\u2019t look as if something so phenomenal has happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Eliza,\u201d he murmured, warmly amused. \u201cLynd said you would drive me mad, and he was correct, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty mouth pursed into a tight line. \u201cI begin to feel as if I am lacking wits,\u201d she groused. \u201cI have been at a loss to understand anything since I woke this morning.\u201d</p><p>He found her confusion poignantly endearing. He wished he could reply to her in a gentler manner, but he was not a gentle man. As surprising as her use of \u201cmate\u201d had been earlier, he found it brilliantly apt now. His desire for her was at a fever pitch, his blood hot and his patience far too thin. If they\u2019d been alone, he would be fucking her now. Mating with her. Pumping his cock so deep into her she would have no doubt that her public performance was the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>Rolling his shoulders back, he tried to ward off the tension building there. He could not talk about sex right now, even to say that he wanted it with her. The words would be too coarse, his vehemence too frightening. And he wasn\u2019t yet sure that she wanted it with him. Her body did, yes. Watching her melt for him in the barouche had been singularly the most arousing experience of his life. But she had been overwhelmed and not thinking properly at the time. Eliza needed to be cognizant of her decision to take him to her bed if he was to have her as he wanted.</p><p>She watched him now, wary and unsure.</p><p>He urged her to walk with him, needing to be in motion. It didn\u2019t escape his notice that she had him in this state by speech alone. Not with a look or a touch, but with innocently spoken, artlessly truthful words.</p><p>\u201cI want you to teach me how to dance,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d The excitement in her voice was its own reward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to make restitution for giving my dance to someone else.\u201d And another way to add a block of time with her to his schedule.</p><p>Her smile was a sight to behold. \u201cI must warn you, I am not a very good instructor of anything. I lack patience and become easily frustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a speedy learner,\u201d he assured, intending to make the lessons worth her while in many ways.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. I would be happy to try.\u201d</p><p>Returning his attention to the portraits on the wall, Jasper acknowledged that he enjoyed the exhibition. He had not expected to, as he wasn\u2019t fond of crowds. The room was almost full and the hum of conversation was a steady but not-unpleasant drone. He should not have felt comfortable there. He was a mongrel among purebreds, yet Eliza made him feel as if he was right where he should be. At the very least, right where he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cWhich is your favorite so far?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that one.\u201d He pointed to an image of a galloping horse. \u201cI can almost feel the wind when I look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is this one.\u201d She pulled him forward and singled out a portrait of a dancing nymph with flowing hair and ribbons. \u201cThe skill involved in turning mere paints into an image that looks as if it can walk right off the canvas...I am awed by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came with me and not with Tolliver,\u201d he said.</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>They continued around the room at a leisurely pace, pausing every few feet to take in the many paintings occupying the soaring walls.</p><p>After an hour, Eliza begged to be excused. \u201cWill you be comfortable if I leave you alone for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Jasper wanted to say no. \u201cOnly a moment.\u201d</p><p>She moved away. He expected her to speak to someone she knew or visit with Lady Collingsworth for a time. Instead, she left the room. He moved to follow, wanting to ensure her safety by keeping her in sight.</p><p>Lady Collingsworth deftly intercepted him.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he said, with a slight inclination of his head.</p><p>She wrapped her hand around his forearm and waved him forward with her fan. \u201cI would like to become better acquainted with you, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He looked toward the exit in time to see Sir Richard Tolliver and his sister make their egress.</p><p>\u201cEliza\u2019s mother and I were dear friends. After Lady Georgina\u2019s passing, I took Eliza under my wing. I couldn\u2019t love her more if she was my own child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is an exceptional young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so young,\u201d she said, eyeing him. \u201cShe has had six failed Seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy her choice. And she is young in more than her years. She has an almost childlike comprehension of emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you know her well, yet I have never heard of you prior to yesterday. Why are you here, Mr. Bond? And when will you return to the place whence you came?\u201d</p><p>They rounded a corner of the room and Jasper considered his reply. A hastily spoken falsehood could breach Eliza\u2019s privacy. \u201cI am here on business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in trade?\u201d Her ladyship pulled away enough to facilitate studying his attire. \u201cSuccessfully, it would appear.\u201d</p><p>Jasper smiled. \u201cIs it a mark in my favor that I am not in pursuit of Miss Martin\u2019s fortune?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDepends on what else you are in pursuit of. I am not blind. I see the way you look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not blind either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheeky fellow,\u201d she admonished, but there was a twinkle in her eye. \u201cWhat are your intentions?\u201d</p><p>He stared at a painting nigh the size of his curricle and mulled over his reply. In the end, he circumvented the question. \u201cI want her to be safe and happy.\u201d</p> <p>And yet his \u201cintentions,\u201d such as they were, might very well put her safety and happiness at risk. For her, there must be some comfort in her ignorance of softer emotions. Already their association had caused her to feel bewildered and to act against sound reasoning.</p><p>\u201cExcellent sentiments,\u201d Lady Collingsworth said. \u201cI could not agree more. Might I suggest you pay your addresses sooner, rather than later? It would be lovely for her to enjoy a few weeks of the Season as an affianced woman.\u201d</p><p>The tension in Jasper\u2019s shoulders returned, but for a different reason. Speaking carefully, he answered, \u201cI am not certain she would be best served with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d There was a long moment wherein her ladyship drummed her gloved fingertips into his forearm. \u201cDo you know, Mr. Bond, I can count on my fingers the number of times I have seen Eliza smile in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not smile often,\u201d he agreed, feeling more than a little triumph that she\u2019d smiled so brilliantly at him today.</p> <p>\u201cI would suggest you leave the determination of what makes Eliza feel safe and happy to her. Speculation is necessary in business, but in affairs of the heart, it often leads to poor judgments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take that under advisement.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved on one side. \u201cI can see what she likes about you, Mr. Bond. You listen. I suspect you don\u2019t always act on what you\u2019ve heard, but you listen in any case.\u201d</p><p>They returned to the entrance and she released him. Jasper bowed, then ducked out of the room with unseemly haste. But he was stopped once again by Lord Westfield, who was a few feet away from reaching the Exhibition Hall with a delicate-looking blonde on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Bond,\u201d Westfield called out. \u201cWhere are you running off to?\u201d</p><p>His lordship leaned down and whispered something to his companion. When his head lifted, she was smiling in a way that promised all sorts of delicious things. She moved into the room without him, leaving him to speak to Jasper.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Martin left the room some minutes ago,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are following her with notable eagerness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been waylaid twice now.\u201d His glare made it clear who the second delay was.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d his lordship said, \u201cthe least I can do is show you where the ladies\u2019 retiring rooms are, as I would imagine that\u2019s where she went. Unless you frightened her into fleeing. I say, your scowl is fearsome even to me.\u201d</p><p>Jasper growled softly.</p><p>Westfield laughed and gave concise directions. Jasper was grateful for the assistance, but was less appreciative of the note of amusement that colored its delivery.</p><p>With a quick salute of fingertips to his hat brim, he set off in search of Eliza. Several minutes had passed since she parted from him, an inconsiderable amount of time for many women but slightly too long for a lady who didn\u2019t fret about her appearance. He turned the corner and heard Eliza\u2019s voice float toward him, but he could not see her. There was a statue of a man between them, in the center of the hallway on a platform of rollers. She was speaking with calm efficiency to the men laboring to move the obstruction, explaining that one of the wheels seemed to be caught by the runner protecting the floor.</p><p>Shaking his head, Jasper started forward. How like her to linger and offer engineering advice, even of such a small nature. A fond smile curved his lips. She said he was a man clearly suited to more strenuous pursuits and he would not argue the point. However, it appeared a quick mind was as arousing to him as a naked woman.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Martin,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond.\u201d She peeked around the thigh of the statue. \u201cI have been eye level with the backside of this artwork for long moments now. It seems one of the wheels is indisposed to motion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should just squeeze around the platform?\u201d he suggested, gauging the space on either side. There wasn\u2019t much room, despite the generous size of the hallway. In fact, the piece was so large it towered above them.</p><p>He slowed as he neared. \u201cIs there another way around?\u201d he asked, directing his question at the two red-faced men straining to push the piece down a tributary hallway.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the larger of the two gasped. Straightening, he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his brow.</p><p>The smaller man, seemingly unwilling to be delayed by courtesy toward a lady, charged into the base with his shoulder. The jolt dislodged the stuck wheel, causing the platform and statue to lurch forward. The wood creaked in protest. One of the thick lines of rope securing the heavy piece snapped. The resulting noise was like the crack of a whip. Jasper watched in horror as the statue listed away from him.</p><p>\u201cEliza!\u201d he shouted, lunging forward but having no way to reach her.</p><p>The platform cracked and the troublesome wheel broke away, tumbling a short ways down the hall.</p><p>The rest was over far too quickly. The crash was deafening in the enclosed space. Debris from the shattered art piece billowed into the air in a hazy cloud.</p><p>Jasper could not see Eliza among the ruins.</p><p>Scrambling over the destruction, he reached the spot where he last saw her standing. The torso of the figure lay there in a solid piece. He was so stunned, he couldn\u2019t think. His chest was so tight, he swayed on his feet.</p><p>Shouts from other parts of the building grew in volume, competing with the thunderous sound of the blood rushing through his ears.</p><p>\u201cHeavens,\u201d Eliza said. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s gaze followed the voice. She stood in a nearby doorway, staring at the disorder.</p><p>Dear God...</p><p>He clambered over wobbling chunks of decimated statue and crushed her to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt looked as if the rope might have been cut at least partway through.\u201d Jasper held his third glass of brandy and continued to pace before the unlit fireplace in his study. His coat and waistcoat had been tossed over the arm of a wingback chair, yet still he felt too constricted. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way to be certain. I was only granted a brief look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it was an accident,\u201d Westfield queried from his position on the settee, \u201cdespite the prominence of the location and the randomness of the event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin says the statue was waiting in a secondary hall when she went into the retiring room. Upon her emergence, she found it had been moved into her path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo men were having a devil of a time pushing it,\u201d the earl reminded. \u201cA lone individual would have found the task impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut one wheel was troublesome. Perhaps, not by chance.\u201d Jasper downed the contents of his tumbler in one swallow, seeking to warm the spot inside him chilled by the near miss. \u201cIs it possible for one person to be the victim of so much misfortune?\u201d</p><p>Setting the glass down on his desktop with a harsh thud, he glanced at the clock. It would be hours before he saw Eliza again at the Lansings\u2019 rout. He was certain to be in a state of high agitation until then. Assigning more men to watch the Melville household was small comfort.</p><p>Westfield made a noise suspiciously like a snort. \u201cYou are positively high-strung about the business, while Miss Martin seemed to take the happenings in stride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she trusts me to manage everything and keep her safe,\u201d Jasper said tightly.</p><p>\u201cI trust you will, as well. But you appear less confident in your own abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gravity of this \u2018accident\u2019 is also responsible for her lack of anxiety. The irony of that...Because this was by far the most dangerous event, she believes it\u2019s unrelated to the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying she\u2019s less concerned because she was almost killed?\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at the earl and noted the amused interest on his lordship\u2019s face. For a brief moment, he was enraged by the entertainment Westfield appeared to be taking from the events of the afternoon. In the earl\u2019s privileged, pampered, ennui-afflicted life even the misfortune of others could enliven spirits.</p><p>Reining in his temper, Jasper turned away. He kneaded the back of his neck with a firm grip. \u201cI am doing all I can. There is nothing to be done about my concern that I\u2019m not doing enough.\u201d</p><p>He was meeting with Eliza\u2019s man of affairs tomorrow, and together they would be visiting her rental properties. His men were looking into the circumstances of her present tenants and recent ones. He intended to speak with Lord Collingsworth this evening about joining the investment pool Eliza mentioned, and he was waiting on word from Lord Melville regarding a time when they could meet. There were still her two fathers\u2014Mr. Martin and Mr. Chilcott\u2014to delve into, but he would see to those inquiries himself. Eliza\u2019s family secrets were not ones he wished anyone else to know about, despite the trust he placed in his crew.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation,\u201d Westfield said, pushing to his feet, \u201cyou are engaged in a singularly unique investigation, while playing a role far outside your experience. Feeling as if you might be missing something is to be expected. But I\u2019m here for you, if you need. I have the experience you lack. In fact, if you would like me to assume the courting of Miss Martin while you focus on the investigation, I would be happy to do so.\u201d</p><p>Jasper bared his teeth in a semblance of a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right.\u201d</p><p>The earl laughed. \u201cThe offer stands, if you should change your mind. In the meantime, I must eat and prepare for the evening\u2019s festivities. You should have a meal as well, and attempt some moderation in your drinking. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be much good to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Waving Westfield away with an impatient flick of his wrist, Jasper sank heavily into the chair behind his desk and mentally took apart every bit of information he\u2019d gleaned so far, looking for any clue he might have missed.</p><p>He could not fail in this. Client satisfaction and point of pride be damned. He was acting on his own behalf, stricken by the memory of those brief moments when he\u2019d feared Eliza had been gravely wounded...or worse.</p><p>It was not a feeling he intended to experience ever again.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Westfield grumbled, snatching two glasses of champagne from a passing servant\u2019s tray. He shoved one toward Jasper, causing the wine to slosh precariously up to the lip. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how unintelligible Lady Lansing becomes when excited. I could not comprehend a word she said. How long were we held captive? Twenty minutes? Half an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen, my lord. At most.\u201d Jasper\u2019s gaze searched the ballroom from one end to the other. It was a long and narrow space, with inlaid marble floors and three large chandeliers. Fluted columns surrounded the perimeter, as did the occasional potted fern. The far wall consisted entirely of French doors, most of which were thrown wide to allow the night air to circulate.</p><p>\u201cInterminable.\u201d Westfield tossed back the contents of his glass. \u201cThe things I do for you, Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be flattered. Your illustrious presence single-handedly made Lady Lansing\u2019s ball a resounding success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not appeased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you a debt, as well, of course,\u201d Jasper murmured, distracted by his inability to find Eliza. \u201cDoes that soothe your ire?\u201d</p><p>The Lansing\u2019s ballroom was neither overly large nor overly filled. There was a respectable showing of guests, but it wasn\u2019t yet a crush. Why, then, couldn\u2019t he locate her glorious red hair?</p><p>Are you one of those gentlemen who have an unusually strong interest in red hair?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been. He had considered all women equally endowed. Now, here he was, completely oblivious to every other hue but that novel fiery one.</p><p>The earl caught his arm. \u201cWalk this way,\u201d Westfield urged, attempting to tug him along. \u201cSomeone is approaching whom I\u2019d rather not speak to.\u201d</p><p>With a rueful smile, Jasper followed. They rounded the perimeter at a torturously slow pace due to the number of attendees who wished to greet the earl. Jasper was about to leave Westfield behind when he finally spotted her.</p><p>His step faltered. Westfield bumped into him.</p><p>\u201cDamnation, Bond, what the devil are you\u2014\u201d The earl fell silent.</p><p>Jasper gave a low, appreciative whistle. Uncouth, to be sure, and an undeniable betrayal of his commonness, but it was sincere. He could find no words.</p><p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Westfield said in a contemplative tone, \u201cI have clearly been remiss in not paying proper attention to Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Eliza stood amid a circle of acquaintances, most of whom were gentlemen. Her glorious hair had been arranged in abundant curls that framed her face and caressed her nape. Her body was clad in sapphire satin, the bold color incongruous amid the paler hues worn by the other women in attendance. There would have been no way to miss her, had she not been shorter than the crowd of salivating males around her.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was she wearing?</p><p>Unable to help himself, Jasper stared with clenched fists. Riveted. The deep color of her gown showcased the creamy hue of her skin and the richness of her tresses to supreme advantage. The cut of the garment was painfully simple, with minimal detail. The gown\u2019s true beauty lay in how it clung to its wearer. How the low bodice hugged full, firm breasts and bared more than a glimpse of cleavage. How the long skirts emphasized the length of her legs. The short puffed sleeves failed to meet the uppermost end of Eliza\u2019s long white gloves, revealing a sprinkling of freckles on her upper arms that he found enchanting.</p><p>He was struck with fierce longing, like a man gone too long without a meal who doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s starving until presented with the sight and smell of food. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An amused masculine voice intruded. \u201cGlad to see I\u2019m not the only man to lose all sense of social grace.\u201d</p><p>Jasper tore his gaze away from Eliza to see who spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cLord Brimley,\u201d Westfield said. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d</p><p>As the earl made the appropriate introductions, Jasper studied Baron Brimley with his usual thoroughness. The baron was a head shorter than both himself and Westfield, and far more slender. Although Brimley\u2019s hairline was receding with regretful swiftness, Jasper guessed he was younger than he appeared.</p> <p>\u201cSurprised to see you, Westfield,\u201d Brimley said after greeting Jasper. \u201cDid word of Miss Martin\u2019s transformation spread so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d the earl drawled, \u201cI simply dropped all of this evening\u2019s invitations into a hat and withdrew a few. The \u2018transformation,\u2019 as you call it, is an unexpected boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Tomlinson is of the mind that Miss Martin finally seeks to throw off the mantle of spinsterhood,\u201d Brimley relayed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Jasper suggested, feeling proprietary, \u201cshe\u2019s taken a fancy to someone and hopes to encourage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Brimley\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cCare to guess who it is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am at a disadvantage, I\u2019m afraid. I have yet to become acquainted with every moth circling her flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoth to flame, eh? Poetic and apt. Well, I shall take it upon myself to discover his identity.\u201d</p><p>Westfield clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou will, of course, be sporting and share your findings.\u201d</p><p>Brimley\u2019s chest puffed up. \u201cCertainly, Westfield.\u201d</p><p>Jasper gave in to his impatience. With a slight bow, he sidestepped away. \u201cIf you will excuse me, my lords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Bond,\u201d Westfield said quickly. \u201cI shall accompany you in your journey to pay court to the lovely Miss Martin. Excuse us, Brimley. Do keep us apprised of your discoveries.\u201d</p> <p>The tension in Jasper\u2019s shoulders increased. Bringing Eliza to Westfield\u2019s attention\u2014and the reverse\u2014was not something he should view as threatening, but the feeling was there. He remembered what Eliza had said about her unexpected feelings of animosity toward Miss Tolliver and he admired her candor even more.</p><p>She caught sight of him when he was several feet away. Courtesy of her d\u00e9colletage, he saw her breath catch and a gentle flush spread across her luminous skin. She stared, unblinking, and masculine triumph surged through him. She was clearly smitten by the sight of him, yet he had not provoked that response from her with any effort on his part.</p><p>He drew to a halt on the fringes of her circle. A pathway was made for him with obvious reluctance.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze and curtsied. \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Jasper obliged Westfield with the necessary introductions, then backed away. For a while, he simply observed her in this new environment, smiling inwardly when she spoke so bluntly those around her momentarily lost their way in the conversation. As dramatic as her change of appearance was, she was still Eliza. While others spoke with great animation about the tale of her mishap at the Royal Academy, she frowned and bit her lower lip, clearly not reconciling the expanded tales with the actual reality. She looked at him often, seeming to take comfort in his proximity. He recalled his earlier thoughts about how at ease she made him feel in situations where he was feeling his way blind.</p><p>They were not so different. More than anything, he was drawn to the affinity they shared in unexpected and deeply seated ways.</p><p>In order to see him schooled properly, Jasper\u2019s mother had paid for his education with her pride and her life. He\u2019d protested the expense, knowing what it would cost her, but she would not be swayed. In the end, he conceded only because he intended to support her, not for the reason she es-poused\u2014to impress his sire, a man well-versed in ignoring his many bastard issue.</p> <p>Jasper blamed opium for his mother\u2019s failure to see the hopelessness of her quest. Certainly no one possessed of full mental faculty would hold the dream that a handsome son with a decent education and proper speech would engender fondness and paternal pride in a dissolute reprobate like the late Earl of Montague. Yes, Jasper was well-spoken and possessed of a refined sense of style. He could read and write. He was capable with numbers, although he lacked the fondness for them Eliza had. In short, he should fit in, but he did not. And he knew Eliza felt the same way.</p><p>A violin played a few opening notes, signaling an end to the orchestra\u2019s short break. Guests began to line up along the center of the parquet floor. Eliza shot him a long, meaningful glance and he knew she was going to be dancing his dance.</p><p>She took to the floor with Sir Richard Tolliver. Riveted by the elegant grace with which she glided across the room, Jasper could not take his eyes from her. The sapphire gown\u2019s skirts were noticeably fuller than those worn by the other females in attendance; he thought the style suited Eliza perfectly. There were more layers to her than most women.</p><p>The musicians began the opening notes of a waltz. Eliza stepped nearer to Tolliver and clasped his hand. With an accomplished flourish, he began the requisite series of steps.</p><p>Jasper frowned, thinking. There had been two Tollivers at the Exhibition Hall. They\u2019d left the room shortly after Eliza and followed in her direction. On Eliza\u2019s list of suitors, Tolliver\u2019s name had been placed above Montague\u2019s, in part because he had a sister who could use a dowry to secure a more advantageous match.</p><p>Turning away, Jasper expected the other sibling would be nearby. He had only to find her.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cYou are a vision this evening, Miss Martin,\u201d Sir Richard said, as they circled the dance floor along with the other couples.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Eliza wondered if she should say more than that. What did one say that wouldn\u2019t sound awkward? She always considered such praise to be a platitude. She was well aware she was no classic beauty. However, since she\u2019d put effort into looking attractive this evening, it would be disingenuous to assume none of the compliments were sincere. Especially considering she was wearing one of her mother\u2019s gowns.</p><p>Eliza was still stunned at her decision. Her mother was someone she never wanted to emulate. Lady Georgina had been irrepressible and impetuous. She\u2019d paid little heed to the consequences of her actions and how they might affect others. For years, Eliza had asked herself the question \u201cWhat would Mother do?\u201d so she could choose the reverse option. But after this afternoon, she wanted to do something nice for Jasper. He\u2019d been so distraught after the unfortunate event at Somerset House. It meant a great deal to her that he cared so much for her well-being. If she were completely honest, she would also say she hoped her attire might goad an answer from him in regards to her earlier question about mating.</p><p>Of course, there was also the reasonable explanation for her choice: it signaled to one and all that a drastic change had occurred in her life. She\u2019d known the very day her mother had taken a fancy to Mr. Chilcott. Lady Georgina\u2019s blue eyes had been bright, her lips red, and her cheeks flushed. She had hummed to herself and burst out in song at odd moments. Over the following week, she\u2019d smiled incessantly. But most telling of all was the way she altered her mode of dress. She\u2019d begun choosing gowns with conservative adornments and richer colors, as if she knew her smitten glow was accessory enough. Eliza understood that she could not continue to go about looking as ordinary as possible and expect others to believe she was extraordinarily attached to a particular man.</p><p>Sir Richard cleared his throat. \u201cI pray you\u2019ll forgive me, Miss Martin, but I am concerned for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI detest stepping into affairs that are removed from me,\u201d he said, sounding anything but reluctant. \u201cHowever, I fear your laudable discrimination in selecting a spouse has become lax.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cLax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI speak of Mr. Bond, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Although Tolliver had been paying court to her for two Seasons now, this was the first display of condescension she\u2019d witnessed. She did not like his tone at all. It was one a parent or tutor would use with a recalcitrant child.</p><p>\u201cThere is something about Mr. Bond that doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I cannot put my finger on it, but something is not right with him.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and located Jasper standing by a fluted column with crossed arms and hooded eyes. Not for the first time, she noted how he didn\u2019t look at her as he had on the day they\u2019d met. His stare now was hotter, more aware, and it awakened an answering awareness in her. Warmth blossomed in the pit of her stomach and expanded. They had known each other only a few days, but she was irrevocably changed by his acquaintance, newly cognizant of a baser sensibility previously veiled from her.</p><p>As for Tolliver\u2019s assertions, although she didn\u2019t appreciate the manner of their delivery, she could not fault him for making them. Jasper\u2019s attire was the only thing polished about him. Although he appeared innocuous on the surface, those with keen perception would recognize how incongruous he was among the crowd. There was a razor\u2019s edge of menace to him and a sleek grace to his movements that was inherently predaceous.</p><p>\u201cI see no evidence of unsuitability,\u201d she lied. \u201cIn truth, I find him quite acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin, I must say, I am alarmed by your estimation. Who are his people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father is known to Lord Melville.\u201d Eliza followed Sir Richard\u2019s lead through an unusually vigorous turn. He was such an accomplished dancer; his uncustomary carelessness was telling.</p><p>\u201cI suspect he is in want of funds, and you have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat applies to many gentlemen of my acquaintance, wouldn\u2019t you agree? But I\u2019m curious. What led you to the assumption that Mr. Bond is a fortune hunter and more of a hazard than my other suitors? Certainly his appearance refutes such a conclusion.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked beyond reproach this evening. Dressed in a dark gray velvet coat and a pale blue waistcoat, he looked accomplished and elegant. The expert tailoring of the whole ensemble displayed the power of his body to advantage. She fully appreciated how strong and capable he was. She felt safe knowing he was nearby. The only person capable of harming her when Jasper was near was Jasper himself.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d Tolliver looked pained. \u201cI must advise you that it\u2019s most disconcerting to dance with a female who spends the duration of the waltz admiring another gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not admiring him, sir.\u201d At least, not verbally. \u201cI am merely requesting that you expound upon the methods of deduction you used to reach your conclusion. You say he is in want of funds, I see no evidence of such. I should like to know what you see that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady of your refined reasoning is at a disadvantage in this situation.\u201d His brown eyes were somber. \u201cI shall explain. He\u2019s regarding you in an inappropriate fashion, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying,\u201d she asked carefully, \u201cMr. Bond must be in want of money because he cannot take his eyes off me? I don\u2019t understand the logic. Isn\u2019t it possible Mr. Bond might find something visually appealing about me? Perhaps my trim figure has garnered his admiration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour form is attractive,\u201d he conceded gruffly.</p><p>\u201cOr my hair? Some men are excessively fascinated by certain hues, I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>A flush rose from beneath his cravat to color his cheekbones. \u201cYou have lovely hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my attractive form and lovely tresses are not enough to explain why Mr. Bond regards me so intently? I suppose that\u2019s due to his exceedingly comely face and its ability to captivate anyone with unhindered vision. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I understand you to mean that my limited physical charms are no match for his. He can certainly find a far more beautiful female.\u201d Eliza wrinkled her nose, as if in deep thought. \u201cWell, then, perhaps it\u2019s my brain he finds so interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree you are extremely clever, Miss Martin,\u201d he said in a fervent rush, swiftly grasping at the change of topic. \u201cIt\u2019s why I like you so well, and why I\u2019m certain we will enjoy each other\u2019s companionship for an indefinite period of time. However, Mr. Bond obviously lends more attention to cultivating his exterior than his interior. One does not attain that physical size through intellectual exertions. I doubt he\u2019s capable of grasping the worth of your brain. In fact, in your position, I would wonder if it was even possible to have meaningful discourse with him.\u201d</p><p>Eliza nodded. \u201cI understand now. Ruling out my mental and physical attributes would leave only my fortune as an enticement for handsome men. I\u2019m quite enlightened, Sir Richard.\u201d</p><p>The waltz ended. She retreated the moment the last strains faded away. \u201cThank you. This discussion has been most informative. However, I seek clarification on one point: If attractive men find only my fortune alluring and you find my brain alluring, does that make you unattractive?\u201d</p><p>Tolliver\u2019s mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again. Nothing came out.</p><p>After an abbreviated curtsy, Eliza spun about and left the dance floor. She intended to go to Jasper, but he was no longer where she last saw him.</p><p>Jasper found Miss Tolliver on the dance floor. Shortly afterward, he was himself found by Lord Westfield.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost inclined to wed posthaste,\u201d his lordship said, \u201cto spare myself further pre-matrimonial torment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause post-matrimonial torment is eminently more bearable,\u201d Jasper said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have unreasonable qualifications for a spouse,\u201d Westfield said with some defensiveness. \u201cSo long as she doesn\u2019t aggravate me unduly, and I\u2019m not averse to bedding her, I am open to anyone of suitable breeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow progressive of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The earl arched a brow. \u201cYour tone leaves something to be desired. Now, tell me there\u2019s something to be done here. I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Miss Tolliver exits the dance floor, I should like her to know my theory regarding today\u2019s events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you want to see how she reacts. Personally, I don\u2019t see how a woman could have moved that statue. And you cannot tell me Sir Richard helped her. I\u2019m not even certain he could lift his sibling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave no stone unturned.\u201d</p> <p>When the waltz ended, they made certain to place themselves in Miss Tolliver\u2019s path. She greeted Westfield with a charming and studied curtsy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tolliver.\u201d Westfield gave an elegant bow. \u201cA pleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d She offered a sympathetic smile to Jasper. \u201cHow is your foot this evening, Mr. Bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImproving, Miss Tolliver. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The pretty brunette offered a flirtatious smile. The pale yellow gown she wore was more heavily adorned than the similarly shaded gown Eliza had worn earlier in the day. Such details were not something Jasper was accustomed to noting. What a woman wore or how she styled her hair was inconsequential to him.</p> <p>But Eliza\u2019s appearance tonight was such a contrast to her usual mode of dress he suspected she purposely minimized her beauty before. It made him consider the attire of others with a more discerning eye, part of his careful reflection on the desire he had for her. Only days into their acquaintance and he knew he would not be ready to part from her in the foreseeable future. He also knew he was willing to go to great lengths to have her.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the unfortunate incident at the Royal Academy.\u201d Miss Tolliver shook her head. \u201cHow terrifying for Miss Martin! I am certain I would be bedridden for a sennight after such a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is managing extraordinarily well,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cEspecially considering the circumstances,\u201d Westfield said, in a confidential tone.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cCircumstances?\u201d</p><p>The earl leaned closer. \u201cThere is some speculation that the rope securing the statue might have been deliberately cut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her hand went to her throat. \u201cWhy would anyone do something so heinous? Especially to Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say she was the intended target,\u201d he qualified, straightening. \u201cShe might simply have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is some small comfort in that.\u201d She exhaled audibly. \u201cDeliberately cut, you say. I wonder why?\u201d</p><p>She looked away and worried her lower lip with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare speculate,\u201d Westfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s rarely good to have one\u2019s name associated with such sensational tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue of us all,\u201d she said gravely, dipping into another curtsy. Miss Tolliver excused herself, and Jasper followed her with his gaze. She headed directly to a group of women.</p><p>\u201cShe spreads the tale,\u201d Westfield murmured, turning his back to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no proof of innocence. In fact, a clever person might assume that bearing the news to others would lighten suspicion. After all, what reasonable person would air their misdeeds to all and sundry?\u201d Jasper intended to have both Tollivers followed for a time. He would not take any chances.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of the investment pool managed by Lord Collingsworth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI participated for a time, but Collingsworth is too conservative for my taste. You might feel similarly.\u201d</p><p>How like Eliza to be cautious. Money was vitally important to her, not for what it could buy, but for the measure of freedom and control its possession granted her. \u201cDo you know who the other investors are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Not all. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Westfield\u2019s brows rose. \u201cWasn\u2019t aware of that. Does that make me a suspect?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Jasper said, \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>The earl grabbed a glass of champagne from a passing servant. \u201cHow delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re at fault.\u201d Jasper moved forward.</p><p>\u201cWas that a threat, Bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you are at fault,\u201d he said again. \u201cIn that case, it would be a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the card room. Perhaps the scent of desperation will lead me in a new direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never answered my question about what you\u2019ll do once you own Montague\u2019s property.\u201d Although Westfield was the public face of the wager that secured the property, Jasper hadn\u2019t revealed why he wanted it.</p><p>However, he had no hesitation in revealing what he would do with it. \u201cI will raze the house, then leave England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor parts unknown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d Jasper looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ve purchased a plantation in the South Seas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d The earl choked on his champagne. \u201cOnly you would find peace living among savages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think similarly about your life.\u201d</p><p>A brilliant shade of sapphire blue in the periphery of Jasper\u2019s vision caught his interest. He turned his head to catch Eliza moving toward one of three sets of French doors leading outside to a wide veranda.</p><p>She shot him a look over her shoulder. It was not the calculated look of a practiced flirt. It was simpler and more sincere, betraying pleasure at seeing him and the hope he might follow.</p><p>He smiled and inclined his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cI will go ahead without you,\u201d Westfield murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappoint me, Bond. When a beautiful woman looks at you in that manner, you should need far more time than that.\u201d</p><p>Eliza moved toward the nearest exterior exit with the hope that her dark gown would blend somewhat with the darkness of night and provide her a brief spell of anonymity. She felt Jasper\u2019s stare following her and fought the urge to quicken her pace. Not because she wished to avoid him, but because it was instinctive to run when caught in the sights of a hunter.</p><p>The anticipation of capture was its own pleasure. The hair on her nape stood on end and gooseflesh covered the parts of her arms exposed above her long gloves. When the warmth of a large hand surrounded her elbow, she couldn\u2019t fight the shiver that moved through her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d Jasper\u2019s deep voice caused a tingling in her stomach. With an easy grip, he led her outdoors to where several guests were paired in quietly voiced conversations. \u201cYou might have warned me that you would steal my breath upon sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Unlike Tolliver\u2019s compliment, Jasper\u2019s praise did not make her feel awkward. Instead, she felt warm and slightly giddy.</p><p>\u201cAltering your appearance to goad speculation was an excellent plan.\u201d He looked down at her with warm appreciation. \u201cIn case I\u2019ve failed to mention it, I love the way you think.\u201d</p><p>Eliza flushed. \u201cWould you admire my intellect less to know I hoped my presentation would impress you as much as my reasoning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I would be deeply flattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel silly,\u201d she confessed. \u201cSimply knowing you goads me into acting in ways I normally wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jasper smiled, and she found him so handsome it made her chest tighten. \u201cWould it ease your nervousness to know I have second-guessed every aspect of my attire from the knot of my cravat to the shoes on my feet before every meeting I\u2019ve had with you since the first? I believe it\u2019s part of the mating ritual.\u201d</p><p>He slowed as they stepped outside the circle of light cast by the ballroom chandeliers. There were torches set around the veranda, but they were spaced at wide intervals to provide just enough illumination to delineate where stone gave way to lawn.</p><p>\u201cPart of the charade?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to feign anything with you, Eliza.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of how to banter flirtatiously, she moved on to safer topics. \u201cHow do you know Lord Westfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian Remington introduced us one evening.\u201d</p><p>She was momentarily surprised Jasper would boast membership in such an exclusive establishment as Remington\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club. Then, she recalled that Lucian Remington was the bastard son of the Duke of Glasser. He was known to allow gentlemen of any background to join his club...so long as they could afford it. The practice was tolerated by those born of higher station because Remington\u2019s was grand on the grandest scale. They were loath to deny themselves such luxury.</p><p>\u201cHave you known one another long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot excessively long, no.\u201d</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t move, she sensed the change in him. The sudden alertness. It was similar to being doused by chilled water. She sometimes forgot she and Jasper Bond hardly knew one another, because her overwhelming physical attraction to him fostered an illusion of intimacy.</p><p>Eliza deliberately kept her tone light when she said, \u201cForgive me for prying into your personal matters. They are none of my concern.\u201d</p><p>She would do well to follow his example and keep to safer topics in their relations. He worked for her, and an employee was all he would ever be to her. Perhaps it would slow her fascination with him to keep that in mind.</p><p>How deeply could one fall when the pool was shallow?</p><p>While there was no outward sign of it, Jasper knew Eliza had withdrawn and he\u2019d lost ground with her. Relationships were complications for just that reason\u2014at some point, women expected full disclosure. He found the need mystifying.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t willing to cede any of the progress he had made with Eliza, regardless of the points on which he would have to bend.</p><p>\u201cI met him two years ago,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cHe finds the work I do interesting and from that interest, we became...friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the word \u2018friends\u2019 so strangely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one I am accustomed to using.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and softened toward him, both physically and otherwise. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at the stone beneath his feet. Of course she would understand. There was an unusual affinity between them. On the surface, they could not be more wrong for one another. In private moments, however, nothing had ever felt more right.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are, Miss Martin,\u201d a confident and familiar voice called out.</p><p>Turning his head, Jasper watched Lord Montague exit the ballroom. Wearing dark emerald velvet and an artful amount of diamond accoutrements, the earl looked solvent and unflappable. It was a feat made more impressive by Jasper\u2019s knowledge of the truth. Montague\u2019s circumstances could not be shakier. Still, the earl\u2019s wide smile and bright eyes made it clear he was genuinely pleased to see Eliza. Or at the very least, the fortune she represented.</p><p>Jasper straightened. He\u2019d never resented his younger brother for bearing the title and privileges that came with it\u2014until the present. In the case of Eliza, Montague\u2019s advantages now posed the first real threat to Jasper\u2019s aims. Jasper could provide only intangibles, such as passion, acceptance, adventure, which were things Eliza had only recently shown an interest in. If she came to the conclusion that she needed matrimony to have sex...</p><p>There was the possibility that in seducing her, he was pushing her into marriage.</p><p>Extending his hand, Jasper waited for Eliza to set hers atop his palm. He kissed the back, hating the white satin barring his lips from her soft, pale skin. \u201cI shall leave you to your admirer,\u201d he murmured, giving her fingers a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>As much as he disliked it, the best way to establish the distinction between himself and Montague was to let her experience it firsthand.</p><p>He passed the earl with no more than a slight tilt of his head as acknowledgment, feeling more than a little satisfaction that he held the marker to the peer\u2019s beloved property and the earl didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>Jasper moved directly toward the card room. Now was as good a time as any to see which of Eliza\u2019s swains was dependent upon the whims of chance. In that enterprise, at least, he had no competition.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond is an exceptionally fine-looking young man,\u201d Lady Collingsworth said from her seat on the opposite squab. The Collingsworth carriage inched its way through the congested streets. While most of the other conveyances squired their passengers from one society event to another, Eliza and her ladyship were retiring to their respective homes.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned that earlier.\u201d Eliza draped her long gloves over her lap. She\u2019d found the sight of Jasper in finery so pleasant, she would have liked to see him again before the evening ended. Their brief discussion on the veranda had been long enough only to make her wish for more time.</p><p>\u201cThere are certain types of handsomeness that are so compelling you tell yourself later you must have exaggerated the appeal in your mind. When you see the man again and he exceeds your embroidery, it\u2019s impossible not to remark upon it.\u201d Although the lamps were turned down low, there was enough light to see her ladyship\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cHe does render one speechless,\u201d Eliza agreed. \u201cSir Richard Tolliver felt the need to warn me that a man as comely as Mr. Bond would set his cap for me only because of my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens.\u201d Regina\u2019s ramrod-straight spine stiffened further. \u201cTolliver is blind and desperate. I paid a great deal of attention to Mr. Bond over the course of the day. He most definitely has tender feelings for you. Enough so he fears being unable to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you reach that conclusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond said as much to me.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s brows rose. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did indeed. Are you considering his suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo answer that conclusively, I would need to know him better.\u201d</p><p>Lady Collingsworth linked her hands together in her lap. \u201cThe responsibility I was given for you is a deep honor. As you know, your mother meant a great deal to me. I loved Georgina as I would a sibling. I wish most sincerely to do well by you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have been wonderful.\u201d She wanted to say that Regina had done far better than her own mother would have, but she bit her tongue. She would never understand what the sweet, generous Lady Collingsworth had seen in the self-centered, mercurial Georgina. Whatever it was, it had inspired an abiding loyalty that persisted beyond the grave. Eliza learned long ago to voice no disparagement of her mother to Regina. To do so was to invite extensive reprimand and extolments of her mother\u2019s worth.</p><p>\u201cYou are kind to say so.\u201d Her ladyship smiled. \u201cYou look so like Georgina in that gown. I was taken aback upon first sight of you. For a moment, it felt almost as if time had moved backward.\u201d</p><p>Eliza didn\u2019t see the resemblance beyond the hue of her hair and eyes, but again, she said nothing. Then, she realized she should offer thanks for the voiced observation. Her ladyship would perceive it to be a compliment. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a remarkably sensible young woman,\u201d Regina continued. \u201cYou are cautious and prefer not to leave anything to chance. But matrimony is all about taking chances. Do you know how much time Collingsworth and I spent together before he paid his addresses? If you consider only the moments we actually spoke to one another, it was no more than a handful of hours. There were parties and dinners and picnics and such, but always with others nearby impeding any chance for quiet, meaningful discourse. You speak of knowing someone well, but in truth there is very little you need to know. Does an attraction exist between you? Do you both wish to see the other happy or, at the very least, reasonably content? If you have those things, you have all you need to enjoy a comfortable marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what if there are things he refuses to share with me? How can there be trust, if there are aspects of one another we don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there not parts of yourself that you would rather keep private?\u201d Regina challenged. \u201cThings you would choose not to discuss? Of course there are. Women are entitled to their mysteries, and men are entitled to their secrets. Frankly, some secrets are painful and best left alone.\u201d</p><p>Eliza considered this information carefully. There were indeed things she would prefer never to discuss again. It stood to reason that Jasper, too, would have memories he would like to forget. The person he was today might have been shaped by past events, but they didn\u2019t rule him now. Why should they rule her?</p><p>\u201cYou can manage a man,\u201d her ladyship coached, \u201cif you pander to his pride and innate sense of self-importance. Convince him that your idea is his and he\u2019ll follow it through. When handled correctly, marriage can be a useful enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe effort you describe is altogether too much work, in my opinion.\u201d But perhaps worth the effort for a man such as Jasper Bond. Shockingly, Eliza was contemplating all the things she might have to concede if she wanted to have Jasper in her life for longer than the length of the Season.</p> <p>\u201cMy dear child. You extract from life what you put into it.\u201d Regina leaned forward. \u201cYour coin will be of little comfort to you during chilly nights and solitary meals. I want a happier future for you. Someone to look after you. Children to love. This is a man\u2019s world, Eliza. Whether we like it or not, there is no help for it. You think you have freedom and independence now, but marriage would grant you even greater license. And Mr. Bond appears to have means of his own, so you might have everything to gain and nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>The carriage rolled to a halt outside the Melville town house.</p><p>Eliza caught her ladyship\u2019s hand and gave it an affectionate squeeze. \u201cThank you, Regina. You\u2019ve given me a great deal to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m available to you, if you need me.\u201d</p><p>As Eliza climbed the steps to the front door, she recognized that a decisive shift had taken place in her world. It was as if she\u2019d been sleeping in a moving carriage, content to move in any general direction. Now she was awakened and feeling the need to change course. Unfortunately, she had no notion of where she wanted to go. She was, however, beginning to think that wherever the destination, having Jasper with her would make the journey far more interesting.</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>\u201cThis is the last one.\u201d Mr. Terrance Reynolds consulted the sheaf of notes in his lap. \u201cAs I mentioned during our last meeting, Miss Martin, your newest tenant creates perfumed soaps, bath oils, and candles to order. Business is slow at present, but having purchased some of Mrs. Penning-ton\u2019s products for my wife, I think that will soon change.\u201d</p><p>Jasper kept his gaze on Eliza, who sat on the opposite squab. It was nearing two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. They\u2019d been visiting her various properties for nearly three hours now, solidifying in his mind just how wealthy Eliza was. He could easily see how someone would find the lure of her fortune overwhelming, but a suitor would have to be capable of looking beneath the surface to discover it. In her business dealings, Eliza went to great efforts to hide her gender and, therefore, her identity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay a visit to this store,\u201d she said, looking out the window of Jasper\u2019s unmarked, enclosed town carriage. \u201cIt will be interesting to see the scent the proprietress chooses to create for me.\u201d</p><p>Jasper wanted to tell Eliza that he liked the way she smelled already, but could not with Mr. Reynolds present. In addition to the safety considerations that prompted today\u2019s excursion, the exercise also brought to light how much he enjoyed talking with Eliza and listening to her view of situations. He missed being able to speak with her freely, but felt it best to keep the arrangement between himself and Eliza private. To Mr. Reynolds\u2019 knowledge, Jasper was a friend of Melville\u2019s and a possible investor in Eliza\u2019s proposed plan to modernize the amenities in a few of her older properties.</p><p>\u201cHow close are we to the store?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cA few blocks,\u201d Reynolds replied. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Rapping on the roof, Jasper signaled for his driver to stop. \u201cI\u2019ll walk from here. That will give us a sufficient length of time between Miss Martin\u2019s arrival and mine so it doesn\u2019t appear as if we came together.\u201d</p><p>An odd look crossed Eliza\u2019s features before she nodded. He made a note to ask her later what prompted it. Alighting from the carriage, he accepted the cane she passed to him through the open door.</p> <p>\u201cPink and white striped awning,\u201d Reynolds advised.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jasper saluted Eliza with a quick touch to the brim of his hat, then he set off.</p><p>Today, he\u2019d learned more than just how wealthy she was. Though neither Eliza nor Mr. Reynolds said so outright, Jasper noted that she leased her properties predominantly to women. He expected his investigation would prove her tenants to be mostly spinsters and widows. It was an honorable endeavor, and he admired her for undertaking it. However, the practice made it less likely that one of her tenants was to blame for her recent troubles. She would engender gratitude before malice. He would need to cast his net wider to include those whose rental applications had been denied. Meanwhile, every day that passed without a stronger lead aggravated him more. The work itself was not an issue. It was the threat to Eliza\u2019s safety that made Jasper dread every moment she was out of his sight.</p><p>In short order, he spotted the cheery awning and his waiting carriage nearby. This time, it was Reynolds who remained out of view while Eliza entered the store. One of the most important lessons Lynd had taught Jasper was to surround himself with trustworthy staff and to pay them well enough to keep them happy. Better to have two people you trust with your life, than a dozen you can\u2019t vouch for. Eliza appeared to have the same sensibility. Terrance Reynolds was paid handsomely. That fact was made obvious by the quality of his attire and his accessories, from his gold pocket watch to his leather satchel. In return, the man seemed genuinely fond of Eliza and intent on serving her interests well.</p><p>As Jasper entered the store, the bell above the door jingled to herald his arrival. The interior of the shop was perfectly sized for an establishment catering to the sense of smell. The air was fragrant without being overpowering. A variety of cloth-covered round tables were placed at set intervals around the room, displaying wares in colorful groupings.</p><p>He removed his hat.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, sir.\u201d</p><p>Jasper found the speaker to his left, arranging items on a tabletop in front of Eliza. The shopkeeper was young and beautiful, blond and blue-eyed. As shapely as a prized courtesan, but with the face of an angel. He bowed in greeting, then shifted his attention to Eliza. The hue of her hair made her initially more arresting to the eye than the paler tresses of the proprietress, but she lacked the fullness of curves and classic beauty of the other. That didn\u2019t alter the fact that he found Eliza to be far more pleasing to look upon. From the first, she\u2019d called to him on a physical level. There was raw magnetism between them, unique in its form. Bedding her would not be about the appeasement of his hunger, but a celebration of it. He\u2019d never felt that for anyone else. With her it was the journey to be savored, not the destination.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin,\u201d he drawled. \u201cFancy meeting you here. It\u2019s a lovely day, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would indeed, Mr. Bond.\u201d Her eyes sparkled with genuine pleasure. The manner in which she looked at him always stirred him. She lacked the artifice to hide how much she enjoyed his appearance.</p><p>Jasper couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Eliza blushed when he continued to stare. She caught her lower lip between her teeth and a wash of heat swept over him.</p><p>He could arouse her with a glance. Did she know what that did to him?</p><p>\u201cIs there something in particular I can help you find?\u201d the blonde asked, excusing herself from Eliza. She wiped her hands on the apron tied around her waist, then gestured at the goods around them. \u201cFloral or fruity? Musky or spicy? If you tell me the age and gender of the person you\u2019re shopping for, I can help you find just the thing. Or I can create something unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you suggest for a young woman of discriminating taste, high intelligence, and deep passions? Nothing ordinary or expected, please. She is neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a wife or a lover?\u201d</p><p>He considered the inquiry a moment, both the boldness of the question and his possible answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best if I ask,\u201d she explained, glancing back at Eliza. \u201cProviding you with the best possible product will ensure both your future business and your referral, and I need one as much as the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I argue with that, Miss...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Pennington.\u201d In close proximity, she appeared to be no older than Eliza.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I look around,\u201d he suggested, \u201cwhile you assist Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>Once again, Mrs. Pennington looked over her shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s selecting a half dozen of her favorite scented oils, which is what I would like you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will start with the same offerings, then.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Pennington gestured toward the back of the store. Jasper followed her prompting. As she opened up free space on a table, she continued to cast furtive glances at Eliza. Perhaps she feared thievery?</p><p>He held back and remained silent, not wanting to distract her from finishing her task as soon as possible. When she straightened, he listened to her instructions and assured her that he could whittle down the choices without further help.</p><p>When she left him, he watched her return to the front of the store and waited to see if she would eye him as often as she had Eliza. She did not. But Eliza did.</p><p>He\u2019d never known it could be so arousing to be ogled. He supposed it was because he had never been ogled by the right person.</p><p>Once Eliza was home again, she stripped off her gloves in the foyer, then looked at the post lying on a silver salver atop the console table. She set aside the few letters for Melville that appeared to be of a personal nature and collected the rest, intent on taking them up to her room. She wanted nothing so much as something to eat and a cup of tea.</p><p>She was halfway up the stairs when Melville called her name from below. Turning on the step, she smiled at him. \u201cYes, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I have a moment of your time?\u201d he queried, frowning while trying to straighten his crooked waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d As she descended, her gaze met the butler\u2019s. \u201cCould you ask Mrs. Potts to bring tea to his lordship\u2019s laboratory?\u201d</p><p>The servant\u2019s tall and lean frame moved quickly out of range of her sight.</p><p>Eliza followed Melville around the base of the staircase and collected his mail at the console. They passed her study door, then turned to the right at the end of the parquet-lined hallway. The room where his lordship spent much of his time was there. She made a chastising clicking noise with her tongue when she found the drapes drawn tight. A copious number of candles were scattered around the room, offering plenty of light...and smoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a glorious day outside,\u201d she chastised, dropping the day\u2019s post onto one of the long, slender laboratory tables before moving briskly over to the windows. She drew the drapes aside, then systematically unlocked each of the windows lining the length of the wall and pushed up the sashes.</p><p>\u201cToo bright,\u201d his lordship groused, blinking like an owl.</p><p>\u201cYou need sunlight. We humans don\u2019t thrive in dark places as mushrooms are wont to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMushrooms!\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cBrilliant, Eliza.\u201d</p><p>Melville quickly rounded his desk and began writing.</p><p>She pulled out one of the wooden stools that butted against a table bearing various-sized glass tubes and bottles. Waiting patiently, she blew out nearby candles that were unnecessary now that sunlight illuminated the large, disorganized space. The multitude of colorful liquids in jars cast jeweled beams of light onto the floor. In that moment, it was possible to see how Melville could become entranced by the mysteries he researched.</p><p>When Mrs. Potts bustled in with tea service on a tray, the intrusion seemed to snap his lordship into a renewed awareness of his location and his visitor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Eliza!\u201d his lordship cried, scratching his head. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>Eliza laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite all right.\u201d</p><p>She enjoyed these quiet moments with her uncle. In addition to being the only family she had remaining, he did not seek to fill perfectly good moments of silence with inane chatter. She did not have to consider\u2014and reconsider\u2014 everything she said, or phrase her words in ways that made them more understandable while also diluting their meaning.</p><p>Sliding off the stool, she stood in front of the tea service and began to prepare the tea.</p> <p>\u201cMontague paid a call on me today,\u201d Melville said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her brows went up. \u201cWhy does that make me apprehensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know why he came. He asked for permission to pay his addresses.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s breath left her in a rush. \u201cDid he give you cause to believe I would welcome his offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, he made it quite clear that while you find him to be one of the more agreeable of your suitors, you are not inclined to wed him.\u201d</p> <p>That made her smile. \u201cYet he made his request, regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was concerned by speculation regarding events at Somerset House yesterday. Some talk of your accident not truly being an accident at all.\u201d His lordship accepted the cup and saucer she passed to him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no need to bother you with the tale,\u201d she protested. \u201cIt was unfortunate, but no harm was done.\u201d</p><p>Melville gave her a calculated look. \u201cYou hired a thief-taker to protect you because of threats to your person, yet you dismiss this egregious event out of hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the flagrant nature of the event makes it unlikely to be unrelated to the rest,\u201d she argued. \u201cI could have been killed. What purpose would that serve anyone? And the location was so prominent, increasing the possibility of exposure. It doesn\u2019t align with the other attacks at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, I granted Montague\u2019s request.\u201d</p> <p>Eliza knew that tone; Melville\u2019s mind was set. \u201cI suspected you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy years are advancing. I would like you to have someone in your life to look after your well-being, someone whose loyalty is not bought with coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can look after myself.\u201d Wielding a pair of silver tongs, she prepared a plate for him, artfully arranging a freshly baked scone alongside slices of shaved ham.</p><p>\u201cBy hiring someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarrying Montague would be nigh on the same thing,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWith the addition of children and a permanent companion. Not to mention a title and the many responsibilities you would gain with it. You would be busy, fulfilled, and rarely alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy being alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot bear the thought of it.\u201d Melville set his cup down. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten our agreement. I know this is your sixth and final Season. You think you\u2019ll be happier rusticating in the country, but I disagree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRusticating is not quite what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Montague he had my permission to make the attempt to change your mind, and I wished him well. No harm in that, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be happy if I married anyone at all?\u201d she queried, adding milk to her tea. \u201cOr only Montague? You seem to like him quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met his father once or twice.\u201d Melville shrugged. \u201cHe seemed to be a pleasant enough fellow. And Montague is determined to have you. There is something to be said for that. But if there\u2019s someone else you prefer, I would champion him over Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord. I will keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re humoring me,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s lips curved against the rim of her cup. \u201cI am not. In fact, this discussion has me seeing Lord Montague in an entirely new light. You are correct: there\u2019s something to be said for his determination. And yours. Which I think was his point. He wanted me to know he\u2019s serious, and he wanted to ascertain whether or not he would have your support. He said he understands me better now, and perhaps that\u2019s true. Flowers will not win me, but cunning and unorthodox methods...At the very least, I admire his approach.\u201d</p><p>Not enough to wed him, but she didn\u2019t see any benefit to reiterating that point. She was enjoying tea with her uncle far too much to ruin it by being unnecessarily contrary. She gestured at his plate in a silent urging to eat.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he praised. \u201cHow is Mr. Bond\u2019s investigation progressing? Is he equally unconcerned by large statues nearly crushing you?\u201d</p><p>Just the sound of Jasper\u2019s name caused the tempo of her heartbeat to alter. \u201cNo. He was upset enough for both of us. If there\u2019s anything nefarious to be uncovered, he will find it. He would also like to meet with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Tell him to come by whenever is convenient for him. If he waits for me to remember to make an appointment, we shall never meet. I doubt I\u2019ll be of much help, however. I have never been with you when you\u2019ve been accosted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is investigating beyond the present,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe wishes to exclude anyone who might hold resentment toward you, Mother, or Mr. Chilcott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so...well, that\u2019s a reasonable avenue of inquiry.\u201d</p><p>They ate in companionable silence for a time, during which Eliza considered his comment about having a permanent companion. Up until now, she thought repasts such as she shared with Melville were all she needed. They rarely spoke while eating, and she enjoyed that. She hadn\u2019t considered how the silence might be deafening if she was the only one to fill it. There was a large difference between sitting quietly with someone else and sitting alone. She realized there was a certain comfort in knowing one could speak if one wanted to and chose not to, rather than being unable to speak because no one was there to listen.</p><p>\u201cWhat troubles you, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware denial is a common female response. But you are too direct for such evasions.\u201d</p><p>Eliza shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve found it best to hold my tongue, if choosing to do otherwise is guaranteed to lead to fruitless argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...Your mother. You will have to speak of her sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps then,\u201d he mumbled around a bite, \u201cyou will stop thinking of her before making decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not\u2014\u201d she started to protest, then fell silent when he shot her a look. He was right, as always.</p><p>Eventually, Melville drifted back to his notes and Eliza slipped off the stool with the intent of moving upstairs. The day\u2019s post caught her eye and she scooped it up, carrying it over to the small, shallow basket where Melville kept his mail. It was nearly overflowing. She shook her head. She\u2019d long ago learned to separate Melville\u2019s personal correspondence from the rest\u2014so that outstanding accounts were paid in a timely manner\u2014but clearly he was also neglecting to keep in touch with those who reached out to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat will it take,\u201d she asked, as she added to the pile, \u201cto motivate you to whittle this down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked up at her, then down at the basket. \u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d She pulled five off the top and brought them to him. \u201cCan we start with these?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>Eliza kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou are exacting your pound of flesh for Montague.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing as she left the room.</p><p>Jasper leaned back in his chair and drummed his fingertips on the desktop. \u201cHow long was he there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour,\u201d Aaron said, holding his hat to his chest with both hands. He stood just inside the doorway of Jasper\u2019s study, rocking back on the heels of his boots. \u201cPerhaps a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why Montague paid that call,\u201d Westfield prompted from his usual spot on the settee.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not. She refused him,\u201d Jasper bit out.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to gain Melville\u2019s support. Don\u2019t be obtuse, Bond. Women bow to familial pressure to marry men they don\u2019t want. It happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s fingers curled into his palm.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe Montague is responsible for Miss Martin\u2019s troubles?\u201d the earl asked.</p><p>\u201cI cannot be certain one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak to her.\u201d How had she taken the news? How far would she go to make Melville happy?</p><p>The thought of Eliza with Montague did horrible things to him.</p><p>It was a new sort of torment to be unable to see her now, to be barred from her company by rules and dictates he\u2019d ignored for years.</p><p>Straightening, he uncovered his inkwell and stabbed a quill into it. He dashed off a quick note, powdering the ink with fine-grained sand before folding. Then he sealed the whole and waved it at Aaron. \u201cTake this to the Melville residence.\u201d</p><p>Aaron approached and collected the missive.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin may need you after she reads it. Linger to be sure and if so, assist her. When you\u2019ve finished with that,\u201d Jasper went on, \u201cI want you to look into a Mrs. Pen-nington, who runs a newly opened shop on Peony Way. Pink-striped awning out front, lovely blonde inside. There is something not right with her. Find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Bond.\u201d</p><p>After the young man left, Westfield stood and walked to the console to avail himself of Jasper\u2019s brandy. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate Montague made so bold a move. Had it been anyone else paying addresses, you could have killed two birds with one stone by encouraging her to marry the gentleman\u2014 Montague would be barred from Miss Martin\u2019s fortune, and you could wipe your hands clean of the business by entrusting her safety to her future husband. Assuming you would be able to ascertain that her betrothed was not our culprit, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The thought didn\u2019t improve Jasper\u2019s mood at all. In fact, it worsened with the understanding that foiling Montague and successfully completing his assignment had fallen behind his desire to possess Eliza.</p><p>\u201cIt might also explain why he sent along the missive today,\u201d Westfield continued. \u201cThe assurance that he would be buying back the marker to his mother\u2019s property was prompted by something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike his father, he is arrogant to the point of idiocy.\u201d Unless Montague had something else shoring up his confidence...Jasper would research the possibility posthaste.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect you can accomplish by talking to Miss Martin?\u201d Westfield asked, turning to face him. \u201cDoes she trust you to play matchmaker as well as suitor?\u201d</p><p>Jasper snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou are so touchy lately, Bond,\u201d the earl complained. \u201cPerhaps you should take the evening off and indulge yourself at Remington\u2019s for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague can have any heiress he wants. Why is he so determined to have this one? Someone clearly on the shelf and possessed of a rare temperament? Someone who\u2019s told him she does not want him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the lure.\u201d Westfield sank into a chair in front of Jasper\u2019s desk. The earl looked both comfortable and bored, two states of being that were unknown to Jasper. \u201cA woman can be a bloody nuisance when she is overly fond of a man. If Miss Martin is inclined to spend much of her time in the country, Montague could have all of the benefits of marrying an attractive yet mature heiress, with none of the detriments. I know you find it hard to believe, Bond, but sometimes there are sound reasons for doing something. Not everything in this world is motivated by some evil plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is with Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain the son is so like the father? Or does that matter to you?\u201d</p><p>Jasper stood. \u201cQuite certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side. Perhaps Montague\u2019s move will speed things up a bit with your investigation. Now there\u2019s a more immediate timeline for the culprit to work against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sorry thing indeed when the reason for celebrating is that a madman could now be feeling desperate enough to act rashly.\u201d</p><p>Westfield sipped his libation and watched Jasper carefully. \u201cYou are like a caged beast. There is such an air of disquiet about you. I have never seen you this way before. Is ruining Montague so important to you?\u201d</p><p>It took Jasper a long moment to answer. He didn\u2019t want to share his state of mind; it was too personal and intemperate. \u201cHave you ever wanted something so badly you couldn\u2019t imagine not having it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a gelding once.\u201d Westfield held his glass between both palms, warming the liquor with his body heat. \u201cAt Tattersall\u2019s. I underbid. I stewed for weeks afterward. If I had the chance again, I would not be so cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you ridden it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I watched him be put through his paces. I examined him myself. Beautiful animal. I knew the moment I saw him that we would suit beautifully together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still regret the loss?\u201d</p><p>The earl shrugged. \u201cOn occasion. Not often. It was some time ago. I tell myself surely there was something wrong with the beast and I\u2019m fortunate to have avoided being saddled with it. Otherwise, fate would have seen fit to give him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in fate. I believe we make our own destiny.\u201d Jasper rubbed his jaw, absently noting that he should shave again. It was early evening and his skin was no longer smooth. It might burn Eliza when he kissed her.</p><p>If she came...</p><p>\u201cCertainly my situation is nothing like yours,\u201d Westfield said. \u201cYour need is rather like a thirst, is it not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThirst...yes.\u201d It was clear the earl was mistaking Jasper\u2019s lust for Eliza for a lust for vengeance. Jasper chose not to correct the assumption. \u201cThat\u2019s apt.\u201d</p><p>Unfolding from the chair, the earl polished off the last of his brandy. \u201cI will continue to assist you in your quest for revenge, Bond. You are not alone in this endeavor, whether you appreciate that or not.\u201d</p><p>How well the earl knew him to comprehend that he disliked being dependent upon anyone. \u201cYou\u2019ve done more than enough. The marker for Montague\u2019s property is my greatest wish realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely your mask.\u201d Westfield\u2019s smile was grim. \u201cYou are the one who has interceded in every investment that might have saved him. You are the one who funded the seasoned gamblers capable of winning against him. You are the one who has worked tirelessly for years to earn enough to squander a fortune to ruin him. Remind me never to anger you, Bond. You aren\u2019t a very nice fellow to those you dislike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are too honorable a man to do anything that would completely alienate me.\u201d With a smile, Jasper tossed the earl\u2019s words back at him, \u201cWhether you appreciate hearing that or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, don\u2019t make that statement within earshot of others, please.\u201d The earl looked at the clock. \u201cShould I return at ten o\u2019clock to begin our shadowing of Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>Jasper considered the time. It was shortly after five. \u201cLet\u2019s make it eleven, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will hear no complaints from me,\u201d Westfield said as he made his egress. \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time with you over the last few days than I have with a woman. No offense, but you aren\u2019t nearly as charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not,\u201d Jasper muttered, following the earl out to the hall en route to his rooms upstairs.</p> <p>\u201cI beg you to follow my lead and consider indulging in some female companionship yourself. It would be a relief to find you less surly this evening.\u201d</p><p>Jasper paused with his foot on the bottom step, absorbing the now familiar thrum of anticipation he felt whenever time with Eliza approached. \u201cDon\u2019t feel the need to be excessively timely,\u201d he said over his shoulder, before ascending the staircase two steps at a time.</p><p>\u201cThis coming from a man who is a stickler for punctuality?\u201d Westfield called after him. \u201cI believe you have caught the Melville madness.\u201d</p><p>Jasper thought that was apt, too.</p><p>Eliza wondered what the house looked like from the front. Alighting from the carriage in the mews afforded her only a backside glimpse of Jasper\u2019s home.</p><p>The young man who couriered Jasper\u2019s note to her urged her expeditiously through an iron gate and along a cobblestone pathway bisecting a garden that was immaculate, if uninspired. She was still absorbing the severity of the rear lawn when Jasper appeared. A shiver of delight moved through her.</p> <p>He filled the doorway leading into the house, his broad shoulders and tall frame backlit by the interior candlelight. His stance was wide, allowing light to shine between his legs, detailing the length and power of his thighs. He was fully dressed, but the expert fit of his breeches left nothing to the imagination. For the first time, she found the sight of a man\u2019s body inflaming. From the moment she first laid eyes on him, she\u2019d felt a disturbing and significant physical response to his proximity. It intensified daily, encouraged by every heated look and every casual touch.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d There was something intimate about the way he said her name.</p><p>She gained the first stair leading up from the garden and he held his hand out to her. It was gloveless and looked so strong and capable. She decided she loved his hands.</p><p>She tugged off her glove before she accepted his assistance, wanting to feel the warmth of his skin. A frisson of heated awareness moved up her arm. His grip tightened for a moment, as if he felt it, too. Looking up at him from beneath the hood of her cloak, she noted the stark austerity of his handsome features. He seemed so somber. So grave.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked, having been concerned from the moment his summons arrived.</p><p>\u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>Glancing behind her, she saw that the young man who\u2019d accompanied her had departed. There had been others with him, but they hadn\u2019t entered the gardens with her. Jasper\u2019s note advised her to ask his man to accompany her back, if she chose to visit him as he requested. Once she relayed her acquiescence, everything was arranged with amazing swiftness. She\u2019d been squired from Melville\u2019s house through the delivery alley and seen into a hired hackney. The winding and repetitive route they\u2019d taken ensured she wasn\u2019t followed.</p><p>Jasper led her inside and took her to a study. Her senses were engaged by the feel of the room the moment she entered it. The mixture of blue hues and mahogany wood was surprising; although she couldn\u2019t say what else she might have chosen for him. Large wingback chairs and overly stuffed settees spoke of comfort as well as functionality. She knew instantly that he spent a great deal of time in this room, which made her want to explore every corner of it.</p> <p>He came up behind her and set his hands on her shoulders. She stiffened, not with fear or apprehension, but expectantly. She heard him inhale slowly and deeply, as if savoring her scent. The action suited him. He was a man firmly attuned to his baser nature, reliant on his senses and instincts as all predatory and dominant creatures were. She was attracted to that side of him, deriving a potent thrill from being capable of stirring it.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, referring to her cloak.</p><p>Eliza nodded.</p><p>Her hood was lifted and pulled back, exposing her face to light from all around. He paused, his frame emanating an unmistakable tension. The act of removing her cloak suddenly became far more revealing. She understood then that he hadn\u2019t summoned her to discuss urgent business or anything else. The divestment of her exterior garments was the first step in the removal of all her clothing.</p><p>Her breath caught audibly and a fine tremor rippled through her.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s chin came to rest atop the crown of her head. His hands gripped her upper arms in a gentle yet unshakeable hold. \u201cWill you stay?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>She hesitated only a moment. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Eliza felt Jasper relax. She did not. How could she, having just agreed to give herself to a man she barely knew? For the first time in her life, she had ignored all reason and acted purely on feeling.</p><p>Just like her mother would have done...</p><p>She pushed the thought aside. She\u2019d made her decision and she would not regret it. \u201cWhat would you have done if I said no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged your mind.\u201d His fingers deftly released the frog at her throat. Her cloak began to slip and he caught it with a flourish.</p><p>Turning to face him, she watched as he draped the black velvet garment over the back of one of the pale blue settees. \u201cI\u2019m agreeing to something I have no knowledge of,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cPerhaps I will change my own mind.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stepped closer and cupped her face in his hands. \u201cIf so, I will desist. But I fully intend for you to beg me not to stop.\u201d</p><p>The physical response she had to his words was so violent it took her by surprise. He took advantage, his mouth sealing over hers and taking it, his tongue thrusting fast and deep. Eliza caught his wrists to keep her balance, her body otherwise frozen by the onslaught. A whimper escaped her and was swallowed by his answering groan.</p><p>He released her as quickly as he\u2019d caught her, stepping back and leaving her to stumble from the loss of his support. His chest lifted and fell rapidly. His gaze was heavy-lidded and hot.</p><p>\u201cThis is my study,\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cWhen I\u2019m home, this is the most likely place to find me.\u201d</p><p>Stunned by the sudden change in conversation and the distance between them, Eliza took a moment to register what he\u2019d said. \u201cIt suits you,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cCome along.\u201d Jasper held his hand out to her.</p><p>He pulled her gently from the room and back out to the visitor\u2019s foyer. There was a longcase clock against the wall, a large console with a lone silver salver atop it, and a rack for Jasper\u2019s cane. It was a purely functional space, lacking any adornments.</p><p>\u201cThe parlor is here,\u201d he said, steering her across a round Aubusson rug covering the marble floor.</p><p>From the threshold, she saw a fire in the grate and playing cards scattered across two separate tables. It looked as if a gathering had recently been there and would be returning shortly. The room was decorated in shades of yellow and cream. There was a large quantity of furniture, all of which was oversized and sturdily built. Still, the space felt sterile and uncluttered.</p><p>\u201cAt any given hour,\u201d he said, \u201cmany of my employees can be found in here. The downstairs is often noisy, filled with bawdy conversations and raucous laughter. This is the first time this room has been empty in many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Eliza understood that he\u2019d sent the men away because of her. \u201cWhen will they be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for many hours.\u201d</p><p>Her palms grew damp, a reaction he couldn\u2019t fail to note with her hand in his. \u201cWere you so certain of my capitulation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it, but I couldn\u2019t proceed as if failure was inevitable.\u201d He tugged her from the room. \u201cThere is also a dining room and ballroom on this floor, but I use neither, so they\u2019re unfurnished.\u201d</p><p>They moved toward the staircase and started to climb. With every step they took, her excitement mounted. Her breathing quickened and her face felt hot. There was an unmistakable finality to their upward progression, as if her fate had been set and she couldn\u2019t turn back now. Far from feeling trapped, she felt liberated. All afternoon, she\u2019d thought of Melville and Regina and Montague. She had weighed their admonishments and advice. And she\u2019d felt the mounting pressure to conform, to cede to the expected behavior and cast aside any lingering hope for independence.</p><p>\u201cThe third floor,\u201d he said, \u201chas three bedrooms and a nursery, which has been converted into a room for guests. Sometimes my men stay here, for various reasons. No one is here now. If you would like to see the rooms, I\u2019ll show them to you.\u201d</p><p>If he was trying to give her time to change her mind, it wasn\u2019t working. She was growing more agitated by the moment. Impatient. Restless. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at her. \u201cDoes anything about my home strike you in an unusual way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cBeautifully furnished. However, it is also oddly barren. Nothing adorns the walls or table surfaces. You\u2019ve hung no portraits of loved ones or pleasing landscapes. I had hoped to learn more about you by visiting, but I\u2019ve seen very little that tells a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne has to want things in order to purchase them. There\u2019s nothing I want. There has been nothing I\u2019ve seen in a shop window or in someone else\u2019s home that I have coveted.\u201d He paused with one foot on the next step. \u201cI think you might understand that lack of wanting. You attire yourself for purpose, not for vanity. You did not refurnish Melville\u2019s study when you commandeered it. You replaced what needed to be replaced and made do with the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people find that art and sentimental objects provide comfort and enjoyment. I, too, own a few items that are impractical but give me pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I such to you?\u201d he asked, his dark eyes shadowed with some emotion she couldn\u2019t name. \u201cAn impractical pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He started forward again. They reached the second floor landing and Eliza looked down the lone hallway, searching for and finding a lack of wall adornment. Aside from sconces to light the way, there was nothing to relieve the long expanse of soft green damask covering the walls.</p><p>His pace slowed from brisk to a near stroll. \u201cI have only ever wanted intangible things\u2014health and happiness for my mother, justice for wrongdoings, satisfaction in a job well done\u2014things of that nature. I have never understood why others become focused on particular objects. I\u2019ve never comprehended obsession or overwhelming need.\u201d</p><p>He spoke without inflection. There was nothing in what he said that betrayed any emotion, yet she felt a deeper undercurrent to his words.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d she asked softly, clutching his hand with both of her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one who uses this floor.\u201d He started forward. \u201cAside from my own rooms, the rest are vacant.\u201d</p><p>His repeated evasion of her questions was growing tiresome. She could not understand his mood. With her own emotions a confusing jumble, she didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to translate his feelings, too.</p><p>They reached a set of open double doors. Jasper gestured her in ahead of him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Eliza crossed the threshold. Like her room in Melville\u2019s house, Jasper\u2019s sitting room was predominantly burgundy in tone with occasional splashes of cream to alleviate the dark hue. But unlike her space, his was thoroughly masculine. There were no tassels or patterns to any of the materials, and no carvings in the wooden arms and legs of the chairs and tables.</p><p>The air smelled of him. She breathed the scent into her nostrils, finding it calming to her jangled nerves. Then, she looked at the open doorway to her left, the portal to Jasper\u2019s bedchamber, and her stomach knotted all over again.</p><p>\u201cThere are games women play,\u201d he murmured, his gaze hot enough to heat her skin. \u201cTests they devise to gauge a man\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sorts of tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make certain a man learns of their favorite flower or color or important dates, then wait to see if he will remember and gift them accordingly.\u201d</p><p>Her hands linked together nervously. Should she sit? Or remain standing as he did? She escaped into the conversation, not knowing what else to do. \u201cThe objects of feminine and masculine sentimentality are often widely different. To expect a man to assume what might be an unnatural form of sentiment to prove devotion is an unreasonable experiment with a high probability of failure. Why not accept his instinctual gestures of affection in whatever manner they are manifested? They likely mean more to him and reveal more about his character.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jasper\u2019s smile curled her toes. \u201cDo you have any notion of how sexually arousing I find your intellect? One day I should like you to expound upon this topic while I\u2019m inside you. I suspect I would find it highly erotic.\u201d</p><p>A flush swept over her face.</p><p>He shut the door to the hallway and locked it. The soft click of the latch rippled through her.</p><p>\u201cI tested you today,\u201d he said, with his back to her. \u201cConsidering how irritating I find such ploys, it astonishes me that I did so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I pass?\u201d</p><p>Facing her, he shrugged out of his coat. \u201cYou are in my home, so I would say so.\u201d</p><p>He swiftly unfastened the buttons of his waistcoat. Eliza found she could not look away, despite the voice in her head that lectured about privacy and proper maidenly modesty.</p><p>She cleared her throat so she could speak. \u201cYou sent for me without telling me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Montague had sent for you, would you have gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. He does not work for me.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stiffened. When he returned to the act of shaking off his waistcoat, it was with notable impatience. \u201cIf Reynolds had sent for you, would you have gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he works for you.\u201d</p><p>Clearly the expected responses were not the ones he wanted to hear. He wanted the truth.</p><p>\u201cI would not have expended the effort for anyone else,\u201d she admitted, her mouth drying as he untied and unwound his cravat, baring his throat. The sight was intensely provocative to her. His skin was darker than her own, firmer. She wanted desperately to touch it, to feel him swallow beneath her fingertips.</p> <p>He toed off his buckled shoes. \u201cThat was the test. I needed to know if you would place me in a different category from other men you know. I was also curious to see how deep your adventuresome proclivities were buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am far from adventuresome,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou would like to believe that.\u201d Jasper tossed his cravat on the floor, then yanked his shirtsleeves over his head.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s knees weakened and she staggered over to the nearest chair, half-sinking and half-falling into it.</p><p>Dear God, he was beautiful. Astonishingly, breathtakingly so. She remembered how he\u2019d urged her to touch him the first time he kissed her. He had been so hard beneath her questing fingers, like stone. She could see why. Her hand lifted to her throat. As dry as her mouth had been, it was now flooded with moisture.</p><p>She had never seen a rendering of a male body that could compare. The washboard-like cording of muscles across his abdomen and the light dusting of dark hair that thinned into a fine line were new to her. And delightful. Her gaze followed the trail to where it disappeared beneath the placket of his breeches.</p><p>Then lower...</p><p>He was hard there, too. Cupped by the expertly tailored doeskin, the outline of his erection was thick and prominent. The knot in her stomach tightened. He was such a blatantly masculine creature. Primitive in the most vital of ways. A male whose appetites were undoubtedly fierce and expansive. How could she, a woman who knew nothing about exploiting her own femininity, sate such a man?</p> <p>When he didn\u2019t move, she jerked her gaze upward to find him staring back at her. A tight smile preceded him taking a seat on the opposite settee. He had allowed her to look her fill, she realized. Unashamed of the visible proof of his lust. Unabashed.</p><p>Jasper rolled down his hose, one leg at a time. \u201cI need you to be adventuresome, Eliza. You wouldn\u2019t tolerate me and my profession for long if you were not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do more than tolerate you,\u201d she rejoined softly, having lost the strength to speak louder.</p><p>He stood, and her eyes stung. She was enamored with the sight of him. Smitten as she\u2019d thought she could never be. There was nothing she would alter about him, nothing she found fault with. In that moment, she was certain she would pay any price for the pleasure of looking upon him indefinitely. The sensations moving through her were drugging and addictive. She wondered helplessly if there was any way she could feel like this every day.</p><p>Approaching her with hand outstretched, he said, \u201cFrom the moment I first saw you, I desired you and knew I had to have you. Since then, I have come to realize it isn\u2019t mere craving that drives me. It is wanting, Eliza. I want you. I\u2019ve never wanted anything in my life, until you. Nothing. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? Gaining and losing a possession means nothing to me. There is always a replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She allowed him to pull her to her feet. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what conclusion to draw from that understanding.\u201d</p><p>He gestured for her to face away from him. \u201cI ceased trying to find reason in it. I cannot waste any more time trying to puzzle out what I don\u2019t know. I must act on what I do know\u2014you are the one thing in the world I want, and I can have you. I\u2019m also lacking the scruples that would prevent me from doing whatever is necessary to keep you. The details can be dealt with later, when I can once again think about something other than bedding you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers went to the buttons that secured the back of her gown and released them with laudable dexterity.</p><p>\u201cHave I no say in the matter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pressed his lips to the top of her bared shoulder. \u201cIf you intend to say you have no objections, speak away. Otherwise, I ask that you give me the next few hours before voicing anything that might make my task more difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>Eliza looked straight ahead, which was a straight-line view into Jasper\u2019s bedroom. The bed was directly in front of her, custom-made from the size of it. The back of her gown gaped open and he pushed it free of her shoulders, then down to the floor. \u201cStep out,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She obeyed, too overwhelmed to do otherwise. \u201cYou are giving me too much time to think,\u201d she groused, averting her gaze from the bed.</p><p>Jasper laughed softly, the moment of levity sufficient to lighten some of the incertitude preying on her. \u201cWould you prefer to be ravished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer not to have these fits of nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to ravish you.\u201d He loosened her stays. \u201cNot tonight, when I need both of us to have no doubt that you came to my bed willingly, but soon.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, she held her loosened corset to her breasts. Jasper rounded her and backed up, putting distance between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost naked,\u201d she bit out, wanting him to do something. Why was he standing so far away? Even if he extended his arms their full length, he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach her.</p><p>\u201cI am highly aware of that fact.\u201d Reaching down, he stroked himself through his breeches, his long fingers rubbing along the length of the pronounced bulge.</p><p>\u201cHave you no shame?\u201d Her tone was curt, her emotions high. She was a virgin, for God\u2019s sake, and he was giving her too much breathing room. She was achingly aware of everything around her, when what she wanted was to be lost to the barrage of sensations he could so easily overwhelm her with.</p><p>\u201cNone at all. And I would like for you to have none either. Eliza...\u201d His tone softened. \u201cDid I not explain myself clearly? Don\u2019t you understand that you are uniquely appealing to me? You worry that exposing your body will make you vulnerable, but I\u2019m the one who will be left raw by the experience.\u201d</p><p>She stood there for a long moment, lip quivering. He was forcing her to reason everything out during the one occasion when she didn\u2019t want to think at all.</p><p>Jasper watched her with those intense dark eyes, his body made golden by the flickering candlelight. How many times had he experienced this sequence of events to be so nonchalant? Dozens? More...?</p><p>She would not be surprised. What woman could resist him?</p><p>She was resisting him....</p><p>Her jaw clenched. He was right to avoid responsibility for her choice to be here. It was her decision, and she needed to claim it. Why should she tell herself that she was acting on instinct when that was a lie?</p><p>She was not like her mother. She was not driven to rashness by passion. She knew damn well what she was doing.</p><p>Eliza launched herself at him. Two running steps and a wild leap, and she was upon him. He caught her, laughing. Lifting her feet from the floor, he spun and strode into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cNot adventuresome?\u201d he teased, setting her down at the foot of the bed. He looked at her with such an expression of proprietary pride that her throat tightened.</p><p>Pivoting on his bare feet, Jasper locked the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were the only ones here?\u201d she queried, her heart still racing from her leap off the proverbial cliff.</p><p>\u201cYou are assuming I\u2019m locking others out, instead of locking you in...\u201d</p><p>The thought of capture excited her. She had run willingly into the lion\u2019s den, and now there was no turning back.</p><p>He leaned back against the door, his palms pressed flat to the panels and one ankle crossed over the other. The perfect appearance of insouciant leisure. But he\u2019d never been able to hide his predaceous nature from her. She had seen it from the first and she saw it now: the high color on his throat and cheekbones, the fine sheen of sweat on his chest, the flaring of his nostrils, and the narrowed, concentrated gaze.</p><p>One wrong move and he would pounce...</p><p>Reaching up, she began to pull the pins from her hair. She dropped them on the floor, one by one, as he\u2019d done with his cravat. There was something oddly freeing in that carelessness. The act of tossing aside the trappings that restrained. Here in this room with Jasper, she could finally cast off the confusing strictures of society and be what she had always wanted to be\u2014liberated and independent.</p><p>After the last pin dropped, she shook out her hair, relishing the tingling of her scalp. She was clad in only her loosened stays and pantalettes, but she was not embarrassed or cold. There was no way she could be, when warmed by a stare as heated as Jasper\u2019s.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, barely blinked. As the silence lengthened, she lost courage and clasped her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, Eliza.\u201d His hand lifted to his chest and rubbed, as if to soothe a pain there. \u201cI adore your freckles. Do you have them everywhere?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip and nodded. \u201cIt is the bane of red hair, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kiss every one of them,\u201d he vowed. \u201cThey are delightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFustian,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cNo one likes freckles.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s eyes twinkled in the light of the bedside tapers. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything about me you adore? Any part of me you want to kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am mad for every inch of you,\u201d she pronounced with heartfelt fervency. \u201cThe way you smell. The cut of your hair. The line of your jaw. I\u2019m especially taken with your hands. I can feel the strength in them when you touch me. You could crush my bones in your grip, but instead you are so gentle.\u201d</p><p>He held both hands out, offering them to her. She rushed forward, knowing his touch would calm and distract her. \u201cSometimes I fear crushing you,\u201d he confessed with a hitch in his voice.</p><p>Catching his hands with hers, Eliza pressed a kiss into each palm. \u201cIs that why you stand so still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do, if you had no need for restraint?\u201d</p><p>As before, he brought her hand to rest over his heart, allowing her to feel its racing. \u201cI would pin you to this door behind me and take you, swift and hard. Then I would lay you on the floor, spread you wide, and have you again. Slowly. Deeply. Eventually, we might make it to the bed, but I couldn\u2019t guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds...savage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel that way. If I could curb the need I have for you, I would. Perhaps, after tonight, it will be more manageable. I pray that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>The roughness in his voice was a caress of its own. Freed from the pressure of her stays, the tips of her breasts throbbed and puckered tight. She was eye level with his chest, which made her wonder if his nipples were as sensitive as hers. The flat disks were surrounded by gooseflesh. Giving in to the urge, Eliza leaned forward and warmed one with a lick of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he bit out, jerking violently.</p><p>Jasper spun her away from him in a dizzying pivot. The ripping of her stays was like a crack of thunder in the room, followed by the rush of cool air across her back and the soft tickle of her hair beneath her shoulder blades. Her pantalettes were next, the tie at her waist digging briefly into her flesh before breaking in half. The flesh-colored stockinette was rent into two halves that clung to her ankles by the fastenings there.</p><p>She\u2019d barely registered that she was excited by his loss of control when a hand at her lower back steered her forward, straight up the short steps at the foot of the bed and onto the mattress.</p><p>On her hands and knees, she crawled across the burgundy counterpane, highly conscious of everything she was exposing to him in the process. His hand caught her ankle when she reached the middle of the massive bed, halting her. She dropped to her stomach in a bid for modesty. The remnants of her pantaloons were stripped from her legs and discarded.</p><p>Eliza didn\u2019t move, barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>She had to force herself to think about her feelings. \u201cI d-don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stretched out beside her, his arm extended above their heads. With his other hand, he urged her to roll to her side, so that her back was against his sweat-dampened chest. He leaned forward and rested his cheek against her shoulder, his silky hair brushing softly against her skin. His arm came around her waist and held her tightly to him. He didn\u2019t move. Eventually, she relaxed into his warmth, inhaling the scent of him, which was made stronger by the tremendous heat of his body. He felt fevered against her flesh.</p><p>It took long moments, but over time his temperature cooled and his breathing slowed.</p><p>\u201cJasper...?\u201d</p><p>His hand at her waist moved higher, cupping a breast. She tensed again at the unfamiliar touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShh,\u201d he murmured, gentling her.</p><p>The feel of his breath gusting across her ear made her nipple harden into his palm. A rough sound escaped him and his hand flexed convulsively around her.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you what you did to me,\u201d he whispered, withdrawing enough to coax her onto her back.</p><p>Eliza stared up at him, awed anew by how handsome he was. How was it possible that such a man would find her so desirable?</p> <p>She didn\u2019t care. She was just grateful for her good fortune.</p><p>With no further warning, he lowered his head and surrounded her nipple with the humid heat of his mouth. She arched upward with a gasp, startled by the violence of her response. His tongue curled around the aching tip, and his cheeks hollowed on a deep suckle. She cried out, her nails scratching into the velvet coverlet. His callused fingertips rolled her other nipple, then tugged. She began to pant.</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>He growled and sucked harder, his tongue stroking the underside of the straining point with wicked skill. The flesh between her thighs pulsed in time to the rhythm of his mouth, clenching deep and feeling empty. Her hips lifted, seeking. The hand at her breast slid lower, across the flat of her belly and into the dark red curls at the apex of her thighs.</p><p>The shock of the caress froze her. She was too sensitive there, too wet and swollen.</p> <p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d His voice was so gruff, she barely recognized it.</p><p>He withdrew and caught her wrist, urging her hand to mold around the outline of his erection. He showed her how to move, rubbing her palm up and down his thick length. Heat rushed up her arm and spread throughout her body, easing her stiffened muscles. Exploiting her distraction, he resumed his quest, his fingers slipping through the lax barrier of her thighs. His palm cupped her, the breadth of his hand easily laying claim to the part of her that had always been intensely private.</p><p>His dark head lifted. He watched her reaction as his fingers moved, gliding through the slickness clinging to the entrance of her body.</p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d he breathed. \u201cLet me feel how wet you are.\u201d</p><p>When she hesitated, he took her mouth, his lips slanting across hers in a brazen seduction. His tongue followed the outer curve of her lower lip, tracing the shape before teasing the seam with flirtatious licks. She opened with rapacious hunger, her head lifting in an attempt to deepen the kiss. He pulled back, maintaining the provocative distance between them, denying her the full possession she sought.</p><p>Eliza made a frustrated sound and his fingers tapped lightly against her sex.</p> <p>Challenged by his silent bargain, she spread her legs, draping one thigh over his so nothing was barred from him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His lips lowered to hers. \u201cBe wanton...\u201d</p><p>His tongue and fingertip breached her simultaneously, above and below. She writhed into the unexpected intrusion, moaning as sweat misted her skin. She gripped his erection with desperately clenching fingers. Bolder than she\u2019d ever imagined she could be.</p><p>\u201cSo snug.\u201d His finger pushed inexorably deeper, then pulled back. When he stroked back into her, her legs fell open, and her hips arched. \u201cSnug and very hot.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips found the plush head of his penis straining above the waistband of his breeches. She hungrily explored the satiny curve, fascinated with the heat and silky smooth texture. Moisture beaded on the crown. She wished she could clench the length of him, caress him fervently from root to tip.</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d he said harshly, pulling back from her.</p><p>She grasped for him to no avail. He slipped further down the bed, away from her greedy lips and tormented breasts.</p><p>\u201cJasper!\u201d she protested, trying to sit up but losing the leverage to do so when he pushed his shoulders under her legs.</p> <p>There was a blazing moment when she realized what he wanted, then her thoughts scattered beneath the lash of his tongue. An unvoiced protest died on her lips. She couldn\u2019t muster the will to stop him, even to appease her scandalized sense of modesty. Instead she moaned and rocked into his mouth, trying to find his rhythm so she could ease the terrible yearning within her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way,\u201d he coaxed darkly, lifting her hips.</p><p>His tongue lapped through the tender folds of her sex, parting her, licking her with velvet roughness. He toyed with her, flickering over the knot of nerves with the pointed tip of his tongue. She bucked upward, knowing there had to be more. Wanting more. Needing it. She mewled in torment.</p><p>His finger returned, sliding easily through greedily clenching tissues.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d she moaned, her eyes squeezing shut against the unbearable intimacy. \u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>In and out. Pushing and withdrawing. Pumping. She writhed, and he pinned her hips with a heavy arm.</p><p>Two fingers. Her body shuddered violently at the unfamiliar stretching. His mouth surrounded her, tongued her, sucked her...</p><p>Eliza climaxed with a serrated cry, her fingers digging into the counterpane, her thighs quivering.</p><p>At the height of her pleasure, Jasper thrust his fingers deep and scissored them, rending the barrier of her virginity. She scarcely felt the pain, so lost was she to the wonder of his talented tongue.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop, groaning as if he felt the same surfeit of feeling, prolonging the waves of sensation until she pushed his head away, unable to bear any more.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Jasper pressed a kiss to a freckle on Eliza\u2019s thigh before sliding off the end of the bed. She curled onto her side, flushed and trembling, her slim, pale limbs drawn tight to her body. Her blue eyes followed his movements, looking dazed and sated at once.</p><p>His blood was raging, his cock throbbing. He yanked open the placket of his breeches and pushed them down. Kicking them aside, he took his penis in his hand and stroked the pulsing length. Crimson skeins of moisture\u2014her virginal blood\u2014clung to his fingers. The sight aroused him, luring his seed to leak from the tip of his cock.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed her far and fast, needing to take her past the twin hurdles of inexperience and virginity so he could have her as he needed to. He had tried to warn her, attempted to explain, forced himself to give voice to a craving he didn\u2019t understand. Small comfort to a woman overwhelmed by her first physical attraction.</p><p>Jasper had taken advantage of that fact, remembering how riotous the flush of first lust was, how ill-considered and desperate it felt. He remembered it well, because Eliza made him feel that way again. Hot-blooded. Randy. Impatient.</p><p>With harsh strides, he went to the washstand and grabbed a handful of freshly laundered towels. On the way back to the bed, he caught up the bottle of oil he\u2019d purchased at Mrs. Pennington\u2019s shop. He tossed the towels on the counterpane, then poured a small pool of the fragrant golden liquid into his palm. The bottle was set aside on the nightstand by Eliza\u2019s head.</p><p>Deliberately, he rubbed his hands together, releasing the scent of bergamot and spice into the air. He\u2019d chosen a masculine scent on purpose, wanting it to linger in her mind after the night was over, goading her to remember the things he had done to her body. Thus far she hadn\u2019t been subject to the sorts of lewd imaginings he suffered through, but he intended that to change. Whether she was balancing her ledgers or dancing with blasted suitors, Jasper wanted her to be thinking of sex with him.</p><p>Eliza watched, riveted, as he gripped his cock at the root and stroked upward, pulling and stretching, swelling further until he was certain he\u2019d never been this hard and thick. Ropey veins coursed the length of him, making him look as brutal as he felt. His bollocks were drawn up tight and hard, his seed churning with the need for release.</p><p>She made a soft, anxious noise.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he asked for the second time that evening. Knowing she had to be. Aware that he would have been kinder to shield her from his size until she knew enough to appreciate it. But he was willing to cast aside what little gentlemanly considerations he had to gain what he wanted from her, using every advantage he possessed to distinguish himself from the others who hoped to win her and take her from him. She liked to look at him. And she was attuned to him on the most basic level. Her mind might shy away from his primitive display, but her body understood...and would react accordingly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered softly, her knees drawing closer to her abdomen. \u201cI have always known you were too much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want me regardless. Face the other way.\u201d</p><p>Rolling, she gave him her back. She curled in a manner that drew her feet up to the lush curve of her buttocks. The discovery of her voluptuous derriere had been a delightful surprise when she\u2019d crawled across his bed earlier. On the surface, Eliza appeared as moderate in form as she was in temperament, but even in this, her private landscape was the most picturesque. He was certain her backside was the most perfect he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWho knew you hid such a curvaceous bottom beneath your clothes?\u201d he murmured, joining her and pressing a kiss to a cluster of freckles on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou tease me,\u201d she accused without heat.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke of men who appreciate certain hues of hair.\u201d Jasper wrapped his body around her, pulling her against his chest with an arm around her slender waist. \u201cIs it so hard to believe I might have my own preferences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor freckles and buttocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Eliza. All of you.\u201d He inhaled sharply when she leaned into him, and he became further inflamed by the smell of her. \u201cMy patience is thinner than I would wish,\u201d he confessed hoarsely. \u201cI must beg you in advance for greater license. You trust me with your life; will you trust me in this? Trust me to give you pleasure, even if I am rough or hurried?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him over her shoulder. Her lower lip was caught between her teeth and her eyes were shadowed, but she nodded.</p><p>With no further preliminaries, he took his cock in his hand and arched his hips forward. Her breath hissed out when he tucked the thick head against her and slid upward, parting the slick folds of her sex and gliding across her clitoris. Up, then down. On the downstroke, the furled underside of his cockhead caught the swollen knot of nerves. On the upstroke, the swollen crest rubbed over it. He notched the tiny protrusion into the weeping hole at the tip of his cock and stroked himself from root to crown with his fist. A hot pulse of pre-ejaculate flowed over her sensitive flesh. She moaned, arching backward.</p><p>Jasper restrained her with a hand at her breast, fighting his turbulent need to pound into her and spew violently, expending his lust in a violent taking that would slake his craving. The sense of desperation was nigh intolerable. He couldn\u2019t shake the apprehension that she might be removed from his grasp before he was ready. It was too soon. His need for her too sharp...</p><p>Eliza\u2019s hand covered his.</p><p>Her nipple pebbled into his palm, tightening deliciously. He felt its sensitivity when he kneaded the whole of her breast. Her entire body trembled, and her hips pushed back. Her legs parted, one foot hooking behind his calf, giving her leverage to undulate against him.</p><p>She was finally unrestrained, and it was better than he\u2019d imagined. She whispered his name. He pulled back, finding the clutching entrance to her body. There was a moment of hesitation; a brief second when reason reminded him that she was above him in station. Too good for him.</p><p>His jaw clenched. He pushed his cockhead deliberately into her tight, resisting flesh. She was scorching hot and drenched.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he hissed, seared by the silken heat of her. The delicate muscles inside her bore down on the exquisitely sensitive head of his cock. A violent shudder wracked his frame.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s head thrashed against his chest. Her nails dug into the forearm he pinned her with. Her movements altered, writhing away instead of into him. She tried to close her legs, but he blocked her, moving his hand from her breast to her cunt in a lightning-quick lunge.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he said gruffly, pushing deeper. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>Registering the tremendous strain in Jasper\u2019s voice, Eliza tried to obey, gasping air into seized lungs. He slid deeper, despite the panicked clench of untried tissues. She understood the use of the oil now. It gave her body no traction to deny him, no means of resistance.</p><p>Her eyes closed on a shuddering exhale. Her mind filled with the vision of Jasper standing beside the bed fully naked, skin gleaming, abdominal and chest muscles rippling from the rough movement of his hands on his magnificent erection. She knew how to judge proportions. She\u2019d known she could never accommodate him, but she wanted to. Needed to.</p><p>He withdrew a scant inch. She sucked air into her burning lungs, and his hips lunged forward, tunneling his rigid penis into her. She made a broken sound, unprepared for the feeling of being so utterly possessed.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He stilled, panting, his chest working like a great bellows against her back. His cheek nuzzled against her temple. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Too full.\u201d Stretched to the point of aching, but she was not pained.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me.\u201d His fingers rubbed between her legs, starting a hot, sweet trickle of sensation in her core. \u201cLet me in, Eliza. Don\u2019t fight it.\u201d</p><p>Eyes stinging, she gave a tentative, tiny swivel of her hips. He slid a fraction deeper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he purred, nudging forward then withdrawing. \u201cLike that.\u201d</p><p>She forced her taut frame to relax, sagging back against his supportive chest and deliberately modifying her breathing. Slow deep breath in. Steady breath out. She concentrated on his touch, the way he expertly circled her clitoris with callused fingertips, urging pleasure outward across devastated nerve endings.</p><p>On her next inhale, he thrust, sinking into her until his thighs were pressed tight to hers. Her held fell forward on a low moan.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, he was so deep in her...</p><p>He pulled out with painstaking slowness, then filled her again. With every withdrawal and return, his movements became more fluid. Practiced. His expertise became apparent. He knew just how far to pull out, how leisurely to push in, how deep to penetrate to drive her mad for the feel of him inside her. Her enjoyment grew, until she sought the pleasure purposefully, writhing into his thrusts to feel the sweet fullness she craved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A low rumble of approval vibrated against her back. \u201cYou like this.\u201d</p><p>She gasped at a particularly masterful stroke. The intimidating size of his erection was now something she relished. He was so long and thick. The largeness of him ensured that he rubbed and stretched every sensitive spot, awakening a voracious hunger. She struggled against him, resisting the position he kept her in that prevented her from increasing his depth and pace.</p><p>\u201cTell me you like this,\u201d he coaxed darkly, rolling his hips and fingers simultaneously, arousing her with consummate skill so she clenched greedily around him. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She whimpered in torment, aching every time he pulled out and left her empty. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can give it to you.\u201d His tone was rough and deeply sexual. \u201cTell me what you want, Eliza, and you can have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged, shameless in her yearning. \u201cGive me more...\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s hand cupped her swollen sex and pulled her back into a powerful lunge of his hips. Heat washed over her. His pace increased, the flat of his palm applying just enough pressure to stimulate her on the outside as well as within. Sweat coated her skin and his, making them slide along each other, releasing the fragrance of the oil and Jasper\u2019s scent into the air. The room became hot and the counterpane damp, creating a lush humidity that intensified the experience. He whispered lewd praise, his words slurring with pleasure, his abdomen and thighs flexing powerfully as he drove into her. Tears filled her eyes, the tension so fine she felt as if she might break at any moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d he groaned, holding still at the deepest point and grinding against her, screwing into her another fractional bit. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p> <p>She arched violently. The climax hit, her vision narrowing until it blackened completely. Her mouth opened in a silent cry of pleasure. Inside, she convulsed, tightening on him in the most intimate of embraces. Blood roared in her ears, drowning out all sound.</p><p>A thick wash of heat flooded the depths of her. Jasper cursed and jerked against her, shuddering in unison with every wrenching spurt.</p><p>Eliza felt her name on his lips as he emptied himself inside her, his mouth moving against her shoulder in a sweetly broken litany.</p><p>There was no place in Jasper\u2019s life for Eliza Martin.</p><p>He lay on his side with his head propped in his hand, watching her as she napped. Strands of her beautiful hair clung to her damp forehead and cheeks. Her lips were parted, her chest lifting and falling in the measured tempo of slumber. She lay on her stomach, baring twin dimples in each curve of her extremely enticing buttocks.</p><p>Spread out as she was, naked and rosy-skinned and debauched, it was easy to imagine keeping her there in his bed. But it was only an illusion. His gaze lifted and swept around the nearly empty room. Aside from the bed and washstand, there was only a wardrobe and chair for furnishings. This evening with Eliza was the longest stretch of time he\u2019d spent awake in his bedchamber since he took up residence in the house. In the normal course of his life, there would be laughter and loud voices filtering up from the lower floor. He would be adhering to a tight schedule, working as many hours as possible to keep income flowing. After all, there was nothing he wanted done that didn\u2019t require coin to see to it.</p> <p>Try as he might, Jasper couldn\u2019t picture Eliza in any part of his home beyond this private space. The men who worked for him were coarse and sometimes ill-mannered. They would have no notion of what to do with a lady like Eliza. He had no dining table at which to feed her, no formal parlor in which she could entertain what few guests would deign to call on her here. His home was less than half the size of Melville\u2019s and located in a part of town that, while acceptable, had never been fashionable.</p><p>Things would have to change drastically...</p><p>Eliza made a soft noise. He looked at her and found her rousing. She blinked, then rubbed at her eyes. He watched her vision focus on him. Awareness swept over her face along with a heated blush. She grew unnaturally still.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he murmured, smiling. \u201cYou look scandalized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look smug,\u201d she accused, but with warmth in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He stroked his hand down the curve of her back. How could he resist, when she looked at him as she was doing now? \u201cIf I do, so should you.\u201d</p><p>He knew some of her feelings were inspired by the aftermath of orgasmic bliss and gratitude for it, but some of them were more deeply rooted. God knew he had never expected nor wanted anyone to love him, but he\u2019d have a better chance of keeping Eliza if her attachment deepened.</p><p>She looked at her fingers, which toyed with a wrinkle in the counterpane. \u201cI did nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper tapped the end of her nose with his finger. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take my word for it. There are many ways to have sex, ranging from horribly disappointing to quite nicely done. What you and I just experienced is another sort of matter altogether. It takes two people with singular chemistry to achieve such a delectable end.\u201d</p><p>Eliza remained strangely quiet.</p><p>\u201cSixpence for your thoughts,\u201d he said, aware of tension eating into his contentment. \u201cIs regret setting in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No regrets,\u201d she replied carefully, glancing at him. \u201cThe first day we met, you spoke of rare skills in sexual congress, and clearly you have them. What woman could regret ending up in your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts on the matter are the only ones that concern me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how that can be true. I didn\u2019t even touch you. You were required to do all of the work\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he leaned over and pressed a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cSweetheart, that was far from \u2018work.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have done something!\u201d she protested, looking less shy and more animated. She set her chin in her hand, which elevated her torso just enough to bare the upper curve of her breasts. \u201cI feel sorely inadequate.\u201d</p><p>Jasper was somewhat startled by the ferocity with which he was stirring again, simply from the sight of her and the thought of her deliberately arousing him. \u201cRubbish. If you had been any more adequate, the business would have been done before I was inside you. That\u2019s why I made a point of facing you away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made certain I could not participate?\u201d Eliza frowned. \u201cI find that very unsporting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsporting?\u201d He grinned, enjoying her immensely as always. In all of his days, he\u2019d yet to bed a woman who wanted to put more effort into pleasing him. Leastwise, not any he hadn\u2019t paid for their services.</p><p>He gestured at his cock, which was half-hard. The semi-erection should not have been possible, not after the galvanic orgasm he\u2019d been devastated by only a short time ago. \u201cMen are easily enticed into the necessary physical state for sexual congress. It takes considerably more effort to arouse a woman. That\u2019s why so many are left disappointed\u2014in the race to climax, men always run the distance faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointed? How can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me for more,\u201d he reminded. \u201cImagine if I had given you less, or worse, said I was finished and it was a shame you couldn\u2019t keep pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...But you would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do that,\u201d he agreed. Even if it meant nearly killing himself every time he had her.</p><p>She pushed up, stealing his wits with the unexpected view of her perfect breasts. They were neither large\u2014as he\u2019d erroneously thought he preferred\u2014nor small. When she sat back on her heels with her hands on her knees, he found himself speechless.</p><p>Then, her eyes widened and she bit her lower lip. Red-faced, she made a move as if to leave the bed.</p><p>He caught her wrist. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a towel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Sitting up, he grabbed one he\u2019d thrown on the bed earlier. With his other hand, he gestured for her to widen her kneeling stance.</p><p>\u201cJasper...\u201d Eliza was clearly mortified.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d he said, tapping his shoulder in a silent order for her to put her hand there for balance. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>His cock hardened at the visible evidence of how explosively he\u2019d climaxed. She was soaked with his semen. Thick trickles of it coursed down either thigh. He could hardly believe he was ready for her again. By all rights, he should be drained dry.</p><p>He cleaned her as gently as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou knew to have towels ready,\u201d she noted breathlessly, as he parted her delicately and dried the dark red curls between her legs. \u201cI should have suggested sheep-gut condoms. I...I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my responsibility to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in public and when you are dressed. When you\u2019re naked, your body belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cDoes your body belong to me when it\u2019s bared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothed and unclothed, for as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d If he had his way, even longer than that...</p><p>Jasper looked her in the eye. \u201cI always use French letters, Eliza. I haven\u2019t gone without one since I was young and too ignorant to know better. I assure you, that was many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget tonight? Or find you lacked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget.\u201d He paused in his ministrations. \u201cTomorrow, when you\u2019re repaired and rested and feeling entirely in control of your mental faculties, we\u2019ll discuss everything that transpired tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips dug into his shoulder. \u201cYou deliberately spilled your seed inside me? Did you not think of the consequences I might face? Have you no care for me?\u201d</p><p>Dropping the towel, Jasper caught her around the waist and tugged her against him. \u201cI would do anything for you. Break any law, violate every rule, circumvent any competition\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague,\u201d she interjected, comprehension leaving her jaw slack. \u201cYou know he visited with Melville, and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with Montague,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI want you. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave myself to you freely.\u201d Eliza tried to wriggle away. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to...mark me, as if you were marking your territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He gripped her with as much tenderness as her resistance allowed. \u201cThe moment you saw me, you knew what I was. My nature is no surprise to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hired you to protect me!\u201d</p><p>Jasper inhaled sharply, cut to the quick by the truth of what she said. \u201cChrist, Eliza.\u201d</p><p>He released her, but she didn\u2019t pull away. Instead she stared at him, breathing roughly. With her face and pale shoulders framed by gloriously hued tousled locks, she was the loveliest creature he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cNot for what you did,\u201d she surmised. \u201cBut because I\u2019m unhappy about it.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing he could say to that. Lying to her was not an option.</p><p>The silence stretched out. They were only inches apart, both kneeling. He sat on his heels; she was upright, bringing them nearly eye to eye. He waited on tenterhooks, wondering if she would want to leave and what he could do to convince her to stay. Seducing a woman in a temper often led to hot sex, but the fury afterward was hotter still. He couldn\u2019t risk pushing her any further away.</p><p>Damnation, he would give anything to know what she was thinking...</p><p>\u201cI can almost hear your brain working,\u201d Eliza said, studying him. \u201cCare to tell me what thoughts occupy you so completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brain isn\u2019t as refined as yours, so I am at a loss for what to do. Tell me how to sweeten you toward me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mystified by the ferocity of your possessiveness. You could have anyone.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cThe only thing distinguishing me is my fortune. Is that what you covet so strongly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd I will point out that you, too, could have anyone.\u201d</p><p>She gave his shoulder a little push. \u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>Jasper fell to his back without reservation, willing to do whatever she required to redeem himself. However, there was nothing repentant about his cockstand, which eagerly extended almost to his navel. He\u2019d progressed from nearly erect to flagrantly so the moment she became aggressive.</p><p>\u201cSince your body is now mine, by your own admission,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI should like to examine it.\u201d</p><p>He lay unmoving, submitting...for now.</p><p>Eliza gestured at his penis. \u201cI should like to see it at rest sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle chance of that happening. Merely thinking of you makes me hard.\u201d He should, perhaps, couch his sentiments more delicately, but since his lust for Eliza was raw, it was more honest to word it thusly.</p><p>She reached out and caressed his biceps. When the muscle twitched beneath her touch, she pulled back with a squeak.</p><p>Jasper caught her hand and put it back. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened or shy. Whatever you do, I promise to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want you to simply enjoy it,\u201d she argued, meeting his gaze. \u201cI want to be exceptionally good at pleasing you. I want to be memorable.\u201d</p><p>Jasper exhaled in a rush, the allusion to temporariness goading every proprietary instinct he possessed.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s fingers moved featherlight over the flesh of his upper arm. Then, she grew bolder and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cYou are so hard,\u201d she whispered. Her gaze moved over his chest and abdomen, followed by her hands. She lingered over his stomach, tracing every ridge of muscle. \u201cAnd large. You are like a great, sleek beast. A virile animal.\u201d</p><p>A visible shiver moved through her, which set off an answering response in him. \u201cYou like that about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. You are too wild and undisciplined. I\u2019m not woman enough to tame you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want me tamed.\u201d He caught her hand again and urged it to his cock, prodding her fingers to wrap around him. Her tentative touch was like lightning, causing the hair on his legs to prickle. \u201cPart of you may be appalled at my primitive approach to certain matters, but part of you wouldn\u2019t have me any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take no credit for your attraction. My parents are responsible for my appearance, and my ruthlessness is equally inherent. I am, however, grateful they win your regard. Contrary to your opinion, you are the perfect female for me.\u201d</p><p>Her other hand joined the first, cupping him. Her hands were so slender; she could not circle him in her grip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat wins your regard?\u201d she asked, tracing a thick vein with her fingertip.</p><p>\u201cYour honesty and good s-sense,\u201d he hissed, shuddering as she clasped the head of his cock in her palm. \u201cYour agile mind and independent thought. And the way you respond to me physically. By God, I cannot get enough of that. You melt for me, softening all those hard edges you use to keep others at bay.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s tongue followed the curve of her lower lip. Her eyes had grown heavy-lidded, betraying how well she enjoyed touching him so intimately. Or perhaps it was what he\u2019d said. Jasper reached up and cupped her breast, his thumb and forefinger surrounding the delicate peak and tugging. She made a soft noise of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLie atop me,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She hesitated, looking unsure. He showed her the way, steadying her with his hands on her waist as she draped her slim body over him. Cupping her nape, he pulled her lips down to his. He kissed her with open-mouthed hunger, drinking her in with deep draws on her tongue. She kissed him back with equal fervency, her lips slanting across his, her hands clutching the counterpane on either side of him.</p> <p>He groaned, feeling ravenous but wanting no more than this for now. It wasn\u2019t enough and yet it was too much, the act of kissing both erotic and sweet. The feel of her slight weight stretched across him was one he adored, and the sudden smattering of tiny kisses she pressed all over his lips made him laugh with delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, knowing he could never give up this intimacy. He was willing to grovel to keep it. \u201cI will make mistakes. I don\u2019t know how to do this, how to be what you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Eliza kissed him quiet. \u201cWe\u2019ll show one another how to be what the other needs,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI want to be the one who gets inside you. The one you cannot forget...\u201d</p><p>Jasper thrust his fingers into her hair and took her mouth in a long, deep kiss. He had no notion of what time it was, and he didn\u2019t care. He just knew he didn\u2019t want it to end.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Eliza had never fully appreciated the restorative properties of salt baths. However, Jasper insisted she take one before leaving his home the evening before and suggested she might avail herself of one in the morning as well. Having taken his advice, she felt much better, although there was still lingering soreness in unmentionable places.</p> <p>She was also starving, as she often was after strenuous activity. She ate far more at breakfast than was usual and remained at the table for some time after Melville excused himself. With the late morning sunshine slanting through the window at her back, Eliza read the paper and chose not to think about all the many things she should be thinking about. Instead she chose to dissect the waltz in her mind, remembering the way it was taught to her and improving upon that teaching method.</p><p>Jasper would be calling later for his first dance lesson. She was eager for him to become proficient so she could share a dance with him in public. A thrill moved through her at the thought of being in his arms in full view of everyone. It would be a delicious challenge to be decorous at a time when she would be so physically stimulated.</p><p>Eliza turned the page and tapped her foot to a tune playing in her head. After returning home at ten o\u2019clock the night before, she\u2019d stayed in. She was perfectly content to read the various renditions of last night\u2019s events in the gazettes, having previously come to the conclusion that the printed tales were often more entertaining than the reality.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>Glancing up, she smiled as her uncle reentered the room. \u201cYes, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He rounded the long wooden table with a frown. Today was one of the few days when every piece of his attire was the way it should be, signaling a hard-won victory for his lordship\u2019s valet.</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Westfield is here,\u201d he said, pausing beside her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has expressed an interest in paying his addresses to you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza blinked up at him. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to wed you. And speak with you. He awaits you in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>She folded the paper carefully, her thoughts rushing forward and stumbling all over themselves. With her brain arrested by confusion, her attention moved to the delicate lace runner that bisected the table. Her gaze slowly shifted to the brass candelabra that stood in the center. The antique piece was surrounded by a ring of pink roses, just as she was surrounded by sudden marriage proposals.</p><p>Melville cleared his throat and pulled her chair back from the table. \u201cI was not aware you and Westfield were well acquainted.\u201d</p><p>Eliza stood. \u201cI hardly know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an excellent match, much more advantageous than marrying Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she agreed, linking her arm with his and following his lead toward the door. Westfield was handsome, wealthy, and widely respected. He was also a friend of Jasper\u2019s, which made his offer decidedly more curious.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about this?\u201d his lordship asked as they left the room.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew. Perhaps I\u2019ll have a better idea after I speak with him. How did you respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wished him luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? Do you wish me luck, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you happy, dear. In whatever form suits you best.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cNow, go on. Don\u2019t keep West-field waiting.\u201d</p><p>Eliza set off on her own toward the front of the house. It was late enough in the day that the sun no longer shined directly through the glass around the front door. The familiar stillness of her home was usually comforting, but today it emphasized the disturbance created by the earl\u2019s visit. A second offer of marriage in as many days. She could hardly credit it.</p><p>As she entered the formal parlor, Eliza collected that West-field\u2019s reason for visiting wasn\u2019t the sole cause of her unease. His physical presence was palpable. His person fairly crackled with a vibrant energy very much at odds with Jasper\u2019s quiet, intensely watchful air.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lord,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d Westfield stood. He was as tall as Jasper, though not as broad or muscular. If pressed for a description, she would call him \u201celegant\u201d and very dashing. \u201cYou look radiant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I should return the compliment and say you look quite nice.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHow are you faring this fine day? I hope you\u2019re well. You were missed about town last night.\u201d</p><p>Eliza chose to sit in the pale yellow velvet wingback facing the doorway. She lowered herself into the seat and smoothed her floral-patterned muslin skirts. The earl settled opposite her with practiced grace, a man of understated power and privilege. She decided that \u201cpolished\u201d was a more apt descriptor than \u201celegant.\u201d Jasper had a sharper edge to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d she answered. \u201cI stayed in by choice, not due to any malaise. I don\u2019t enjoy the events of the Season as much as others do, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>She mentioned her sentiments deliberately, knowing Westfield would need an accomplished hostess for a wife if he hoped to achieve his political and social aims.</p><p>\u201cNot surprising,\u201d he said, \u201cconsidering what a danger they have become to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of the nature of your association with Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was too startled to blink. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hold his disclosures against him. He confided in me because he knows I am trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may trust you with his own personal matters, but trusting you with mine is an avenue I wish he\u2019d discussed with me.\u201d She wondered how much information the earl was privy to. Considering he was offering marriage, she expected he was aware of more than she was comfortable with.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern, I assure you.\u201d He paused as the tea service was brought in and placed before Eliza on the low table between them. He eyed Mrs. Potts with what appeared to be astonishment, a reaction Eliza was quite used to. The housekeeper was tall and slender as a reed, her arms seemingly too frail to support the weight of the heavy service. But she was far stronger than she looked, capable of lifting items even Melville struggled with.</p><p>After Mrs. Potts left, Westfield continued. \u201cMy intention is to help you and Bond. And myself, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy offering to resolve a temporary problem by binding me to a permanent one?\u201d Eliza turned her attention to the preparation of tea.</p><p>\u201cYou just called me a permanent problem,\u201d he pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d she corrected, measuring the tea leaves. \u201cMarriage to you. We know very little about each other, and if we were to consider what we do know, I doubt we\u2019d find ourselves to be aligned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m appreciative of the way you responded to a statue nearly braining you,\u201d he argued, leaning forward. \u201cI thought you displayed considerable fortitude and courage. You proved yourself capable of addressing any situation presented to you, Miss Martin, and that is a trait I\u2019ve not previously been wise enough to consider.\u201d</p><p>Taking more time and care than necessary, Eliza balanced a strainer atop the lip of a cup. Her mind was focused on identifying how she felt about Jasper\u2019s betrayal of her confidence. She knew she shouldn\u2019t take the matter lightly\u2014not after the examples of foolish choices her mother had made in the throes of an infatuation\u2014but she found herself making excuses for Jasper. Attempting to find a mitigating circumstance she could accept. Surely he had good reason for sharing what happened between them the night before, if only she could think of it. It was difficult for her to decide whether she was showing good faith or poor judgment.</p><p>\u201cI understand my desire to remain unencumbered by marriage is incomprehensible to most,\u201d she said finally. \u201cAll young women are expected to select a husband as they would a new bonnet or pelisse, because a spouse is as necessary a female accessory as outerwear. But I need no support, financial or otherwise. I have most of what I need, and I can afford to buy the rest. Frankly, my lord, while your solvency is most refreshing, I don\u2019t see what use I would have for you personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His mouth lifted on one side in a manner she knew many women would find appealing. \u201cYou would be free of the suitors plaguing you, including Montague, who is becoming impatient. Bond has only your best interests at heart, but he\u2019s blinded by his own personal motivations, and now they are contributing to your dilemma. Seeing you safely wed to someone he can trust is the most responsible way to address your situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike talking in half-measure, my lord. I lack the talent required to translate and decipher. Since I don\u2019t believe you would offer marriage in the name of friendship, regardless of the circumstances, I should like for you to speak bluntly and honestly.\u201d</p><p>Eliza chose not to elaborate on what those circumstances might be, because she still wasn\u2019t certain how much the earl knew. If he was aware of her indiscretion and the possible ramifications, it would explain his address. But what would motivate a man in his position to step into such a situation?</p><p>Westfield waved off her offer of sugar. \u201cI\u2019m not being completely altruistic. You are sensible, attractive, and willing to take extraordinary measures to accomplish necessary tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly not the only female to meet those qualifications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wealthy, intelligent, and determined,\u201d he enumerated. \u201cYou have sufficient breeding, but come unencumbered by tiresome, troublesome, or expensive siblings. You speak your mind and force me to speak mine. What more could I ask for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesire? Elevated feelings? Youth?\u201d She could tell by the momentarily blank expression on his face that her first suggestion took him aback. However, she felt the question was warranted by his offer.</p><p>\u201cFour and twenty is a perfectly acceptable age. As to the rest, a lifetime is a long time to commit to another individual. I\u2019d rather not enter into such an extended association based on higher sentiments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t why you make this offer. You see an opportunity in me, yes. But finding a suitable wife is not all you want.\u201d</p><p>Westfield straightened. Although his gaze didn\u2019t narrow, his focus did. \u201cWhat else would it be?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>It was the drawl that proved her point. \u201cPerhaps you seek a shield or a barrier. Someone to deflect attention from you. Or an innocuous person to fill a hole you find painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I add \u2018imaginative\u2019 to the list of your attributes?\u201d</p><p>The sound of masculine voices in the foyer drew Eliza\u2019s attention to the open parlor door. A moment later, the butler appeared with a calling card borne atop a salver. A quick glance at the clock on the mantel told her it was Jasper. He was timely as usual, arriving just a few minutes early.</p><p>She nodded at the butler in a silent acknowledgment that he should show Jasper in. \u201cMr. Bond is here, my lord.\u201d</p><p>When Jasper appeared in the doorway, her fingers linked tightly within her lap. For such a large man, he moved with an effortless silence. His attire was notably understated, comprised of shades of gray. His Hessians were polished to a shine rivaling the luster of his gleaming hair, and he stood with a widened stance, a position that emphasized how solid he was. How well-anchored and stable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jasper drew to a halt just inside the threshold, looking at Westfield in a way that said he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the earl visiting. Either his men watching the house had informed him, or he\u2019d known from Westfield. Eliza didn\u2019t know how she felt about the latter possibility.</p><p>What she did know was that their relationship was irrevocably changed. Although he was dressed from his neck to his toes, in her mind\u2019s eye she saw him as he\u2019d been last night\u2014flushed and disheveled, naked and vulnerable. He had been so open then, so willing to bare his thoughts and feelings, even when he didn\u2019t understand them. The knowledge of that hidden side to him created a nearly unbearable yearning. A part of her believed she \u201cknew\u201d him. It was not reasonable for her to feel thusly, considering how little about his life and past was known to her, but it wasn\u2019t her mind making the determination.</p><p>From the way he was looking at her, he was remembering the night before, too. But if he felt the same deep connection, why had Westfield come to call on her?</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d Jasper bowed, his voice lingering in the air for a delicious moment. He straightened and pivoted to face the earl. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p> <p>Westfield stood. \u201cBond. How fortuitous your arrival is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Jasper looked at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Eliza understood from Jasper\u2019s low tone that he was in a volatile mood. She hesitated a moment before answering, unsure how to relay the events of her morning. \u201cLord West-field has come to offer his assistance.\u201d</p><p>Visually, there was no change in Jasper\u2019s countenance, but his clipped response spoke volumes. \u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Westfield, turning the conversation over to him.</p> <p>Jasper\u2019s arms crossed.</p><p>The earl smiled. \u201cI\u2019m simply following through with what we discussed last night. Seeing Miss Martin wed might resolve the problems of everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWed to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jasper shifted slightly, in the manner of a stirring beast.</p><p>Eliza, who was uncertain of what was transpiring, thought it best to keep her own counsel.</p> <p>Westfield\u2019s smile began to fade as the silence stretched out.</p><p>Jasper glanced at Eliza. \u201cHave you answered him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the delay? Westfield is suitable in every way.\u201d</p><p>Stiffening against a sharp pain in her chest, Eliza lifted her chin and replied, \u201cPerhaps I was waiting for your endorsement, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>The earl looked equally stunned. \u201cNow, see here, Bond\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your answer, Eliza?\u201d Jasper stared hard at her.</p><p>She looked at his hands, noting the whiteness of his knuckles as he gripped his biceps. She forced herself to look away and give Lord Westfield her full attention. Her fingers were linked so tightly, they hurt. Even lacking refinement in social graces, she knew what she was about to do was wrong in many ways, but she also knew Jasper needed to hear she wanted him as well. He required it said aloud, with a witness. As confident and aggressive as he could be when in his element, he was as lost as she was when it came to intimacy.</p><p>After a deep inhalation, she said, \u201cAs honored as I am by your address, my lord, I must decline. My feelings are engaged elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Westfield\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cRight, then,\u201d Jasper said, breaking his stillness. \u201cOut you go, Westfield. I\u2019ll see you this evening. Come early. You and I have matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, the earl stood. \u201cMy offer will stand through the end of the Season, Miss Martin. As for you, Bond\u2014\u201d Westfield\u2019s face took on a hardened cast\u2014\u201cwe do, indeed, have matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was vaguely aware of holding out her hand to West-field, who lifted it to firm lips and kissed the back. She might have said something inane, he might have as well, but she was so taken aback by the intensity with which he stared at her that she missed the rest. It was a searching look, one she couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He left shortly after, with Jasper following him to the front door. Eliza took the brief moment of solitude to take a fortifying drink of her now tepid cup of tea.</p><p>Equanimity. She missed it. Feeling so unsettled and confused was anathema to her. This was exactly the sort of situation her mother had so often wallowed in, the sort of situation Eliza long promised herself to avoid.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Her head lifted so she could see Jasper\u2019s face, then lowered again as he sank to one knee in front of her. Her heart thudded violently. Her free hand fisted in her lap.</p><p>He urged her grip to relax by gently prying open her fingers. \u201cThe only thing Westfield knows is the reason why you hired me. I needed someone who had invitations to the events you attend, so I could gain entry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d As he massaged her palm, the tingles that coursed up her arm weren\u2019t entirely due to a returning flow of blood. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know he intended to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought, perhaps, it was your way of protecting me from the consequences of last night.\u201d</p><p>He took the cup from her other hand. \u201cI\u2019m not that selfless. Regardless, the memory belongs only to us, and I would never share it.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cWhy are you kneeling in that way?\u201d</p><p>A slow, self-deprecating smile curved his mouth. \u201cIf I\u2019m able to secure Melville\u2019s blessing, would you have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestfield is correct. It would solve many problems. I would have greater access to you, the person who wishes to harm you would have less access, we would have more time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know one another!\u201d she protested, while a rush of warm and sweet feelings tightened her chest.</p><p>\u201cWe have honesty and desire.\u201d He brought her hands to his lips and kissed the knuckles. His eyes were dark, his words delivered with heartrending earnestness. \u201cYou have money and breeding; I work in trade, and my blood is worthless. But I would spill it for you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want me.\u201d Jasper reached up and cupped her nape, his thumb stroking across her throbbing pulse.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I have you without a ring?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOnly you would prefer to be a man\u2019s mistress instead of his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should prefer me that way, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile other men line up to ask for your hand and claim rights to you that are mine? I think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month, the Season will be over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut our relationship will not be. You don\u2019t yet see it, but you are visibly changed by what transpired between us last night. The more I have you, the more obvious it will become, and other men will be drawn to that new awareness in you.\u201d</p><p>She absorbed his words, startled to think that the lush languidness she felt might be obvious to others. Studying Jasper, she searched for signs of change in his appearance.</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cI am down on one knee, Eliza. If that isn\u2019t a reflection of change, I have no notion what would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do not make light of this. You don\u2019t want to marry either. You said you have no place in your life for a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make a place for you. We\u2019ve both thought of matrimony in terms of how it would limit our lives, but marriage can be useful in some regards. A married woman has far more freedom than a spinster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would it be useful to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would settle me.\u201d His touch moved downward to cup her cheek. \u201cIn the last few days, I\u2019ve been pulled in two di-rections\u2014between work that must be done and thoughts of you. If you were mine, you would be close and protected. I could focus on the tasks at hand in the thorough manner I\u2019m accustomed to.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his other hand tightly in her lap. \u201cPerhaps it would be best for both of us if we went our separate ways and resumed our lives as we knew them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d He made a frustrated noise. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to come to you as Montague and Westfield did, with practical reasons and sound arguments. If pressed, I would have to say we have no business in one another\u2019s lives and we would be mad to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can make you happy. We are alike in many ways, yet different enough to complement one another. You can show me how to be more circumspect; I can afford you the opportunity to be as adventuresome as you like.\u201d</p><p>An odd sort of delight bubbled within her. Like champagne, it made her slightly giddy. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly as confident in my ability to make you happy. Most people find me to be aloof and too quiet. I am proficient with the pianoforte, but I\u2019m a terrible singer. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed and leaned forward to kiss the end of her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be entertained. I want you. Just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry about the possibility I might be with child,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cI take that very seriously, yes. But why ask for marriage now, instead of waiting to be certain?\u201d Jasper leaned back. \u201cTell me truthfully, Eliza. Is your fortune an obstacle between us? Do you think it matters to me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head without hesitation. When he continued to seem expectant, she spoke the negation aloud, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He released her, and set both his hands on his upraised knee. \u201cLet us make a bargain, shall we? I will secure Lord Melville\u2019s blessing, and you\u2019ll say \u2018yes\u2019 to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper, I would swiftly bore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d he pressed on, \u201cthe banns will be read. That will give us the time we need to find the source of your trouble, discern whether or not you are increasing, and spend some time together. If, after all of that, you still believe we don\u2019t suit and cannot be happy together, we\u2019ll break the engagement at the end of the Season. Is that reasonable enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to break an engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claim not to be reasoned about this, yet you present me with a practical plan that affords me the opportunity to reach solid conclusions.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m faced with two difficult choices: Make a decision now with too little information, or progress further than I ever intended in order to gather the information I believe we both need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you were impulsive,\u201d he teased. \u201cI might have been able to convince you to elope with me and spare you all the rumination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so confident about this?\u201d she complained. \u201cWhy can I not have some of that surety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make my decisions here\u201d\u2014he tapped his abdomen\u2014 \u201cand they are usually instantaneous. You make your decisions here\u201d\u2014he tapped her temple with his index finger\u2014\u201cand that takes more time. I\u2019m trying to give you that time, Eliza, while staving off my own impatience. An engagement is the compromise we reach.\u201d</p><p>Worrying her lower lip, Eliza struggled to find the courage to say what she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cI cannot decide if it\u2019s desire goading me to agree against my better sense, and I\u2019m also concerned that as the novelty of bedding me becomes less engaging you will want me less and less, until eventually you no longer want me at all. After we are bound to one another, it will be too late to realize we had only lust, which was quickly sated.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cIf the possibility of waning interest concerns you, I can prove I desire you for more than sex. I won\u2019t ask you to give yourself to me again until we are wed, but I\u2019m available to you whenever and wherever you want me. Chivalry and mores are no restraints to me. I learned long ago never to spite myself; the only person who loses is me. You should know of that aspect of my character, I suppose, before you wed me.\u201d</p><p>To be wanted so keenly...Eliza finally understood why her mother had been addicted to the feeling. It was so very tempting. And Jasper was irresistible.</p><p>To have him whenever she wanted. The thought of commanding sex from him, at any time and in any place, was impossibly arousing.</p><p>\u201cEliza,\u201d he murmured, drawing her focus back to him. \u201cGive yourself permission to take what you want, for once. You might enjoy it more than you think.\u201d</p><p>That was partially what she was afraid of. But her fear wasn\u2019t a strong enough deterrent to mitigate her memories of the night before and the lingering happiness she\u2019d felt upon waking.</p><p>\u201cSpeak to Melville,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, ask me again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cI would never have expected this of you,\u201d Westfield said, rocking back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d Jasper said dryly.</p><p>The Valmont ballroom was larger than many, but the broad expanse and thirty-foot ceilings did little to ease the crush of guests. Worse than the crowd was Jasper\u2019s realization that he was an object of curiosity. Having spent the entirety of his life avoiding notice whenever possible, he found it decidedly uncomfortable to be the center of attention. But the news of the notoriously reticent Miss Eliza Martin\u2019s betrothal to a man few people had ever heard of was apparently the most interesting item of discussion. His appearance was being examined by nearly everyone, as if the reason he\u2019d won her could be determined visually.</p><p>Mindful of Eliza\u2019s pride, he had dressed with care. While he\u2019d elected to wear black to minimize his size, his coat and breeches were flawlessly tailored. The materials used were exceptional, as were the diamond in his cravat pin and the sapphire in the ring on his right hand. The result was understated yet expensive elegance, which he hoped mitigated any speculation that he wanted Eliza for her fortune. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are completely inappropriate for her,\u201d the earl went on.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked for Eliza and found her. She appeared composed, if slightly irritated. The frown marring her brow betrayed both her peevishness and bemusement. He smiled, appreciating her artless honesty.</p><p>\u201cShe would be better served with me,\u201d Westfield said. \u201cHow can any woman live the life you do, Bond?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI expect Miss Martin and I will discover the answer as time progresses.\u201d</p><p>Westfield stepped forward, then turned to face him, effectively taking up the entirety of his view. \u201cIs there anything you will not do in your quest to ruin Montague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the periphery,\u201d Jasper conceded, sidestepping to resume his viewing of Eliza.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d The earl moved in front of him again. \u201cWere you talking about her last night? That nonsense about wanting something badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wanted her now. Eliza had worn another of her mother\u2019s gowns, this one in a lovely rose hue. It was as simple in cut as the sapphire gown she\u2019d worn days ago, but the bodice was provocatively low and the waist perfectly snug. The slender beauty of her figure was a joy to behold.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Westfield looked over his shoulder at Eliza. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy her, and I can make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you can. Not for the long term. And how does enjoyment signify? I enjoy half a dozen women any given fortnight, yet you don\u2019t see me proposing to any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherein lies the difference between us,\u201d Jasper drawled. \u201cThere are very few things I\u2019ve enjoyed in my life, and none to the degree with which I enjoy Miss Martin\u2019s company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, you have me intrigued,\u201d Westfield complained. \u201cI\u2019ll forever be wondering what I missed about Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not. You\u2019ll forget about her in any other capacity than as my wife, and that will be the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d Westfield turned around, searching. \u201cI have yet to see Montague. I should like to know how he\u2019s taking the news of your engagement.\u201d</p><p>Jasper didn\u2019t care what Montague thought.</p><p>The moment the realization hit, his spine straightened and his breath hissed out between his teeth. Shifting his position, he canted his body away from Eliza, his hands flexing at his sides. Soon, he would be able to put Montague behind him, but not now. Not yet. The earl had still to pay for his sins and the sins of his father.</p><p>Eliza. She made him forget himself, which was one of the reasons why he needed her. But she couldn\u2019t serve that purpose now. Not yet. His plan was in the final stages after years of frustrated waiting and endless hours of work.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, Jasper watched as Sir Richard Tolliver approached. Although Jasper had believed Tolliver couldn\u2019t be any thinner, it appeared he was tonight. His dark coat hung loosely on his shoulders and his modestly embroidered waistcoat gaped a little just above the top button. \u201cGood evening, Sir Richard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hear congratulations are in order,\u201d Tolliver said, looking far from congratulatory.</p><p>\u201cThey are. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fortuitous that Miss Martin should decide to marry so soon after you returned to her life. Almost as if she were waiting for you these last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetic,\u201d Westfield drawled. \u201cPerhaps if you\u2019d shared your talent for romantic thought and turns of phrase with Miss Martin, you might have had more luck with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat talent did you share?\u201d Tolliver shot back, glaring at Jasper.</p><p>\u201cBe very careful when maligning me,\u201d Jasper warned softly. \u201cShould you inadvertently cast aspersions on Miss Martin\u2019s character, I assure you, I won\u2019t take it well.\u201d</p><p>Tolliver\u2019s foot tapped against the floor. \u201cYour long familial friendship with the Tremaines makes it decidedly odd that Miss Martin can share little about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannot? Or will not?\u201d Jasper challenged. \u201cShe understands the value of privacy. It\u2019s one of the many qualities she and I have in common. Now, cease being a nuisance. Go find a new heiress to woo.\u201d</p><p>Tolliver remained in place for a long moment. Finally, he spoke between clenched teeth, \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond. And to you as well, my lord.\u201d He turned about and stalked away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making friends already,\u201d Westfield said, staring after Tolliver. \u201cI have to say, I never guessed he had such forcefulness in him. Perhaps his feelings for Miss Martin were true after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so sublime.\u201d Jasper rolled his shoulders back. This was what he\u2019d wanted\u2014to attract the attention of whoever was endangering Eliza. But he hadn\u2019t anticipated the feeling of jealousy. Tolliver had roused his proprietary instincts and his discomfort was certain to worsen as time progressed.</p><p>The sound of Montague\u2019s name being bandied around them drew Jasper\u2019s attention toward the farthest entrance. \u201cHe came,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019d begun to doubt he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this place.\u201d Westfield gestured with a jerk of his chin. \u201cLady Valmont hasn\u2019t enjoyed a gathering of this size in many years. The curious come en masse to see Miss Martin\u2019s transformation and the man responsible for it. She changed her appearance for you, did she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did it for the investigation. At first.\u201d Jasper gave himself permission to look at her again. He was torn between his two goals\u2014winning Eliza\u2019s hand and staying focused on his vengeance. \u201cTonight, I think she did it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was being truthful when she said she had feelings for you?\u201d Westfield snorted. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name does she see in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew. I would show her more of it.\u201d</p><p>Montague\u2019s progress through the room was marked by a noticeable ripple in the throng. He was heading toward Eliza, who stood on the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Jasper started in that direction. Westfield fell in line. They worked their way through the crowd, their path repeatedly blocked by one inquisitive well-wisher after another.</p><p>\u201cIs your marriage a sign that Montague\u2019s destruction is now assured?\u201d the earl asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I have learned he\u2019s forming a pool of investors for a coal mine speculation.\u201d Jasper grabbed a glass of lemonade from the tray of a passing footman.</p><p>\u201cIs that what shored up his confidence about his finances and prompted him to contact me about retrieving his marker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to know the answer tomorrow. Either he\u2019s falling deeper into ruin or digging himself out of it.\u201d</p><p>Westfield grabbed his elbow and pulled him to a halt. \u201cBond.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s brows rose in silent inquiry.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered embracing your new life with Miss Martin and leaving Montague\u2019s future to fate? In my experience, deserving fellows have a way of finding their own sorry end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Montague\u2019s end,\u201d Jasper said, before tossing back the contents of his glass. He started forward again, lamenting the beverage\u2019s inability to make the scrutiny directed his way more tolerable.</p><p>\u201cI am so happy for you.\u201d Lady Collingsworth beamed like a proud parent. Dripping in sapphires and adorned with white plumes in her hair, she carried herself with the sort of regal confidence that supported such accessories instead of depended upon them.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Eliza ran a hand over her unsettled stomach.</p><p>\u201cI admire you for following your heart,\u201d Regina went on. \u201cI know how difficult the decision to marry was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to understand why it is so hard for me and not for so many others. Certainly I am not privy to information other women do not have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are. Only you lived with your mother.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s eyes widened. It was the closest the countess had ever come to speaking harshly about Georgina.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so surprised, dear? I\u2019m aware of how you feel about your mother and her choices. She wed two different men because she cared for them, and neither marriage ended well. The fact that her second husband was a fortune hunter sealed your opinion of matrimony. I understand the preconceptions you had to overcome before accepting Mr. Bond\u2019s proposal.\u201d Regina looked past Eliza, focusing on something or someone behind her. \u201cI can only hope that the indecent way he looks at you had a hand in your capitulation. I do believe his regard elevates the temperature in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina!\u201d Eliza resisted the urge to glance at Jasper, knowing if she did, she would become flushed and distracted. All evening long, he\u2019d been staring at her as if she was naked.</p><p>\u201cStuff,\u201d the countess retorted. \u201cWhat happens in the privacy of the marital bed is of equal importance to what happens outside of it. A marriage cannot thrive if there is disharmony in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it survive if pleasure is all there is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl, pleasure is what is lacking in most marriages. Don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems so frivolous a reason,\u201d Eliza muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou are too smart to make frivolous decisions. I\u2019m certain if you made a list of Mr. Bond\u2019s good and bad points, you would find the good far outweighs the bad.\u201d</p><p>No longer able to resist looking at Jasper, Eliza turned her head to find him. En route, her attention was caught by a familiar tall figure. The Earl of Montague was cutting through the crowd, his handsome face lit with a charming grin. Although he was frequently held back by those who wished to greet him, it was obvious he was on a direct path to her.</p><p>\u201cMontague seems to be in good spirits,\u201d Regina noted. \u201cIt was good of you to tell him directly about your engagement to Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving the matter to Melville would have been too distant and insincere.\u201d Eliza offered a smile to Regina that was filled with heartfelt gratitude. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to meet with him without you. Thank you for accompanying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccompanying you where?\u201d</p><p>Eliza was warmed by the sound of Jasper\u2019s voice behind her. The occupants of the room receded, her awareness of the noise fading into insignificance. She faced him. \u201cTo the park this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a meeting with Montague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. To tell him about our engagement.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over Jasper\u2019s features. \u201cYou should not have done that.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened at his tone, unaccustomed to being gainsaid. \u201cIt was the least he deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no notion of what he deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBond.\u201d Westfield\u2019s low, warning tone stole Eliza\u2019s attention. She looked at the earl, who stood just beyond Jasper\u2019s left shoulder. Like Montague, Westfield cut a dashing figure, and when he looked at her, his eyes were kind.</p><p>Two peers. Both were attractive, solicitous, and willing to marry her. Yet she had chosen the wild commoner of indeterminate origins. A man she could never hope to tame. She felt a frisson of disquiet over her decision.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s jaw tensed, as if he sensed her sudden confusion. The affection that had been in his eyes when they\u2019d first reunited this evening was far less evident now. To her, the distance between them seemed almost tangible.</p><p>Regina cleared her throat. \u201cPerhaps you might accompany me to the drinks table, Lord Westfield. My throat is dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The earl shot a meaningful glance at Jasper, before leading Lady Collingsworth away.</p><p>Jasper stepped closer to Eliza. \u201cHow can I protect you when you deliberately put yourself in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat danger? I met with Lord Montague in public, with Lady Collingsworth in attendance. Your men were certainly somewhere nearby. Or were they not? Is that why your mood is so foul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hired me to investigate your suitors. Then you meet with one privately to tell him he\u2019s losing any chance of laying claim to your money, putting him in a desperate position!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could he have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbscond with you. Hold you for ransom. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cA man of his station would not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him, Eliza, or what he is capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from him.\u201d</p><p>Her brow rose. \u201cIs that an order?\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cDon\u2019t turn this into a battle of wills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are attempting to limit my freedom. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect me not to fight for it.\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the elbows and tugged her scandalously close, as if they were alone and not surrounded on all sides by prying eyes. \u201cI am attempting to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour advice is duly noted.\u201d Eliza knew she was goading his temper, but his clipped responses made her wonder if she wasn\u2019t giving him precisely what he wanted. He seemed to be spoiling for a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou must heed me.\u201d His eyes were so dark, they were nearly black.</p><p>\u201cYour concern is unfounded. I foresee no occasion where Lord Montague and I would have cause to meet again outside of social settings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause or not, I want you to keep your distance.\u201d He released her. \u201cFrom Tolliver, as well.\u201d</p><p>Irritation swelled within her. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolliver is not taking the news of our engagement well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Montague? He smiled when I told him and wished me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cares for no one\u2019s happiness but his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m just to take your word for this, with no explanation provided?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready exerting your husbandly right to control me in whatever manner you see fit?\u201d Her grip on her fan tightened to the point that the wood creaked in protest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will not allow you to turn a discussion about your safety into an argument about independence and the drawbacks of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t allow. I see. Is this acceptance and rejection of acquaintances reciprocal? Can I forbid you to meet with Lord Westfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are deliberately baiting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am simply attempting to discern where the boundaries are, and if they apply equally to both of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWestfield is no danger to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I know something you do not,\u201d she challenged. \u201cOf course, if I follow your example, I don\u2019t have to share what I know with you.\u201d</p><p>She looked away to hide the prickling of tears and saw Lord Montague approaching. Her shoulders went back.</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d Montague kissed the back of the hand she extended to him, then released her with a stately dip of his head. He looked at Jasper. \u201cMr. Bond. May I extend felicitations to you?\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s lips curved in a teeth-baring smile. \u201cYou may, my lord. I accept them with pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Eliza knew the rigidness of her posture betrayed the op-positional nature of her conversation with Jasper, but she was too frustrated to care overmuch.</p><p>\u201cIs it too much to hope, Miss Martin,\u201d the earl said, \u201cthat you might still have room on your dance card for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next waltz is yours.\u201d</p><p>A tic in Jasper\u2019s jaw filled her with acrimonious satisfaction.</p><p>She\u2019d deliberately withheld the evening\u2019s two waltzes. Not for Montague, but as a token gesture for Jasper. She had intended for her next waltz to be with him, even though it would take weeks for him to learn the steps and absorb them into memory.</p><p>\u201cIt appears I, too, am fortunate,\u201d Montague said. \u201cAlthough not to the same degree as you, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d Jasper\u2019s features were set in hard lines.</p><p>The orchestra played a few brief notes to alert the guests that the next dance would soon begin. Eliza gratefully excused herself and searched for her partner, Baron Brimley. As she moved away from the terrible tension emanating from Jasper, her breathing became easier. Reason returned to her, swiftly followed by regret. She disliked that they\u2019d quarreled. Worse, she disliked herself.</p><p>Jasper watched Eliza walk away with undue haste and berated himself for sparking their first argument. He knew he had to tread lightly with her or risk her thrusting issues of money and independence between them, but he\u2019d been discomfited into acting rashly. The surprise of learning that she\u2019d met with Montague drove him to be harsh and unyielding, yet his ignorance was his own fault. Lynd had called upon him unexpectedly, and Jasper made the mistake of delaying the daily reports in order to accommodate his old mentor.</p><p>How could he have been so careless? He lived by rigid schedules and timetables for a reason\u2014they kept things running smoothly and without startling incidents. Compounding his error by expelling the anger that should rightly have been self-directed only made the situation worse. He\u2019d now caused a rift between him and Eliza that he could ill-afford.</p><p>\u201cYou have Byron\u2019s brooding countenance mimicked to perfection,\u201d Montague said. \u201cI didn\u2019t try that tactic when attempting to woo Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s head turned slowly, his expression altering to reveal no emotion whatsoever. He and his half-brother were nearly of a height. The similarities between them were numerous enough that Jasper shifted slightly to put more distance between them. \u201cI cannot say I\u2019m sorry you lost her to me.\u201d</p><p>Montague smiled and rocked back on his heels, blissfully oblivious to the resemblance between them and the reason for it. \u201cYou are somewhat of a mystery, Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me what you want to know. Perhaps I\u2019ll answer you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel about coal?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of satisfaction moved through Jasper. Could acquiring the information he needed be so easy? \u201cIt\u2019s a necessity. Life would be miserable without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d The earl\u2019s smile turned into a grin. \u201cI have a speculation you might find interesting.\u201d</p><p>Jasper pushed Eliza from his mind and managed a smile. \u201cYou have the entirety of my attention, my lord.\u201d</p><p>By the time the Earl of Montague collected Eliza for their waltz, her ire had vanished. Still, she was completely out of sorts. For the first time, she understood that she\u2019d lived her life without conflict after her mother passed on. No one disagreed with her because there were no points of contention; she was not obliged to explain herself nor meld her viewpoint with anyone else\u2019s. The result of her unchallenged independence was that she was sorely unprepared for arguments. Her entire body responded negatively to discord. She had a headache, and her stomach was upset, even though she was no longer angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you look lovelier, Miss Martin,\u201d Montague murmured, as he set his hand at her waist.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She stared at his cravat, noting its elaborate style and thick starching.</p><p>Montague had dressed flamboyantly in peacock blue velvet and a multi-colored waistcoat. His attire was far removed from Jasper\u2019s more somber style, and yet the earl\u2019s height and physical coloring were uncannily accurate substitutes for Jasper. The similarity caused Eliza to focus on how the earl made allowances for her shorter stature when an upraised arm position dictated it. He was a highly accomplished dancer, leading her expertly through the steps. She took mental notes for use in Jasper\u2019s dancing lessons, grateful the preoccupation afforded her some respite from her emotional turmoil.</p><p>\u201cYou have aroused my curiosity,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn what regard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour matchmaking skills.\u201d</p><p>Eliza frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I possessed any. Only that I could find someone more suitable for you than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggestions?\u201d His dark eyes were laughing.</p><p>\u201cI believe any unmarried woman in attendance tonight would fit that criterion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor shame,\u201d he cried, laughing, and thereby turning heads toward them. \u201cTo foster hope, only to dash it with a cruel jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFustian. You could have anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for you.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to realize he was teasing her. \u201cHow about Audora Winfield?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cHer laugh drives me to madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane Rothschild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI frighten her. She stammers and turns red. The best we\u2019ve managed were short stretches of time at a house party where I spoke incessantly to fill the void and she nodded vigorously to everything I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing. Perhaps more time spent with her will alleviate her nervousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo torturous for both of us, I think. Certainly too much work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sarah Tanner?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat fault does she have?\u201d Eliza asked.</p><p>Montague hesitated a moment, then said, \u201cShe is...overbold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d She found herself at a loss. There were others, she was sure, but she couldn\u2019t name them offhand. \u201cPerhaps you would be best served by waiting for a new Season and new debutantes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs recently as yesterday, I would have said I could not afford to wait that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I have renewed hope that I can buy the time necessary to find a suitable replacement for you. I believe I have found a solid investment with a high probability of return. Mr. Bond might join me in the pool. We have plans to discuss it further tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Why would Jasper consider investing with Montague when he claimed not to trust the earl and knew him to be insolvent? It was unreasonable. And that wasn\u2019t her only concern. What was Jasper\u2019s experience with investments? Did he know what he was involving himself in?</p><p>In the morning, she would ask Reynolds to look into Montague\u2019s speculation and assess its potential. Then, she\u2019d approach Jasper directly and ask him to explain. If he refused to answer, she would give him an ultimatum\u2014share with her or lose her.</p><p>They could progress no further as a couple with so much unsaid between them.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Eliza turned away from the French doors leading to the rear garden and faced Jasper. He entered the Melville ballroom with a determined, forceful stride. There were over one hundred feet of marble floor between them, but she felt his presence keenly.</p><p>\u201cClose the door,\u201d she said.</p><p>He drew to a halt. The massive room was dimly lit, with only the indirect morning sunlight at her back offering any illumination. She heard him take a deep breath before turning around and returning to the door.</p><p>As the click of the latch echoed through the room, she asked, \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jasper resumed the long walk to where she stood, passing the many mural vignettes without looking. \u201cBut then, I\u2019ve never slept well. There is too much to be done and not enough time in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well either.\u201d She absorbed the rush of sensation she always felt upon first sight of him. Interspersed between the Georgian-era vignettes of a picnic party were long, slender mirrors framed by cream-colored molding. The result was many Jaspers filling the room. Her reaction was equally magnified.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for last night,\u201d he said again, reaching for her and pulling her into his arms. Lowering his head, he sealed his mouth over hers.</p><p>There was nothing remorseful about his kiss. It was hot, fierce, and lustful. Jasper\u2019s tongue teased her lips open, then licked inside. The taste of him exploded across her senses, awakening a powerful need to possess him.</p><p>Eliza caught him to her with fevered desperation. Her arms encircled his shoulders, her fingers pushed into his silky hair and cupped his nape. Her breasts swelled against his chest, the lingering soreness between her legs forgotten in a rush of slick moisture. She wanted to bare his skin, rub her open mouth across it, caress him with her hands and uninhibited undulations of her body.</p><p>He groaned and twisted his mouth away.</p><p>\u201cJasper...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI handled myself poorly.\u201d He rested his temple against hers. \u201cI know you won\u2019t tolerate being dictated to.\u201d</p><p>She no longer wanted to talk, but knew they must. Sexual passion could not be all they had. \u201cH-how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I pay attention to you.\u201d He set her away from him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a good judge of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me at a disadvantage. I know nothing about you beyond your livelihood and your wish to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I look without my clothes on. And how I feel inside you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him inside her now. Ached for the feeling of fullness and delicious friction. The incendiary rush of climax and the repletion that followed.</p><p>Eliza linked her hands behind her back and circled him, her green skirts swaying around her legs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t enough for me in quiet, contemplative moments. I think of you and how I act when I\u2019m around you, and I do not recognize myself. You are the catalyst for the changes in me, yet you\u2019re an enigma. Can you understand how difficult it is for me to experience such upheaval with no foundation upon which to lay it?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to keep their gazes connected. \u201cI know it appears as if I haven\u2019t altered as much or sacrificed as much as you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one sorry about their behavior last night. I said and did things I regretted almost the moment they happened. I was irritated with you and reacted unthinkingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationships are fraught with such behavior. It\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not be normal for us, or I want nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>His stance widened. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>Slowing in front of him, she eyed him from head to toe. He was dressed for riding in snug doeskin breeches and polished Hessians. The powerful muscles of his thighs and calves were clearly delineated. He crossed his arms, as if in preparation for a confrontation, and his flexing biceps strained the seams of his dark gray coat.</p><p>He was the most attractive, sexually alluring man she\u2019d ever crossed paths with.</p><p>\u201cI cannot hide how I want you,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI want to be in your bed even now, despite the fact that it\u2019s the middle of the morning. I want you so badly I burn with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how you\u2019ve changed me, that I can say such things aloud? But desire alone won\u2019t be enough impetus to wed you. I could insist on an affair instead.\u201d She rounded him again. \u201cI agreed to your proposal because you\u2019ve been honest with me. Although you haven\u2019t revealed much of yourself, what you have shared up to this point has been truthful.\u201d</p><p>Jasper caught her arm as she came around. \u201cI\u2019m different with you, as well. I am learning to adjust. You will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you become more than a stranger to me. You once said your past and future are irrelevant. But since then, you\u2019ve asked me to blend your future with mine. To create a joint future. Our future. In order for that to happen, you have to show me the road upon which you travel. I cannot be led along blindly. If you won\u2019t commit to sharing, then we are finished before we begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future is shaped by the past.\u201d His throat worked on a hard swallow. \u201cMy past will alter your view of me. The risk of you turning away from what I am is too great.\u201d</p><p>Eliza cupped his cheek. With every inhale, she smelled the beloved scent of his skin. \u201cWhat kind of life would we have together, if we continue to do and say things to each other we lament? It\u2019s the worst sort of dishonesty. I\u2019ve seen it before, and I know it ends in sorrow and misery. I don\u2019t want that for you, or for me. I do not want that for us.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and kissed her palm. \u201cYou speak of your parents.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere was so much left unsaid between them. Their infatuation brought them together, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough to bear the weight of their fa\u00e7ades. They quarreled often and said unkind things. Eventually, apologies were no longer enough to mend the rift between them. How could they be, when they continued to repeat the mistakes they apologized for?\u201d Her fingertips drifted across his firm lips. \u201cIf only they\u2019d been honest about themselves and what they needed. Perhaps they could have made each other happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moment you walked away from me last night, I regretted my brusqueness. I considered climbing through your bedroom window just to reassure myself that you would still receive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have revealed the truth to me then?\u201d</p><p>Jasper offered a rueful smile. \u201cI doubt it. Surely, the convenience of finding you in bed would have distracted me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow swiftly you tell the truth when it\u2019s not tied to your past.\u201d</p><p>He urged her closer and pressed a kiss to her forehead. Then, he walked away and spoke over his shoulder. \u201cPull the pins from your hair. I\u2019ll speak for as long as it takes you to let it down completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to learn how to dance with you. We cannot have every lesson delayed by interruptions, despite how pressing they might be. We need a way to measure the time spent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pocket watch will not suffice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t nearly as fun.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up with both hands, she obliged. Slowly. Pulling out one pin and carefully lowering her arm to drop it on the floor.</p><p>He gave an approving nod, then began to follow the length of the wall. \u201cThere are some individuals who lack empathy for others. They are unable to create or sustain emotional connections, and their vision of the world is limited to their own viewpoints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stepfather was such a person. Chilcott was entirely self-absorbed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s voice rose to compensate for the growing distance between them. \u201cIn addition to that defect of character, Montague is also cursed with aberrant sexual appetites.\u201d</p><p>Eliza paused in the act of withdrawing another pin. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have crossed paths with women who\u2019ve had the misfortune of catching his eye. He prefers unwilling partners and the infliction of pain. My understanding is he cannot perform otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwilling...\u201d Her stomach turned at the thought of being forced to share the intimacies of sexual congress with someone who was cruel and malicious. \u201cHow does one acquire such deviant tastes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the blood, perhaps? Or a defect of the soul.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>Her hands fell to her sides. She walked toward him with her hair loosened and threatening to fall around her shoulders. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this earlier? How could you keep such things from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen could I have told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy!\u201d</p><p>He altered direction to meet her halfway, his booted steps more silent than her slippered ones. \u201cI would give up a great many things to spare you such sordidness. I knew you were decided against marriage, which made the possibility of your ever learning of Lord Montague\u2019s activities very slim indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not have met with him yesterday if I\u2019d known!\u201d As she reached him, her hands went to her hips. \u201cAnd you and I would not have quarreled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI also feared what would happen if he discovered you knew of his darker nature. Your face is so expressive. You will not be able to hide your condemnation, and he\u2019s a desperate man. His good name is all he has left. He cannot afford to have it sullied by gossip.\u201d</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t approve of his methods, she hadn\u2019t the heart to argue about his reasoning. He wanted to protect her in every respect. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s the one who has been plaguing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\u201d Jasper beckoned her closer with a crook of his finger. \u201cHe is teetering on the verge of utter ruination. He\u2019s gambled away or sold every non-entailed property, and he does not have the means to support the holdings he has left. His debts are such that he\u2019s being denied credit. Soon, he will have nowhere to turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re considering investing with him?\u201d Eliza stepped into his open arms. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He set his chin atop her head. \u201cI want him ruined. I cannot allow him to find a means of salvation. If feigning interest is required to glean the information I need to thwart him, it\u2019s a small price to pay.\u201d</p><p>His tone was so vitriolic, it didn\u2019t sound like Jasper at all. Eliza leaned back to study his features. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetribution for a...friend.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy stung her. \u201cA lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands stroked the length of her spine. \u201cBefore you there was sex. You have been my only lover.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers straightened his already immaculate cravat. \u201cWill I always be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking if I\u2019ll be steadfast? Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou answer so easily.\u201d</p><p>His beautiful mouth curved with amusement. \u201cAs if I practiced my response for just such a question? And here I thought we\u2019d established I have yet to tell you a falsehood.\u201d</p><p>Eliza looked up at him from beneath her lashes. \u201cI find the thought of another woman enjoying you as I have to be extremely vexing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVexing,\u201d he repeated, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIntolerable,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cWe certainly cannot have you vexed. Therefore, I must be faithful.\u201d</p><p>Unsatisfied by his response, she goaded him. \u201cI shall follow your lead in this aspect of our association, as I have in everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Miss Martin,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI do believe that was a threat.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to where her fingers lay against white linen. \u201cOnly if you stray.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Picking her up, he spun her around.</p><p>\u201cJasper!\u201d Wide-eyed, she looked into his face. Something in his expression flushed her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou delight me.\u201d His voice was slightly husky.</p><p>\u201cYou confound me. And charm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd arouse you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo easily.\u201d She ran her hands through his hair, unable to resist its thick silky texture.</p><p>\u201cI want you even when we\u2019re not together. Can you say the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in the moments when I\u2019m not questioning myself for jumping into a situation with my eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper set her down and touched her falling hair with reverent fingers. \u201cYour mind wants to make sense of what you feel. I\u2019ve forsaken any effort to understand it, but you will not. It\u2019s one of the many things I admire about you. Just promise me that when you have doubts or concerns, you\u2019ll come to me as you did today. Tell me what you need, and I will find a way to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza believed him. He made her feel as if she was important to him. Necessary. She\u2019d never been necessary to anyone before. It was a novel feeling, one she was still attempting to assimilate.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need,\u201d she began, catching his hand in hers and setting her left hand on his shoulder, \u201cis for you to learn how to waltz. I want to dance with you.\u201d</p><p>He positioned his hand at her waist. \u201cFrom the very first, you listed dancing as a requirement in your suitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy dancing with you best of all.\u201d Eliza smiled. \u201cYou have that air of danger about you, and a very seductive way of moving. The inherent sensuality of the waltz was made for a man such as you.\u201d</p><p>His smile made her pulse race. \u201cI want to commission a new gown for you to wear during our first public waltz. Will you wear it?\u201d</p><p>Pleased by the thought of a gift, she nodded. It had been a long time since someone who cared for her bought her a present. Melville rarely knew what day of the week it was; special occasions were beyond him.</p><p>\u201cI cannot wait,\u201d he purred, his spine straightening beautifully. \u201cTeach me quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d Her tone changed, became more clipped and direct. \u201cThere are nine positions in the German waltz. However, we must start with a rule: this precise distance between us should always be maintained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too far away,\u201d he complained, shooting a pointed glance down at the floor between them.</p><p>\u201cStuff. The waltz is the only dance in which pairs are set apart from the assemblage and focused on each other. There is no way to be more intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a bed.\u201d</p><p>Eliza bit back an indulgent smile. Certainly she shouldn\u2019t encourage his roguish tendencies, but she adored them. He was unlike any man she knew\u2014wicked in all the best ways.</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cYour feet should be turned outward when stepping\u201d\u2014she demonstrated\u2014\u201cand the lift of your leg should be pronounced.\u201d</p><p>Although he continued to make provocative statements, Eliza remained focused. She walked him carefully through the steps. At first, he seemed almost afraid to move. When she pointed it out, he groused, \u201cDamned if I\u2019ll trample you.\u201d</p><p>But he soon learned to appreciate her responsiveness. He became more confident and sure-footed. The steps became more natural, his arm movements accomplished with more flourish. She praised him when his form was perfect, and teased him when it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>As time passed and they continued their exertions, his scent of spice and bergamot filled the air between them. The advance and retreat of the steps became foreplay to her. The twisting movements limbered her, while the too-brief moments of proximity began to titillate her senses. His powerful shoulder flexed beneath her hand, reminding her of how delicious he was when naked and passionate and aroused. Her breathing quickened.</p><p>Jasper watched her with an enigmatic smile. \u201cI like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you follow my lead. The feel of your body moving in just the way I want, with only the slightest urging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like being in control.\u201d</p><p>Jasper paused mid cross step. Their faces were turned toward one another, their lips only inches apart. \u201cAnd you like me in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u201d\u2014she lowered her gaze to his lips\u2014\u201cbeing out of control is my aim.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on her waist. \u201cAre you propositioning me, Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped, so that their bodies were aligned. Face-to-face. Jasper was such a large, strong man. She felt so delicate when she was with him, yet never overpowered.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d she whispered, blushing.</p><p>\u201cA kiss?\u201d He gently pulled another pin from her hair. \u201cAn embrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much more?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip.</p><p>Jasper caught her chin. \u201cShyness has no place between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be...overbold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d His tone was soft and warm. \u201cCan you still be unaware of how I relish your esteem and desire? Haven\u2019t I told you how deeply they please me and how much satisfaction I derive from them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m the only woman to admire you,\u201d Eliza said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only woman whose admiration has value to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? There\u2019s nothing special about me. Whatever pleasing traits I possess are better represented in other females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the combination with which you are blessed.\u201d His hand drifted from her jawline and closed around her breast. He studied her reaction as his thumb circled a highly sensitive nipple. \u201cI love that you are beautiful and clever and carry a constant desire for me. You could not be more perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her body responded instantly to his expert touch\u2014her nipples tightened into aching points and the flesh between her legs throbbed with need.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d he coaxed, anchoring her with a hand at her hip. With two fingers, he rolled and tugged the erect point of her breast, the pressure too light to offer any relief.</p><p>She felt pliable and wanton. Intoxicated. They\u2019d been alone for an hour, only inches apart; his body had been in motion the entire time. Watching him move was a seduction in and of itself. She couldn\u2019t keep herself from wanting him. Her infatuation was far too great to be moderated.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>A soft rumbling came from his chest, sounding suspiciously like a purr. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her hands moved of their own volition, catching the lapels of his coat. \u201cTake this off.\u201d</p><p>His wicked smile made her toes curl. He shrugged out of the expensive garment and let it fall to the floor. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly.\u201d She caressed his arms through his shirtsleeves. Looking behind him at the mirror on the opposite wall, she drank in the view of his buttocks and thighs. The sight, smell, and feel of him were all aphrodisiacs to her.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYou surprise me in all the best ways. Should I hang a mirror above our bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper...\u201d A shiver of mortified delight moved through her. \u201cI would never be able to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you won\u2019t be able to look away. Shall we prove it?\u201d</p><p>Eliza stilled. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Melville disturb us?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHow...?\u201d</p><p>Her mind rushed forward, planning how they could manage a coupling without a bed.</p><p>\u201cYour nipples are so pretty,\u201d he murmured, drawing her attention to her bodice. She was shamelessly, visibly aroused. \u201cSo tiny and petite.\u201d</p><p>He stayed her when she moved to cover herself. \u201cUnfair for you to hide when I cannot.\u201d</p><p>She followed the gesturing sweep of his hand and found the bold outline of his erection straining the placket of his breeches. A soft sound of yearning escaped her. She wished for nothing more than to be naked with him, his powerful body flexing and working atop hers, his long thick penis pushing deep into her. Despite her lingering soreness, the lure of orgasm was too potent to be denied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked himself brazenly through the doeskin. \u201cYou cannot have this again so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she demanded, her gnawing desire making her audacious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sore, and I\u2019m not in possession of a condom.\u201d</p><p>Knowing he was vulnerable to her, she closed the distance between them. With one hand at his nape and the other gripping his buttock possessively, she rubbed against him like a cat.</p> <p>Jasper\u2019s chest vibrated with a chuckle, stimulating her already tender nipples. \u201cVixen,\u201d he murmured, bending his knees and notching his erection against her swollen sex. He worked her against him, stroking where she ached with the stone-hard length of him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted, her nails digging into his skin. \u201cI want this.\u201d</p><p>His lips moved against the shell of her ear. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it, I told you. But I can make you come. Would you like that, Eliza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She felt feverish.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJasper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d He backed away. \u201cLift your skirts and bare yourself.\u201d</p><p>Despite the extremity of her desire, Eliza was still mortified by the request. It was one thing to be in his arms and lost to his skill. It was quite another to stand alone and lewdly display herself. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so very dark. \u201cI promise to reward your courage.\u201d</p><p>She fought against years of training and memories of her mother\u2019s promiscuity to blossom as he wished her to do. She\u2019d always believed intimacy was built through time and familiarity. Now she knew it could also be based simply on trust.</p><p>She clutched her skirts in her hands. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve seen countless pantalettes before.\u201d</p> <p>The corner of Jasper\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cCountless? How debauched do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to ask me to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d he conceded with a regal bow of his dark head. \u201cBut I did not ask.\u201d</p><p>She might have taken him to task for his arrogance, if her brain hadn\u2019t leaped in another direction. So rare is this particular skill that many a woman will disregard other considerations in favor of it, he\u2019d said the day they had first met. And she\u2019d laid claim to a man who possessed such expertise and wanted to practice it on her. How foolish was she to deny herself?</p><p>Before she altered her mind, Eliza yanked up her narrow skirts.</p><p>The way he looked at her caused the hairs on her nape to stand on end. \u201cHow brave you are,\u201d he praised.</p><p>Emboldened by his admiration, she untied the ribbon that secured her pantalettes around her waist. The lace-hemmed linen fell to the floor and pooled around her ankles.</p><p>\u201cSweet Eliza,\u201d he murmured, his foot deliberately catching on his discarded coat and sliding it across the floor to a spot directly in front of her. \u201cYou are more generous than I deserve.\u201d</p> <p>He sank to his knees.</p><p>As he stared at the dark red curls between her legs, Eliza became so aroused she could no longer stand still. She swayed slightly, and he caught her hip with one hand. With the other, he caught the waistband of her pantalettes and silently urged her to step out of them.</p><p>He kept her legs wide by gripping her ankle and keeping it in place. The hand at her hip moved between her legs, parting her and stroking gently through the slickness of her desire.</p><p>\u201cI believe you were made for me,\u201d he said huskily, rubbing her flesh with a callused finger. \u201cLook how wet you are.\u201d</p><p>Her hips rolled into his teasing caresses. \u201cJasper...\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, his breath ruffled her damp curls. She tensed in anticipation.</p><p>He licked his lips and purred, \u201cLet\u2019s see how wet you can get.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Eliza watched as Jasper leaned forward and licked lightly across the quivering flesh exposed by the spread of his fingers. The sensation was exquisite torment. Her thighs shook with the strain of yearning for orgasm. The sight of him on his knees, servicing her with such tenderness, was too stimulating to bear. He was so beautiful. So big and strong. So confident and self-possessed. To see him subjugating himself to her desire filled her with a sense of feminine power she\u2019d never known.</p><p>And Jasper had introduced her to that power. Shown her it existed. Reveled in her wielding of it. She cherished him for that gift and his confidence in giving it to her.</p><p>Cupping the back of his head, she held her breath in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cOpen to me,\u201d he said softly, tapping the top of his shoulder.</p><p>It took the space of a heartbeat to comprehend what he wanted. He held out his hand to help her balance and she carefully, hesitantly lifted one leg. As the back of her knee settled over his shoulder, the thrill of dominance increased. Heat raced across her skin. The lush weight of her breasts strained her bodice. The illicitness of what they were doing only added to her excitement. Her entire body felt ripe with erotic promise, fluid and languid, restless and alluring.</p><p>Jasper tilted his head back to look up at her. His expression\u2014lust laced with fondness and admiration\u2014tightened her chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve discovered your ability to enslave a man. And you like it.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers through his hair, grateful she had the right to do so. \u201cWith you, I seem to like everything.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her thigh with a firm, yet gentle grip. With a turn of his head, he pressed a kiss to the skin above the tie of her stocking. His tongue flickered, so swift and fleeting she wondered if she imagined it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI am already overwrought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience is a virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look virtuous to you?\u201d she cried, so frustrated by desire she had to look away.</p><p>It was then that the mirror behind him snared her attention. Her breath caught sharply at the reflected view\u2014her leg slung dominantly over Jasper\u2019s broad shoulder, her toes pointed from the delicious expectation, her hands cupping his head and urging him toward the eager flesh between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cAre you watching?\u201d he asked with a dark note of devilish provocation.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Eliza stared, unblinking, as his head canted to the side and he leaned into her. A second later, his mouth was on her, his firm lips surrounding her clitoris in a heated embrace. The flat of his tongue rubbed across the distended knot of nerves, and she cried out as tiny spasms rippled through her.</p><p>Jasper pulled back, licking his lips. \u201cOne day soon, I will spread you across my bed and feast on you for hours, just to hear the sounds you make when I pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>His words created a vision in her mind that inspired a heated rush of moisture. He hummed with approval and leaned forward, his hands cupping her buttocks and holding her still. The restraint he\u2019d shown so far disappeared in a voracious assault of lips and tongue that destroyed any remaining rational thought.</p><p>Driven to wildness by his ardor, Eliza held his head and rocked into his working mouth. In the mirror, her reflection was both aggressive and wanton, her calf flexing against his back, urging him on. She was red-faced and gasping, her eyes glassy and her hair in disarray. She looked ravished and debased and more sensual than she ever thought she could be.</p><p>She looked like a woman who might enslave a man like Jasper Bond.</p><p>He hefted her higher with effortless strength, forcing her to balance on the tips of her toes. His tongue pushed into her and she moaned, pleasure sizzling across oversensitive nerve endings. Stabbing fierce and fast, Jasper breached the clenching tissues and drank the flow of silky liquid that welcomed a deeper, thicker penetration.</p><p>All the while the mirror starkly displayed her frantic writhing. She ground her throbbing flesh against Jasper\u2019s mouth, riding his thrusts in a mindless quest for orgasm. His tongue withdrew, and he caught her clitoris in a hot, wet kiss. With suction and the pointed tip of his tongue, he set off a climax so intense her vision blackened. Sobbing in the grip of violent shudders, Eliza hunched over him, attempting to pull away from his fervent suckling but unable to escape him. As the gripping ecstasy eased, the circle of his lips tightened, hurtling her headlong into another furious release.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders. Tears burned her eyes and sweat bloomed from her skin in a humid mist. As she listed and began to fall, Jasper shrugged out from under her leg and caught her to him, tumbling backward so she sprawled across him.</p><p>She clung to him weakly, breathing his name.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he soothed, his hands stroking her trembling back. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>He did. Completely.</p><p>Jasper stared up at the murals of circling olive branches surrounding each of the three massive chandeliers in the Melville ballroom. He knew time was rushing by while he lay on hard marble with Eliza draped bonelessly atop him. However, he didn\u2019t care about the time or the discomfort of his position. There was nowhere else he would rather be. Aside from a bed, perhaps...</p><p>\u201cJasper?\u201d Eliza\u2019s normally clipped voice was passion-hoarse. He enjoyed the sound so much, he was prompted to press a quick hard kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cUm?\u201d His fingers played with the disheveled strands of her tumbling hair.</p><p>Her head lifted and she looked at him. \u201cHow can you imbue so much smugness into one little sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I not be smug? You just melted in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Gaze narrowed, she rose to a kneeling position beside him and set her hands on her knees. Her expressive face took on a look of examination and calculation. When her focus settled on his groin, his subsiding cockstand swelled to renewed life. He almost held his breath, wondering how far she would go.</p><p>\u201cI cannot allow you to leave with that,\u201d she pronounced.</p><p>He grinned, adoring her. \u201cOh? But it is attached, I\u2019m afraid. Fortunately, we are to be married, and you\u2019ll soon have more frequent access to it.\u201d</p><p>She gave his shoulder a push. \u201cNot the penis itself. The erection, you vexing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I always have one when I part ways with you.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes widened. \u201cYou do not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Not to this extent, but to some degree.\u201d</p><p>Eliza appeared to consider this information carefully. \u201cHave you always been so randy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot prior to meeting you. My natural appetite for sex was previously sated by twice-weekly visits to Remington\u2019s.\u201d He rubbed a strand of her hair between his thumb and forefinger, remembering the flaming tresses spilling across his pillows.</p><p>\u201cCourtesans?\u201d One of her hands lifted to rest on his abdomen. \u201cHave you never had a woman who was special to you? One to whom you were attached enough to see more than once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some who are...easier to pass the time with. They eschew conversation and work diligently. If they\u2019re available, I will choose one of them over the others. But attachment? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex without affection? That sounds very lonely to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what loneliness is.\u201d It was not in his nature to discuss feelings and such. Jasper shifted uncomfortably, but answered directly. The more he revealed, the less hesitant Eliza became. That result was worth any discomfort. \u201cThere are goals to be met and work to be done. There is no time in my day to wish for things I don\u2019t have. Except for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never understand why you like me so well.\u201d The tiny dimple he\u2019d first noted on the day they\u2019d met winked at him. \u201cBut I won\u2019t complain about my good fortune.\u201d</p><p>Enamored with that dimple, he grabbed her hand and tugged her toward him. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like kissing. Not that I\u2019m complaining. You are very accomplished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never liked the act prior to meeting you. Now, I cannot get enough. Sometimes the urge to kiss you is so fierce I have a damnable time resisting it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cTruly? I cannot fathom your disregard. I love your lips. And your kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never considered my mouth a particularly erotic part of my anatomy. There are other places on my body I preferred directing attention to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you somewhere else?\u201d A blush swept upward, over her chest to her cheeks. \u201cHere, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Her hand moved lower and stroked him through his breeches.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he hissed, unprepared for his impossibly swift reaction to her boldness.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d she whispered, withdrawing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He caught her retreating hand and put it back, mentally kicking himself for startling her away from an act he wanted as much as his next breath. The level of trust she was displaying\u2014from speaking freely to indulging his lustful whims\u2014humbled him. He\u2019d done nothing in his life to deserve her.</p><p>\u201cHave your wicked way with me,\u201d he urged. \u201cI beg you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza raked him with a heated glance, from head to toe. He felt that gaze like a tangible caress. \u201cTeach me how to please you. Show me the way to be the only woman you will ever need or want.\u201d</p><p>Jasper yanked the placket of his breeches open and pushed his smalls out of the way. His cock sprang free of its confinement, straining toward his navel in a display of brute male arrogance.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she breathed. \u201cEvery part of you is magnificent.\u201d</p><p>The awed note in her voice sent relief rushing through him, swiftly followed by rampant desire. He watched as she reached for him, her slim white hands enclosing his scorching length in cool satin skin. His neck arched, his teeth gritting together in a bid for control. A few pumps of his hand and he could finish this. He was primed to blow after Eliza\u2019s earlier display of total abandon. Her scent clung to his lips, filling his nostrils with every drawn breath, spurring his lust to previously unattained heights.</p><p>Her fingertips slid delicately up and down his cock, exploring. Jasper exhaled in a rush. His bollocks were drawn up tight, his seed churning and pushing its way up his shaft to leak out the tip.</p><p>Eliza touched the first drop, then lifted her finger toward her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou might not like it,\u201d he warned. \u201cSome women do not.\u201d</p><p>Her brow arched defiantly. Her mouth formed an O, and she pushed the glistening fingertip inside. She hummed softly, and that was his undoing.</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth on me,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cWrap your lips around the head.\u201d</p><p>She bent over him without hesitation. Her hair\u2014still partially pinned\u2014drifted over her shoulders, with some freed pieces falling to pool on his stomach. He reached up with one hand and pushed her hair out of the way of his view.</p> <p>He watched her lips part, her head lower, his cock disappear inside her...Her mouth fastened on the plush head, and he groaned raggedly. The drenching heat and gentle suction were torturous.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he gasped. \u201cTake more.\u201d</p><p>Her lips slid farther down, pushing his cockhead deeper into the narrowing channel of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSuck. Ah...yes, like that.\u201d Sweat dotted his brow and upper lip. \u201cGod...your tongue...\u201d</p><p>A moan vibrated along the length of his shaft.</p> <p>Any worry he\u2019d had that she would find the act distasteful vanished with that sound. Her hand pushed into his breeches and cupped his testicles. Her avid tongue rubbed the underside of his cock. Her head bobbed up and down his length, her mouth sucking so forcefully it was audible. The wet smacking echoed through the massive room, then rippled through him in a wracking shudder.</p><p>As frenzied as she\u2019d been in her own extremis, she was similarly ravenous for his. Eliza worked his cock as if starved for the taste of him. The sight of her fervor, the feel of her hands and mouth, the sounds she made...it was all so erotic he lost himself to her.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so hard,\u201d he growled. \u201cDesist. Let me finish this.\u201d</p><p>In response, she took him as deep as she could, her tongue pinning him to the curved roof of her mouth. She sucked him so vigorously his thighs shook with the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d His hips lunged upward. The first furious spurt of semen felt as if it was wrenched from his spine.</p><p>Eliza swallowed deeply and worked her hand on him, pumping his seed up the length of his shaft and into her eager mouth. Groaning and sweating, Jasper clenched his jaw shut and fucked his cock through her swollen lips, spewing his lust in an orgasm so intense it was painful. The rush of climax was endless, his cum spilling over her stroking tongue in thick, creamy washes. She took every wrenching pulse with unmitigated greed, urging him on with muffled moans.</p> <p>Jasper collapsed to the floor with arms outstretched, muscles twitching from his calves to his shoulders, his lungs fighting for every serrated breath. His cock began to soften, as exhausted as he was, but she didn\u2019t cease her ministrations. The tip of her tongue dipped into the tiny hole at the crown, drinking the last bit of semen he had left. He closed his eyes, drunk on the repletion sinking into the very marrow of his bones.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he murmured, needing to hold her.</p><p>As she curled against his side on the marble and entwined her legs with his, Jasper didn\u2019t recognize the feeling gripping his chest in a vise.</p><p>It was hours later when he realized the sensation might have been joy.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Eliza welcomed the distraction provided by the arrival of her man of affairs shortly after eleven o\u2019clock two days later. Jasper had sent a note, excusing himself from their scheduled morning meeting, and while it expressed regret, the missive gave no explanation for why he\u2019d canceled. The last time they spoke at length was during yesterday\u2019s dance lesson in the ballroom\u2014a space she would never think of in the same way again.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Reynolds,\u201d she replied briskly, closing her ledger and smiling.</p><p>He stared at her, blinking, as if taken aback, which brought to her attention how readily she smiled of late.</p> <p>Clearing his throat, he took a seat in front of her desk. She was pleased to see he\u2019d procured a new satchel. Unlike his previous one, this one was made of butter-soft burgundy leather ornamented with gold hardware. He was a wonderful employee, one who worked hard and performed well, and she paid him accordingly. It was good to see him indulging himself.</p><p>\u201cI understand congratulations are in order,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d Eliza linked her fingers on the desktop. \u201cHow is Mrs. Reynolds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>He told a story about his wife\u2019s social pursuits that Eliza made every effort to appear interested in. She was grateful when he moved on and said, \u201cI\u2019ve also received word from my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d A quiver moved through her tummy. Jasper\u2019s agreement to be more forthcoming about his situation put her in an awkward position. She\u2019d grown more and more apprehensive about sending Tobias Reynolds to Ireland. Although she had engaged Tobias before beginning an intimate relationship with Jasper, she was nevertheless circumventing the man she intended to marry by researching his past without his knowledge or consent.</p><p>Reynolds settled more comfortably into the chair. \u201cHe arrived safely and has begun the initial inquiries.\u201d</p><p>She reminded herself to trust her instincts. \u201cI would like to recall him. I have the information I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re certain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. He\u2019ll still be paid the agreed-upon fee for his time, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted it.\u201d His fingers curled and uncurled around the wooden arms of his chair. \u201cMay I speak freely, Miss Martin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she assured. \u201cI value honesty above all else. I\u2019d expect you would know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. However...\u201d He inhaled deeply, then exhaled in a rush of words. \u201cHave I been remiss in my duties or disappointing in some way? Have I given you cause to distrust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her spine straightened with alarm. \u201cWhy would you have such concerns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always asked me to investigate your suitors. Therefore, I was startled to learn of your engagement to a gentleman whose circumstances I was not asked to explore. I know he is a friend of Lord Melville, but he\u2019s also a possible investor and even in that capacity, you did not ask me to verify his solvency.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was impressed. \u201cYour thoroughness is laudable, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear you say so.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cI had only yesterday and this morning to inquire, but I must confess, what little I\u2019ve gleaned has made me uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUneasy?\u201d Certainly Terrance Reynolds wasn\u2019t the only enterprising and curious individual in town. What could be learned about Jasper through cursory inquiry?</p><p>\u201cHis residence is in a less-than-fashionable area of town. He has all manner of disreputable-looking individuals coming and going as they please. I\u2019m not yet certain, but I believe he engages in trade. I suspect he makes a comfortable living, but it\u2019s doubtful he has your means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew do. Regardless, Mr. Bond counts the Earl of West-field as a close acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Reynolds conceded. \u201cFrankly, your betrothed is a bit of an enigma.\u201d</p><p>Much obliged by his loyalty, Eliza felt it best to offer a truthful explanation for Jasper, so Reynolds would no longer be troubled. \u201cMr. Bond is a thief-taker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thief-taker!\u201d There was a pause, during which he blinked rapidly. Finally, he said, \u201cNot one of the better-known ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. It would have been impossible for Mr. Bond to assume the guise of a viable suitor if he was a familiar personage. I found him through a referral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound...? You sought a thief-taker? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you recall when Mrs. Peachtree experienced monetary troubles earlier this year?\u201d she asked, referring to a tenant who\u2019d suspected one of her employees of pilfering from the till. \u201cYou reported that she hired a Runner. When my situation arose, I approached her for his name and engaged the same man. However, Mr. Bell was unable to assist me. He referred me to Thomas Lynd, who suggested Mr. Bond would be more suitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d Reynolds flushed. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much without my assistance...I cannot help feeling superfluous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite the opposite. You\u2019re an excellent man of affairs, sir, and valuable to me. Therefore, I was unwilling to endanger you. You see, I have recently found myself to be prone to accidents of a disturbing and suspicious nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidents!\u201d He paled. \u201cWhat...? Why...? Damnation! Who would have reason to harm you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hired Mr. Bond to discover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d seen fit to include me. Tobias and I could have overseen a thief-taker or Runner on your behalf. You could have avoided the ruse of an engagement to Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a ruse.\u201d She lamented the shadow of confusion that swept over his features. \u201cMy relationship with Mr. Bond is twofold.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds began to shift uncomfortably in his seat. He looked pained.</p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say, sir,\u201d she prompted. \u201cPlease feel free. I respect your opinions and viewpoints as they relate to my business matters.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat again. \u201cI find the novelty of the series of events leading to the hiring of Mr. Bond to be...dubious. The circle begins when you\u2019re subjected to incidences causing you to fear for your safety. Then, you hire a thief-taker. The result of which leads to the thief-taker successfully wooing you into accepting his proposal of marriage, despite his lack of suitability. I cannot help wondering if the end ties back to the beginning in a manner more closely related than surface appearances indicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s possible Mr. Bond is the source of my problem, as well as the solution to it? No, do not look chagrined! It is a fascinating hypothesis. I\u2019m embarrassed I didn\u2019t think of it myself.\u201d She leaned back in her chair and allowed her mind to toy with the idea. \u201cMr. Bond would indeed be quite clever if he arranged to create circumstances necessitating his hiring, then used his employment to gain access to wooing me. However, considering my former aversion to marriage, I cannot see how anyone would imagine such machinations would be successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour financial means and familial circumstances would certainly make the effort worthwhile. What would Mr. Bond have to lose? At the very least, he would be paid to solve a mystery of his own making, ensuring a satisfying conclusion for you and a financial reward for him.\u201d</p><p>Eliza smiled. \u201cI\u2019m congratulating myself for hiring such a creative thinker for my man of affairs.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds looked embarrassed. \u201cYou have always been so circumspect, especially about your suitors. Please allow me to continue investigating Mr. Bond. I\u2019ll accept no fee for my services. Putting your mind at ease is the very least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not uneasy, Mr. Reynolds. Trust is of equal value to me as honesty. I\u2019ve extended mine to Mr. Bond without reservation, and I have no wish to erode that foundation with needless doubts.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Reynolds. However, I do have something for you to look into. The Earl of Montague is creating an investment pool. I should like to know what speculation has garnered his interest and how you assess its viability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in joining the pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at this time. Lord Montague approached Mr. Bond about it, and I\u2019m concerned as to whether or not the investment is sound.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds withdrew his weekly report from his satchel and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll begin my inquiries straightaway.\u201d</p><p>Eliza accepted the papers with a brisk nod. \u201cGodspeed, sir.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight bow. \u201cTo you as well, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>For the hour following Terrance Reynolds\u2019s departure, Eliza worked diligently on a list of garments and items she would need for her trousseau. Her desire to replace her entire wardrobe with gowns of brighter hues and more provocative lines was just another sign of how much she\u2019d changed since meeting Jasper. It was not an alteration of character she took lightly.</p><p>After contemplating the matter thoroughly, she understood that Jasper wasn\u2019t the entirety of the reason why she was able to abandon long-held attitudes and beliefs. Her own ability to trust him enabled her transformation. She\u2019d watched her mother falter through one relationship after another, spiraling deeper into melancholia with every failed romance. Whatever it was Georgina had been seeking in a partner, she\u2019d been unable to find it. Eliza now suspected a lack of trust and honesty was to blame. All this time, she\u2019d thought avoidance of romantic entanglements was the solution. In truth, the answer was simply to find a partner whom she could trust. Now she had only to cultivate her bond with Jasper through transparency and forthrightness.</p><p>A soft rapping on her open study door drew Eliza\u2019s attention from the papers on her desk. Robbins stood on the threshold with the post in hand.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss.\u201d</p><p>The butler entered and set the salver on the edge of her desk. \u201cWill you be taking tea here, or with his lordship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Melville, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza stared at the unusually large pile of letters in front of her. She shifted through them, separating Melville\u2019s correspondence from her own. The majority of her post was invitations, far more than she was accustomed to receiving. Confused by the sudden influx, she collected Melville\u2019s missives and stood. She went to her uncle\u2019s study and discovered him absent, then moved on to the conservatory. There she found him watering the plants he experimented with. The afternoon sunlight poured in through the many windows, warming the enclosed space and creating a noticeable humidity.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, my lord,\u201d she said upon entering.</p><p>Melville presented his cheek to her, and she pressed a kiss to it. \u201cEliza,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cRemember the splicing I shared with you? Look how it\u2019s thriving!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eliza examined the two disparate plants, now connected at the stem. It made her think of her relationship with Jasper. \u201cBeautiful. I can see why you\u2019re so pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally these plants grow best in a tropical climate, so I am doubly pleased by the success.\u201d He beamed with pride, then noted the letters she carried. His smile faded, and he held out his hand with a sigh.</p><p>She handed the post to him. \u201cAre you making any progress with responding to those who write to you?\u201d</p><p>His wince was answer enough.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cDo you never miss the company of others, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have all I need right here.\u201d He set the mail atop potting soil scattered on the table.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps others need you. Clearly they continue to extend their friendship to you, even though you don\u2019t reply.\u201d</p><p>Melville\u2019s well-being was a growing concern to her. What would happen to him when they no longer shared a roof? She was his sole human connection to the world at large. Would he soon become completely estranged from Society, reliant upon the gazettes for news? It broke her heart to think of it.</p><p>He returned his attention to watering his plants. \u201cWere you not determined to live a solitary life until a short time ago? Content with quiet walks, good books, and uninterrupted time with your ledgers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long? Eventually, I will move on to my reward.\u201d</p><p>Eliza drew swirls in the soil with her fingertip. \u201cThe time you speak of is still far away.\u201d</p><p>Melville glanced at her, but blessedly did not continue to speak of his demise. Instead he said, \u201cRegardless, I am relieved to see you out of your mother\u2019s shadow. It does my old heart good to know you\u2019ve found someone with whom to share your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s shadow,\u201d she repeated softly. \u201cHave I moved out of it? I resemble her, and I\u2019ve chosen a man similar to my father. Perhaps I have assumed her shadow and made it my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have her beauty,\u201d Melville agreed. \u201cBut also a steadfastness she lacked. Your footing is solid. Georgina\u2019s was often unsteady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean to say she was irresponsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to say she was unstable. She could not maintain an even keel. She listed from one side to the other.\u201d He flicked a small bug off a plant leaf. \u201cGeorgina is the reason I acquired an interest in horticulture. My hope was to find some combination of herbal elements to tame the mercurial quality of her moods.\u201d</p><p>Eliza remembered those fluctuations all too well. Georgina would be giddy with happiness one week, then unable to rise from bed the next. \u201cYou think her ailment was physical? I have always believed she simply had poor judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was willing to consider any possibility. I would\u2019ve searched the world for the key to her happiness, just as I would do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond makes me happy. The only worry I have now is for you.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and patted the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be well, so long as you are.\u201d</p><p>Turning her hand over, she squeezed his. \u201cShall we retire to your study for tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it time already?\u201d As if cued, Melville\u2019s stomach grumbled with hunger. He set the watering pot down and dusted off his hands. Then, he proffered his forearm to her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the mail I brought you.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, but gathered up the post. \u201cYou are certainly stubborn like your mother.\u201d</p><p>They exited the conservatory and strolled the distance to his study in companionable silence. When they stepped into his private domain, Eliza took in the space where her uncle spent the majority of his day and knew she would miss these moments with him. For all his idiosyncrasies and foibles, she loved him dearly. She wondered how much time she might have to visit with him once she lived with Jasper. When Melville retreated to the country, would he be alone for months at a time? Now that she thought of it, she suspected Jasper spent all of the year in London due to his trade.</p><p>Melville set the latest post atop the leaning pile of mail in the basket by the door. Unable to bear the additional weight, the mass shifted to the side and dozens of letters tumbled to the floor. \u201cBloody nuisance,\u201d he muttered, squatting to pick up the wayward missives.</p><p>Eliza joined him, raking letters toward her with widespread fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d he said to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s odd?\u201d she queried.</p><p>\u201cThis seal.\u201d</p><p>She focused on the black wax seal gracing the letter he held out to her. \u201cIt looks to be a sword crossing over...something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hourglass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. To whom does that seal belong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no notion. But there is another one...\u201d He dug into the pile at his feet and withdrew a second letter bearing the same image in black wax. \u201cSee here.\u201d</p><p>He opened the letter, dropping the others to the floor in the process. As he read, he frowned. Then, he grew very pale.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cIt appears to be a threat of violence\u201d\u2014Melville held the letter out to her\u2014\u201cagainst you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Standing, Jasper set both palms flat on Eliza\u2019s desk and surveyed the five open letters spread out before him. They were obviously all penned by the same female hand. The delicate swirls and flowing script were clearly the handiwork of a woman.</p><p>He glanced up at Melville and Eliza, both of whom sat in chairs facing him. \u201cAre there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were all we could find,\u201d Eliza said, looking remarkably composed.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any notion of when the first of these arrived? Or the last?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s fingertips drummed on the desktop. \u201cThis changes everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt certainly does.\u201d</p><p>Each missive warned Melville to retire with Eliza to the country or she would pay the consequences, completely contradicting Eliza\u2019s original assumption that she was being pushed toward matrimony.</p><p>He looked at the earl. \u201cWould you, perchance, be able to assist with the procurement of a Special License?\u201d</p><p>Eliza jolted visibly. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial License?\u201d the earl asked, frowning and scratching his head. \u201cWho\u2019s getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take that as a \u2018no.\u2019\u201d Jasper was certain Melville\u2019s hair was even more of a fright today than it had been the previous times he\u2019d seen it. \u201cPerhaps Westfield can be useful in that regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d Eliza no longer looked placid. \u201cWhat are you about?\u201d</p><p>Straightening, he set his hands on his hips. \u201cIt appears there\u2019s a woman out there who perceives you to be a threat. It\u2019s likely she has an interest in one of your suitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unhealthy interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can only hope that it\u2019s Montague who has enamored her to the point of violence.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an arch look.</p><p>His smile was unapologetic. \u201cRegardless, taking you out of competition could likely remove you from danger straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the news of my engagement will suffice, if we give it a chance to spread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rest easier if you and I resided under the same roof.\u201d In truth, he doubted he would rest at all if they shared a bed, but that was a topic for another discussion.</p><p>Melville nodded. \u201cQuite right. I\u2019ve proven to be unsuitable for the task of protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s gaze dropped to her lap.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d Jasper made every effort to keep his voice modulated. \u201cI should like to hear your thoughts on the matter.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to leave Melville at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he your only concern?\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted. \u201cAm I overlooking something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He relaxed. \u201cI could take up residence here with you until the end of the Season. As your husband.\u201d</p><p>The softness that stole into her eyes when she looked at him was worth far more than the concession deserved, but he wouldn\u2019t complain about that.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her smile lit up the room.</p><p>A surge of adrenaline pushed through him. Eliza would be his within the week. \u201cMake whatever arrangements you need, but please avoid leaving the house whenever possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI will see to my end of things.\u201d He cast one last glance at the letters laid out before him. Fury resurfaced with biting swiftness. He would find the author of the threats and ensure that the culprit never posed a hazard to Eliza again.</p><p>Marriage would not be the end of his hunt.</p><p>Jasper urged his horse away from Lambeth Palace. He cast a final look at the brick gatehouse and Lollard\u2019s Tower, then set his hand lightly over the Special License tucked into his coat\u2019s inner pocket.</p><p>Drawing abreast of him, Westfield said, \u201cYou have yet to tell me precisely what the letters said. Since their contents incited our mad rush to the archbishop, you have to know I\u2019m overset with curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe missives were brief. A few lines each, almost in rhyme, with the same admonishment to retire from the city. Two made indirect references to sidesaddles and the Serpentine, both of which relate to accidents Miss Martin experienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about the falling statue at the Royal Academy? Perhaps it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I\u2019m at a disadvantage in many respects. I don\u2019t know if the letters arrived before the events, which might suggest violence was not the culprit\u2019s first choice. Or if the letters arrived after the fact and served as taunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWritten by a woman, you say?\u201d Westfield whistled. \u201cThere is some sense in that. A man who wished to prevent her from marrying could simply compromise Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she would have conceded, despite the damage to her reputation. She has an aversion to being managed and a limited appreciation for Society\u2019s mores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d The earl tugged the brim of his hat down as a shield against the late afternoon sun. \u201cThe more I learn of her, the more I like. Who would have thought a spinster\u2019s sixth Season would cultivate such drama and intrigue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich begs the question: why now? Melville\u2019s correspondence has been accumulating for years. His housekeeper was able to present a small trunk of past letters, and there were no threats prior to this Season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you won\u2019t be abandoning your work in favor of a honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>The mention of a honeymoon was all it took to fill Jasper\u2019s mind with lascivious thoughts. \u201cIf only I were so fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are extremely fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s brows rose. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew precisely what you wanted, and made certain you attained it.\u201d</p><p>Directing his gaze forward, Jasper pondered the somber note in the earl\u2019s normally droll tone. \u201cIs all well with you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Nothing is ever wrong in my world, Bond. There are no surprises. No challenges. Equanimity rules the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something to be said for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s boring.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Jasper urged his mount into a canter, leaving the Thames behind. There was a great deal to be done before he could end the day. \u201cYou are welcome to stay in my world for a while longer, if you prefer. Never a dull moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re married,\u201d Westfield drawled.</p><p>Jasper entered his house to the sound of raucous laughter floating out of the downstairs parlor. Behind him, Westfield barely stepped onto the marble floor of the visitor\u2019s foyer when Herbert Crouch caught sight of them.</p><p>Herbert, who\u2019d been leaning against the parlor doorjamb as if awaiting them, pulled his hands out of his pants\u2019 pockets and straightened. He was one of Jasper\u2019s most seasoned employees; old enough that his two grown sons also worked for Jasper. He lumbered over with a broad grin that peeked out from the frame of a bushy, unkempt beard.</p><p>The Crouches were an odd-looking lot as a whole. Herbert was of a height with Jasper, but considerably broader. Many of his progeny were near giants; the top of their sire\u2019s head barely reached their shoulders.</p><p>Herbert mussed his wheat-colored hair with a meaty hand, disrupting the perfectly molded shape of his hat\u2019s interior. \u201cI \u2019ave news that might be interesting.\u201d</p><p>Gesturing toward his study, Jasper passed his hat and gloves to his butler, but kept his coat on. The Special License in his pocket wasn\u2019t something he was willing to allow out of his immediate reach.</p><p>He settled behind his desk. Westfield moved over to the console to help himself to the Armagnac. Herbert sank heavily onto one of the settees.</p><p>With libation in hand, Westfield faced the center of the room and leaned back against the console with his hip. He crossed his legs at the ankle and enjoyed a deep swallow of brandy. \u201cHow fare you, Crouch?\u201d</p><p>Jasper studied him. The earl seemed to be imbibing more of late. If he continued along the same vein, Jasper intended to bring the matter up for discussion. It was not a subject he looked forward to broaching, but the health of his friend warranted his concern.</p><p>\u201cAs well as can be expected, mi\u2019lord.\u201d Herbert didn\u2019t smile, which was unusual for him. Jasper knew the commoner was ill-at-ease conversing socially with an earl.</p><p>\u201cHow are Mrs. Crouch and your brood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll are well. The missus is increasin\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? Dear God.\u201d Westfield took another drink. \u201cHow many children do you have now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen. Until the birthin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a stronger man than I, Crouch.\u201d</p><p>Herbert gave an awkward pull on his beard and looked at Jasper almost pleadingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jasper took pity on the man and said, \u201cBefore you begin, it is important to know we\u2019re now looking for a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Herbert slapped his knee.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d Jasper was more than satisfied with the strengths of his crew. Herbert in particular had an instinct for hunting, becoming quite dogged when he sensed something was amiss. \u201cWhat did you uncover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still \u2019ave a few more questions of my own to answer \u2019bout some o\u2019 the renters, but there\u2019s one I\u2019m fair certain isn\u2019t what she says she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa Pennington. Aaron and I \u2019ave asked around, but we can\u2019t find any proof of a Mr. Pennington. No ring on \u2019er finger, no papers or letters, no portraits\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she keeps such sentimental items in a private place,\u201d Westfield suggested.</p><p>\u201cI checked,\u201d Herbert said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014?\u201d Westfield paused. \u201cForget I asked.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cHer residence is above the store, yes?\u201d</p><p>Herbert nodded. \u201cAside from the agreement to rent the space from Miss Martin, I couldn\u2019t find anything with the name \u2018Pennington\u2019 on it. But I did find several receipts and such addressed to \u2018Vanessa Chilcott.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cChilcott.\u201d Jasper leaned back heavily into his chair. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ne\u2019er-do-well clan of thieves and miscreants.\u201d West-field straightened and took the seat opposite Herbert. \u201cPerhaps their past success with Lady Georgina has made them bold in regards to the Tremaine family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Vanessa Chilcott related to Miss Martin\u2019s stepfather?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>Herbert lifted one sturdy shoulder in a shrug. \u201cAside from praising her face and figure, the other shopkeepers in the area \u2019ad little to say \u2019bout her. She keeps to \u2019erself.\u201d</p> <p>Westfield snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve been told the Chilcotts are all remarkably good looking. Which is not enough to make me foolish, but clearly the same cannot be said of everyone, or the family wouldn\u2019t be so successful in their subterfuges.\u201d</p><p>Jasper averted his gaze. Eliza was too intelligent to miss seeing the parallels between her relationship with him and her mother\u2019s with Chilcott. She had to overlook prejudicial experiences in order to extend her trust to him, which made her credence all the more valuable. He would have to tread carefully or risk losing something priceless.</p><p>\u201cI want Miss Chilcott watched at all hours until further notice,\u201d he told Herbert. \u201cI want to know whom she speaks to, where she goes, and what hours she keeps. And I need to know how she\u2019s related to Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it.\u201d Herbert pushed heavily to his feet.</p><p>Jasper watched the man depart, then looked at Westfield. \u201cI visited the Pennington store with Miss Martin, and she had no notion the proprietress was anything more than a stranger. Miss Chilcott, however, appeared to be greatly interested in Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected.\u201d The earl made a careless gesture with his hand. \u201cShe is residing and conducting business in space owned by Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Chilcott should not be aware of that fact. Miss Martin takes great pains to remain anonymous, conducting most transactions through her man of affairs. She believes it eases the way for everyone involved if her gender remains unknown.\u201d Jasper rapped his knuckles against the desk in frustration. \u201cDamnation. If I\u2019d retained the sales receipt from my purchase, I could have compared Vanessa Chilcott\u2019s penmanship to that of the letters Melville received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why Miss Chilcott would want to prevent Miss Martin from marrying. Pettiness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is an obligation created with their business relationship that doesn\u2019t exist otherwise,\u201d Jasper reasoned, \u201ca legal agreement between two parties with responsibilities and ramifications on both sides. As a former step-relation, whatever grievance Miss Chilcott may have against Miss Martin clearly has no weight or she would have pursued it legally. Without legal basis, there\u2019s no possibility of restitution. But as a tenant, if she was to create a circumstance in which Miss Martin was seen as liable for damages or loss of income, Miss Chilcott could possibly negotiate a financial settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Miss Martin is accountable as a landlord in ways she isn\u2019t as a relation-by-marriage. Exploiting their business association for monetary gain wouldn\u2019t be too far outside the realm of possibility, considering the Chilcott family\u2019s larcenous reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. It would also explain why Miss Chilcott hid her true identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut would an assumed guise withstand further scrutiny in a court of law?\u201d Westfield queried.</p><p>\u201cAssuming I\u2019m correct, I doubt she intends her plan to go that far. If she was able to gain leverage of some sort against Miss Martin, I believe the result would be a quiet exchange of funds in order to maintain the business anonymity Miss Martin prizes. However, if Miss Martin had a spouse, he would have greater license to mount a public defense, because he would have no reason to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtortion is a nasty business. Best not to have anything requiring concealment.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s foot tapped restlessly. \u201cI\u2019m due to retrieve the balance of my purchases from Miss Chilcott\u2019s store\u2014customized items requiring preparation time.\u201d</p><p>Westfield set his glass on the low table with a dull thud and rose gracefully to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you, of course. I should like to see what happens next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us hope you see the end of Miss Martin\u2019s troubles.\u201d Jasper pulled out his pocket watch and checked the time. He cursed.</p><p>\u201cRunning behind again, are you?\u201d There was laughter in the earl\u2019s voice. \u201cTardiness is becoming a habit with you. Here I thought you would corrupt Miss Martin\u2019s finer points, but perhaps the opposite is true.\u201d</p><p>Jasper might have been chagrined if not for the fact that the swifter time passed, the sooner Eliza would be his wife. \u201cStep lively, Westfield.\u201d</p><p>But haste didn\u2019t help him achieve his aim. Although they arrived at Miss Chilcott\u2019s shop within posted business hours, the proprietress was not in evidence.</p><p>\u201cShoddy way to run a new business,\u201d Westfield muttered, tilting his head back to eye the pink-striped awning.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you mean to make a success of it. By your accounts, the Chilcotts aren\u2019t ones to work for their keep.\u201d</p><p>Jasper waited for Peter Crouch to return from checking the rear exterior staircase leading to the domicile on the second floor. When the young man appeared, he was shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDamn and blast,\u201d Jasper muttered. \u201cI cannot wait for Miss Chilcott to return. I\u2019m to meet Montague at Remington\u2019s in an hour to discuss his idiotic mining speculation.\u201d</p><p>Westfield looked at him. \u201cDespite an imminent wedding and the nefarious Miss Chilcott, you still won\u2019t allow Montague to meet his own fate? You know as well as I he\u2019s destined to destroy himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and his family owe me far better than that. I want his destruction to come by my hand, and I will not rest until I\u2019ve seen the deed through to the last.\u201d</p><p>The earl sighed and turned away from the building. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you to Remington\u2019s, then part ways with you for the evening. With the announcement of Miss Martin\u2019s engagement to you, you won\u2019t be needing me to gain entry to anyplace you choose to go. I, however, am in dire need of a strong drink and a soft woman. Or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy on the drink,\u201d Jasper said, walking back to his horse.</p><p>\u201cAnd ride hard on the woman? Excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Neither man could see the eavesdropper in the room above them. She sat on the floor beneath the barely raised sash and listened to the masculine voices drifting up to her. A smile curved her lovely lips. With a rapacious gleam in her blue eyes, she began to plan...</p><p>It was difficult for Eliza to refrain from fidgeting when she knew she was to be married the next day. However, the Cranmores\u2019 ballroom was not the place to appear anxious.</p><p>A few years had passed since she\u2019d last been invited to a Cranmore event. Lady Cranmore was a consummate hostess whose entertainment innovations were often copied, and her expertise was widely evident tonight. Tulle and ivy wrapped Ionic columns. Harp players filled every corner with music when the orchestra was quiet. Outside, the rear lawn was dotted with dramatically blazing torches. The result was one of Grecian decadence, and everyone in attendance appeared to be in high spirits.</p><p>Eliza, however, was feeling high-strung. She was filled with a mixture of exhilaration and apprehension such as she\u2019d never known. Tomorrow, she would be wed. After so many years of making certain she did nothing as her mother would have, she was no longer allowing Georgina to rule her actions from the grave. Which made every aspect of the coming day momentous.</p><p>\u201cI am so pleased,\u201d Lady Collingsworth said, looking at Eliza with bright eyes. \u201cI must confess, when you told me you would be married tomorrow, I doubted I could do justice to the occasion with such short notice.\u201d</p><p>Personally, Eliza thought nothing more than family and close friends were necessary, but she guessed that saying so would only disappoint and hurt Regina. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said instead. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff.\u201d Regina waved one gloved hand carelessly. \u201cI had given up on your ever marrying. I\u2019m so very happy you found someone precious to you after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious,\u201d Eliza repeated, her head turning to find Jasper. He stood on the edge of the ballroom speaking with Montague. She\u2019d previously taken note of Westfield\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cYou are full of surprises lately,\u201d Regina murmured. \u201cTo think...Secret proposals from two of the most eligible bachelors of the ton. Absolutely delicious. Does Mr. Bond know who his competition was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Montague is being laudably gracious. Look at him speaking so civilly with your betrothed. And what a pair they make. From this distance, one could almost imagine them as brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy understanding is that the similarities between the two exist only on the exterior.\u201d</p><p>Regina leaned closer. \u201cYour tone is intriguing.\u201d</p><p>Eliza lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHave you ever heard anything of a worrisome nature about Lord Montague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. There are some things it\u2019s best not to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot initiate such a topic, only to abandon it!\u201d</p><p>When it became apparent Eliza would say no more, Regina snapped open her fan with a flourish. \u201cHmph...With your engagement, I\u2019d hoped that poor Rothschild girl would finally capture Montague\u2019s attention, but you have me wondering if he\u2019s not such a prize after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane Rothschild?\u201d Eliza frowned.</p><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d Regina gestured to where Miss Rothschild was hovering behind a column near Montague and Jasper. \u201cSee how she stares at him, looking so forlorn? I\u2019ve noticed her lingering in his general vicinity, as if she hopes he\u2019ll notice her. Her behavior is sadly untoward, but exception must be made for her common origins.\u201d</p><p>Jane was a pretty girl with soft brown hair and eyes, and a rather curvaceous figure. An air of melancholy clung to her. Perhaps it was the way her mouth turned down at the corners, or how she shifted so restlessly, as if the disquiet inside her was so great it manifested itself physically.</p><p>\u201cMontague told me he attempted to court Miss Rothschild,\u201d Eliza said, \u201cbut she was unreceptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe that,\u201d Regina scoffed. \u201cHer parents would pay a fortune for an earldom, and her actions speak for her.\u201d</p><p>Eliza could argue with neither point. Curious, she excused herself and moved toward the other woman. Why would Montague say Miss Rothschild was averse to his suit, when it appeared she was in fact openly seeking his regard? It was a puzzle, especially considering how dire Montague\u2019s financial situation was reported to be and how wealthy the Rothschilds were.</p><p>As she drew closer, Montague parted from Jasper and moved toward the open doors leading to the moonlit garden. Jane prepared to follow the earl outside, but Eliza spoke out.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rothschild. How are you this evening?\u201d</p><p>Jane cast an almost frantic glance at Montague\u2019s back, then faced Eliza with a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m well, Miss Martin. Thank you for inquiring. Congratulations on your betrothal.\u201d</p><p>With proximity, Eliza noted Jane\u2019s wan complexion and the dark circles under her eyes. \u201cThank you. Would you care for something to drink? A lemonade, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jane looked out the door again. \u201cI\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Martin.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s voice drew Eliza\u2019s attention. His gaze was blatantly inquisitive.</p><p>Jane bolted. \u201cExcuse me, Miss Martin. I wish you a good evening.\u201d</p><p>Eliza gaped as the woman hurried out to the garden.</p><p>Drawing abreast of her, Jasper queried, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, his proximity far too close to be seemly, but she couldn\u2019t complain. The thrill she felt at his nearness was worth any censure.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of your stepfather\u2019s relations?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cExtremely little. I avoided speaking with him whenever possible.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s gaze moved over her face, searching. \u201cWhat was it about him you disliked so intensely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have had to know my mother to understand. She was...erratic. Impulsive. What she needed was a firm hand, such as my father\u2019s, but Mr. Chilcott was overly indulgent. He encouraged her wild notions and sudden changes of agenda. His enabling of her behavior led to their deaths. She decided they absolutely had to travel north to celebrate the passing of six months of marriage. She ignored warnings of muddy roads due to torrential downpours, and he didn\u2019t have the sense or will to stay her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Eliza looked out to the rear lawn, but could no longer see Jane Rothschild or Lord Montague. The Cranmores had a heterogeneous garden featuring a hedgerow maze, a pagoda, various-sized obelisks, a recreation of a Grecian temple ruin, and a gazebo covered in climbing roses. It was an expansive outdoor space that could not be seen fully while standing in the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cEscort me outside.\u201d</p> <p>With one brow arched in a silent show of curiosity, he offered his arm and led her to the garden.</p><p>They reached the gravel-lined path beyond the terrace and began to stroll. There were several groups of guests enjoying the many sights, but the distance between parties was sufficient to keep the conversations private.</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, are we doing?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>Although she was focused on finding Jane Rothschild, Eliza was taken by Jasper\u2019s warm tone. She glanced at him. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for a quiet corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you attempting to compromise me, Miss Martin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI confess, the notion is tempting. If you were of a mind to steal a few moments of my time away from prying eyes and ears, where in this garden would you go?\u201d</p><p>He raked their surroundings with a considering glance. \u201cNot the maze. Nor the gazebo. The temple might have promise, if you could restrain those sweet whimpers of yours that drive me to distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not quiet in your pleasures either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you, love. Only with you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched at his endearment. Embarrassed by the depth of her reaction, she looked away...and noted footprints moving off the pathway onto the adjacent lawn. She tugged Jasper\u2019s arm to stay him, then pointed at the ground.</p><p>His lips pursed, contemplatively.</p> <p>Only two prints were visible before the rest became hidden by low-lying ferns. A large Italian alder spread its branches above them, providing a slightly shadowy cover from the moonlight.</p><p>Releasing him, Eliza looked around to be sure no one was watching, then she followed the trail by stepping deliberately into the preceding footprints. She knew Jasper was with her even though she didn\u2019t hear him behind her. As she approached the tree, she picked out the sound of voices. One was feminine and pleading, the other masculine and biting.</p><p>Jasper caught her elbow and pulled her to the side, then urged her to crouch behind a boxwood shrub. Eliza bunched up her pale green skirts to keep the hem from becoming damp and dirty. They were on the far side of the tree from where they\u2019d left the path. She couldn\u2019t see the other couple from their vantage, but the sound was much improved.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot leave me in this state!\u201d Jane cried.</p><p>\u201cI can do anything I desire. Haven\u2019t we already determined that?\u201d</p><p>The identity of the speakers was clear to Eliza. When she looked at Jasper, she knew he recognized Montague\u2019s voice, if not Jane Rothschild\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou leave me no choice,\u201d Jane said, with steel in her tone. \u201cI shall tell my parents what you did to me at the Hammonds\u2019 house party. They will know I carry your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it mine?\u201d Montague rejoined smoothly. \u201cI think not. You are a promiscuous piece of baggage. I\u2019m certain I can locate others who would attest to sampling your dubious charms.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper jolted physically, eliciting Eliza\u2019s concern. Reaching out, she set her hand atop his forearm and found it to be hard as marble. He looked stone-faced and furious, his jaw clenched so tightly the tautness of the muscles was visible. He did not, however, look the least bit as surprised as she knew she did.</p><p>\u201cI was untouched,\u201d Jane said with more dignity than Eliza thought she would manage under similar circumstances. \u201cYou forced this child on me. You must make this right. Your misdeed can no longer remain hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRape is a serious allegation, Miss Rothschild. In fact, I find it so egregious I\u2019m considering leveling an allegation against you in response: scandalum magnatum. While antiquated, it would still serve to protect my good name. You would go to prison, Jane, for libel against a peer of the realm. Not the most hospitable accommodations for a woman who is enceinte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a monster. Vile and debased. Filled with the devil\u2019s own taste for depravity and lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to wed me.\u201d Montague laughed. \u201cWhat does that make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperate,\u201d Jane hissed.</p><p>Eliza swayed with a rush of nausea. Jasper grabbed her elbow and stood, dragging her up with him. He propelled her away from their hiding spot and back out to the pathway, nearly running into Sir Richard Tolliver and his sister, who were strolling away from the manse.</p><p>\u201cI say,\u201d Tolliver muttered. \u201cWhat were you doing back there, Mr. Bond?\u201d</p><p>Jasper moved to step around the siblings. \u201cWe were momentarily lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost?\u201d Tolliver snorted. \u201cRidiculous. Have you no care for Miss Martin\u2019s reputation? Certainly my sister and I will be discreet, but you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour discretion is appreciated. Excuse us.\u201d Jasper gave a quick bow and set off toward the house, forcing Eliza into an indecorous pace to keep up.</p><p>As they fled, she glanced behind her. Tolliver was engaged in spirited debate with his sister. Chagrined to have been caught stumbling out of the bushes with Jasper, Eliza was turning her gaze forward again when a shifting shadow beneath the alder caught her eye. A chill moved through her.</p><p>Had Jane Rothschild noted their departure? Or worse, had Montague?</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cForgive the delay, Mr. Reynolds.\u201d Eliza hurried into her study. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you this morning.\u201d</p><p>Reynolds rose swiftly to his feet. \u201cMy apologies, Miss Martin. I have some information I feel you must know, and I thought it best to bring it to you directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Rounding the desk, she sat for the first time since breakfast. She shot a quick look at the window, noting the persistence of the early morning drizzle. In her opinion, the gray and overcast sky was ill-fitting for her wedding day, but she thought it matched Jasper\u2019s mood of the evening before. He\u2019d seen her safely back to Lady Collingsworth, admonished her to stay far away from Montague, and departed in a rush. She was anxious to see him again and ascertain how he was feeling on the day of their wedding. \u201cMy curiosity is duly aroused.\u201d</p><p>Her man of affairs remained standing for a few moments longer; his attention caught by the parade of footmen and hired staff flowing past the open doorway. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever seeing such a flurry of activity on the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond and I are to be married late this afternoon,\u201d she explained, somewhat startled to realize she would rather return to the interrupted fitting for her wedding gown than participate in a discussion of business matters.</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Mr. Reynolds lowered himself into his chair. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you happy, Miss Martin. But I\u2019m also exceedingly grateful I called on you this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I appreciate your sentiments.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAs for why I\u2019m here...By some stroke of good fortune, my father\u2019s employer, Lord Needham, recently learned of a business associate who was approached by Lord Montague to join the investment pool you asked me to look into. My father began an investigation into the viability of the speculation at that time, which was a few days ago. Sadly, it would appear it isn\u2019t sound, and we recommend against participation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Eliza couldn\u2019t muster even a modicum of concern for Montague. She was still horrified to realize how consummate his fa\u00e7ade was, how perfectly it shielded him, and how ugly he was behind it.</p><p>\u201cConsidering Lord Montague\u2019s financial state, I wondered why he would risk his few remaining funds on such a risky prospect. Once again, my father was of great assistance. It seems Lord Needham was a player in a card game that also boasted Lord Westfield and Lord Montague as participants. Lord Westfield was the victor, and the winnings included the deed to a property in Essex that has been in the late Lady Montague\u2019s family for generations. Montague is said to have been overwrought at the loss, which was instigated in large part by Westfield. I assume the property has sentimental value. It\u2019s Montague\u2019s last remaining unentailed holding. He sold everything else long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstigated?\u201d She frowned. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague was prepared to withdraw from the game when Westfield put a deed into the pot. He then went to great lengths to goad Montague into doing the same by making thinly veiled references to Montague\u2019s poor financial situation. It escalated to the point where Montague was faced with the choice of folding under the cloud of insolvency or continuing in an effort to maintain the guise of affluence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d she muttered, somewhat disgusted by the carelessness inherent in gambling. She valued her financial security too deeply to leave its fate up to chance. \u201cI still don\u2019t see how Westfield can be held in any way responsible for Montague\u2019s stupidity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe property Westfield wagered is actually deeded to Mr. Bond.\u201d</p><p>Eliza went very still for a moment, then she exhaled in a rush. \u201cWell...that alters the situation a bit, does it not?\u201d</p><p>The Earl of Westfield was an extremely wealthy man who owned both entailed and unentailed properties. If he wished to gamble with such high stakes, he didn\u2019t require Jasper\u2019s means to do it. Jasper, however, held a deep dislike for Montague, and he\u2019d apparently been aware of the earl\u2019s dissolute and immoral private life. He would insist against Westfield risking anything in the process of providing assistance, and so would supply the property to be wagered to mitigate any possibility of loss.</p><p>What had Montague done to garner Jasper\u2019s wrath? And how far was Jasper willing to go to gain whatever recompense he sought?</p><p>Reynolds continued. \u201cWestfield also ensured Montague\u2019s bet by offering unusual terms: if Montague lost, he would have until the end of the Season to buy the marker back. Albeit at considerable expense, far more than the property is worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague thought he had little chance of losing the deed permanently.\u201d Her hand lifted to her knotting stomach. Would Jasper go so far as to marry her to prevent Montague from gaining access to her funds, which the earl could then use to recover his marker?</p><p>\u201cI believe the investment pool Lord Montague is forming is actually a means to gather the funds necessary to regain his mother\u2019s property before time runs out. He can tell the investors later that the speculation was unsuccessful, resulting in a loss, or perhaps he intends to marry or gamble successfully to repay the investors without the pressure of an end-of-Season deadline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is tremendously hazardous to play such games.\u201d In truth, she couldn\u2019t care less whether or not Montague was ostracized. It was the very least he deserved. She spoke only to fill the silence, absentmindedly attempting to hide how unsettled she felt.</p><p>\u201cMontague seems to have little choice.\u201d Reynolds looked grim. \u201cI cannot help wondering how involved Mr. Bond is in this affair. Is he assisting Lord Westfield? Or is Westfield assisting him? And why?\u201d</p><p>She kept her face impassive. \u201cThe Rothschilds would gladly take Montague as a son-in-law, but he resists. If he was of a mind to recover his deed, he could do so through Jane Rothschild\u2019s dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague would never marry Miss Rothschild,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cBoth of her parents are of common stock. Montague has approached only tradesmen to invest in his pool, and he refuses to gamble at tables where commoners are seated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am astonished at how little I knew about someone I saw with fair regularity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the same not true of the man you intend to marry today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She said no more. There was no need to explain her or Jasper\u2019s personal affairs.</p><p>\u201cWith his participation in Westfield\u2019s wager, Bond, too, is playing a hazardous game against a peer of the realm. And his profession...will he continue it? If so, doesn\u2019t that present a separate set of challenges? The danger he faces daily will be brought home to you. Those he angers will seek you out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all, Mr. Reynolds?\u201d she said sharply. She could hardly tolerate hearing him speak so reasonably about a matter she was too emotionally invested in to view impartially. Where was her good sense? Her reason? Her desire for self-preservation?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve angered you. That was not my intent.\u201d His stiff posture deflated. \u201cProviding you information with which to make decisions has been my position for so long, it\u2019s now second nature to me. But I should know better than to step into your personal and private affairs.\u201d</p><p>Eliza immediately regretted her harsh tone. \u201cThis is as uncharted for me as it is for you. I will never hold your concern for me against you. Your loyalty is why I retain you, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to speak no more on the matter. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, rest easy, Mr. Reynolds,\u201d she said softly, because her throat was too tight to allow for greater volume. \u201cI didn\u2019t make my decision regarding Mr. Bond lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Your feelings are engaged. I should be celebrating your good fortune, not questioning it. Lord knows having my wife, Anne, in my life has made my world a richer place.\u201d He managed a smile. \u201cThere is risk in love, but it can be worth taking.\u201d</p><p>Eliza searched her own heart, something she was not accustomed to doing. She\u2019d always questioned what purpose feelings served when the reasonable course of action was best decided with the mind. But it seemed her heart refused to be denied. Even now, it raced with something akin to panic at the thought of losing Jasper. Despite everything she\u2019d learned from her mother, and everything she knew from observation, and everything years of dealing with her own business affairs had taught her, she couldn\u2019t imagine turning away from him now. Despite whatever his goals or motivations might be. Despite the heartache she invited by proceeding with marriage to a man who hid so many things from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2014a reasonable woman who prized her equanimity to the point of excessive caution\u2014was faced with the realization that the only avenue she could bear taking was the most hazardous and unreasonable one.</p><p>She\u2019d given Jasper her trust, and she would not take it back. She couldn\u2019t. She loved him too much.</p><p>\u201cI brought this for you.\u201d</p><p>Jasper turned away from his bed, where several garments were laid out for his selection. He smiled at Lynd, who entered through the sitting room door. His mentor held a folded square of white cloth in his hand. When Jasper accepted it, he saw the letter L embroidered in the corner.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my grandfather\u2019s,\u201d Lynd explained, shoving his hands into the pockets of his overly elaborate coat of fine wool. He rocked back on his heels in an uncustomary nervous gesture. \u201cIt was passed to my father, then to me. I want you to have it on your wedding day.\u201d</p><p>The monogram distorted as Jasper\u2019s eyes stung. Lynd was the closest thing to a father he\u2019d ever had. It meant a great deal to him that Lynd regarded him as a son. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lynd waved the gratitude away with a shaky hand.</p><p>That telltale sign of deep emotion goaded Jasper to step forward and embrace his old friend. There was a moment of crushing, then back slapping.</p><p>\u201cWho would have thought you would marry an heiress?\u201d Lynd said in a gruff voice. \u201cAnd an earl\u2019s niece in the bargain!\u201d</p> <p>Jasper set the kerchief carefully on his bed. \u201cI\u2019m not certain I will believe it until the vows are said and the deed done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chit is fortunate to have you. If she has a brain in her head, she knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the most intelligent person I know. Oddly humorous. Lacking all guile.\u201d Glancing around the room, Jasper remembered Eliza in the space. \u201cAnd passionate in ways one would not expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly would not expect it,\u201d Lynd muttered. To which Jasper laughed.</p><p>Lynd studied him with an odd half-smile. \u201cShe has changed you. I didn\u2019t realize until this moment that this is a love match.\u201d</p><p>Jasper breathed deeply. He hadn\u2019t named his feelings for Eliza. Perhaps he\u2019d been afraid to. He wanted and needed her, and he could have her. He\u2019d been content with that.</p> <p>Turning away, he gestured at an ensemble of light gray breeches, a silver-threaded waistcoat, and a charcoal gray coat. \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d</p><p>Lynd drew abreast of him and set his hands on his hips. \u201cHave you nothing less plain?\u201d</p><p>Remembering Eliza\u2019s commentary on Lynd\u2019s need for a proper tailor, Jasper hid a smile and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. This is for you, you see. I cannot have you better dressed than me at my own wedding, can I?\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, Lynd looked at him. \u201cYou would have me at your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not have the wedding without you. Who will stand beside me, if not for you, my old friend?\u201d</p><p>Lynd\u2019s nose reddened, swiftly followed by his eyes.</p><p>A knock came from the open doorway. Jasper looked over his shoulder. Patrick Crouch stood on the threshold with the top of his head nearly touching the lintel. \u201cThere is a woman \u2019ere to see you. I told \u2019er you weren\u2019t seeing anyone today, but she mentioned Lord Montague and I thought I should tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Jasper moved to the chair by the door where he\u2019d tossed his coat earlier.</p><p>Lynd cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll come down with you.\u201d</p><p>They descended to the ground floor and took up positions in Jasper\u2019s study\u2014Jasper leaned into the front of his desk, while Lynd settled into a wingback with one ankle set atop the opposite knee. In short order, a petite brunette entered the room. She was lovely, with sable-dark hair and cornflower blue eyes. Her back was ramrod straight and her head held high. She declined to pass her fur-lined cape and muff to the butler, and spent a long moment sweeping the room from one end to the other with an examining glance.</p><p>Finally, she returned her attention to Jasper and said, \u201cMr. Bond, I presume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Francesca Maybourne.\u201d She brushed off the immaculate damask of his settee with a gloved hand before perching delicately on the edge. She fluffed her rain-dampened skirts with little regard for Jasper\u2019s rug.</p><p>Lynd rolled his eyes.</p><p>Jasper crossed his arms. \u201cThis is my associate, Mr. Lynd. How can we help you, Mrs. Maybourne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust I have your discretion,\u201d she said in a clipped tone.</p><p>\u201cI would not be successful in my profession if I weren\u2019t discreet.\u201d</p><p>She weighed his assurance for a second, then nodded. \u201cMy sister is in trouble, Mr. Bond. I\u2019m at my wits\u2019 end trying to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you elaborate?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze directly. \u201cEloisa is young and impetuous. She has yet to learn how to deny herself anything. Recently, she began a flirtation with the Earl of Montague. I thought it was ridiculous, but relatively harmless. After all, my sister is a married woman.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cHowever, it has come to my attention that Lord Montague is a scoundrel of the worst sort.\u201d Mrs. Maybourne\u2019s nose wrinkled, which softened her sharpness somewhat. \u201cMy sister came to me this morning in tears. It seems Lord Montague asked her for a token of her affection. I was horrified when she told me this! To give irrefutable evidence of an indiscretion...I cannot imagine what she was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was this trinket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sapphire and diamond necklace, sir. One of great value. And if that were not bad enough, it\u2019s a family heirloom on her husband\u2019s side. There is no doubt he will notice its loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she asked for the necklace back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany times. Prior to today, Lord Montague said he would return it. Then, this morning, he said he intended to sell it. He gave her the name of the jeweler and said she could contact the proprietor any time after three o\u2019clock this afternoon to repurchase it.\u201d Mrs. Maybourne sighed and wrung her hands. \u201cThe necklace is worth a small fortune, sir. There is no way for her to obtain the funds necessary to reclaim it without her husband becoming aware.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s lips pursed. He glanced at Lynd. Montague had devised a way to obtain the funds needed to buy back his marker. Yet by some twist of fate, the knowledge had been brought to Jasper. It seemed he was destined to destroy Montague.</p><p>He looked back at Mrs. Maybourne. \u201cYou want me to retrieve the necklace before he pawns it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he already has.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, causing thick glossy curls to sway around her piquant face and long, slender neck. \u201cI pray that\u2019s not the case. I approached a Runner, but because a peer is involved, he refused the commission. Mr. Bell recommended you, sir. In the interim, he ascertained that the necklace had not yet been brought into the store as of an hour ago. He agreed to watch the premises until you make an appearance. Perhaps you will arrive too late. I won\u2019t hold anyone but my sister responsible for such a lamentable end. But if God is kind, you will precede Montague and find a way to bring this debacle to a successful resolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is no easy task you set,\u201d Jasper warned.</p><p>\u201cMy sister cannot afford to buy the necklace, Mr. Bond. But she and I are capable of affording you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBond.\u201d Lynd uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. \u201cMay I have a word with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is of the essence!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Lynd managed a ghost of a smile. \u201cIt won\u2019t take but a moment.\u201d</p><p>Jasper followed Lynd out to the foyer. \u201cWhat are the odds that this should fall in my lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Bell is a good man. Certainly an excellent source of new business.\u201d Lynd stopped in the center of the circular rug and turned around. \u201cLet me manage this task for you. You cannot take this on today, yet the opportunity isn\u2019t one you can allow to slip through your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Jasper ran a hand through his hair and damned the timing of this unexpected boon. \u201cI cannot send you out to accost a peer. If things go awry, the penalty could be your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what masks are for, my boy.\u201d Lynd grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll put on that suit you have for me, and add a wig. If Montague attempts to identify me later, he\u2019ll describe a very different fellow. With any luck, I will even arrive at the wedding on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontague is my cross to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Lynd shook his head. \u201cYou know how I feel about this vendetta you wage\u2014it cannot help your mother now. That said, you are so close to achieving your final aim, and I would rest easier knowing you\u2019ve put the past behind you. But I\u2019m not certain you can do so until you see this matter of Montague\u2019s property through to the end.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s head fell forward. For all of his life, the one thing he\u2019d needed was justice for his mother. And now, with the end in sight after years of planning, he could no longer deny he wanted Eliza more. He wanted her so badly that when faced with the choice of foiling Montague or getting married, the latter was the event he couldn\u2019t bear to miss. Even while the thought of Montague slipping through his fingers caused his gut to knot and sweat to mist his skin, the response was only a shadow of what he felt when contemplating the loss of Eliza.</p><p>Torn, he spoke gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m certain I will not rest easy until I\u2019ve seen my plan through to the end. Montague\u2019s ruination is all I have lived for, for so long. How can I abandon the cause in the final hour? How could I face my reflection in the mirror every morning, knowing I deserted my life\u2019s goal only days before fruition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy having something else in your life more fulfilling,\u201d Lynd posited. \u201cYou are young yet. There is a world out there to be explored. I know that\u2019s what your mother would have wished for you.\u201d</p><p>A thought that had eluded Jasper previously came to him in that moment. Was it possible that the tutoring she\u2019d secured for him had not been for his father\u2019s benefit at all? Perhaps a secure and brighter future for her son had been the true aim.</p><p>Regardless, it wasn\u2019t his mother\u2019s wishes\u2014whatever they may have been\u2014that decided him. He made his choice based on the instincts that had saved his life so many times before.</p><p>\u201cI cannot lose Eliza,\u201d Jasper said with total, unequivocal conviction. With her, he had no sordid past. There was only the future, one he looked forward to and...needed. \u201cIf you can see to Montague, I\u2019d be eternally grateful. As for myself, I have a wedding to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, then.\u201d Gesturing toward the study, Lynd said, \u201cYou deal with the matter of the retainer and collect the necessary information. I\u2019ll change my garments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jasper clasped him on the shoulder.</p><p>Lynd flushed. \u201cConsider it a wedding gift. Now off with you. There is work to be done and vows to be spoken.\u201d</p><p>Jasper arrived at the Melville house precisely at three o\u2019clock. Eliza delayed the donning of her wedding gown for his arrival and rushed to the lower floor to meet him. She came to a halt partway down the last flight of stairs, arrested by the sight of him. He\u2019d dressed in the same garments he wore on the day they\u2019d met, and the sentimentality of the gesture touched her so deeply her chest ached with it. His dark hair was slightly windblown and his cheekbones burnished by the cold. He was beautiful in every way. Flawless to her eyes.</p><p>Smitten, she sighed. Jasper heard. His gaze lifted to find her, and she watched his expression change, becoming fiercely focused.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>She barely heard her name, but she felt it. She rushed down the remaining steps and stopped a few feet away from him. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, now that I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza gestured toward the parlor, then led the way. As always, she knew he followed even though he moved silently. She sat, and he took a seat beside her on the settee.</p><p>They were to be married in an hour. She felt more joy than apprehension about that.</p><p>\u201cI am so glad you came early.\u201d She fought the urge to reach for his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you since we parted last night.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMontague is very much like his father. The manner in which he spoke was difficult to tolerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to you now because we have something to discuss before the wedding, something you must know before we say our vows to one another. I can only pray you\u2019ll still have me, once the truth is out.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was made wary by his tone and her own lingering anxiety from Reynolds\u2019 visit. \u201cYou can tell me anything. I want to support you, Jasper. You no longer have to carry your burdens alone.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes were contemplative and somber. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to commit myself to you unencumbered. I am working diligently in that regard.\u201d</p><p>She was waiting patiently for him to continue when a violent pounding came to the front door. The sound echoed through the lower floor and brought them both to their feet.</p><p>Somehow, without appearing to run, Robbins reached the entrance before they did. The butler opened the door and revealed one of Jasper\u2019s crew, the handsome young man who\u2019d escorted her to Jasper\u2019s home the night she shared his bed. Aaron yanked off his hat when he saw Eliza. His wild eyes caused her alarm.</p><p>Jasper quickly outdistanced her with his longer stride. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe store. It\u2019s ablaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPennington\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s heart lodged in her throat. \u201cWhat is ablaze? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with her,\u201d Jasper ordered, running down the front steps to where a footman held the reins to Aaron\u2019s mount. Catching the pommel with both hands, he vaulted into the saddle and galloped away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he disappeared from view, Eliza stared out the open doorway, confused and frightened. Aaron stepped into the house, panting. She caught him by a thick biceps before he moved past her. Their gazes met directly. \u201cWhere has he gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your property on Peony Way.\u201d</p><p>One meaningful glance at Robbins was all it took to set things in motion. Within twenty minutes a carriage was hitched and brought around front. During that time, Eliza spoke with Regina and Melville, explaining the delay and assuring them all would be well. She ignored admonishments to await Jasper\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re to be married in half an hour,\u201d she argued. \u201cRegardless of the circumstances or location, I intend to be with him at that time.\u201d</p> <p>Aaron followed her down the front steps to the street. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want you there. For your own safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile he risks his own for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBond is not unprepared for this event. I\u2019m certain the situation will be well in hand before we arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he should have no cause for objection.\u201d She pulled together the sides of her hastily donned pelisse and secured the buttons.</p><p>Eliza was tying the ribbon to her bonnet when a familiar figure rode up to the house and drew to a halt.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I missed the nuptials,\u201d Westfield called out, pushing up the brim of his rakishly angled hat.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond and I will return shortly, my lord.\u201d She accepted the footman\u2019s assistance up the carriage steps. \u201cPlease see yourself inside. Lady Collingsworth will receive you.\u201d</p><p>The earl dismounted and approached, catching either side of her carriage\u2019s doorframe with both hands and leaning in. All levity was gone from his features. \u201cWhat has you so anxious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my properties has caught fire. Mr. Bond has gone on ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Peony Way,\u201d Westfield said.</p><p>Eliza blinked, understanding that everyone had a piece of the puzzle she was missing. \u201cPerhaps you should ride with me.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and climbed in. Aaron joined them, sharing the opposite squab with the earl.</p><p>With a crack of the coachman\u2019s whip, the carriage jolted forward.</p><p>Her foot rapped an impatient staccato against the floorboards. \u201cWhy is the incident at the Peony property of surprise only to me?\u201d</p><p>Westfield explained. \u201cThe tenant you know as Mrs. Vanessa Pennington is, in truth, Miss Vanessa Chilcott. Bond suspected Miss Chilcott of intending to use her business relationship with you to create a financial liability on your part.\u201d</p><p>Eliza felt oddly still inside, her thoughts strangely quiet. She wondered if it was shock she felt or simply resignation. The nature of the Chilcott brood was well-known to her, but she\u2019d thought herself beyond their avarice since her mother\u2019s passing.</p><p>\u201cSuch as a fire on the property,\u201d she said without inflection. \u201cIf I was neglectful as a landlord or deliberately failed to address a safety issue in the building, she might have a claim then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Bond believed you might pay a handsome settlement to keep your gender and evidence of your holdings out of the courts.\u201d</p><p>A cold fury moved through her. \u201cBut such a quiet transaction would no longer be likely to occur once I marry. Hence the need for her to act before the vows are spoken.\u201d</p> <p>As they neared Peony Way, they found the street blocked off by wagons set perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Thick, black smoke mushroomed into the air and burned her airways. Eliza withdrew a kerchief from her reticule and held it against the lower half of her face.</p><p>They alighted from the carriage at the makeshift barrier and traversed the rest of the distance on foot, pushing their way through crowds of onlookers who fought tenaciously to retain their vantages. Westfield led the way while Aaron brought up the rear, both men attempting to cushion her from the crush but being only moderately successful.</p><p>When they neared the charred storefront, they found their way impeded by members of the fire brigade working on behalf of Eliza\u2019s insurance company to minimize the damage. She explained who she was, her eyes on the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. Allowed to pass through, she searched the sea of people clogging the immediate area and spotted Jasper\u2019s tall frame.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d She pointed.</p><p>Westfield caught her elbow and shepherded her closer. When they were only a few feet away, the crowd parted and a cleared path appeared, revealing Jasper standing by Mrs. Penning\u2014Miss Chilcott. The woman\u2019s gown and apron were both singed and covered in ash. Her blond hair was darkened by soot, as was her face, which had a swelling bruise around her left eye. The resemblance to Eliza\u2019s stepfather was so obvious, it would be impossible to miss if one was paying attention, which Eliza hadn\u2019t been when they\u2019d met. A morning spent with Jasper in the close confines of his carriage, followed by his entrance into the Pennington shop so swiftly on the heels of her own had kept her too preoccupied to pay any mind to the other woman.</p><p>It was a testament to Vanessa Chilcott\u2019s beauty that she was still riveting in her disheveled condition. Westfield faltered slightly when she turned toward them, his breath leaving his lungs in an audible rush.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d Jasper did not appear to be overly surprised to see her. \u201cWhy did I know you wouldn\u2019t heed caution and stay home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go where you go.\u201d She examined him for signs of injury. He was dirty with ash and soot, as if he\u2019d been in the building as well, but he didn\u2019t appear to be hurt.</p><p>She turned her attention to the woman standing beside him. \u201cMiss Chilcott.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa Chilcott\u2019s blue eyes were red-rimmed and somewhat vacant. She replied in a painfully hoarse voice. \u201cMiss Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>Jasper had begun to reply when a fireman approached.</p><p>\u201cThe fire is contained,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe found the body and a can of paraffin oil, just as Mrs. Pennington described.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBody?\u201d Eliza felt ill. \u201cDear God...Someone was caught in the fire?\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. \u201cMiss Chilcott went up to her flat to retrieve a special order and caught Terrance Reynolds in the act of setting the place ablaze. They fought, and she brained him with a poker. She barely made it out before the fire engulfed the space. I attempted to retrieve him...but it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds?\u201d Eliza repeated.</p><p>Her man of affairs had been excruciatingly thorough in his vetting of prospective tenants. By God, he\u2019d discovered Jasper\u2019s ownership of the property Westfield wagered against Montague, despite the intricate nature of the inquiry and formidable time constraints. He would not have missed discovering that Mrs. Pennington was actually Vanessa Chilcott. Why had he withheld the information? What reason would he have to allow a Chilcott to rent space from her?</p><p>She looked at Vanessa. \u201cYou were his insurance. He hid your identity from me to use at his convenience. What role do you play in this subterfuge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Vanessa\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cI am more ignorant of this matter than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat relation are you to my stepfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your stepsister.\u201d</p><p>Staggered by the day\u2019s revelations and the understanding that the employee she\u2019d trusted so keenly had betrayed her, Eliza swayed on her feet. Jasper caught her close.</p><p>She clung to him. \u201cI saw him only hours ago. He came with information about you. Information intended to make me doubt the wisdom of marrying you.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWhat information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour participation in the wager between Westfield and Montague over land in Essex. He suggested you offered for me as a way to prevent Montague from laying claim to my money, which would afford him the opportunity to reclaim his marker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were not swayed by this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Which left him no option, I suppose, aside from this last-minute attempt to delay the ceremony.\u201d She looked up, finding Jasper watching her with a dark, fierce gaze. \u201cBut it would only delay the inevitable. Surely, he knew that. What was his aim? I had no intention of releasing him from his position. His circumstances would not have altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll uncover his secrets, love.\u201d He sheltered her in his embrace, anchoring her as no one else in her life ever had. \u201cI promise you that. Every last one of them.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>With Westfield at his side, Jasper escorted Eliza and Vanessa Chilcott into the Melville residence. Disheveled and reeking of smoke, the four of them were incongruous in a household prepared for the celebration of a wedding. They stood shoulder to shoulder in the foyer, hard-faced and bemused.</p><p>Lady Collingsworth hurried from the ballroom where the ceremony was to take place and came to an abrupt halt a few feet away. \u201cDear God,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThe parson awaits you, but it\u2019s clear I should reschedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eliza said, astonishing Jasper. \u201cIf he can wait an hour, I can be ready.\u201d</p><p>Recovering, Jasper said, \u201cI can be repaired within an hour as well.\u201d</p><p>Blinking rapidly, Lady Collingsworth took in Miss Chilcott\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cRegina,\u201d Eliza said briskly, \u201cthis is Miss Vanessa Chilcott, my stepsister. Vanessa, this is the dowager Countess of Collingsworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Vanessa whispered, curtseying.</p><p>Admiration and pride filled Jasper. He could think of no other woman who would wade through the morass of the day\u2019s events with such aplomb. Eliza could have left Miss Chilcott to her own devices after learning the truth of her identity. Instead, she had asked one question of the woman\u2014 \u201cWhy?\u201d\u2014to which Miss Chilcott replied, \u201cI want to be self-sufficient and independent. Who better to learn from than you? And how else to manage it, but to shed the Chilcott name that has defined my life thus far?\u201d</p><p>Eliza had offered to take the woman in for now, since Miss Chilcott\u2019s residence and all her possessions had been lost in the fire. At the very least, it kept the woman close while they delved into her circumstances. They would address other considerations tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cMiss Chilcott will need a bath and a room,\u201d Eliza said. \u201cIf you could see to that, Regina, I would be deeply grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Lady Collingsworth looked at Jasper. \u201cYou have visitors, Mr. Bond. In the parlor.\u201d</p><p>Jasper met Eliza\u2019s querying gaze by extending his arm. I go where you go, she\u2019d said, and despite everything, she wished to be married to him with as much haste as he felt. He treasured her for that and countless other things.</p><p>Westfield set off to join the handful of other guests in the ballroom. Jasper and Eliza moved into the formal parlor. There were five people in the room. The Crouch twins, Lynd, Anthony Bell, and Mrs. Francesca Maybourne.</p><p>Surveying the group with raised brows, Jasper wondered why the lot of them was in attendance. He was about to ask that very question, when Eliza spoke.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAfter today\u2019s events, I was not expecting to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the jeweler,\u201d Lynd explained, \u201cbut Bell was nowhere to be found, which raised my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>Eliza continued listening to the recounting of the second half of the Reynolds\u2019s plot with a heavy heart. While she was deeply grateful for the plan\u2019s failure, she was painfully conscious that the hazard would not have existed if Jasper wasn\u2019t determined to destroy Montague. How much of his energy was focused on that endeavor? Would she ever have all of him? Or was the largest piece of his heart given to the woman from his past whom Montague had destroyed?</p><p>And yet she had to take heart. He\u2019d come to marry her and sent Lynd after Montague in his stead.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Jasper said quietly, \u201cwhat looks too good to be true is precisely that.\u201d</p><p>Lynd nodded. \u201cIt was wise of you to send the Crouches with me. Together we watched the street for close to an hour and we noted one hackney that was a fixture the entire time. Patrick walked by it and\u2014aided by his tremendous height\u2014 was able to see Mrs. Reynolds waiting inside with a pistol in her lap. I sent Peter to fetch Bell so he could confirm the story she gave us. Bell didn\u2019t know her, but apparently she knew enough about him, you, and Montague to create the perfect lure to draw you out. We brought her here to see what you thought of it all, having no notion her identity was false or that Miss Martin would know who she truly was.\u201d</p><p>Eliza eyed Anne Reynolds with something akin to hatred, an emotion she\u2019d never truly felt before. \u201cWere you going to shoot Mr. Bond? Was it your intention to kill him?\u201d</p><p>The brunette lowered the sodden kerchief she\u2019d been sobbing into since learning of her husband\u2019s demise and glared daggers at Jasper. \u201cThat isn\u2019t his name. I have no notion what his given name truly is, but I can tell you his surname is Gresham. He is the son of Diana Gresham, who was a whore for Lord Montague until her death from a wasting disease.\u201d</p><p>Jasper became so still it frightened Eliza. \u201cModeration would be wise,\u201d he warned with dangerous softness.</p><p>\u201cI know everything about you, Mr. Gresham,\u201d Anne spat. \u201cI told Mr. Reynolds to share what he knew with Miss Martin. After all, she\u2019s the one who hired my brother-in-law to investigate your connection to Lord Gresham in County Wexford. \u2018Tell her he isn\u2019t what he says he is,\u2019 I told him, but he insisted Miss Martin had only to believe you wanted her money to set you aside. He also feared rousing her concern if she was to learn he never recalled Tobias from Ireland. \u2019She might wonder what other orders I\u2019ve disobeyed,\u2019 he said. He should have listened to me.\u201d</p><p>The explosive tension in the room was palpable. Eliza rushed to fill the void before Anne could ignite the situation further. \u201cYou wrote the threatening letters Lord Melville received.\u201d It was not a question. \u201cWhy? What purpose did this all serve?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne\u2019s chin lifted and she looked away. \u201cAs if I would say anything further. I have done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the incident at the Royal Academy?\u201d Jasper asked with ice in his tone.</p><p>\u201cDear God. You cannot think we had anything to do with that! We are not murderers. I\u2019ve had enough of this.\u201d She stood. \u201cYou have no right to detain me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking you in to Bow Street,\u201d Bell said, rocking back on his heels. He was a short and slender man, almost delicate looking. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the magistrate agrees with you. \u2019Til then, sit down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an expensive cape you wear,\u201d Jasper noted. \u201cAnd sizable emeralds at your ears and throat. Either you came into your marriage with money, or Miss Martin paid your husband exceedingly well.\u201d</p><p>Unaccustomed to noting such things, Eliza reevaluated the woman\u2019s attire. Anne Reynolds\u2019s ensemble did indeed seem far finer than Eliza\u2019s own accoutrements. She looked at Jasper. \u201cHow? I manage my own funds...keep my own ledgers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not deal directly with your tenants. Who collects the rents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Lynd said. \u201cIs it possible what you believe you are charging and collecting isn\u2019t what the tenants are actually paying to Reynolds?\u201d</p> <p>Eliza paled. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible, if he was clever enough about it.\u201d Which she knew he could have been. She looked at Anne, who was also wan, if defiant. \u201cIf he raised the rents over time without my knowledge, or charged for miscellaneous items of which I wasn\u2019t aware. We should ask Miss Chilcott and my other tenants. Dear God...they are all as much victims as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s likely why Reynolds wanted Bond dead,\u201d Bell said. \u201cOnce you had a husband to assist you, the embezzlement might\u2019ve been discovered or Reynolds\u2019 duties reduced. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t believe you when you hired me, Miss Martin. Let that be a lesson to me in the future.\u201d</p><p>Jasper remained deadly quiet and expressionless.</p><p>\u201cThis was to be my last Season,\u201d Eliza said softly. \u201cI intended to retire to the country with Melville, at which point a greater portion of my affairs would have been left in Mr. Reynolds\u2019s hands. He and his wife were so close to achieving their aims that my sudden decision to marry Mr. Bond must have made them desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you marry him,\u201d Anne said coldly, \u201cyou deserve what comes to you. At least Mr. Reynolds was concerned about building your wealth. Gresham, I am certain, intends to squander it.\u201d</p><p>Eliza pushed to her feet, unable to bear any more. \u201cI shall leave this matter to you, Mr. Bell. I\u2019m confident you will apprise me of the necessary information.\u201d</p> <p>The Runner gave a curt nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bond,\u201d Eliza murmured, which caused Anne to laugh. \u201cWould you accompany me, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment,\u201d he said without inflection. \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza made her egress on wooden legs, wondering if she would, indeed, be found, or if Jasper would now be lost to her. Perhaps he\u2019d never truly been hers to begin with. For all their promises to be truthful to one another, it seemed they\u2019d kept more secrets than they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Jasper reached the top of the staircase and turned to the right, following the directions to Eliza\u2019s room that Lady Collingsworth had given him. If the dowager countess thought it was inappropriate for him to ask for them, she gave no outward indication. Instead, she told him the parson was having a fine time with both the champagne and Lord Westfield\u2019s witty discourse, and he\u2019d agreed to stay as long as they wanted him to.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, Jasper lifted his hand to knock on Eliza\u2019s boudoir door. As he waited for her to answer, he struggled against the feeling of being made of glass; he felt as if he might break at any moment. Perhaps it was the endless string of unexpected revelations that had him so unsettled. Or perhaps he was simply experiencing a bridegroom\u2019s expected nervousness. He thought it might be terror over the prospect of losing something irreplaceable, but he didn\u2019t have any frame of reference to be certain.</p><p>The door opened, and Eliza stood there. She was in a dressing gown, and her eyes and nose were red. He remembered when they\u2019d first met, he\u2019d thought her pretty enough but no raving beauty. He couldn\u2019t comprehend that determination now. He was certain she was the loveliest woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Stepping back, she made room for him to enter, then she shut the door quietly behind him.</p> <p>Her rooms were decorated in the same hues of cream and burgundy as his own. He noticed that immediately, and took an odd sort of comfort in the similarity. He shouldn\u2019t forget how alike they were in the most fundamental of ways. If only they could strip away their exteriors and bare that affinity...</p><p>\u201cI should have told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>They spoke and ended in unison. Startled to have said the same thing at once, they stared at one another. He waited for her to speak first. After the day\u2019s revelations, she deserved the opportunity to give him a tongue-lashing.</p><p>Her hands tightened the belt at her waist. \u201cI hired Tobias Reynolds in the beginning, when I knew nothing about you. You said the connection between you and Lord Gresham would withstand greater scrutiny, and I told myself I was only confirming the claim before someone else had a mind to. But I recalled Mr. Reynolds from the task before he reported anything. I wanted you to be the one to tell me whatever you felt I should know, in your own good time.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded and linked his fingers behind his back. \u201cI should have told you about my mother. I knew I would have to, but I thought we had time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cAll the time you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time is now, Eliza. You should know me before you wed me. I couldn\u2019t bear for you to turn away from me after you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot turn away. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed on a shuddering breath. \u201cEliza\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to say anything,\u201d she interrupted quickly, \u201cuntil after we are man and wife. I need to marry you with my heart, not my mind. I need to trust in my own instincts, over my reason, so I can make the changes necessary to be what you require, to be whole. I need you to know I accept you just the way you are, without reservation or doubt, so you can\u2014God willing\u2014someday grow to love me, too.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was defying all of her routines, setting aside habits of a lifetime, deliberately making one concession after another ...for him. She was determined to leave herself open to trusting him, even when everything suggested she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He looked at her. She\u2019d taken a seat upon one of the settees with her hands clasped demurely in her lap. Insanely, that aroused him\u2014the vision of her so controlled, when he knew how wild she could be in his arms. It was the way she revealed her deeper self when they were intimate, even more than the physical pleasure, that drove his sexual craving for her.</p><p>\u201cI am undone,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYou rule me completely. I would do anything to possess you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s hand lifted to her throat, her fingers wrapping around the graceful column. He crossed the room to her and caught that alabaster hand. Jasper pressed a kiss to the back of it, then moved to the tips of her fingers. He licked the end of the one that would bear his ring by the close of the day, and she shivered. Her lashes lowered and her lips parted on soft panting breaths.</p><p>Opening his mouth, he sucked the slender digit inside, swirling his tongue around it until a whimper escaped her.</p><p>The sound of surrender freed him from any restraint.</p><p>He reached down and opened the placket of his breeches with his free hand. His cock fell heavily into his palm, so thick and hard he fisted himself to stave off his hunger.</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>His mouth slid free of her trembling fingers. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Eliza fumbled with the belt at her waist. Jasper sank to the floor on his knees and pushed up her chemise, his hands rough with impatience. He caught her hips and tugged her down to his lap, her legs straddling his. The cleft of her sex pressed against the silky length of him.</p><p>He caught her nape in his hand, forcing her to look straight into his eyes. \u201cI need to be in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grew slick with welcome due to the heat of his rut. She loved him like this, uncontrolled and lustful.</p><p>He shifted her, urging her up and then over him, the thick crest of his penis gliding along her slit and nudging her clitoris. She moaned and caught his shoulders, tense with impatience and greedy for pleasure.</p><p>When he notched himself at her clenching opening, she trembled. With a groan, he thrust, pushing his thickly veined cock deep into her.</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d His arms tightened around her, crushing the air from her lungs and immobilizing her against him.</p><p>She clawed at his back, writhing. The heat of his skin burned through the linen and velvet of his garments.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged, quivering around him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jasper gripped her hips, lifting and dropping her. Working her onto his rigid length. Pumping her up and down. Grinding and screwing deep.</p><p>Eliza sobbed with the pleasure. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will addict you to this,\u201d he promised in a dark, dangerously rough voice. \u201cAddict you to me. Soon, you\u2019ll seek me out in public, unable to wait another moment. You will lift your skirts and beg for my mouth on you, my tongue in you. In the extremity of your lust, you won\u2019t care where we are. You will crave the taste of me. You will sink to your knees and service me with your mouth, sucking my cock until I spill into you, thick and hot and mad with hunger.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, eyes closing as he surged repeatedly inside her. The feeling was incredible. She would never have enough of it. The stroking of the furled underside of his crown rubbed deliciously, finding her most sensitive nerve endings and setting them afire.</p><p>He slid inside her, deeply, filling her with the heat and hardness of him. Filling her with pleasure that made her arch wildly. His possession was indescribably erotic. As addicting as he threatened.</p><p>He withdrew, and she felt empty. He returned, and she bit her lip to hold back cries that would betray their actions to a multitude of guests.</p><p>But Jasper would abide no restraint. \u201cLet me hear you,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cLet me hear how much you want this.\u201d</p><p>His free hand cupped her thigh, opening her wider so that he could thrust deeper. Swiveling his hips, he worked her into a frenzy with ruthless skill, making her insensate with lust and hungry for more. Always more. As much as he gave her, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Eliza gasped and dug her nails into the flexing muscles of his back. The horrors of the day created a sharp urgency. \u201cFinish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo soon,\u201d he ground out, sweat dripping down his temple.</p><p>\u201cWe have forever to go slower. Don\u2019t make me wait now.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him. \u201cI love you. Eliza...love you.\u201d</p><p>She climaxed with a force that left her shaking. Jasper followed swiftly, his hips ramming upward with ferocious speed. She felt his climax building, felt the tensing of his muscles and the frantic heaving of his powerful chest. When he came, it was violent, his thick penis jerking inside her with every molten spurt of his seed. Her name fell brokenly from his lips until she kissed him, swallowing the sounds of his pleasure with unconditional love in her heart.</p><p>They were married an hour later. Aside from the parson, who was flushed and happy with drink, it was a somber wedding. If the stamp of Jasper\u2019s passion was evident in Eliza\u2019s appearance, no one said anything to her, and she was certain Regina would have.</p><p>Jasper\u2019s hair was still damp when he said his vows. He\u2019d sent the Crouches back to his home to retrieve fresh clothes, then bathed in a guest bedroom to save time.</p><p>Fewer than a dozen people witnessed the short ceremony. The celebration afterward was equally abridged, since everyone had been present for hours by the time the vows were said.</p><p>Eliza wore a new cream-hued satin gown with fine lace sleeves and bodice. It was cut and fashioned in the latest style, the first of many that would assist her transformation. She intended to enhance what beauty God had given her, using every weapon in her feminine arsenal to please her husband and deepen his love for her.</p><p>When the time came to retire, Jasper was relieved. Eliza led him to her suite of rooms with his hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said, when they were alone.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cI did not think of a wedding gift for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all the gift I need.\u201d He reached into the inner pocket of his coat and withdrew a lady\u2019s signet ring.</p><p>He held his hand out for hers, slipping the golden circlet onto the ring finger of her right hand. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Eliza looked up at him with luminous eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and shrugged out of his coat. \u201cWould you care for a drink?\u201d he asked solicitously. Having taken her body so peremptorily earlier, he intended to savor her now.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction surged through him. His chest expanded on a deep inhale. His blood thickened and flowed hotly. \u201cHave you no reservations? No questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still talking?\u201d She presented her back to him.</p><p>\u201cWill you always surprise me?\u201d He approached her and reached for the first button of her gown.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we had enough unpleasantness for one day? Tomorrow is soon enough to address the rest.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to her shoulder, grateful for her.</p><p>Her head turned, and her gaze met his. \u201cIf you\u2019d gone to the jeweler\u2019s today instead of Lynd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza...\u201d</p><p>She pivoted into his arms, catching his mouth with her own in a fervent, awkward kiss. He caught her close, lifting her feet from the floor. Her slender arms wrapped around his neck, her fingers pushed into his hair in the way that never failed to inflame him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you naked,\u201d she breathed, making his cock hard. \u201cI want to touch you everywhere, and your clothing makes that impractical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot have impracticality in our bedroom,\u201d he said, biting back a smile. Setting her down on the edge of the mattress, Jasper stepped back. He attacked the buttons of his waistcoat.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s tongue traced the curve of her bottom lip. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like to watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like to watch you,\u201d she amended. \u201cYou are everything I find beautiful, and sexual, and desirable.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea what to say to that, how to tell her what her candor meant to him. He could only slow the process of undressing, maintaining eye contact with her, allowing her to see how much he loved her. When the last stitch was shed, he straightened and waited for her to tell him what to do next. He\u2019d taken what he needed earlier, and she\u2019d given it to him without hesitation. Only the second time in her life that she\u2019d had a man inside her and he\u2019d been too overwrought to show her the gentleness she deserved. Now, it was his turn to give her what she needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overdressed,\u201d she said, toeing off her slippers. Her slim legs dangled off the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndress me. But much more quickly than you bared yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper set his hands at her waist and helped her off the mattress. He resumed his task of unfastening her buttons, working quickly. The wedding gown was set aside with reverence, but the sheer chemise and pantalettes were left to puddle on the floor. Enamored with her softly freckled skin, he wrapped himself around her, his arms tucked under hers and his knees bent to accommodate her shorter stature. With one hand cupping a breast and the other tangling with the dark red curls between her legs, he owned her passion completely.</p><p>She purred with pleasure, her head falling back against his shoulder. \u201cI love your hands on me. They are so big and strong, callused and warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tradesman\u2019s hands.\u201d He traced the delicately pink shell of her ear with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cThe only hands that will ever touch me this way.\u201d</p><p>Scissoring his fingers, he parted the lips of her sex, exposing the hood shielding her clitoris. \u201cWill I find you wet?\u201d</p><p>She began to pant as he rolled her nipple between his fingers. Her stance widened in invitation for a deeper caress. \u201cYes...You linger in me from earlier.\u201d</p> <p>The thought of her drenched in his semen swelled his already heavy erection. He pushed his cock between her thighs, growling at the slickness that coated him.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he coaxed, urging her to fold forward over the edge of the bed.</p><p>There was a slight tension in her lithe frame. Then she relaxed and lay facedown, presenting the lush curve of her beautiful buttocks. He cupped them, squeezing their fullness.</p><p>Reaching between her legs, he urged her to pull one leg up and onto the mattress, her thigh perpendicular to her body, opening her completely. He cupped her there, too, possessively. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She rested her cheek on the counterpane and closed her eyes. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>He took himself in hand, notching his cockhead into the tiny entrance to her silken cunt. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>With a slow roll of his hips, he pushed the fat crown into the fist-tight glove of her. Her fingers dug into the velvet and her low moan stirred his blood.</p><p>\u201cMy wife,\u201d he breathed, pushing inexorably deeper.</p> <p>Eliza arched her back like a cat, which caused the tiny little muscles inside her to squeeze him. The pleasure of those rippling embraces, the sensation of being lured deeper into her...A deep groan escaped him. Hunching over her, Jasper worked his cock into her with quick shallow judders, sliding through quivering tissues until he hit the end of her, refusing to risk either of them climaxing until they were completely connected.</p><p>Her breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cSo deep...\u201d she slurred.</p><p>He withdrew a few inches, then thrust, going even deeper. She hugged him at the root, clasping his throbbing cock in liquid heat. Catching her by the shoulder, he held her in place and rode her with long, leisurely thrusts. His bollocks smacked against her damp cleft in a steady, erotic rhythm. Eliza whimpered with every weighty tap against her clitoris, her nails leaving visible trails in the counterpane, the curls around her face growing damp with perspiration.</p><p>When the pressure to blow grew dangerously high, Jasper would pause at the deepest point of her and grind, whispering soothing words as she climaxed around him. Sweat soaked his hair and matted his chest, a visible sign of the restraint required to remain rock hard and full to bursting to please her.</p><p>Time passed, and Jasper lost track of it, as he always did when he was with Eliza. He knew only that she came so many times her fingers no longer had the strength to clutch the counterpane, and the cries she made as the pleasure hit were weak-as-a-kitten mewls.</p><p>It was her hoarse-voiced \u201cI love you\u201d that finished him.</p><p>With his cheek pressed against her glorious hair and his arms wrapped beneath her, he filled her with hot, wrenching pulses of the lust that sprang from a deeper source. From a well of hope and love inside him he hadn\u2019t known was there until she made him whole.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Eliza was perusing the morning\u2019s papers at the breakfast table when Vanessa Chilcott appeared. Her stepsister was dressed in the housekeeper\u2019s clothes\u2014a high-neck shirt that was slightly too snug around the breasts and a skirt that was a tad too long\u2014but she carried herself with unassailable dignity.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Eliza greeted her, before returning to reading the reports of the fire the day prior.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Martin.\u201d</p><p>It took a few moments for Eliza to realize the other woman was rooted to one spot. Frowning, she peeked over the top of the page. She gestured toward the console against the wall where plates and covered platters waited. \u201cThe food is there. Please help yourself to whatever you like.\u201d</p><p>As if all she\u2019d needed was permission, Vanessa nodded and moved to serve herself. When she was finished and settled at the table, she said, \u201cCongratulations on your wedding yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Eliza bit her lower lip and set the paper down. \u201cShould I have asked you to attend? I was unsure after the events at the store and the discovery of our...relation to one another, whether I should or not.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa blinked. She stared at Eliza in the manner most people did when they comprehended how little she knew about etiquette.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, ladies,\u201d Jasper said as he entered the room. His stride was easy and inherently sensual, with a touch of leisure as if time was no concern. \u201cMy wife is blessed with an extraordinarily pragmatic nature, Miss Chilcott. She rarely means offense when she observes\u2014or does not observe, as the case may be\u2014certain social mores.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Vanessa watched as Jasper walked the length of the room to where Eliza sat at the far end. There was blatant appreciation in the blonde\u2019s eyes, a knowing understanding of what type of man he was\u2014ruthlessly deliberate and dangerously sexual. Eliza imagined it would be impossible for any red-blooded woman to be immune to him. After all, as oblivious as she\u2019d personally been toward men, she hadn\u2019t failed to want him either.</p><p>\u201cI took no offense,\u201d Vanessa assured. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have had a roof over my head last night.\u201d</p><p>Eliza shrugged. \u201cIt was the most reasonable course of action to have you stay here. You lost more than I did in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Jasper set one hand on the table and the other on the back of Eliza\u2019s chair. Bending, he kissed her temple and whispered, \u201cI had need of you this morning, madam. In the future, you should order a tray brought to our rooms.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Jasper had displayed a marked insatiability throughout the night, waking her repeatedly to take her again and again. On her back. Sprawled on her stomach. Arranged on her side. With her heels in the air or her thighs between his. Deep and shallow, hard and soft, pounding possessions and slow, endless glides...His repertoire of sensual delights was vast, and she suspected he\u2019d shown her only a smidgeon of what he was capable of.</p><p>As he straightened, she turned her head, impulsively pressing her lips to his. He stiffened in surprise, then gave an encouraging hum, remaining still as she kissed him sweetly. When she withdrew, Jasper\u2019s smile curled her toes. He traced the bridge of her nose with his fingertip, then he stepped away to fetch his own plate.</p><p>Bolstered by his presence and verbal support, Eliza took a deep breath and turned her focus to her stepsister. Vanessa\u2019s attention was firmly on her food, her eyes downcast as if to say she couldn\u2019t possibly be aware of the scandalous behavior taking place at the other end of the long room.</p><p>Vanessa cleared her throat. \u201cWhether or not it was reasonable to provide lodging to a tenant who lied on her application is debatable, I think. I doubt many would have done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not simply a tenant,\u201d Eliza pointed out. \u201cYou are my stepsister.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile twisted Vanessa\u2019s lips. \u201cWhich is more of a detriment than an endorsement, is it not?\u201d</p><p>Jasper pulled out the chair at the foot of the table, which was directly to Eliza\u2019s right, and sat.</p><p>Eliza nodded, seeing no point in being untruthful.</p><p>\u201cUnfalteringly candid,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cMy father quite enjoyed that about you, Miss Martin. He said it was freeing. It inspired him to be a better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but he never mentioned you.\u201d</p><p>One blond brow rose. \u201cWhen did you give him the opportunity?\u201d</p><p>Eliza opened her mouth, then shut it again.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Vanessa carefully sliced into her black pudding with her knife. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. You are astute, and you knew straightaway that he pursued your mother for the fortune left by your father. It\u2019s all true what they say about us Chilcotts.\u201d</p><p>Nonplussed, Eliza glanced at Jasper, whose face was austere and gave away none of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSee this?\u201d Vanessa set down her utensils and held out her hand. She pointed to a reddish birthmark that rested over the back of her wrist. \u201cMy grandmother once told me you could spot the rotten fruit in our family tree because we all bear this \u2018bruise.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Eliza said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do not see, however, is that even bruised fruit sometimes has salvageable parts. In my father\u2019s case, it was his heart. He courted your mother for her money; he married her because he loved her.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s hands linked together on the table. \u201cIf he\u2019d truly cared for her, he would have been a positive influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds reasonable,\u201d Vanessa agreed. \u201cBut love is not reasonable. Love is wanting to see the other person as happy as possible as often as possible. Leastwise that\u2019s how my father viewed love. As you know, it wasn\u2019t an easy task keeping Lady Georgina happy. If he cared for her not at all, he could have had her committed. Or he could have taken her to the country and left her there. Or the Continent. Perhaps she might have taken a liking to America\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>Jasper reached over and set one hand atop both of Eliza\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI think you should know,\u201d Vanessa continued, \u201cyou were a positive influence on my father, who in turn extolled the virtues of respectable living to me. He\u2019s the one who convinced me I could make an honest living.\u201d</p><p>Eliza was at a loss as to how to handle the conversation. What could she say that wasn\u2019t already known to Vanessa? \u201cI\u2019m sorry my difficulties with Mr. Reynolds spilled over into your life.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shrugged. \u201cI blame my surname for Mr. Reynolds\u2019s actions against my shop, not you. I believe he rented the space to me with the intention of extorting from me whatever money he thought I intended to extort from you. When I caught him igniting the paraffin, he said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I can still ensure you see a profit from your plans.\u2019 That was when I hit him with the poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have seemed like the kindest of fates to him, falling so neatly into his lap through no effort on his part. A Chilcott to use as another means to garner more of your money.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at Eliza. \u201cBy distracting you with the fire and removing me with a bullet, Reynolds likely hoped his services would seem even more valuable. In the process, he would have discredited Mr. Bell and cast suspicion on Montague, ensuring those avenues no longer seemed viable to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no way of knowing,\u201d she murmured, loving him all the more, \u201cthat you would forsake a chance to thwart Montague in favor of me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand.</p><p>Eliza glanced at Vanessa. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent much of my life making decisions based upon my surname. Even when taking a new direction, I did so by comparing it to the known alternative, which is still allowing the name to define me. No more. The store was a lovely dream, but I\u2019m not certain it was my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like for you to stay here in the interim,\u201d Eliza said, startling herself.</p><p>\u201cAnother Martin inviting another Chilcott to live under her roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parallel did not even occur to me.\u201d She\u2019d made the decision impulsively and from the heart.</p><p>Jasper offered an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re finished,\u201d she said to him, \u201cI would like to speak to you privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Robbins appeared in the open dining room doorway, bearing a calling card. He crossed the length of the room and set the silver salver in the space between Eliza and Jasper. \u201cThe Earl of Westfield has come to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>A moment later, Westfield entered the room, looking windblown and dashing for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he called out to the room at large, but his eyes were on Vanessa. \u201cHow fortunate. I haven\u2019t yet eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, my lord,\u201d Jasper drawled.</p><p>\u201cI cannot remember the last time I was out of bed at this hour. Only for you would I be conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should consider retiring to bed earlier, my lord,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat fun is there in that, Miss Chilcott?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa kept her gaze on her plate. \u201cThat would be dependent upon who else is in the bed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at Eliza. His dark eyes were laughing. \u201cMy wife and I must adjourn, but please, enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Westfield smiled. \u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I should warn Miss Chilcott about Westfield,\u201d Jasper said, as he and Eliza ascended the steps to her rooms.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here I was wondering if Westfield needed a similar warning.\u201d She smiled and there was an openness to the gesture that nearly caused Jasper to miss a step. \u201cHowever, I think they are well-matched. Neither will gain much advantage with the other, I suspect. Although it\u2019s clear Westfield is hoping otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has an eye for beautiful women.\u201d</p><p>She looked aside at him. \u201cJust so long as you do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot agree to that, I\u2019m afraid. You see, there is a beautiful woman who shares my life, and I could never agree not to have an eye for her.\u201d</p><p>They entered her boudoir, and Jasper expected they would retire to the bedroom. They were newly wedded, after all. But Eliza sat on one of the sitting-room settees and arranged her striped skirts as if settling in for a not inconsiderable length of time. Her assertive nose was lifted high and her jaw was set.</p><p>Recognizing the signs of determination, Jasper shrugged out of his coat. \u201cI\u2019m impressed with how the conversation between you and Miss Chilcott progressed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand what she means in regards to allowing exterior forces to define us. For so long, I allowed my frustration with my mother to define me and my choices.\u201d She took a deep breath and said, \u201cEven when it came to marrying you.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat beside her. \u201cWhatever concerns you had about repeating your mother\u2019s mistakes were bravely managed. You would not be wearing my ring otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Eliza watched him lift her hand to his lips and press a kiss to her ruby and diamond wedding ring. \u201cBut you see, as determined as I was not to marry because of my mother, when I reversed my position it was also because of her. I became so determined that she wouldn\u2019t be the reason I refused you, that she became the reason I accepted you.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of where the conversation was going and certain he didn\u2019t like hearing she\u2019d wed him for any other reason than loving him, Jasper retained his light hold on her hand. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds attempted to sway me against you, and even when he relayed information meant to incite doubt and concern, I dismissed my own disquiet because not marrying you had taken on the meaning of giving my mother a victory.\u201d Her fingers tightened on his. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do. Do you still have those concerns and doubts?\u201d He rubbed his chest with his free hand, fighting the restriction he\u2019d begun to feel.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jasper had to focus on relaxing his jaw. \u201cDid you ever believe, for even a moment, that I wanted to marry you solely to prevent Montague from attaining your fortune? Did you believe I might utilize your fortune to ensure he could not climb out of the hole he dug for himself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to take whatever amount is required to achieve your aims,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cUse whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhat nearly happened yesterday,\u201d she went on, \u201cwith Anne Reynolds and the failed ambush...It was your past defining you. I couldn\u2019t give myself fully to our marriage until I released myself from my mother\u2019s influence. The same applies to you.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stood in a rush. \u201cMy mother came to London for the Season. She was a diamond of the first water. She had her pick of husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she fell prey to the late Earl of Montague?\u201d</p><p>Her gentle tone nearly undid him. He\u2019d never shared his mother\u2019s tale with anyone. Lynd knew it only because he\u2019d borne witness to it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jasper shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cUnlike the young lady we heard in the Cranmores\u2019 garden the other night, my mother went willingly to Montague\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane Rothschild,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cBut like Jane Rothschild, my mother became pregnant.\u201d He began to pace. \u201cWhen Montague refused to offer for her, she had to tell her brother. Lord Gresham\u2019s response was to disown her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer own sibling...Is that why you don\u2019t bear his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed it legally. He left her in the city when he retired to Ireland, Eliza. She had nowhere to turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper. \u201cBeing so helpless.\u201d</p><p>He spoke more harshly than he intended. \u201cAnd yet you freely offer me the means by which you are independent?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze unflinchingly. \u201cYou\u2019re angry with me for offering my support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Damnation. I\u2019m angry at Montague for placing money between us!\u201d He reached the wall and pivoted. \u201cMy mother turned to him. Begged him. He made her his mistress, then boasted to one and all that he\u2019d reduced the Season\u2019s brightest star to being his whore. When his luck in the gambling hells ran out and his debts mounted, someone offered to take a night with my mother as payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jasper,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWhere were you in all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the schoolroom during the day, and locked in my bedchamber at night. Some of the men Montague sent to her brought gifts and tokens of esteem. They remembered how promising her future had been and took pity on her. She pawned them all and used the money to fund my education...and her growing dependence on opium.\u201d</p><p>Jasper didn\u2019t look at Eliza as he spoke, knowing if he saw pity in her eyes he wouldn\u2019t be able to continue.</p><p>\u201cAs Montague\u2019s financial situation declined,\u201d he went on, \u201cso did the quality of my mother\u2019s lodging, the men who came to her, and the gifts they brought her. She wasn\u2019t willing to allow my education to suffer, so she began to earn money the only way she could...through whatever acts and degradation were required.\u201d</p><p>His voice hardened. \u201cMeanwhile, I learned all I could from my tutors, so that one day I could ruin Montague the way he ruined my mother. I was furious when he passed on before I was ready.\u201d</p><p>There was a length of silence, during which all he heard was Eliza\u2019s elevated breathing. Finally, she said, \u201cWhat happened to your mother is unconscionable, Jasper. A cruelty so vile I could never have imagined it possible. And his son is cut of the same cloth.\u201d</p><p>She stood and came to him, catching him around the waist mid-stride and forcing him to accept the comfort she offered. He stood stiffly for a long moment, breathing hard, his mind filled with scenes from a past he wished desperately to forget. Then the scent of her perfume penetrated through the fog of memories and brought him back to the present. Back to the wife he\u2019d never expected to have, yet could no longer imagine living without.</p><p>He pressed his cheek to her crown. \u201cI know what you sacrifice with your offer. As consumed as I\u2019ve been by vengeance, I could easily squander everything you and your father have built. You know this, but you love me enough to put my needs first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you.\u201d Her arms banded tightly around him. \u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you. I understood when I sent Lynd to deal with Mrs. Reynolds\u2019s assignment that what I wanted most was to spend time with you. I also realized Montague could rob me of that, if I allowed him to.\u201d He leaned back to look at her. \u201cIf I allowed him to define me and my actions.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to ask Westfield to return the deed to Montague, and I will wash my hands of him. That\u2019s why West-field is here this morning. You see, my mother wins if I enjoy a life of happiness with a beautiful wife and rambunctious, extremely bright children. The victory would be hers.\u201d</p><p>Her hands cupped his face, her blue eyes shining with unshed tears and a love that humbled him. She was about to speak when a knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Jasper admonished.</p><p>Eliza\u2019s dimple flashed, and he almost told whoever was bothering them to return in a few hours. Or days...</p><p>He pulled the door open.</p><p>Robbins stood in the gallery. \u201cForgive me, Mr. Bond. There is a Runner here to see you and Mrs. Bond. A Mr. Bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thank you. We\u2019ll be down in a moment.\u201d</p><p>Jasper collected his coat. Eliza accepted his arm when he was ready and they descended to the ground floor. As they passed the parlor, Westfield could be heard speaking with Miss Chilcott. He sounded affronted.</p><p>They met with Mr. Bell in Eliza\u2019s study.</p><p>The Runner declined to take a seat and looked grim. \u201cYesterday, Mrs. Reynolds mentioned the Earl of Montague multiple times.\u201d</p><p>Jasper kept his expression neutral, but shot a quick look at Eliza, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019ve no notion\u2014yet\u2014of how his lordship is connected to yesterday\u2019s events, but I thought it might be relevant to tell you he was murdered an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Eliza lost the color in her cheeks, but said nothing. Jasper, too, needed a moment to absorb the news. He was surprised, then relieved to realize he felt no regret or anger, as he\u2019d felt when his father died. Montague\u2019s escape into death robbed him of nothing. Everything he needed was standing right beside him.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Jasper asked finally.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jane Rothschild did the deed,\u201d the Runner relayed. \u201cShot his lordship in the heart with her father\u2019s pistol.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eliza stood in the middle of her uncle\u2019s study and wondered how she would find a slender journal amid the multitude of books.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain it\u2019s not in your bedchamber?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Melville\u2019s wild head of hair appeared on the other side of a high table. His face was seen shortly after, his cheeks red and eyes bright. \u201cI\u2019m certain I looked for it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not purchase a new journal for your use on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI require the information in the journal,\u201d he said. \u201cNot simply blank pages on which to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we ready?\u201d</p><p>Eliza jumped at the sound of Jasper\u2019s voice, startled as ever by how silently he moved. He stood directly beside her. \u201cNot quite. We\u2019re still searching for his lordship\u2019s journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the barren desert of my heart,</p><p>you bloom with radiance</p><p>and fill the air with heaven\u2019s scent.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s brows rose as Lady Collingsworth entered the room while reading from a thin-spined book.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted, Burgess,\u201d Regina said, with a telltale blush. \u201cWho knew you were a poet?\u201d</p><p>Eliza was of the mind that her uncle was less than proficient in poetry, by any estimation, but she\u2019d learned that the sentiment behind a gift or gesture was the most important aspect. Practicality came a distant second.</p><p>\u201cNow may we set off?\u201d Jasper held out his hand to Eliza. \u201cI, for one, would prefer not to miss the ship carrying our luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Regina said, closing the journal and holding it out to Melville. When he accepted it, she took his arm.</p><p>\u201cIt will sound better when I read it to you,\u201d his lordship whispered, leading Regina out to the waiting carriage.</p><p>Setting her hand in Jasper\u2019s, Eliza wondered if the vibrating excitement reverberating through her was obvious on the exterior. He squeezed her fingers and smiled. \u201cI can feel how anxious you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anxious. Eager.\u201d She followed him back out to the foyer, where Robbins held her pelisse and bonnet. \u201cI love the ocean and temperate weather. I cannot wait to be surrounded by both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like falling asleep to the sound of crashing waves,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI intend to lay a blanket on the sand and ravish you in the moonlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper.\u201d Eliza was scandalized...and intrigued. \u201cOutdoors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn sunlight, and in rain. On the beach, and beneath the trees. Also indoors, in every room in the house.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was wry as he helped her up into their carriage. Melville and Regina were in a separate equipage behind them. Although the two claimed to be no more than friends, it was clear there was a connection between them. Eliza had initially been surprised to learn of their affection, until Regina explained that Melville had courted her long ago. In the end, he felt it would be best for her to marry a man who spent the majority of his time connected to the rest of the world, and Regina had assumed Melville simply didn\u2019t love her. Eliza and Jasper\u2019s delayed wedding provided the time and opportunity for the two sweethearts to reconnect. So far, their renewed relationship seemed highly promising.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you expect to schedule all these hours of sexual congress,\u201d Eliza said, as the carriage lurched into motion, \u201cwhile attempting to make a success of a sugarcane plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a guesthouse. Melville and Lady Collingsworth will be no deterrent. With unhindered access to you, the possibilities are endless.\u201d</p><p>Eliza smiled. \u201cMelville intends to cultivate a variety of seeds while he\u2019s with us, taking advantage of the warmer weather.\u201d</p><p>The light in Jasper\u2019s dark eyes was wicked. \u201cI suspect it will be Lady Collingsworth he will be cultivating and tending.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have a lascivious mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he purred. \u201cBut my claim is bolstered by the indefinable magic of the tropics that stirs a man\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She nodded sagely. \u201cNow your true intentions are revealed.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back into the squab and watched her with slumberous eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the first day we met that seduction was my method of choice with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d She hadn\u2019t, but in the weeks since they wed, she learned that teasing him led to delicious results.</p><p>\u201cShall I remind you?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lower lip. \u201cYou are welcome to make the attempt.\u201d</p><p>He moved quickly, grabbing her by the waist and dragging her over him. \u201cWifely satisfaction is a point of pride with me, Mrs. Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear you may be too handsome for the task.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jasper grabbed fistfuls of her skirts. \u201cConsidering the shortness of the distance to the docks, that\u2019s likely a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition,\u201d she went on, her voice growing husky, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to disguise the air about you which distinguishes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray tell me what that is.\u201d He reached into the opening of her pantalettes and parted the lips of her sex.
