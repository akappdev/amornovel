He had no sons, but he did have three nephews, and the youngest one was called Clever John....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>LONDON, ENGLAND</p> <p>APRIL 1738</p><p>Wolves, as Silence Hollingbrook well knew, are savage beasts, little given to pity or honor. If one must face a wolf cleverly disguised in human form, it did no good to show fear. Rather, one must throw one\u2019s shoulders back, lift one\u2019s chin, and stare the damned beast down.</p><p>At least that was what Silence told herself as she eyed \u201cCharming\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor, the most notorious river pirate in London. As she watched, Mr. O\u2019Connor did something far more alarming than any real wolf.</p><p>He smiled at her.</p><p>Silence swallowed.</p> <p>Mickey O\u2019Connor lounged like the pirate king he was on a gilded throne of red velvet at one end of a lavishly corrupt room. The walls were lined with sheets of gold, the floor was a fabulous mosaic of different colored marbles, and around her, piled high, were the spoils of thieving: trunks overflowing with furs and silks, crates of tea and spices, and treasures from every corner of the globe, all of it stolen from the merchant ships that came into London\u2019s docks. Silence stood in the midst of this illicit opulence like a petitioner.</p><p>Once again.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor plucked a sweetmeat from a tray offered by a small boy, holding it between long, beringed fingers as he examined her. One corner of his wide, sensuous mouth curled in amusement. \u201c \u2019Tis always a pleasure to gaze upon yer sparklin\u2019 hazel eyes, Mrs. Hollingbrook, but I do wonder why ye\u2019ve come to see me this lovely afternoon.\u201d</p><p>His mocking words strengthened Silence\u2019s spine. \u201cYou know very well why I\u2019m here, Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>The pirate lifted elegantly winged black eyebrows. \u201cDo I, now?\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Harry, one of Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s guards and her escort into the throne room, shifted his weight nervously. Harry was a big man with a battered face\u2014a man who\u2019d obviously lived a rather rough life\u2014yet he was just as obviously wary of Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d he muttered to her beneath his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get \u2019is temper up.\u201d</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor popped the sweetmeat into his mouth and chewed, his black eyes closing for a moment in pleasure. He was a beautiful man. Silence could see that even if she found him quite repugnant herself. His eyelashes were thick and black, surrounding dark, liquid eyes, his complexion a smooth olive, and when he smiled... well! The dimples that were revealed on his cheeks made him look both as wicked as the devil and as innocent as a small boy. Had a Renaissance master wanted to paint all the seductive allure of Satan, he would\u2019ve painted Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p><p>Silence inhaled. Mr. O\u2019Connor might well be as evil as Satan himself, but she\u2019d braved him once before and survived\u2014even if she hadn\u2019t walked away entirely unscathed. \u201cI\u2019ve come for Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>The pirate\u2019s eyes opened lazily as he swallowed his sweetmeat. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Oh, this was too much! Silence felt her face heat as she shook off Harry\u2019s restraining arm and marched right up to the foot of the small dais on which the ridiculous throne stood. \u201cYou know very well who! Mary Darling, that sweet little baby girl I\u2019ve taken care of for over a year. Mary Darling, who knows only me as her mother. Mary Darling, who you took from the foundling home where we both live. Give her back to me at once!\u201d</p><p>So great was her ire that Silence found herself out of breath at the end of her little tirade and pointing her finger nearly in Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s face. For a moment she froze, her finger only inches from his nose. Everyone in the room seemed to hold their breath. Mickey O\u2019Connor had lost his smile, and without that expression to lighten his face, he looked quite, quite frightening.</p><p>Silence let her hand fall.</p><p>Slowly, the pirate straightened from his chair, his long limbs uncurling gracefully like a predator. He stood, his polished black jackboots thunking to the floor, and stepped down from the dais.</p> <p>Silence could\u2019ve backed up, but that would\u2019ve shown fear. And besides, she thought she might\u2019ve become rooted to the spot. The scent of lemons and frankincense drifted in the air. She lifted her chin in defiance as Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s smooth, tanned, bare chest nearly touched her nose\u2014the man was so vain he left his extravagantly ruffled shirt unlaced\u2014and looked him in the eye.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor bent, his mouth lightly touching her ear, and murmured, \u201cWell, and why didn\u2019t ye say so in the first place, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>And while Silence gaped up at him, he straightened, his gaze still locked with hers, and snapped his fingers.</p><p>A door opened and Silence finally found the willpower to tear her gaze from those black, impenetrable eyes. And then she forgot all about Mickey O\u2019Connor. A servant girl had entered, and in her arms was the sweetest, most wonderful being in the whole world.</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d Mary Darling shrieked. She began a frantic bouncing in the servant girl\u2019s arms. \u201cMamoo! Mamoo! Mamoo! Up!\u201d</p><p>Silence rushed to catch the toddler before she could completely squirm from the girl\u2019s arms. \u201cI have you. I have you, my love,\u201d she murmured as Mary Darling wrapped soft, pudgy arms about her neck and squeezed.</p><p>Silence breathed in the scent of milk and baby, tears pricking her eyes. When she\u2019d found the toddler gone\u2014when she\u2019d feared that she\u2019d never see Mary Darling again\u2014her heart had seemed to shrivel into a tiny, frozen thing.</p><p>\u201cMamoo,\u201d Mary Darling sighed, and unwrapped her arms to pat Silence\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Silence ran her hands over Mary Darling\u2019s black curls, touching and squeezing and rubbing, making sure the little girl was as well as when she\u2019d last seen her, half a day before. The previous six hours had been the most frightening of her life and she never wanted to repeat\u2014</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d a masculine voice murmured nearby, and Silence suddenly remembered where she was.</p><p>She clutched Mary Darling to her breast and whirled to face the river pirate. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s most... most kind of you to have given her back to me. I really can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d Silence took a step backward, afraid to take her eyes from Charming Mickey\u2019s face. \u201cI... I\u2019ll just be leaving\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor smiled. \u201cOh, certainly, sweetheart, do as ye wish, but the little one will be a-stayin\u2019 with me, I think.\u201d</p><p>Silence froze. \u201cYou have no right!\u201d</p><p>The pirate lifted one inky eyebrow and reached out to finger Mary Darling\u2019s black curls. His tanned hand was large against her little head. \u201cOh, don\u2019t I? She is me daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad!\u201d Mary Darling glared at Mickey O\u2019Connor, dark eyes meeting dark eyes, black curls framing a face that might\u2019ve been a feminine miniature of Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s own.</p><p>The resemblance was quite devastating.</p><p>Silence swallowed. Mary Darling had been abandoned on her doorstep almost a year ago to the day. At the time she\u2019d thought that the baby had been left with her because Silence\u2019s brother, Winter, ran the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children. Now she wondered if there had been a much more diabolical reason. Fear that she was about to lose Mary Darling forever made her clutch the baby closer.</p><p>\u201cYou abandoned her upon my doorstep,\u201d she tried.</p><p>He cocked his head, eyeing her with ironic amusement. \u201cI left her with ye for her safekeepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d He let his hand drop. \u201cYe were\u2014are\u2014the purest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, me sweet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows drew together, confused. He didn\u2019t make any sense, and besides, they\u2019d wandered from the main point. \u201cYou don\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m a-thinkin\u2019 that don\u2019t matter when ye do, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d</p><p>Silence felt the breath catch in her throat. \u201cLet me leave with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling squirmed again with one of those mercurial shifts of moods that toddlers are prone to. \u201cDown!\u201d</p><p>Silence let her slip from her arms, watching as the little girl carefully stood against one of the huge trunks of booty. She looked so small. So precious. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Haven\u2019t you done enough to me in this lifetime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not nearly enough, m\u2019darlin\u2019,\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor murmured. Silence felt more than saw him reach out his hand toward her. Maybe he meant to fondle her hair as he had Mary Darling\u2019s.</p><p>She jerked her head out of his way.</p><p>His hand dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d She folded her arms and faced him, though she kept Mary Darling within sight.</p><p>He shrugged, the movement making his shirt slip further off one muscled shoulder. \u201cA man in me position has many an enemy, I fear. Nasty, mean creatures who don\u2019t let the thought of innocence or youth stop them from doin\u2019 terrible, murderous things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy take her from me now?\u201d Silence asked. \u201cAre these enemies new?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved into another smile, this one entirely without humor. \u201cNot at all. But me enemies have become more... er... persistent in the last month, ye understand. \u2019Tis merely a matter o\u2019 business\u2014one that I hope to soon tidy up. But in the meantime, should me enemies find the wee child...\u201d</p><p>Silence shivered, watching as Mary Darling grabbed for a dark fur and pulled it half out of the trunk. \u201cDamn you. How could you have put her in this danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said without any signs of conscience. \u201cI gave her to ye, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was safe with me,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cWhat has changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve discovered where she and ye live.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze to him and was disconcerted to find him only a foot away. The room was big, and besides Harry and the sweetmeats boy, a gang of pirates sat around Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s throne. Was he worried they\u2019d be overheard?</p><p>\u201cLet me keep her,\u201d Silence whispered. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you, doesn\u2019t love you. If there\u2019s truly a danger, then send men to guard her where we live, but let her stay at the home. If you have any decency in you at all, you\u2019ll let her go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, love.\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor tilted his head, long coal-black locks of hair slithering over his broad shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t ye know by now that decent is the last thing anyone would be a-callin\u2019 me? No, the lass stays with me and me men, here where I can keep me eye on her night and day until I can put an end to this bit o\u2019 bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she thinks me her mother,\u201d Silence hissed. \u201cHow can you separate us when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who said anythin\u2019 about separatin\u2019?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor asked with feigned surprise. \u201cWhy, darlin\u2019 I said the babe had to stay with me, I never said ye couldn\u2019t as well.\u201d</p><p>Silence inhaled and then found she had trouble letting the breath out again. \u201cYou want me to come live with you?\u201d</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor grinned as if she were a pet dog that had finally learned a trick. \u201cAye, that\u2019s the way o\u2019 it, sweetin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live with you,\u201d Silence hissed furiously. \u201cEveryone would think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, now?\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor arched an eyebrow, his black eyes glittering.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThat I was your whore.\u201d</p><p>He tutted softly. \u201cOh, and we can\u2019t be havin\u2019 that, now can we, what with yer reputation bein\u2019 all snowy white and all?\u201d</p><p>Her hand was half-raised, the fingers balled into a fist before she even realized it. She wanted to hit him so badly, wanted to wipe that smirk from his face with all her soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except he was no longer smiling. He watched her, his face expressionless, his eyes intent, like a wolf waiting for the hare to break from cover.</p><p>Trembling, she let her hand fall.</p><p>He shrugged, looking mildly disappointed. \u201cAh, well, it\u2019d be a great inconvenience to have ye livin\u2019 under me roof anyway. I \u2019spect ye\u2019ve made the right decision.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, sauntering smoothly toward his throne. She\u2019d been dismissed, it seemed. He no longer found her interesting enough to play with.</p> <p>In that moment, with rage and grief, and yes, love, swirling all inside, Silence made her decision.</p><p>\u201cMr. O\u2019Connor!\u201d</p><p>He stopped, still turned rudely away from her, his voice a rumbling purr. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>AH, BUT VICTORY felt so fuckin\u2019 lovely. Mick smiled, his back still toward the little widow. She was so outraged, her dusty black feathers all ruffled, she probably didn\u2019t even feel the net tangled about her prim little feet. And yet, how easy it\u2019d been to make her walk into his palace of her own volition, simply by kidnapping the babe.</p> <p>He turned, eyebrows arched as if surprised. \u201cYe\u2019ll be stayin\u2019 with me, is that what yer sayin\u2019, Mrs. Hollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>Her pointed chin was raised as if to challenge him in his own palace, poor foolish wench. She was an odd creature, Silence Hollingbrook, pretty, of course\u2014or he\u2019d not have looked twice at her in the first place\u2014but not his usual type, oh no. She didn\u2019t flaunt her charms, didn\u2019t try to lure a man with titties overflowing from a low bodice or a wicked wink. She didn\u2019t try to lure at all, come to think of it. She held her womanliness locked up tight like a miser, which, on the whole, was a bit irritating.</p><p>Irritating and alluring at the same time\u2014made a man want to find the key to her locks, truth be told.</p><p>Mud was splashed on the hem of her plain black frock; her shawl and cap were tattered, and yet her eyes stared at him all defiant like. Ah, but what eyes they were\u2014large and wide, and a glorious hazel\u2014made of golden brown and grass green and even a bit of gray blue. Hers was a face that might haunt a man\u2019s dreams, make him wake in the night sweating and lonely, the flesh between his legs heavy with longing. Why, it made him think of those ghost tales his mam used to tell him when he was but a wee lad, crying for lack of a dinner and the burning from the welts upon his back. Wailing women, dripping water in the night, searching for their lost loves.</p><p>Mind, the tales might\u2019ve been lovely, but his belly had still ached with hunger, his back had still stung with pain when he\u2019d woken in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said, her nose tilted proudly in the air, \u201cI\u2019ll come and live in this... this place. Just to take care of Mary Darling, nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, it was hard not to grin at those words, but he was strong, keeping his expression as solemn as a judge\u2019s. \u201cAnd what \u2018else\u2019 might ye be thinkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>The color flew high into her pale cheeks, making her eyes sparkle. Making his cock twitch. \u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer sure now, Mrs. Hollingbrook?\u201d He took a step closer, testing, watching for her to flee, for despite his enjoyment of this sparring, \u2019twas a serious matter that she stay beneath his roof. Her very life might depend upon it.</p><p>But she stood her ground, his little widow. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain, Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do call me Mickey, please,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMister O\u2019Connor.\u201d Her eyes narrowed on him. \u201cDespite what the rest of St. Giles thinks, you and I both know that my honor is quite intact, and I\u2019ll thank you to remember that fact.\u201d</p><p>She was a brave one, was Silence Hollingbrook. Her small chin outthrust, her hazel eyes steady, her pale lips trembling. Any other man might\u2019ve felt a twinge of guilt, a trickle of remorse for the sweet innocence he\u2019d taken and smashed to the ground like a fine china dish.</p><p>Any other man but he.</p> <p>For Mick O\u2019Connor had lost any vestige of guilt, remorse, or soul on a winter\u2019s night sixteen years before.</p><p>So now he smiled, without any conscience at all, as he lied to the woman he\u2019d hurt so cruelly. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be sure and remember, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d</p><p>She heard the mockery in his voice\u2014her lips thinned\u2014but she soldiered on. \u201cYou said that you\u2019ll soon have your business tidied up.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in interest, wondering what loophole she thought she\u2019d found. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re done with your... your enemies, then Mary Darling will no longer be in danger.\u201d</p><p>He merely watched her now, waiting patiently.</p><p>She inhaled as if to fortify herself. \u201cWhen that happens\u2014when your enemies are defeated and Mary isn\u2019t threatened anymore\u2014I want to leave here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course,\u201d he said at once.</p><p>\u201cWith Mary.\u201d</p><p>Oh, now, but the lass wasn\u2019t daft, was she? \u201cShe\u2019s me own flesh and blood,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe only soul in London related to me\u2014or at least the only one I\u2019ll acknowledge. Will ye be partin\u2019 a fond papa from his wee little one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said you don\u2019t love her.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook ignored his pretty words. \u201cI can provide a loving home for her, a wholesome, decent life.\u201d</p><p>Well, and he\u2019d already admitted to a lack of decency, now hadn\u2019t he? The corner of his mouth curved, a bit too sharply. He glanced at the babe, playing with the furs from a chest. Her down-bent head was topped with hair the exact shade as his own\u2014and his mam\u2019s, come to think of it\u2014and yet the sight didn\u2019t cause anything to stir within his chest.</p><p>He looked back at Mrs. Hollingbrook. \u201cWhen I say the danger\u2019s past, when I say ye can go, then aye, ye may take the babe with ye.\u201d</p><p>She sighed a bit. He had the feeling she didn\u2019t like it, not at all\u2014he\u2019d not put a date on the day she could go\u2014but she\u2019d already made the bargain, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cVery well. I shall have to return to the home to retrieve my things and Mary\u2019s. We\u2019ll come back here as soon as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, ah.\u201d He shook his head with amusement. Did she think he\u2019d toddled into St. Giles yesterday? \u201cThe lass stays here with me. Ye can take two o\u2019 me men with ye to bring back whatever ye\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She must\u2019ve known she was pushing the matter. She merely pursed her pretty lips, nodded, and bent to kiss the oblivious baby on the top of the head. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned to stalk to the door.</p><p>Mick admired the outraged sway of her hips for a second before jerking his head at Harry to follow the little widow. Harry touched his forehead and hurried after her. He\u2019d get his cohort, Bert, and between the two of them guard Mrs. Hollingbrook to and from the home.</p><p>There was a squeak somewhere around the level of his knees. Mick glanced down and saw the babe\u2019s face turn a bright shade of beet red as she watched Mrs. Hollingbrook leave the throne room. It was his only warning.</p><p>And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cYOU DON\u2019T HAVE to escort me all the way back to the home,\u201d Silence muttered irritably some moments later.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Imself says we do, and so we do,\u201d Harry said somewhat obscurely.</p><p>He took one step for every two of hers and might\u2019ve been out for a late afternoon stroll. The buttons of his frayed brown coat strained over his barrel chest and he wore a bright red scarf wound around his neck, the ends flung debonairly over his shoulders. The scarf was at odds with his battered face and massive broken nose\u2014Harry looked like a pugilist who had lost one too many rounds. The early spring wind was chill with a nasty edge of damp, but Harry didn\u2019t seem to notice as he stumped along, his old cocked hat at a jaunty angle.</p><p>The same couldn\u2019t be said for his companion.</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2019oos mindin\u2019 the palace, is what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d grumped Bert. He was half a head shorter than Harry and was hunched inside the collar of his bottle-green coat like a turtle. A huge gray scarf wrapped around and over both his face and the seedy wig he wore, making his head look disproportionately swollen. \u201cSendin\u2019 us off in the middle o\u2019 the day with a wench!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dozen o\u2019 the crew at the palace,\u201d Harry pointed out. \u201cAnd Bob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob! Jaysus, Bob,\u201d Bert said in disgust. \u201cCouldn\u2019t guard a kitten, could Bob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen \u2019e\u2019s not three sheets to the wind \u2019e can,\u201d Harry said judiciously.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019s always fuckin\u2019 drunk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yer tongue,\u201d Harry said, and then as an aside to Silence, \u201c \u2019E\u2019s missin\u2019 \u2019is afternoon tea is Bert, and it makes \u2019im tetchy like. Normally the most placid o\u2019 men is our Bert.\u201d</p><p>Silence, watched as \u201cour Bert\u201d spat through his missing two front teeth, almost hitting a passing mongrel. She was rather doubtful that the man was ever in a good mood, tea or no tea, but she wisely decided not to share this thought. For whatever reason Harry seemed to have taken a liking to her, and she was loath to spoil their accord.</p><p>If she was to live with Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor she would need a friendly face.</p><p>Dear God. Only now as she walked the grimy streets of St. Giles, did the full impact of her decision hit her. She\u2019d pledged to live in the same house as the most notorious man in St. Giles\u2014a man she\u2019d spent over a year hating and fearing. Whatever shreds of respectability she\u2019d been able to pull together over her battered reputation in the last year would be truly torn asunder now. But what choice did she have? One look at Mary Darling\u2019s face and she would\u2019ve walked through fire.</p><p>Silence shivered and pulled her cloak more firmly about her person. Mickey O\u2019Connor had never actually hurt her\u2014not physically anyway\u2014and she had Harry as an ally. She would draw on her own strength, keep to herself, and avoid the company of Charming Mickey and his men as much as possible until his enemies were defeated and she could go home.</p><p>Pray that was soon.</p><p>She turned into a small lane and the modest door to the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children came into sight. It was the temporary Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children, sadly, ever since a fire had burned down the original home a year ago. A new building was being built for the home, but a series of setbacks had delayed their move to the new place.</p><p>The door was flung open before Silence could touch it.</p><p>\u201cHave you found her?\u201d Nell Jones, the home\u2019s trusted maidservant, looked eager, but her bright blue eyes dimmed when she saw Silence\u2019s empty arms. Nell\u2019s pretty face was flushed, one blond lock fluttering around her ear\u2014her disorder a measure of how worried she was about Mary Darling.</p><p>\u201cI did find Mary Darling,\u201d Silence said hastily. \u201cBut... well, it\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are these two?\u201d Nell asked suspiciously, eyeing Harry and Bert.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen what \u2019as seen yer mistress safely \u2019ome,\u201d Harry said. He removed the battered tricorne from his head, revealing a thinning patch of straggly brown hair, and bowed rather elegantly, considering his size.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Nell sniffed, though her tone was less strident. \u201cBest come inside, then.\u201d</p><p>The entryway to the home was narrow and cramped and the two men seemed to take up not only what little room there was, but the air as well.</p><p>Nell stared at them disapprovingly for a moment and then turned to a small boy loitering curiously behind her. \u201cJoseph Tinbox, take these, er, gentlemen back to the kitchen and ask Mary Whitsun to make them a pot of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite kind o\u2019 ye, ma\u2019am.\u201d Harry beamed.</p><p>Silence was surprised to see Nell fight to keep her face stern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMind nothing goes missing in there,\u201d the maid said gruffly. \u201cI know everything in that kitchen down to the vinegar shakers.\u201d</p><p>Harry placed his hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019ll keep me eye on Bert, \u2019ere. See that \u2019e don\u2019t pocket a spoon or nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>With an indignant snort from Bert, Joseph Tinbox led them off.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d Silence said as she made for the stairs. \u201cI had to leave Mary Darling behind and I want to get back quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack where?\u201d Nell cried as she followed Silence up the stairs, panting.</p><p>\u201cTo Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord in Heaven,\u201d Nell muttered. \u201cIs that where you rushed off to after reading the note? To see that devil?\u201d</p><p>Silence had returned from the shopping that morning to find that Mary had somehow disappeared from the home. Everyone in the house\u2014all eight and twenty children, three maids, and the lone manservant\u2014had immediately begun searching for her. But it wasn\u2019t until a mysterious note had been delivered hours later that Silence had even thought of Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p><p>\u201cThe note was from Mr. O\u2019Connor saying he might have something I\u2019d want,\u201d Silence said breathlessly as they made the top floor of the house. The room she shared with Mary Darling was up here under the eaves. \u201cHe\u2019s Mary\u2019s father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nell had finally caught up with her and she laid a hand on Silence\u2019s arm. \u201cHow long have you known this?\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019ve suspected it for some time. You remember Mary\u2019s mysterious admirer? The one who used to leave presents for her on the step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nell sank onto the narrow bed in Silence\u2019s room, her pretty face creased with worry.</p><p>\u201cA couple of months ago, just before Christmas, he left me a lock of black hair.\u201d Silence pulled a small trunk from under the bed. She straightened and looked at Nell. \u201cThe lock matched Mary Darling\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Mickey O\u2019Connor left it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Silence shrugged. \u201cBut I think it must\u2019ve been him. I thought I saw him watching me and Mary Darling once or twice last fall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s her father, why did Mickey O\u2019Connor leave her with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he was trying to protect her from his enemies.\u201d Silence began to throw clothes into the chest. \u201cPerhaps he thought her safely hidden with me. Perhaps he was merely playing a game to amuse himself.\u201d</p><p>Nell shook her head as if dazed. \u201cBut what of the baby\u2019s mother? Surely she had some say in the matter?\u201d</p><p>Silence froze, her hand outstretched for one of Mary\u2019s frocks hanging on a hook. She turned her head and stared at Nell. \u201cHer mother\u2014my goodness, he never even mentioned the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s dead.\u201d Nell frowned. \u201cDo you think Mickey O\u2019Connor was married? I never heard of such, but he\u2019s a secretive scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Silence took the frock with shaking fingers and placed it carefully in the trunk before closing the lid. \u201cI only know that I must go live with him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nell jumped to her feet in alarm.</p><p>Silence locked the trunk. \u201cHe says that Mary is in danger from his enemies and he won\u2019t let her leave his house. If I\u2019m to be with her, I must live with him.\u201d</p> <p>Nell lifted one end of the trunk even as she moaned. \u201cBut after what he did to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t any choice, don\u2019t you see?\u201d Silence walked to the door, the heavy little trunk between them.</p><p>\u201cBut the home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness!\u201d Silence stopped and stared at Nell.</p><p>She\u2019d been so busy worrying over Mary Darling, she\u2019d not thought of what her actions would do to the home. In the last year the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children had gained the patronage of several aristocratic ladies\u2014ladies who cared terribly about appearances and reputations. The home depended on their donations. If they found out that Silence was staying with a man\u2014a pirate\u2014without benefit of marriage...</p><p>Silence\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let anyone know where I am. We can say that I\u2019ve gone to attend an ill aunt in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Makepeace?\u201d Nell muttered as they began to descend the staircase. \u201cWhat shall I say to him?\u201d</p><p>Silence stumbled, nearly dropping her end of the trunk. She\u2019d forgotten she\u2019d have to deal with Winter\u2019s disapproval as well. Her brother had made a journey to Oxford on business and thus had been away from the home when Mary Darling\u2019s absence had been discovered. This morning Silence had wished desperately for her brother\u2019s support in searching for the little girl. Now she was thankful he was away. Winter was a mild man, a schoolmaster by trade, as well as manager of the home, but she had no doubt at all that he would\u2019ve locked her in her room before letting her go to Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p><p>Just the thought made her hurry her step. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, Nell, to leave you with the chore of telling Winter but I can\u2019t stay. I need to go to Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Nell said stoutly.</p><p>Silence shot her a quick smile. \u201cNone of this is your fault and Mr. Makepeace will understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surely hope so, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>By the time they\u2019d descended the rest of the stairs Silence was perspiring from exertion and anxiety. Winter wasn\u2019t expected back for days, yet she couldn\u2019t help jumping when the door to the kitchen opened.</p><p>\u201cTake that, shall I?\u201d Harry asked as he strolled out, a bun in one hand. He grasped one of the trunk\u2019s handles and easily swung it to his broad back.</p><p>Nell straightened, hands on hips and glared. \u201cWatch you don\u2019t drop the mistress\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course not,\u201d Harry said easily, earning himself a disgusted grunt from Bert.</p><p>Nell looked at Silence and her face seemed to crumple. \u201cOh, ma\u2019am!\u201d She threw her apron over her face and let out a loud, hiccupping sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Nell, really \u2019tis,\u201d Silence said helplessly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether or not she believed the words herself, but what else was she to say? Tears were pricking her eyes now as well. She\u2019d lived at the home for just over a year, learned of her husband William\u2019s death last fall here, discovered she was more than a wife here\u2014that she could stand on her own two feet and be of use to others. Now she was leaving suddenly and without warning. She felt as if the very ground beneath her feet was unstable. She had no home now\u2014hadn\u2019t since William\u2019s death, really\u2014all she had was Mary Darling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d she whispered, not even sure she spoke the truth.</p><p>Nell pulled down her apron, her face reddened and damp, her blond hair trailing from its pins. She marched up to Harry and stuck a finger in his chest. \u201cJust you watch out for her, you hear me, you great lout? A hair on her head gets harmed and it\u2019s you I\u2019ll be coming after.\u201d</p><p>The threat was ludicrous, Harry towered over Nell. Silence blinked, Bert scowled, but Harry himself was quite solemn. He took Nell\u2019s hand gently in his big paw and spread her fingers until he could rest them on his great chest, just over where his heart might be.</p><p>\u201cNever you fear, ma\u2019am,\u201d was all he said. \u201cNever you fear.\u201d</p><p>And then Silence was out the door, the wind whipping her skirts flat against her legs as she headed into a new life.</p><p>CHARLIE GRADY, BETTER known as the Vicar of Whitechapel, poured himself a tankard of beer. Some might find it strange\u2014his taste for beer\u2014seeing as how he controlled the distilling of damn near every drop of gin in Whitechapel and indeed the whole East End of London, but there it was. Charlie liked beer, so beer he drank.</p><p>And if anyone did find his taste in drink strange, well... no one was foolish enough to tell him so to his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d he asked, watching as the foam in the pewter tankard slowly subsided. He didn\u2019t need to look up to know that Freddy, standing before Charlie\u2019s table, was studying his own big feet.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E moved the babe into \u2019is palace today.\u201d Freddy was a big bruiser, smarter than he looked, but not much for expansive talk.</p><p>Charlie grinned, only half of his face moving. \u201cAlways a smart one was Charming Mickey. He must have a real fear for what I\u2019d do to the babe to take her out of his hiding place and move her to the palace.\u201d</p><p>Freddy shuffled uneasily. \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wench came to see \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>Charlie laughed, the sound a strange sputter. \u201cThat there isn\u2019t news.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked up in time to see Freddy look hastily away.</p><p>Freddy flushed, the red mottling his pitted face. \u201cThis one is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one \u2019oo lived in the orphan\u2019s \u2019ome\u2014the respectable one. The one takin\u2019 care o\u2019 the babe.\u201d</p><p>Charlie cocked his head, feeling the pull of old scars on the left side of his face and neck. \u201cAh, but that is news. Charming Mickey don\u2019t like the respectable ones much, now does he?\u201d</p><p>Freddy knew better than to answer, so Charlie took a sip of his beer, the tart taste of hops washing down his throat.</p><p>He set his tankard back on the table and picked up the dice with his left hand\u2014the one with the thumb and forefinger turned to claws. He\u2019d had the dice for long years now and they were worn smooth, the paint gone from the carved pips, the edges rounded. They were old friends in his palm and when he threw them gently, they rolled with barely a sound on the bare plank table.</p><p>Deuce and trey. A five. Ah, now, five could be good or very good, depending. Depending.</p><p>Last fall he\u2019d had plans to move into St. Giles. Take over the gin distilling there and become king of gin in all of London. Those plans had stumbled because of an aristocrat not afraid of blowing up his own still\u2014and taking half of Charlie\u2019s men with it. But Charlie\u2019d had time to regroup since then.</p><p>And besides, he had another focus now.</p><p>\u201cMy Gracie\u2019s dead and buried. What she wanted, what she kept me from doin\u2019... now that\u2019s dead, as well.\u201d Charlie stared with fascination at the greasy bits of bone. They seemed to wink up at him slyly. \u201cAll bets are off and Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor would do well to look after his females.\u201d</p><p>He looked up in time to catch Freddy\u2019s horrified gaze directly.</p><p>\u201cBest have our spy find out how much the lady means to Mickey, hadn\u2019t ye?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The king had a palace, naturally, and beside the palace was a large and lovely garden. Every morning it was the king\u2019s habit to stroll about his garden and inspect the fruit trees, which were his pride and joy. Imagine then, the king\u2019s shock when one morning he came upon his favorite cherry tree and found the ground underneath littered with cherry pits....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>It was dusk by the time Silence, Harry, and Bert made it back to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s gaudily opulent \u201cpalace.\u201d The moment they stepped inside Silence heard the screams.</p><p>She knew that angry shriek.</p><p>Silence took the stairs two at a time, not even slowing at Harry\u2019s worried, \u201cOi!\u201d from behind her. The screams were growing louder the nearer she got to Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s throne room. She pushed open the great double doors and swept right past Bob, the skinny guard, and marched to where Mickey O\u2019Connor stood in the middle of the room with a bawling Mary Darling in his hands.</p><p>No wonder the little girl was crying! The pirate held his screaming daughter out at arm\u2019s length as if she were a stinking chamber pot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Silence demanded and snatched the baby from his hands.</p><p>Mary Darling had stopped shrieking at the sight of Silence, but she still cried, her little face red and swollen, her shoulders shuddering with uncontrollable sobs. Silence recognized this state of affairs: Mary had been wailing for quite some time.</p><p>She kissed the baby\u2019s damp cheek, murmuring soothing nonsense and then turned an accusing eye on Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p><p>He threw up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t be lookin\u2019 at me like that. I didn\u2019t touch the brat and no one could get her to stop wailin\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>Silence covered Mary\u2019s ears. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor scowled, for once looking less than charming. \u201cShe started bawlin\u2019 the moment ye left. Like a great, barmy banshee, she was. Near to deafened me, I tell ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps she doesn\u2019t like it here.\u201d Silence tucked Mary\u2019s still shaking head under her chin and cuddled the baby. \u201cPerhaps she doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t like her, and that\u2019s a fact, no perhaps about it.\u201d</p><p>Silence gasped. \u201cBut she\u2019s your daughter!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what does that have to do with the matter?\u201d Mickey asked with a sardonic twist to his lips. \u201cHer dam was a whore I kept for less than a sennight. The first I was hearin\u2019 o\u2019 the babe was when the wench died and left a note that I was the father. An old bawd came and dumped the babe on me, but not afore demandin\u2019 a guinea for the pleasure. For ought I know her mam lied and the babe is none o\u2019 me flesh at all.\u201d</p><p>Silence stroked a hand over Mary\u2019s soft curls, truly shocked. Had he no feelings at all? \u201cIs that what you truly think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatters not at all, does it?\u201d He turned away, one wide shoulder shrugging elegantly. \u201cDaughter or not, flesh or not, like her or not, she\u2019s me own now, so don\u2019t be a-gettin\u2019 any ideas to the contrary. Now follow me like a good lass and I\u2019ll be showin\u2019 ye to yer room.\u201d</p><p>He strode away as if he did indeed expect her to follow like \u201ca good lass.\u201d Had Silence any choice she would\u2019ve remained where she was. But since Mary was already half-asleep on her shoulder, she tramped after the awful man with Harry and Bert bringing up the rear.</p><p>He led her out through the double doors\u2014Bob ran to open them as Mickey O\u2019Connor approached so he didn\u2019t have to stop. Mr. O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t acknowledge the courtesy, merely striding past like a king, but Silence nodded her thanks to the skinny guard as she hurried after.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor stalked down a short hallway and then through another door that led to the back of the house. A big man stood guard here as well. The gold walls and marble floor stopped at the door, but that didn\u2019t mean this area of the house was any less richly appointed. The carved wood panels of the walls shone richly with beeswax and the floor beneath their feet was thickly carpeted. Mr. O\u2019Connor mounted a set of stairs, Silence panting behind, trying to tamp down the frisson of dread remembrance. Mickey O\u2019Connor had taken her this way once before, and she hadn\u2019t emerged again entirely whole.</p> <p>The sound of the pirate\u2019s heels as he led her and the smell of fresh beeswax on the panels suddenly made the memory of that night rise up, overwhelming her like water closing over her head.</p><p>William, her dear husband, had been accused of stealing the cargo from his ship\u2014the cargo that Mickey O\u2019Connor had taken.</p><p>So Silence had come to St. Giles, wrapping herself in foolish bravery, love for William, and a fatal na\u00efvet\u00e9. She\u2019d pleaded with Mickey O\u2019Connor for William. She\u2019d thrown herself on the mercy of a wolf, forgetting that wolves didn\u2019t understand even the idea of mercy.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor had told her that he would replace the cargo\u2014but that in return she\u2019d have to spend the night with him. He\u2019d stood up from his throne and led her from the throne room and through these very hallways.</p><p>By that time she\u2019d been very nearly in a panic. She was a good woman\u2014a virtuous woman\u2014and she had no choice but to think that he would debauch her. Instead, he\u2019d brought her to his magnificent bedroom, seated her by the fire, and called for supper. Servants had brought the most beautiful meal she had ever seen. Sweets and rich meats and hothouse fruits. He\u2019d insisted she eat and she\u2019d obeyed him, though the food had tasted like ashes in her mouth.</p><p>Afterward, he\u2019d bid her lay in his big bed, stripped the shirt from his body... and then he\u2019d ignored her, reading papers by the fire, half unclothed. When she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer she\u2019d sat up. \u201cWhat do you mean to do with me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d glanced up in feigned surprise, the shadows the firelight had cast across his face making him look nearly demonic. \u201cWhy, nothin\u2019, Mrs. Hollingbrook. What did ye think I\u2019d do with ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you bring me here?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d smiled\u2014not a nice smile. No, this was a smile such as a wolf would give just before he tore into the doe\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat will ye tell yer husband when ye return to his arms tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him? I\u2019ll tell him the truth: that we dined together, but that nothing else happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll believe ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She\u2019d been outraged. \u201cWilliam loves me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d nodded. \u201cIf he loves ye, he\u2019ll believe ye.\u201d</p><p>His words had been like a curse. Even then\u2014sitting on that ridiculously lush bed, just beginning to feel the relief that she wouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice her pride to this man\u2014even then, she\u2019d shivered with foreboding.</p><p>The next morning Mickey O\u2019Connor had made her undo the front of her dress until her breasts were nearly revealed. He\u2019d had her take down her hair and tousle it about her face. And then he\u2019d made her promise to walk up the street like that.</p><p>As if she were a common whore leaving his bed.</p><p>It had been hard\u2014until then the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done in her life\u2014but she\u2019d walked up that street, past the catcalls of the whores returning home for the night. She\u2019d found her sister, Temperance, waiting for her at the end of the street, worried sick about what had happened to Silence over the night. Silence had collapsed in her sister\u2019s arms, hoping that the terrible spell was over.</p><p>But that walk up the street in disarray had not been the worst\u2014not by a long shot. For after that night she\u2019d found that no one believed her. Not Winter, not Temperance, not the butcher on the corner, not her neighbors in Wapping.</p><p>No one.</p><p>Not even her darling husband, William. They all had thought Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor had raped her. William had hardly been able to look at her before he left on that last voyage. He\u2019d turned his head aside as if the sight of her shamed him\u2014or as if she repelled him. And as she had watched her love leave, that last time on a ship that in six months\u2019 time would be lost at sea, Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s words had echoed in her mind:</p><p>If he loves ye, he\u2019ll believe ye.</p><p>Silence blinked and saw that they were climbing past a wide landing. She caught sight of familiar gilded double doors and glanced hastily away. Mickey O\u2019Connor led her to the next floor up and then to the first door in the hallway there. He opened it with a flourish to reveal a neat bedroom with pink walls and white trim. Silence stopped short in astonishment. A bed with embroidered flowered hangings stood in one corner. Beside it was a cot with spindled rails all around the outside\u2014obviously a child\u2019s bed. There was even a small sitting area with a settee before the fireplace. Harry was already placing her trunk at the foot of the bed while Bert took a chair outside the door.</p><p>All in all the room was very nice\u2014and terribly out of place in this den of iniquity.</p><p>Silence turned to Mr. O\u2019Connor with a frown. \u201cWho usually resides in this room?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d leaned a broad shoulder against the fireplace mantel as he watched her examine the room. \u201cWhy, no one, darlin\u2019. Did ye think I kept a passel o\u2019 virgins here to sacrifice to me wicked lust?\u201d</p><p>She could feel herself color at his mocking words. \u201cI merely wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, wonder no longer. This room is for ye and ye alone.\u201d He arched one satanic eyebrow. \u201cHave ye any other questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave ye to make yerself at home. Supper\u2019s at eight o\u2019clock. Sharp, mind. Harry\u2019ll show ye the way.\u201d He\u2019d straightened from the mantel as he spoke, and now he strode out the door without so much as a backward glance.</p><p>Silence stared, rather stunned, as the door closed softly behind the river pirate. \u201cWretched man!\u201d</p><p>There was a soft gasp from near the bed and Silence noticed for the first time that a girl sat by the cot. It was the same maidservant who had brought Mary Darling into the throne room.</p><p>Behind Silence, Harry cleared his throat with a sound like boulders rubbing together. \u201cThis \u2019ere\u2019s Fionnula, \u2019oo\u2019s been set to carin\u2019 for the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Fionnula dipped in an awkward curtsy, abandoned halfway down. She was a pretty girl, perhaps no more than eighteen, her fair skin freckled, her hair a lovely reddish blond, springing out from its pins in a cloud of curls about her face.</p><p>\u201cMrs. \u2019Ollingbrook is goin\u2019 to stay \u2019ere with the little lassie, Fionnula,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOrders o\u2019 \u2019Imself, so mind what she says, \u2019ear?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula nodded, apparently struck mute by Harry\u2019s instructions.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Harry said after an awkward pause. \u201cAh... I\u2019ll jus\u2019 push along. \u2019Imself \u2019as given orders that me and Bert\u2019ll be watchin\u2019 after ye while yer \u2019ere, Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook, so if\u2019n ye need anythin\u2019, jus\u2019 give us a \u2019oller. We\u2019ll be outside the door.\u201d</p><p>And Harry left, as well.</p><p>Silence scowled at the door through which the men had disappeared. \u201cSometimes I suspect that men are great idiots.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula gave a surprised giggle, hurriedly muffled.</p><p>Silence smiled sheepishly at the girl. It was hardly Fionnula\u2019s fault that Mr. O\u2019Connor was such an autocratic pirate.</p><p>\u201cThe babe\u2019s fair worn out,\u201d Fionnula said, nodding at Mary still in Silence\u2019s arms. Her Irish burr was pronounced.</p><p>\u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Silence whispered. She carried Mary to the cot and gently laid her down, hovering a moment to see if the toddler would wake.</p><p>But Mary was exhausted from her crying bout and slept deeply.</p><p>Silence straightened and moved to the fireplace, motioning Fionnula to follow. \u201cSo you were looking after Mary today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the maid said shyly. \u201cShe was fair mad to\u2019ve been taken from her home. She\u2019s a handsome lass, though. The spittin\u2019 image of Himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is,\u201d Silence murmured as she sank into the settee. She hadn\u2019t had a moment to rest since she\u2019d discovered Mary missing and weariness was making her limbs liquid. \u201cIs this your room now, too?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am. \u2019Tisn\u2019t anyone\u2019s as far as I know, savin\u2019 yerself. I have a cot in the attic, same as the other maids, but Himself has said I\u2019m to sleep through there now.\u201d She gestured to a small door on the wall.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d Silence got up to peek into Fionnula\u2019s room. It was barely big enough to hold a cot and a row of pegs on the wall. Certainly it was far more Spartan than Silence\u2019s and Mary\u2019s room. She came back and flung herself down on the settee again and looked at the maid curiously. \u201cWhen did you come to work for Mr. O\u2019Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit more\u2019n a month ago.\u201d Fionnula\u2019s fair face suddenly flamed. \u201cI... I have a friend who lives here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the blush on the maid\u2019s face, Silence thought the \u201cfriend\u201d must be a man. \u201cSurely not Harry?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula giggled. \u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Mr. O\u2019Connor?\u201d Silence asked with a strangely heavy heart. Had he sent his kept woman to watch over her?</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no,\u201d Fionnula said. \u201cThe ladies that Himself entertains are fancy pieces, quite lovely like. I\u2019m not nearly as beautiful or as high in the instep as they.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d Silence got up to unpack her meager trunk.</p><p>The reality of her situation swept over her. She\u2019d placed herself entirely in the power of an evil man\u2014a man whose only use for women was to have them \u201centertain\u201d him. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted for Mary Darling\u2014or herself. Once again she\u2019d let Mickey O\u2019Connor get the upper hand. For a moment panic rose in her chest, nearly suffocating her.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d Fionnula asked hesitantly.</p><p>Silence glanced up and saw the little maid watching her worriedly. \u201cOh, yes. Just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>She rose to put away a pile of stockings, but as she did she came to a decision: she might be in Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s palace again, but that didn\u2019t mean this time had to end like the last. This time the pirate would find that Silence Hollingbrook had a mind and a spirit of her own.</p> <p>And she would never blindly obey him again.</p><p>THE LITTLE WIDOW\u2019S presence in his palace gave him an odd itch \u2019tween the shoulder blades, Mick mused later that evening as he spread out a great map upon a table. \u2019Twas a crawling feeling, two parts curiosity, one of lust, with a dram of uneasy wariness stirred in.</p><p>Strange, that, since he\u2019d spent the last year slyly planning to get Silence Hollingbrook exactly where she was\u2014under his power and under his roof. It\u2019d been a whim in the beginning. He\u2019d eyed the squalling babe held in the greedy old bawd\u2019s arms, and known at once that the babe would have to be hidden from the Vicar. And why not her? he\u2019d thought. Why not the righteous Mrs. Hollingbrook? Perhaps it was a way to claim some of that pure virtue she\u2019d blazed at him in his own throne room. To steal by proxy what he could never earn. It had given him a bittersweet satisfaction: to hide the flesh of his flesh with the woman he\u2019d harmed most in the world. To tie Silence to him with bonds of her own maternal love.</p><p>Aye, and now at last he\u2019d brought her back to his palace and by rights he ought to be feeling a triumphant bit of glee, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Not an odd, crawling sensation instead.</p><p>\u201cShe seems content enough.\u201d Harry\u2019s broad, ugly face wrinkled as if he were thinking on whether \u201ccontent\u201d was really the word he wanted. \u201cI left \u2019er with Fionnula.\u201d</p> <p>Mick shot him a sardonic glance before returning his gaze to the map spread upon a great gilded table before him. Rumor had it that the table had been meant for a royal palace. But that was before Mick had demanded it in tithe from a captain who\u2019d tried to wriggle out from his just obligations to Mick and his crew. Made it all the sweeter to have it in his own planning room, then.</p><p>\u201cLeft her alone?\u201d Mick asked with an edge to his voice. Silence was in his palace now\u2014a treasure he\u2019d protect like any other.</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d Harry said hastily. \u201cBert\u2019s guardin\u2019 \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mick grunted. \u201cI\u2019d be best pleased if\u2019n she and the babe were within eyesight o\u2019 one o\u2019 ye at all times. She\u2019s to be guarded well, mind.\u201d He spread the map, leaning on it with both arms outstretched and studied it. \u201cWhere\u2019s this dock yer contemplatin\u2019?\u201d he asked the third man in the room.</p><p>\u201cDown here,\u201d Bran Kavanagh said, waving his hand over the lower Thames. \u201cIt\u2019s rumored that the owners are in debt. They\u2019ll sell cheap.\u201d</p><p>The lad leaned forward eagerly, forgetting that he liked to pretend an air of sophistication. Bran had been with Mick for the last six years or more. He was a pretty lad of twenty or so, all light blue eyes and red-brown hair pulled back into a queue. Made the girls quite swoon over him\u2014much to Bran\u2019s discomfort, for the lad was a solemn one.</p><p>Except as now when he had a scheme brewing in his brain.</p><p>Mick examined the area Bran had indicated. \u201cWhat\u2019re ye thinkin\u2019 we can do with it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can buy the docks and charge for the use of them,\u201d Bran said at once. He\u2019d been contemplating his plan for a while, it seemed. \u201cOr sell them again at a higher price in the future. It\u2019s a bit of insurance against lean times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Mick murmured. He hadn\u2019t told Bran, but he already had \u201cinsurance.\u201d \u201cI do like the idea o\u2019 insurance.\u201d</p><p>Bran grinned, quick and hopeful. \u201cThen you\u2019ll buy the docks?\u201d</p><p>Mick sighed, hating to disappoint the lad, but business was business. \u201cIf I go a-buyin\u2019 docks and such, then I\u2019ll be havin\u2019 to hire secretaries and managers and the like to run the damn things. Might be more expense than profit.\u201d</p><p>The corners of Bran\u2019s mouth turned down\u2014the boy hadn\u2019t yet learned to hide his emotions properly. \u201cIf you wait, they\u2019ll sell to someone else. We\u2019ll have lost the docks and another mayn\u2019t come up for sale for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I jump too soon, I\u2019ll lose me money,\u201d Mick said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interestin\u2019 idea, Bran, me lad, but I\u2019ll have to think on it a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mick shook his head once, staring at the boy sternly. \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019ve other matters to settle first\u2014ones involvin\u2019 the Vicar.\u201d</p><p>Bran looked away. \u201cAs you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like,\u201d Mick said mildly as he rolled up the map. \u201cWhat have ye found out for me?\u201d</p><p>Bran sighed. \u201cI saw his men lurking around the orphans\u2019 home this afternoon after Mrs. Hollingbrook left. You got the babe out just in time, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLurkin\u2019 in plain sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Bran replied. \u201cThe Vicar\u2019s men have become quite bold. They tramp about St. Giles in packs of four or five without a care in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em,\u201d Mick growled. \u201cSt. Giles is mine and I\u2019ll see those bloody whoresons run out.\u201d He stretched his neck. \u201cAnd how did the Vicar find out about the babe in the first place is what I\u2019m wonderin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did have men watching her,\u201d Bran pointed out.</p><p>Mick looked up, eyes narrowed, only to find Harry nodding thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve led the Vicar straight to the babe,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Mick grunted. He didn\u2019t like the thought that \u2019twas his own error that had led the Vicar\u2019s men to the orphanage and the babe. There was another possibility, too: Had one of his men betrayed his secret to the Vicar?</p><p>\u201cThen he knows that I have the babe within me palace,\u201d Mick said slowly.</p><p>Bran nodded grimly.</p><p>Mick sighed. \u201cWell, \u2019twas never me plan to hide the fact that I had her safe. He knows he must attack me palace to get to her\u2014and that, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019, he\u2019ll be loath to do.\u201d He looked at Bran. \u201cWhat have ye found out about the Vicar himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vicar\u2019s got dozens of men around him at all times,\u201d Bran replied. \u201cHe guards himself better than you, come to that. It\u2019ll be a right job to get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but get to him we must,\u201d Mick said. \u201c \u2019Tis near the end o\u2019 winter and he\u2019ll be runnin\u2019 low on grain for his damned gin stills. Have some o\u2019 me men find out who\u2019s supplyin\u2019 him. I\u2019ll offer the suppliers an incentive to quit doin\u2019 business with the Vicar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bran hesitated, then blurted out, \u201cBut I don\u2019t see why you two are at war. He has his gin distilling and you have the river. How do your interests cross?\u201d</p><p>Sad brown eyes rose up in his inner mind, the lilt of an Irish voice, Me darlin\u2019 Mickey.</p><p>Mick grimaced, pushing the memories aside. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal matter. One ye needn\u2019t worry about.\u201d</p><p>Bran frowned as Mick put away the map. \u201cThat\u2019s your own affair, but we\u2019re spending time on the Vicar and getting no money in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I\u2019m aware o\u2019 it,\u201d Mick said. \u201cIf I could end this, I would. But I\u2019m afraid the Vicar isn\u2019t such a reasonable gent as m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201d Bran\u2019s light blue eyes were young\u2014and utterly ruthless.</p><p>\u201cI would, but as ye\u2019ve pointed out, the man guards himself well.\u201d Mick tapped the table for a moment in thought, then came to a decision. \u201cWe\u2019re better off takin\u2019 the roundabout way. Cut off his grain, starve him, and run him out o\u2019 St. Giles for good. In the meantime, send some o\u2019 me men about to roust any o\u2019 his crew they find in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>Bran nodded. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Mick arched an eyebrow. The boy was still lingering though he\u2019d been given his orders. \u201cSomethin\u2019 else on yer mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this Mrs. Hollingbrook?\u201d Bran\u2019s upper lip curled. \u201cI can see keeping the child\u2014if you think she\u2019s truly yours\u2014but why insist the wench stay, as well? She\u2019s a distraction.\u201d</p><p>Mick\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cPardon me, but I wasn\u2019t aware I need explain m\u2019self to ye, lad.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s face went a fiery scarlet. A muscle beneath his right eye jumped and then he turned and left the room abruptly.</p><p>Harry had been leaning on the wall in the corner, but he stirred now. \u201cThe boy\u2019s impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he is,\u201d Mick muttered.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019s clever, is our Bran,\u201d Harry said with an air of consideration. \u201cBut a bit rash.\u201d</p><p>Mick cocked a sardonic eyebrow at Harry, waiting.</p><p>Harry straightened. \u201c \u2019E may not like Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook, but Bran does \u2019ave a bit o\u2019 a point. Are ye sure \u2019tis best to keep \u2019er \u2019ere?\u201d</p><p>Mick\u2019s reaction was immediate and gut-deep. Silence was his and he would hold her. No one was going to change that.</p><p>\u201cSecond-guessin\u2019 me, Harry?\u201d Mick asked with silky menace.</p><p>The big man flinched, but didn\u2019t back down. \u201cNow, ye know I\u2019d never do such, Mick. But, see, she\u2019s a soft thing, is Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook, though she \u2019ides it be\u2019ind a sharp tongue. She\u2019s a lady, through and through, and easily \u2019urt. Ye \u2019ad yer way with \u2019er once afore. Is it necessary like to play with \u2019er again?\u201d</p><p>Mick glanced down at the papers he\u2019d picked up. They\u2019d crumpled beneath the force of his grip. Hazel eyes weeping in the night. \u201cI find m\u2019self in a strangely good mood this evenin\u2019, Harry, otherwise ye know I\u2019d not be allowin\u2019 such questionin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, I do,\u201d Harry said earnestly.</p><p>\u201cThen ye know also that I\u2019ll be answerin\u2019 yer damned questions jus\u2019 this once,\u201d Mick said, his eyes pinning Harry. \u201cI trust ye remember the girl found upon me doorstep jus\u2019 last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d been in me palace only nights afore, though I didn\u2019t take her to me bed,\u201d Mick rasped, remembering the body of the girl. Her face had looked like it had melted off her head. Jaysus. That wouldn\u2019t happen to Silence Hollingbrook, not while he still lived. \u201cCan ye imagine what the Vicar would do to someone I might... care about?\u201d</p><p>Harry looked away uneasily. He\u2019d been the one to find the body. \u201cAye, but Mick, the Vicar don\u2019t know ye fancy \u2019er, does \u2019e?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mick felt his jaw clench at the admission. \u201cI thought the babe secret and safe as well\u2014and she wasn\u2019t, was she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry shook his head soberly.</p><p>\u201cEither he knows already or he soon will\u2014he\u2019s not stupid is the Vicar. It\u2019s very necessary that I keep Mrs. Hollingbrook here with me,\u201d Mick said softly. \u201cDo we have a problem?\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Mick nodded. \u201cAnd Harry?\u201d</p> <p>Harry, who had turned to the door, froze. \u201cAye, Mick?\u201d</p><p>Mick smiled thinly. \u201cWhatever else I might be doin\u2019 with Mrs. Hollingbrook, I\u2019m not playin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The information didn\u2019t lighten Harry\u2019s expression. He was wearing a frown on his ugly face when he left the planning room.</p><p>Mick cursed and flung himself onto a velvet settee. Months of scheming had finally born sweet, juicy fruit and yet he still had a feeling of... What? Some strange emotion, some odd sense that he hadn\u2019t truly won. Mick snorted. And what sort of pirate felt any emotion at all? He had the wench in his grasp, held fast in his own domain where he might examine her at his leisure. Find out why the little widow Hollingbrook brought such an uncommon itch to his skin, making him as restless as a caged wolf. He\u2019d forgotten the face of the lass he\u2019d bedded just the night afore, yet Silence Hollingbrook\u2019s wide hazel eyes had haunted his sleep for months.</p><p>Muttering to himself, Mick rang for his accountant, Pepper. The balding sparrow of a man came to him promptly enough and for the next hour or so Mick listened to the man drone on about ships and building materials until his head fairly ached. Yet at the end of that time, had anyone asked, Mick realized he wouldn\u2019t have been able to report what Pepper had said.</p> <p>Sighing, Mick sent the accountant away again, then washed his face and hands and headed to supper.</p><p>The dining room was a cavernous hall\u2014Mick liked to have all his people eat the evening meal together\u2014and thus the room was usually quite loud. But as Mick entered tonight, what conversation there\u2019d been quickly quieted.</p><p>He looked about. Bran was seated next to Fionnula. Pepper was across from him, a book open on his empty plate. A couple of Mick\u2019s current women tittered together in the corner, while Bert glared at them from across the way. And a dozen or so of Mick\u2019s night crew took up the far end of the long tables set end to end. To a man they were a dangerous, shifty lot\u2014and yet not a one could meet his eye. Even the sweetmeats boy, Tris, was seated behind Mick\u2019s chair, ready to serve him.</p><p>Everyone was there in fact, except Mrs. Hollingbrook.</p><p>Mick strode to Fionnula. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The girl trembled. \u201cShe said that she couldn\u2019t come down to sup.\u201d</p> <p>Mick bent and whispered softly, \u201cCouldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>The girl gulped and said bravely, \u201cWouldn\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Mick inhaled, feeling rage boil within his breast. He turned heel and left the room without a word. No one ignored his summons to supper\u2014a fact Mrs. Hollingbrook was about to learn the hard way.</p><p>SILENCE HAD JUST finished feeding Mary Darling her dinner when Mickey O\u2019Connor burst into the bedroom without so much as a knock. She glanced up, startled, and then stiffened at the grim set of his mouth.</p><p>Mary Darling frowned sternly, looking quite a bit like her sire at the moment. \u201cBad!\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor narrowed his eyes at the baby and then turned to Silence. \u201c \u2019Tis supper time\u2014or hadn\u2019t ye heard?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cYes, I\u2019d heard. Fionnula informed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t ye downstairs with everyone else, darlin\u2019?\u201d he asked much too gently.</p> <p>He stood preternaturally still, his head cocked as if listening to her breathing.</p><p>Silence found herself licking her lips nervously. She reminded herself of the promise she\u2019d made just this afternoon: she would not blindly obey this man again. Refusing to dine with Mickey O\u2019Connor might seem like a small defiance, but it was the only one she had. \u201cI prefer to eat in my room with Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those who live under me roof dine together downstairs.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin. \u201cDo they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d he said. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>His tone was so commanding that she almost did just that. Silence exhaled carefully and lifted Mary from her lap. She set the toddler on the floor and Mary immediately began exploring the room, holding on to the settee seat as she went.</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard her well enough so Silence merely folded her arms in answer. The posture also served to hide the trembling of her hands.</p><p>He stared at her a moment and there was anger on his handsome face, but there was also a kind of animal curiosity as well. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled, trying to calm the rapid beat of her heart. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to break bread with pirates. Maybe I don\u2019t want to dine with you. Maybe I simply prefer my quiet room. Does it matter? Whatever my reasons I will not obey you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stilled and she found herself holding her breath, as if waiting for an attack. He stood in front of the fire, the light limning the tight fit of his breeches on muscled legs, his hands fisted by his sides, his big shoulders bunched and ready. His face was absolutely motionless, and she thought again how beautiful he was\u2014beautiful and dangerously feral.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, Mrs. Hollingbrook,\u201d he finally drawled, \u201cthat\u2019s yer choice sure enough, but ye\u2019ll not be eatin\u2019 at all until ye grace me supper table.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in outrage. \u201cYou\u2019ll starve your own child?\u201d</p><p>He sliced the air with the blade of his palm, his rings winking in the firelight. \u201cI never said the babe won\u2019t be eatin\u2019. I\u2019ll have enough victuals sent up for her, but not yerself, me darlin\u2019. Feast on that fact, why don\u2019t ye?\u201d</p><p>And with that he stalked from the room.</p><p>Of all the absurd, autocratic commands! For a moment Silence stared at the closed door, shocked. He couldn\u2019t just order her starved, could he? Except, of course, he could. Mickey O\u2019Connor lived like some primitive king and like a king he was obeyed absolutely in his own home. Her gaze darted to the small tray that had been sent up earlier with Mary\u2019s supper. A few bits of cheese, and a bowl smeared with the remains of stewed apples still sat there. Silence could nibble on that, but Mary often decided to have a snack before bedtime. Silence would never deprive the baby of her food.</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath. Why did Mr. O\u2019Connor care anyway where she chose to dine? If he truly was surrounded by his gang and a bevy of beautiful females, he\u2019d hardly notice if she were there or not. The whole thing came down to control: Mr. O\u2019Connor wanted to have her at his supper table simply to show that he could make her do as he wished. Well, it would do such a dictatorial man good to find that he couldn\u2019t always have his way.</p><p>Besides, he wouldn\u2019t truly starve her, would he?</p><p>On that rather disquieting thought Silence finally roused herself to ready Mary for bed. Mary only fussed a little bit as her hands and face were washed and a clean chemise was pulled over her head. Halfway through their bedtime game of patty-cake Mary yawned and by the time she was settled in her little cot she was nearly asleep. Silence sat by the cot, quietly rubbing Mary\u2019s back until the little girl\u2019s knuckle crept to her mouth and her rosebud lips pursed in sleep.</p><p>Silence smiled ruefully. Mary was so angelic in sleep. One would never realize the tyrant the toddler could be when awake. And Silence had come so close to losing her today. Her breath caught on the thought and she leaned down to carefully brush a kiss against the tiny flushed cheek.</p><p>She rose then, and went to look at the tray before the fireplace. The last bits of cheese had been eaten before the game of patty-cake, but there was still a puddle of stewed apples in the bowl. Silence rubbed her stomach. She\u2019d missed luncheon in the frantic search for Mary and now her stand against Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s despotic ways seemed a bit... shortsighted.</p><p>She was reaching for the bowl when the door to the room opened. Silence snatched back her hand guiltily and whirled to find Fionnula creeping into the room.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d the maid said, gasping softly at Silence\u2019s sudden movement. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle ye, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Silence exhaled. \u201cI was just preparing for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am,\u201d the maid said shyly. \u201cI\u2019ll just tidy up, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Silence watched wistfully as Fionnula picked up the tray and brought it to the door, handing it to a servant outside.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Silence murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Fionnula replied. \u201cWill ye be needin\u2019 anythin\u2019 else tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Silence began.</p><p>But Fionnula hastily answered. \u201cOh, but I fetched ye a fresh cloth with which to refresh yerself. I knew ye\u2019d use the one here to wash the wee babe.\u201d</p><p>The maid had come closer as she said this and she now handed Silence a bundled cloth. Silence took it and immediately realized that something was hidden in the folds. Her gaze darted to Fionnula\u2019s face in question. The maid\u2019s eyes widened in warning as she glanced significantly toward the still-cracked door.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all, I\u2019ll just be biddin\u2019 ye good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Silence hastily set the bundle on a table. \u201cThank you, Fionnula.\u201d</p><p>The maid went into her own bedroom and Silence crossed to the outer door. Bert was sitting in a chair against the wall on the opposite side of the hall.</p><p>Silence nodded to him. \u201cGood night, Mr.... er, Mr. Bert.\u201d</p><p>Bert scowled, but nodded grudgingly.</p><p>Silence closed her bedroom door very firmly. Goodness! She was beginning to wonder if the guards were there to ensure her and Mary\u2019s safety or to keep them from wandering. Shaking her head, she went to the bundle on the table and carefully unwrapped it. There lying on the pristine cloth was a slice of seedcake and a bit of roasted beef. Her stomach growled at the sight. What would Mr. O\u2019Connor do if he learned of Fionnula\u2019s disobedience? Silence would have to talk to the maid tomorrow\u2014tell Fionnula that she must not risk herself on Silence\u2019s behalf. But for now...</p><p>Well, right now she was very grateful for the supper.</p><p>She ate the cake and meat and washed it down with water from a pitcher on the table by the bed. Then she bathed as best she could. She doused the candles and removed her clothes in the dark. Clad only in her chemise, she climbed into the big canopied bed.</p><p>For long moments Silence lay, staring sightlessly in the dark. This morning she\u2019d woken to a usual, chaotic day at the home. Tonight she lay cut off from all her family and friends. As she listened to the soft whisper of Mary Darling\u2019s breathing she made this vow: she would endure whatever she must for the baby\u2019s sake.</p><p>And whatever happened, she would not break under Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s rule.</p><p>MICK WOKE IN the darkest part of night, the time when men forgot their bravery of the day and wonder if their souls still lived upon this lonely earth. He stared into the blackness, listening to the breathing of the wenches in his bed, thinking about the dream that had disturbed his sleep.</p><p>Her hazel eyes had been weeping, great teardrops of sorrow and accusation, which was a damned funny thing considering she\u2019d never wept on that night over a year ago now. Why she should haunt his dreams so, he could not fathom. He\u2019d killed men, some so young they still grew only down upon their cheeks. If he were to be haunted, surely it was those ghosts, long consigned to hell, that should be drifting through his sleep.</p><p>Not the color-shifting eyes of a woman who yet lived.</p><p>She was a part of him now somehow, whether he wanted it so or not. He\u2019d not felt so close to a female since his mam\u2014his mind skidded away from the thought. The heat and the stink of sex from the girls on either side of him suddenly made his stomach turn. Mick rose silently, padding on bare feet to pull on a pair of breeches. He left his room and stole through the darkened corridors of his palace until he reached Silence\u2019s door. Harry watched as Mick approached, though the guard didn\u2019t say a word. Carefully Mick turned the door handle. The door opened without squeaking for he\u2019d ordered the hinges oiled well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her room was smaller than his, but somehow the air seemed fresher, less close. He could hear the sound of the child\u2019s heavy breathing in sleep and softer, slower, the woman\u2019s. He went to stand next to the bed and even though the room was unlit, he could make out, faintly, her slight form beneath the covers. The sight somehow calmed his soul. She lay in his bed, in his house, and no matter what bargain she thought she\u2019d made with him, he knew the truth.</p><p>He had no plans to let her go\u2014ever.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The king roared with royal rage and called his three nephews.</p> <p>\u201cWhomever of you can find this nighttime thief shall be my heir!\u201d cried the king.</p><p>Well the nephews all looked at each other and then they each gathered weapons and settled themselves beneath the cherry tree to wait for night and the thief....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Silence\u2019s third meal of the day came just after two of the clock the next afternoon and from a quite unexpected source.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s the word, mind,\u201d Bert said gruffly, laying his finger aside of his nose.</p> <p>Silence didn\u2019t even have time to thank the guard before he hurriedly stomped from the room.</p><p>She blinked, rather bemused at the bounty she\u2019d received from Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s servants. She\u2019d never thought that the pirate\u2019s own people would defy him to bring her food. Uneasily she wondered what Mr. O\u2019Connor would do if he found out about the underground rebellion against his orders not to feed her.</p><p>Shaking her head, she opened the rather grimy handkerchief Bert had thrust into her hands and contemplated the contents: three walnuts, a crumbled bit of pigeon pie, and a smashed cake with pink icing. Earlier she\u2019d been given a slice of gammon and a muffin from Fionnula, and a scandalously out of season plum and a duck\u2019s wing from Harry.</p><p>The outer door to the room began to open and Silence hastily shoved the kerchief and its contents beneath a pillow on the bed. She turned, half-expecting to see the pirate himself, but it was a younger man who faced her. He was quite good-looking\u2014nearly as handsome as Mickey O\u2019Connor, but much more solemn, a bit shorter and only about twenty years old, if that.</p><p>The young man looked startled to see her as well. \u201cAh... er, I was looking for Fionnula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Silence said. \u201cYou must be her friend.\u201d</p> <p>He blushed at her blurted words and looked suddenly even younger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Hollingbrook,\u201d she said to set him at ease. \u201cFionnula has gone down to fetch some hot water for Mary Darling\u2019s bath.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly. \u201cI\u2019ll just be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Silence said. He really did seem ill at ease. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t overly used to talking to outsiders? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d He blinked, glancing past her. \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he darted around Silence and scooped Mary Darling up. \u201cMind the hearth, lass. \u2019Tisn\u2019t safe for pretty little fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Silence hadn\u2019t noticed Mary near the fire, but the toddler had been quite inquisitive this afternoon. Mary had soon bored of remaining in one room and had been fretful and restless since noon.</p><p>Silence looked at the young man gratefully. \u201cThank you, er...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBran,\u201d he said, smiling down at Mary Darling. \u201cBran Kavanagh.\u201d The little girl usually protested mightily at strangers, but she seemed charmed by Bran, looking curiously into his face.</p><p>Silence had to admit that when he smiled he was quite dashing. \u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He fished a bit of string from his pocket and tied it in a loop before deftly threading it through his fingers and showing Mary the resulting cat\u2019s cradle. \u201cThe little ones often do. My mother had a dozen children and I looked after the ones younger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Irish?\u201d His accent wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as Fionnula\u2019s or Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s.</p><p>He glanced up warily, a lock of auburn hair falling over his forehead. \u201cBred and born right here in London, but, aye, both my mother and my father were from Ireland. Father was a weaver in Spitalfields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened\u2014\u201d Silence started, but Fionnula came in the room carrying a kettle of steaming water at that moment.</p><p>The maid stopped short on sight of Bran, her face lighting up. \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just came to tell you I\u2019d be gone tonight.\u201d Bran set Mary gently down by the settee and gave her the loop of string. \u201cI thought you might want to know.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula knit her eyebrows, looking worried. \u201cIs it the Vicar again?\u201d</p><p>Bran frowned, darting a glance at Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat vicar?\u201d Silence asked, looking between the two. \u201cYou have pirate business with a man of the cloth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Bran said hastily. \u201cThe Vicar of Whitechapel isn\u2019t part of any church. He\u2019s a gin maker and he\u2019s...\u201d Bran paused as if trying to find the word that wouldn\u2019t offend Silence\u2019s delicate ears.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s evil,\u201d Fionnula said. She crossed herself. \u201cPure evil.\u201d</p><p>Silence shivered at the solemn dread in Fionnula\u2019s voice and glanced at Mary, happily playing on the settee. \u201cHe\u2019s Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s enemy, isn\u2019t he? One of the people Mr. O\u2019Connor thinks might hurt Mary.\u201d</p><p>Bran didn\u2019t reply, but his grim glance at Mary was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d best be off, then,\u201d Fionnula said softly.</p><p>He nodded and left without further comment.</p><p>Silence blew out a breath and bent to pick up Mary. There had been a tiny, niggling suspicion at the back of her mind that Mr. O\u2019Connor had made up all his talk of enemies who might hurt Mary. Perhaps he was playing some game of his own and simply wanted her and Mary in his palace for reasons she couldn\u2019t comprehend. That small suspicion was now laid to rest. The fear in Fionnula\u2019s face had been too genuine, Bran\u2019s voice too sure as he spoke of the Vicar. Whoever he was, the Vicar\u2014and the danger he posed\u2014would seem to be quite real.</p><p>Well, Mickey O\u2019Connor might be an overbearing pirate, but they were safe enough in his palace. Silence sighed and began undressing Mary Darling for her bath, her thoughts turning to another matter. \u201cBran seemed quite nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The maid was blushing still as she carefully poured the hot water into a basin and tested it with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cAnd quite handsome,\u201d Silence said carelessly.</p><p>Fionnula jerked and some of the water splashed on the floor. She stared at the puddle and then raised worried eyes to Silence. \u201cHe\u2019s too pretty for me, \u2019tisn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Silence blinked. She\u2019d meant to tease, not hurt. \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is,\u201d Fionnula said dismally. \u201cHis eyes are so blue and he has such a handsome face. I see other girls lookin\u2019 at him and I just want to tear their hair out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he look back?\u201d Silence asked as she placed Mary into the shallow bath.</p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d Fionnula drew out the word as if unsure.</p><p>\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d Silence said as she began to sponge Mary\u2019s little back. Mary was still busy with her string, dipping it into the water and draping it over her tummy. \u201cI\u2019m sure he finds you quite pretty.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula nibbled her lower lip as if unsure, then brightened. She took a bundle from her apron pocket.</p><p>\u201cI got some more victuals for ye, ma\u2019am,\u201d she whispered as she handed the bundle over.</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d Silence said brightly as she unwrapped her fourth meal\u2014either her third luncheon or perhaps an early supper? It was hard to tell. At this rate she might actually grow plump while on Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s starvation diet.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Mickey O\u2019Connor was entirely oblivious to his people smuggling her food against his express command. She shivered at the thought.</p><p>What was the pirate\u2019s punishment for mutiny?</p><p>WINTER MAKEPEACE WOKE the next morning with a groan at his aching muscles. His room was still dark\u2014the new day wouldn\u2019t dawn for another hour or more\u2014yet he knew it was exactly half past five of the clock, for that was the time at which he\u2019d trained his body to wake. He sat up in his narrow cot, feeling the twinge of thighs and buttocks, the result of spending all yesterday riding a horse.</p><p>Since he lived in the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children and the day school where he taught small and not very disciplined boys was only a stone\u2019s throw away, he had no need to ride a horse usually. However, his trip to Oxford had necessitated the renting of a nag. He rubbed his legs for a half minute or so and then stood, pushing the aches from his mind. They were of no consequence and would fade soon enough.</p><p>He had to duck his head as he bent over the washbasin to sluice his face. His room was under the eaves and the roof sloped sharply. But months of living in the cramped space had accustomed him to the irregularities of the room, so now he could move about without knocking his head on a beam, even in the dark.</p><p>Winter dressed in white shirt, black waistcoat, black breeches, and black coat and threw open his attic window to toss the wastewater from his ablutions into the alley below. The sky was turning a pinkish gray, silhouetting the haphazard rooftops of St. Giles. He gazed at it only a moment before shutting the window firmly and lighting a candle. For the next hour he worked steadily at a narrow desk, writing and reading. Some of his work was in preparation for the day\u2019s lessons, but he also was in correspondence with scholars of philosophy and religion both in England and on the continent. In fact, his recent trip to Oxford had been to call upon an old acquaintance\u2014an elderly philosopher who was on his deathbed.</p><p>When the sky had fully brightened, Winter stood and stretched before pinching the candle out. Picking up the pitcher, he locked his bedroom carefully behind him and paused for a moment to glance at his sister, Silence\u2019s, bedroom door. No light shone beneath it. She was probably still abed. He contemplated waking her, then decided against it. Silence could use the extra minutes of rest.</p><p>He clattered down the stairs, nearly running into a small boy lurking rather suspiciously on one of the turns.</p><p>Winter grabbed him by the collar\u2014he\u2019d learned early in his career of teaching young hellions that it was best to catch and then ask. \u201cWhy are you not at breakfast with the other boys, Joseph Tinbox?\u201d</p><p>Joseph, his freckled face cowled by the jacket Winter held, rolled his eyes up at him. \u201cI was jus\u2019 now goin\u2019 down, Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Winter inquired skeptically. He set down the pitcher and made a lightning fast snatch at the object Joseph had been attempting to hide behind his back. \u201cAnd what plans did you have for this sling?\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s eyes widened in what was a very good imitation of innocence at the leather strap dangling before his eyes. \u201cI found it on the stairs, truly I did.\u201d</p><p>Winter cocked his eyebrow, staring at the boy.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s gaze slid away from his own.</p><p>\u201cJoseph,\u201d Winter said quietly. \u201cYou know that I do not condone lying in this house. A man\u2019s word is a treasure he holds within himself no matter how poor his outer garments. To squander it recklessly is the mark of not only a fool, but a cheat as well. Now tell me. Is this sling yours?\u201d</p><p>The boy swallowed, his small throat working. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am displeased to hear that you\u2019ve been playing with a sling,\u201d Winter said calmly. \u201cBut pleased that you have spoken the truth to me. As punishment for the former, I would like you to sweep out the kitchen hearth and scrub clean the outer tiles around the fireplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d Joseph began, but gulped back his groan at a look from Winter. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Winter let him go, pocketed the sling, picked up the pitcher, and gestured for the boy to precede him down the stairs.</p><p>They descended in silence, but as they made the bottom step, Joseph hesitated.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Winter glanced at Joseph. He was shifting his weight from one foot to the other.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes, Joseph,\u201d Winter said gently. \u201cIt is how one acts afterward that distinguishes the righteous man from the dishonest one.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s brow crinkled as he contemplated that statement. Then it cleared. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The boy walked into the kitchen, his habitual jaunty step nearly restored.</p><p>Winter felt his lips twitch in amusement as he followed. This was not the first such talk he\u2019d had with Joseph, and he did not expect it would be the last, but at heart the boy was a good lad.</p> <p>The home\u2019s kitchen was bright and loud with the chatter of children. Two long tables took up the center of the crowded room, one for the boys, one for the girls. Joseph Tinbox went to the boys\u2019 table and hopped onto one of the long benches.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Makepeace,\u201d Alice, one of the home\u2019s maids said, pausing as she hurried by.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, Alice,\u201d Winter said, handing her the pitcher.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, sir, for saving me the trip upstairs.\u201d Alice flashed a smile that lit up her rather careworn face before rushing to catch a spilled cup of milk.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Nell Jones, the head maidservant at the home, raised her voice above the cacophony. \u201cPlease bid Mr. Makepeace good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Makepeace!\u201d a ragged chorus immediately responded.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, children,\u201d Winter said as he sat on a bench.</p><p>Nell hurried over with a bowl of porridge and a teapot.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Winter murmured as he sipped the scalding tea. He glanced across the table to a small dark-haired boy sleepily picking his nose. \u201cDid you sleep well, Henry Putman?\u201d</p><p>All the boys at the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children were christened Joseph and all the girls Mary\u2014except for Henry Putman. When Henry had come to the home\u2014at the advanced age of four\u2014he had urgently argued to keep his own name. And since unlike most of the orphans he\u2019d been old enough to speak, his wish had been granted.</p><p>At Winter\u2019s greeting, Henry hastily dropped his hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The older boy sitting next to Henry elbowed him.</p><p>Henry glanced at the older boy in outrage.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d hissed the older boy.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Henry exclaimed. \u201cYes, sir. I slept good. \u2019Cept for a dream.\u201d</p><p>Winter, well aware that the subject of children\u2019s dreams could take up most of breakfast, only murmured an, \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>But Henry had found his voice. \u201c \u2019Bout frogs, it was. Big frogs. Big as cows.\u201d</p><p>Henry spread wide his arms to demonstrate the size of the mythical frogs, nearly upsetting his neighbor\u2019s bowl of porridge.</p><p>Winter caught the bowl with the ease of long practice.</p><p>The older boy had other concerns. \u201cFrogs can\u2019t grow that big. Everyone knows that!\u201d</p><p>Winter addressed the elder boy mildly. \u201cJoseph Smith, perhaps you can inform Henry of your thoughts regarding the relative size of dream frogs in a more polite manner.\u201d</p><p>For a moment both boys were silent as they worked through his statement and Winter was able to take a bite of his porridge in near peace.</p><p>Then Joseph Smith said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe frogs grow as big as cows.\u201d</p><p>To which Henry Putman replied, \u201cThey do in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>Which seemed to settle the matter.</p><p>A sudden squeal made Winter glance at the girls\u2019 table and he noticed that Silence still hadn\u2019t come down for breakfast. He caught Nell Jones\u2019s eye and motioned her over.</p><p>\u201cI believe it may be time to wake my sister.\u201d</p><p>Nell\u2019s blue eyes shifted down and away and Winter felt a vague sense of unease. \u201cUm, well, as to that sir...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he prompted when the maidservant seemed to have trouble finding her words.</p><p>Nell screwed tight her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Winter blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hollingbrook left the home the day before yesterday,\u201d Nell said rapidly as if to get a nasty task over as quickly as possible. \u201cAnd Mary Darling is with her.\u201d</p><p>The children had begun to quiet, sensing with the animal instinct of the young when danger or excitement was around.</p><p>\u201cWhere,\u201d Winter asked very softly, \u201cis my sister?\u201d</p><p>Nell gulped. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to live at Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s palace.\u201d</p><p>SILENCE HAD JUST finished feeding Mary Darling a small bowl of porridge that morning when she heard the faint sounds of male shouting. Fionnula glanced up. Silence paused, a spoonful of the last scrapings from the bowl still held outstretched toward Mary. The toddler had lost interest in her breakfast and was busy fingering the sticky bowl, studiously ignoring the spoon.</p><p>Silence tapped her on the shoulder. \u201cMary, finish your porridge.\u201d</p><p>The shouts rose again, one of them sounding familiar.</p><p>A chill went through Silence. She dropped the spoon and ran to the door.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, ye can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Fionnula called behind her as Silence yanked open the door.</p><p>The scowling face of Bert met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWho is below?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He opened his mouth, but she was already shoving past him.</p><p>\u201cOi!\u201d Bert yelled in indignation.</p><p>Silence ran down the stairs, fearful of the quiet below. What had they done with him?</p><p>She made the lower hall, skidded through the doors, and ran into a large male back, blocking her way.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d she muttered, trying to dodge around Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s form. She just caught sight of Winter\u2014standing very still in the middle of a pack of pirates\u2014then Mr. O\u2019Connor hauled her back against his chest and set his hands on her waist to hold her.</p><p>Silence inhaled sharply at his touch. The exotic scent of frankincense surrounded her. She hadn\u2019t seen him since their argument the night before last over supper and already she seemed to have forgotten the intensity of his presence.</p><p>Winter\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cUnhand my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEager as I am to bow to yer smallest command, Mr. Makepeace,\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor drawled above her, his chest rumbling against her back, \u201cI can\u2019t in all good conscience do so when the lady herself hasn\u2019t asked me.\u201d</p><p>Winter looked at her. \u201cSilence?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Winter looked like thunder. He stood clad in his habitual somber clothes, his empty hands fisted by his side, a round, black hat on his head. Like all her brothers he preferred his dark brown hair undressed and tied back simply. The armed pirates circling him were almost comically more dangerous looking. Yet somehow he\u2019d made it past the front door and this far into Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s well-guarded palace.</p><p>Perhaps it was a measure of Winter\u2019s quiet authority that the pirates hadn\u2019t stopped him.</p><p>Silence turned within the circle of Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s arms and looked up into his face. He was so close she could see each individual inky eyelash and notice the tiny wrinkles fanning from the corners of his deep brown eyes. \u201cLet me talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Those perceptive eyes narrowed at her\u2014the pirate didn\u2019t look at all happy.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAs ye wish.\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor spread wide his arms and looked over her head. \u201cFive minutes, Mr. Makepeace. No longer. Ye can talk to yer lovely sister in me library.\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor has a library? For a second, Silence was distracted by the thought of this outrageously virile man bent studiously over dusty books.</p><p>The image was dashed the moment they were shown into the library, however. Naturally Mr. O\u2019Connor would have a library like no other she\u2019d ever imagined. It was a middling-sized room, but from the carved rosewood ceiling overhead to the thick Persian carpet underfoot, the entire place was fantastic. Ancient statuary stood about the room, no doubt plundered from ships. Here there was a Diana in flight, her hunting hounds bounding beside her. There a bust of some ancient bearded dignitary. And the books! Every surface held open books, each one fabulously illustrated. From a folio of exotic animals to a tiny prayer book, delicately illuminated in gold.</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Silence breathed in awe, looking around the exquisite room. \u201cHave you ever seen such a wonderful place, Winter?\u201d She frowned. \u201cThough it could do with some comfortable chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment I\u2019m a bit more interested in you than in the room, sister,\u201d Winter said drily.</p><p>Silence flushed and looked at her brother. His straight brown brows were drawn together in worry.</p><p>She inhaled and smoothed a hand down the apron she\u2019d put on this morning out of habit\u2014only now did she notice that it was a bit crooked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have left the home so abruptly. I know it must have distressed you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistressed.\u201d Winter said the word flatly.</p><p>Silence bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cAre you being held here against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not a man given to hysteria. If I were, I\u2019d be bald at this moment from having torn out my hair on the way over here. Mickey O\u2019Connor, Silence?\u201d</p><p>His last three words were soft, but there was a wealth of meaning behind them. Winter had seen her after she\u2019d left Mr. O\u2019Connor the last time. He knew what had been done to her.</p><p>And he suspected much worse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Mary Darling\u2019s father,\u201d she said.</p><p>His eyebrows lifted in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cHe says that Mary must stay here because she is in danger from his enemies. But he has let me stay as well, to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Winter closed his eyes briefly and when he opened them again they were filled with sorrow. \u201cIf the child is truly his, then you have no hold on her. You must give her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She swallowed and lowered her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Mr. O\u2019Connor has promised to let me have Mary Darling\u2014let me have her forever\u2014once his enemies are no longer a threat. Don\u2019t you see? I can take her away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather trust the word of a snake than Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward and gently touched her on the elbow. \u201cHe\u2019s using you, sister. Perhaps he only sees you as an amusement, perhaps his plan is far worse, but in either case you can be sure of one thing: Mickey O\u2019Connor is interested only in pleasing himself. He cares for neither you nor Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for me to stay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love Mary, Winter. She\u2019s as much a daughter to me as if I\u2019d given birth to her. I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave her here by herself even if I had no hope of eventually bringing her home. But since I do... Well, then, it\u2019s only a matter of hanging on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reputation will be in tatters if you stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reputation already is in tatters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of him.\u201d Winter rarely raised his voice, rarely showed emotion of any kind, but he spat the word \u201chim\u201d with deep loathing.</p><p>Silence\u2019s eyes widened. She knew Winter disliked Mr. O\u2019Connor, but she\u2019d had no idea of the antipathy her brother held toward the pirate.</p><p>\u201cWinter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll destroy you and he\u2019ll destroy the home because of you.\u201d Winter\u2019s words were tight and controlled. \u201cWe cannot afford speculation about your virtue right now, sister. Think of the home if you will not think of yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed her eyes, feeling sick. She was letting him down, betraying his trust, but... \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly sorry about the home, but it\u2019s Mary Darling, Winter. Please. She\u2019s all that I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Her brother turned and walked to a bookshelf, staring blindly at the rows of expensive embossed leather spines.</p><p>For a moment there was quiet in the library.</p><p>Silence bit her lip, watching her brother. Waiting to see if she\u2019d broken his trust irrevocably. Winter was the youngest of her brothers, the one closest to her in age\u2014and closest to her heart.</p> <p>If she hadn\u2019t been studying him she might not have seen his shoulders lower a fraction of an inch. \u201cI know what Mary Darling means to you, sister. I\u2019ve witnessed your grief and the renewal of your inner joy this last year. Much of it was due to the baby. If this is the only way to keep Mary Darling, then stay.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, opening her mouth to thank him.</p><p>Winter swung suddenly to look at her and she saw that his normally calm eyes blazed. \u201cBut I saw what Mickey O\u2019Connor did to you. I saw the damage in your eyes. I cannot stop you from this mad plan, but do not expect me to dance with joy at the prospect of you in Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s foul hands.\u201d</p><p>Behind them a single clap shattered the intimacy of the library.</p><p>Silence swung around.</p> <p>Mickey O\u2019Connor lounged in a narrow doorway cleverly hidden in the carved paneling. \u201cI appreciate yer stamp o\u2019 approval, Makepeace. It warms the cockles o\u2019 me heart, it does.\u201d</p><p>Winter had gone very still next to Silence and for some reason she had the feeling he was holding himself in check, keeping himself from violence only by the thinnest of threads. Silly, really. Winter was the least violent man she knew.</p><p>But she placed a restraining hand on his arm anyway. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do as you wish,\u201d Winter said to her, though his gaze never left Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m leaving today, but next time I come I\u2019ll take you with me. Until then, if you feel yourself in peril at any time, send word to me and I will come for you\u2014night or day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Winter,\u201d she said meekly, realizing that her brother needed to feel that he had some control over the matter.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s black eyes slid to hers mockingly.</p> <p>Fortunately, Winter didn\u2019t seem to see the look. He bent to kiss Silence on the cheek, murmuring as he straightened, \u201cRemember: any time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak because of the lump that suddenly clogged her throat. She\u2019d known that Winter was fond of her, but his actions today had spoken of real brotherly love: he\u2019d stormed Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s palace by himself for her. She\u2019d never realized that he loved her so, and suddenly she felt the paradoxical loss of something she\u2019d not known she\u2019d had before now. He was leaving her here\u2014only because she asked it of him. Only because he truly loved her.</p><p>\u201cMe men will be showin\u2019 ye out, Makepeace,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cJus\u2019 to make sure ye don\u2019t get lost \u2019tween here and me front door.\u201d</p><p>Winter glanced at the pirate and for a moment Silence held her breath as the men exchanged some kind of unspoken communication.</p><p>Then Winter turned and left the room.</p><p>Silence glared at Mickey O\u2019Connor. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to goad him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d The pirate straightened away from the doorway, ambling closer to her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Silence frowned at him. \u201cWe\u2019ve already made our bargain and I have no intention of reneging on it. Winter has only my best interests at heart. By goading him, you could\u2019ve started a rather nasty argument.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cBut see, me darlin\u2019, that\u2019s where ye and I must disagree. Yer brother is a hard man. Had I not stood upon me principles, he\u2019d\u2019ve had ye out o\u2019 here before ye could blink.\u201d</p><p>Winter a hard man? What a very strange notion. Silence shook her head. Men could be very odd at times. She watched as Mr. O\u2019Connor brushed his fingers idly over a huge volume of colored maps, his many rings flashing.</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve guessed you had a room such as this,\u201d she said.</p><p>His black eyebrows winged up his forehead in cynical amusement. \u201cYer sayin\u2019 these things are too refined for a crude pirate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she exclaimed, although of course that had been what she meant. \u201cI... I just thought...\u201d</p><p>Her voice faded as she watched him trail a long finger over the tip of Diana\u2019s nude breast.</p><p>He turned and caught her staring. \u201cAye, Mrs. Hollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>Her face was aflame, but she met his gaze. Winter hadn\u2019t backed down from this man and neither would she. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for a room such as this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to put her thoughts into words. \u201cYour throne room is outrageously ostentatious, but you let others see it. It\u2019s almost a public place because you receive visitors there. The ostentation has a purpose. You intimidate with it. But this library...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for it because you don\u2019t use it to impress others.\u201d</p><p>His head was cocked as he stared at her curiously. \u201cWhat a very interestin\u2019 women ye are, Mrs. Hollingbrook. If I don\u2019t use me library to impress, then what do I use it for, if ye don\u2019t mind me askin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I wondered,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy have this library?\u201d</p><p>The stark question seemed to catch him by surprise. He watched her a moment, hesitating, then seemed to come to a decision. He crossed to where another big book lay. Silence followed curiously, looking over his elbow as he opened the book.</p><p>An emerald beetle was revealed, perched on the stem of some exotic plant. The color was so startling, so vivid, the insect looked ready to crawl off the page.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor traced the edges of the page lightly. \u201cOne night maybe eight years or so ago, I found a book like this one in a chest taken off a ship comin\u2019 from the West Indies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you stole it,\u201d Silence said severely.</p><p>Mickey grinned at her, flashing strong white teeth. \u201cBelonged to one o\u2019 them plantation owners over there, I hear. Man who owned hundreds o\u2019 slaves laborin\u2019 to grow his sugar and make him his fortune. Aye, I stole from one such as he, and not a night\u2019s sleep have I ever lost over it.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked back down at the illustrated book. She certainly didn\u2019t approve of thieving, but then again she didn\u2019t approve of the trade of human beings, either. \u201cYou said you, uh, found a book like this one eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, returning his own gaze to the emerald beetle. \u201cFound it, and opened it, and was amazed. I\u2019d never seen such, ye understand. It was filled with pictures o\u2019 butterflies. Butterflies aren\u2019t exactly plentiful in the parts o\u2019 London I grew up in, and butterflies such as these\u201d\u2014his elegant fingers caressed the page as if remembering\u2014\u201cwell, it almost makes a man believe in God, it does.\u201d</p><p>Silence swallowed. She\u2019d been raised in London as well, but there had been trips to parks and outings to Greenwich and other towns. She\u2019d seen butterflies and more\u2014tame deer, wild birds, lovely gardens, and flowers. What kind of boyhood had he had never to have seen a butterfly?</p><p>\u201cWhere were you raised in London?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cSt. Giles,\u201d he said, still tracing the gilt pages. \u201cNot more\u2019n a stone\u2019s throw from here.\u201d</p><p>She tried to picture him as a boy. He\u2019d have been beautiful, of course, lean and graceful. The thought made her uneasy. Beautiful youths didn\u2019t last long in St. Giles. \u201cYou lived with your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe mam... and him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the emphasis on the last word. Was he talking about his father\u2014or another man? She glanced at him, but ended up asking the easier question. \u201cDo your parents still live in St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an ironic look and closed the big picture book. Obviously he had no intention of answering her.</p><p>Irritating man. She looked around the little library. \u201cWhich book is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She gestured to the overflowing bookshelves. \u201cWhere is your butterfly book?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t keep it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a curious thing ye are.\u201d He turned to place the book on a shelf.</p><p>She inhaled, feeling frustrated. \u201cWhat is it you want from me?\u201d</p><p>When he turned, his face had gone blank. \u201cWhat makes ye think I want anythin\u2019 from ye, me darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to let him slide away from this question. She took a step closer and he made a movement almost as if he would retreat from her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give Mary Darling to me. Didn\u2019t have to involve me in your life at all. What is it you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away from her, a muscle clenching in his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m protectin\u2019 ye and the babe, nothin\u2019 more. All ye have to do is stay in yer rooms and be content.\u201d</p><p>Stay in her rooms? Be content? Silence\u2019s eyes widened incredulously. \u201cDo I look like a doll to you?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids lowered, his beautiful black lashes sweeping his cheeks before he glanced back up at her again. \u201cNay, yer a lovely woman, ye are. I\u2019d not be mistakin\u2019 ye for any playthin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted at his intimate tone.</p><p>His sensuous mouth curved at her confusion. \u201cSupper\u2019s early tonight\u2014seven o\u2019 the clock, mind. I trust we\u2019ll be graced with yer lovely presence.\u201d</p><p>Silence stiffened. He wouldn\u2019t catch her off guard so easily. \u201cOn the contrary, I have no intention of dining with you, Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>The smile was abruptly gone from his face, leaving it rather frighteningly grim. \u201cThen ye\u2019ll fast in yer rooms, me darlin\u2019, until ye can see fit to change yer mind.\u201d</p><p>And with that he pivoted and strode from the room.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>But a very strange thing happened. As dusk fell in the king\u2019s garden, all three of the nephews began to nod and soon they all slept. In the morning they woke and none of the three could remember a thing. The nephews had to confess rather sheepishly to the king that they had not caught the thief. But when Clever John ran his hand through his hair, a bright green feather fell to the ground....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>\u201cBut ye can\u2019t!\u201d Fionnula hissed early the next morning.</p><p>\u201cWho says so?\u201d Silence asked stubbornly as she took a quick look up and down the hall outside her room. Harry was eating breakfast and she\u2019d just sent Bert to call a servant. She only had a minute at most while the guards were occupied.</p><p>\u201cHimself, that\u2019s who,\u201d Fionnula cried in a muted wail. \u201cHe\u2019s given orders that yer not to leave the rooms until ye consent to dine with him.\u201d</p><p>Silence snorted softly. \u201cMickey O\u2019Connor is not my master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mayn\u2019t be,\u201d Fionnula said, \u201cbut he\u2019s used to bein\u2019 obeyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Mr. O\u2019Connor is in for a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Silence slipped from the room with Mary Darling in her arms and ran lightly toward the back of the hallway\u2014away from the stairs where Bert had gone. She stopped at the corner to catch her breath before continuing more sedately.</p><p>A touch at her shoulder nearly made her scream.</p><p>\u201cWhere are ye plannin\u2019 on goin\u2019?\u201d Fionnula whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Silence admitted, \u201cbut Mary needs new surroundings to explore. Perhaps a sitting room?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula looked doubtful. \u201cI don\u2019t think Himself spends much time sittin\u2019. He\u2019s not exactly gentry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe library, then. That\u2019s below us.\u201d Silence looked worriedly at Fionnula. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get you into trouble. Perhaps I ought to tie you up? We can say I\u2019ve overpowered you.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula rolled her eyes. \u201cAs if anyone would believe that.\u201d</p><p>Behind them came a noise like an enraged bull. \u201cOi!\u201d Bert had discovered her absence.</p><p>Silence couldn\u2019t restrain a start, but at least she didn\u2019t break stride.</p> <p>Mary bounced in her arms, looking over Silence\u2019s shoulder. \u201c \u2019Ert!\u201d</p><p>They reached the stairwell just as Bert caught up with them.</p><p>\u201cNow see \u2019ere,\u201d the guard panted. \u201cWhere d\u2019ye think yer goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the library,\u201d Silence said airily as she started down the stairs.</p><p>Bert scoffed. \u201cRight next to \u2019Imself\u2019s plannin\u2019 room, that is. Ye\u2019ll not get two steps past the stairwell.\u201d</p> <p>The news made Silence\u2019s pulse race. She was already at the landing, but she didn\u2019t stop, sailing through the doorway and into the lower corridor. Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor might discover her disobedience\u2014she was counting on it, in fact\u2014but that wouldn\u2019t detain her. It was important that she assert her rights, her will to not be treated like some pawn at the beck and call to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s whims. In fact\u2014</p><p>Hard hands caught her waist and Silence couldn\u2019t help a squeak of surprise and alarm. She was lifted quite off her feet with Mary Darling still clutched to her breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Mrs. Hollingbrook doin\u2019 out o\u2019 her rooms?\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s voice rumbled behind her, far too calmly.</p><p>Silence craned her neck and saw that the pirate held her at arm\u2019s length, his face quite expressionless. She gulped and faced forward again, only to see Fionnula frozen while Bert opened and closed his mouth like a landed fish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame Bert or Fionnula,\u201d Silence blurted out. \u201cThis is my fault\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought otherwise,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor snapped. \u201cTake the babe.\u201d</p> <p>Fionnula darted forward, eyes wide and before Silence could protest Mary was in the maidservant\u2019s arms.</p><p>Silence frowned. \u201cNow see here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d the pirate whispered, and somehow his lowered voice was even more frightening than a shout.</p><p>He swung her and suddenly Silence found herself on her stomach over Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s shoulder\u2014a most ignominious position\u2014one broad hand clamped firmly over her bottom to hold her in place.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she said with as much dignity as possible, considering that all the blood was rushing to her head.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to reply. Instead, he simply turned and strode down the hall.</p><p>\u201cMr. O\u2019Connor!\u201d Silence found she had no choice but to brace her hands on his hips if she didn\u2019t want her nose to bounce off his extremely firm rear end.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply as he mounted the stairs\u2014seemingly without effort despite steadying her weight with only one arm\u2014but Silence thought she might have heard him muttering to himself under his breath.</p> <p>Or possibly cursing.</p><p>She gulped. She\u2019d defied him outright this time\u2014and humiliated him in front of his man and Fionnula to boot. There was a very real possibility that his ire might take a physical form. But she\u2019d made up her mind not to bend to his will and she\u2019d stick to her guns\u2014no matter the cost.</p><p>So it was with a feeling of both defiance and trepidation that Silence found herself tossed on the bed minutes later. She bounced on the soft mattress, struggling to push her hair out of her hot face. She must present a firm but calm countenance to the pirate.</p><p>Still she couldn\u2019t help gulping when at last she looked up.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor loomed over her, arms crossed, feet braced wide apart. \u201cWhat in the name o\u2019 all that\u2019s holy did ye think ye were doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin. \u201cGoing for a walk.\u201d</p><p>He bent, thrusting his handsome face into hers. \u201cWhen I gave ye orders to stay in yer rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She licked her bottom lip.</p><p>For a moment his gaze dropped to her mouth before snapping back up to meet her eyes. \u201cNo one disobeys me in me own home!\u201d</p><p>For a moment she wasn\u2019t sure she could speak. He was crowded into her, his very breath hot upon her cheek. He was so much bigger than she. So much more physically powerful.</p><p>But she had determination. \u201cEvidently someone does now.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and for a moment all she could do was hold her breath.</p><p>Then he abruptly straightened and stomped to her door. He wrenched it open and glared at her. \u201cStay in this fuckin\u2019 room or I swear ye\u2019ll be regrettin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>The walls shook as he slammed the door.</p><p>Silence exhaled and flopped back on the bed. She felt as if she\u2019d weathered a thunderstorm, but one thought rang gleefully in her mind:</p><p>She, Silence Hollingbrook, meek widow of no particular means, had just faced down Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, the most feared pirate in London.</p><p>SUCH A STUBBORN little thing she was! Mick stalked along the corridor to the stairs. When he came to a rag and bucket, carelessly left by a maid, he kicked it over. The clatter of the falling bucket was gratifying, but didn\u2019t tame his foul mood. Why wouldn\u2019t she sit meekly in her rooms? Why wouldn\u2019t she fucking obey him? He hadn\u2019t a bloody clue what he would do if she defied him again. The thought of giving her any sort of pain was simply out of the question and if he couldn\u2019t physically punish her...</p><p>Mick stopped at the bottom of the stairs and glared sightlessly at a tiny picture on the wall. It was an ancient Madonna and child, their halos layered in gold, Mary\u2019s face was pinched and disapproving and an odd shade of green. The widow had been in his home a mere two days and already she was overthrowing his orderly life.</p><p>There was the sound of a throat clearing behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell is it, Harry?\u201d Mick growled without turning.</p><p>\u201cAh, beggin\u2019 yer pardon, sir, but Bert is upset that Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook got past \u2019im and I was thinkin\u2019\u2014\u201c</p><p>Mick shook his head once. \u201cI\u2019m not discussin\u2019 her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anythin\u2019 else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran was wantin\u2019 to know when ye\u2019ll be talkin\u2019 to the owner of the Alexander.\u201d</p><p>Mick turned at that. \u201cAfter me supper, but afore midnight. Let the man get sleepy in his great house a-thinkin\u2019 Mick O\u2019Connor has forgotten that he didn\u2019t pay tithe on his last bloody ship.\u201d</p><p>Harry pursed his lips. \u201cSleepy or not, \u2019e\u2019d be a great fool not to be well guarded in \u2019is own \u2019ome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Mick started down the corridor. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019ll be bringin\u2019 Pat and Sean as well as Bran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink that\u2019ll be enough?\u201d Harry hurried to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cAye. We\u2019ll be a-waitin\u2019 in his room for him when he goes to bed.\u201d Mick reached his rooms and flung open the door. \u201cThe shock of seein\u2019 four armed men in his bedroom will, I think, be enough to soften him up right finely.\u201d</p><p>Mick stopped dead in the middle of his bedroom. His bed was a huge piece of furniture with posts as big around as a man\u2019s thighs. He\u2019d slept comfortably there with two other bedmates\u2014and had he wished, could\u2019ve fit another three. The bed was so massive it usually dwarfed whoever occupied it. But not the big dog draped over both his pillows. The animal lay with its pale belly exposed, forepaws up in the air, its great head turned to the side, jaws agape and tongue lolling.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Mick said softly, \u201cis Lad doin\u2019 in me bed?\u201d</p><p>Hearing his name, Lad opened small, piggish, upside-down eyes, gazing with idiotic adoration as his whip-thin tail thumped the covers.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Harry scratched behind one ear. \u201cWell, see, \u2019e was lookin\u2019 so forlorn, like, out in the courtyard by \u2019imself. Seemed an awful shame to leave \u2019im there all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff!\u201d Mick roared at the dog.</p><p>Lad\u2019s transformation was instantaneous. His tiny triangle ears folded back, his eyes narrowed worriedly, and he rolled so that he could crawl toward the edge of the bed on his belly.</p><p>\u201cIs that mud on his paws?\u201d Mick asked in outrage.</p><p>Harry glanced at the dog. \u201cI do believe it is,\u201d he said as if making a discovery.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Mick watched disgustedly as Lad made the edge of the bed and slithered off, thumping to the floor. The dog seemed to think that his apology was done\u2014or perhaps he\u2019d already forgotten that Mick was mad at him\u2014for he gamboled over as frisky as a lamb.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not even me dog,\u201d Mick muttered.</p><p>Lad sat, one back leg sprawled out to the side, tongue hanging from his mouth, and grinned up at him. He completely ignored Harry, his supposed master.</p><p>\u201cThe dog \u2019as a wonderful affection for ye,\u201d Harry said brightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t for him,\u201d Mick said. \u201cTake the beast out to the courtyard and get the maids to clean me bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course, o\u2019 course,\u201d Harry said, not moving. He cleared his throat delicately. \u201cAnd Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>Mick swung on him. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked. \u201cAh... I thought a nice walk about the place wi\u2019 the babe might make \u2019er feel less cooped up.\u201d</p><p>Mick snorted so loudly Lad cocked his head. \u201cThat woman isn\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere until she bends to me will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she won\u2019t be joinin\u2019 us for supper this evenin\u2019?\u201d Harry asked, hope dying hard in his hangdog eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot unless she has a sudden change o\u2019 heart,\u201d Mick said sourly. \u201cIn fact both she and that hellion babe will be stayin\u2019 in her rooms with only food for the babe until she makes up her stubborn mind to come sup at me table.\u201d</p><p>Harry tilted his head back to study the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mick demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s jus\u2019 that I\u2019ve noticed in dealin\u2019 wi\u2019 the fair sex that it sometimes does a man well to show a little kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I not given her a bed and a room fit for a queen?\u201d Mick asked softly, dangerously.</p><p>\u201cYe-es\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have I not been most accomodatin\u2019 o\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Harry looked doubtful.</p><p>Mick sliced his hand through the air. \u201cAll I ask is that she sup wi\u2019 me. No other wench has disobeyed me thus to me own face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but most wenches ye be dealin\u2019 wi\u2019 are doxies or servant girls,\u201d Harry pointed out in a reasonable tone. He took a step backward nonetheless. \u201cMrs. \u2019Ollingbrook is neither.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Mick merely stared at his henchman. Jaysus, when had his life become so complicated that he took to pleading his case with Harry? He had Silence in his house. He had her where he wanted her. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. She wasn\u2019t supposed to turn his life upside down.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t she live in me palace and be happy?\u201d Mick muttered.</p><p>Harry shrugged massive shoulders. \u201cMayhap because she\u2019s a woman. They do \u2019ave minds o\u2019 their own, I find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe orders stand,\u201d Mick declared. \u201cShe may not be a whore or a servant, but she\u2019ll bloody well learn to obey me.\u201d</p><p>Harry and Lad stared at him with strangely similar bloodshot brown eyes, sad reproach in both their gazes.</p><p>Mick flung out a hand irritably. \u201cGet on with ye!\u201d</p><p>Dog and man turned toward the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cAnd keep that dog out o\u2019 me house!\u201d Mick roared after them.</p><p>BY THAT NIGHT Silence was going quietly mad in her bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t keep me locked up here like some prisoner!\u201d she muttered to Fionnula.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the girl said with admirable equanimity considering she\u2019d been listening to Silence complain for most of the day.</p><p>Silence grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that this is so... so medieval. Who does Mickey O\u2019Connor think he is? Some pagan god?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, ma\u2019am,\u201d Fionnula replied earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he considers himself a god. Now a prince or even one of those sultans they have about in those heathen lands...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s thinking like that that makes him as arrogant as he is.\u201d Silence paced to the windows. They were draped in lovely rose curtains, perhaps to hide the fact that they\u2019d been boarded up. She could just make out a sliver of the street below if she applied her eye to a crack in the boards. \u201cThis is impossible! If he doesn\u2019t care if I go mad from confinement, he should at least think of his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling whimpered as if in answer. Already this evening the little girl had thoroughly explored the room, been warned away from the fire a half a dozen times, and been rescued out from under the bed twice. Now she sat, fretfully playing with the spoon and dish leftover from her supper.</p><p>Silence\u2019s stomach rumbled at the sight of the empty porridge dish. She\u2019d told Fionnula that she could no longer accept her smuggled food\u2014not after defying Mickey O\u2019Connor this morning. Fionnula, Bert, and Harry were already in enough trouble because of her.</p><p>\u201cYe could come down to sup with him,\u201d Fionnula pointed out cautiously.</p><p>Silence turned to glare at the girl. \u201cNot as long as he orders me to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Fionnula ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Silence winced. It was hardly the girl\u2019s fault that Mr. O\u2019Connor was such a despotic beast.</p><p>Silence wrapped her arms about her waist. She\u2019d already acquiesced to living with him. She was a lone woman with very little power in Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s palace. Refusing to dine with him really was the only way she could assert herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Silence muttered to herself and stomped out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye about?\u201d Fionnula cried as she scooped up Mary and hurried after.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Harry rose in alarm from the chair outside her room. Bert was apparently in disgrace\u2014she hadn\u2019t seen him since she\u2019d escaped this morning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a word with the sultan,\u201d Silence said with determination to them both. She turned and marched down the stairs before they could voice any more protests.</p><p>A moment later she opened Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s bedroom door with a jerk, bracing herself. It was with something of a letdown that she realized the room was empty.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s off on his business,\u201d Fionnula panted from behind her, Mary still in her arms. \u201cThey were all talkin\u2019 about it at supper tonight. Come away now, ma\u2019am. \u2019Twouldn\u2019t do to be found in here.\u201d</p><p>Silence ignored the warning, transfixed by the room. She\u2019d been in here, of course, on that night nearly a year ago. He\u2019d led her into this extravagantly decorated room, fed her, bid her enter his huge bed, and while she\u2019d watched, had begun to unbutton his fine lace shirt. His long, elegant fingers had seemed to mesmerize her. She remembered staring, her mouth going dry with fear, as he\u2019d bared his upper chest and then, his sardonic eyes locked with hers, he had lifted his arms, grabbing his shirt behind his back to draw it\u2014</p><p>A sudden movement on the bed nearly made her scream. As it was Silence was unable to suppress a squeak of alarm. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is that?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula peered around her. \u201cLad! Do get off the bed.\u201d</p><p>An enormous dog raised its head, tiny eyes looking worried. The animal jumped clumsily to the floor and started for them.</p><p>Silence backed away quickly, ready to slam the door shut. \u201cIs it dangerous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Lad \u2019urt anythin\u2019\u2014unless ye count an old soup bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s so big.\u201d Silence eyed the animal worriedly. Lad was a none-too-clean fawn color, his little flop ears much too small for his massive head. She could see each rib on the dog\u2019s side\u2014as well as the muscles that moved beneath his tawny coat. A sudden thought struck her. \u201cMr. O\u2019Connor has a pet?\u201d</p><p>Fionnula scrunched up her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call Lad a pet. More like he just hangs around the place.\u201d</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cLad\u2019s me dog, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he sleeps in Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s bed?\u201d Silence began skeptically, but at that moment the inevitable happened\u2014Mary Darling caught sight of the dog.</p><p>\u201cGog!\u201d she cried and bounced so hard that Fionnula set the baby at her feet.</p><p>Lad ducked around Silence and made straight for the baby.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Silence started forward to haul the animal back by the scruff of the neck\u2014Lad wore no collar.</p><p>But before she could reach him, the animal stopped before Mary and wagged his tail tentatively as he looked down at her.</p><p>Mary chortled with glee and grabbed his muzzle with both her hands. \u201cGog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Silence breathed, her hand hovering over the big dog\u2019s neck. She\u2019d throw herself on him to tear him away from her baby if she had to. She wrinkled her nose. Even if the beast smelled like a stable.</p><p>Lad stood still, save for his tail wagging ever faster. Mary had his jowls in her tiny fists, but the big dog didn\u2019t seem to mind. As Silence watched he swiped the baby\u2019s chin with an enormous tongue.</p><p>\u201cTold ye \u2019e\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d Harry said proudly.</p><p>\u201cHe might not be a danger,\u201d Silence conceded, \u201cbut he certainly needs a bath. He reeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he does usually spend most of his time in the courtyard,\u201d Fionnula admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen what was he doing in Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLad has taken a fair likin\u2019 to Himself,\u201d Fionnula said, shrugging. \u201cEven though it was Harry who rescued him from the bull-baitin\u2019 pits.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cLad was a bulldog?\u201d Silence asked in horror. The sport was a popular one, particularly among the poorer denizens of London, but Silence had always thought it terribly cruel.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E was bred a bulldog,\u201d Harry rumbled, \u201cbut \u2019e were no good at it. Seems \u2019e were afraid o\u2019 the bulls. I took \u2019im off a man about to drown \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Silence said softly. Lad was large and ugly and very smelly, but it seemed a shame to drown any creature, even an especially unbeautiful one.</p><p>As if he knew her thoughts, Lad sat and wagged his tail.</p><p>Silence placed her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, no matter how he came here, one thing is for certain. This dog needs a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019YOU THINK HE\u2019LL pay the tithe now?\u201d Bran asked Mick that night.</p><p>They were tramping back to the palace in the company of Pat and Sean, four abreast down the middle of the street. Any they ran into in the dark made a wide berth around them.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Mick replied with satisfaction.</p><p>The owner of the Alexander, a large, round man with sallow, hanging cheeks, had gone a rather sickly green when he\u2019d walked into his bedroom to find it full of pirates. He\u2019d nodded vigorously to everything Mick had said to him, while clutching his banyan about himself like a frightened virgin.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s done,\u201d Bran said.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Mick replied as they turned into an alley. They were nearly to the palace now, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel that they were being trailed. Well, this was as good a place as any\u2014and he had his men at his back. Mick flexed his arm, feeling the sheathed knife bound to his forearm. \u201cHe\u2019s agreed to me tithe, but I don\u2019t think he understands the error o\u2019 his ways. We\u2019ll be raidin\u2019 the ship when it makes port.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Bran began, nodding.</p><p>A shape suddenly dropped from above, landing just in front of the four men.</p><p>\u201cJaysus Christ!\u201d Sean shouted, leaping back.</p><p>Mick had his knife already drawn and was looking around warily, watching to see where the other attackers might come from. Several yards back two shadows drifted into the entrance to an alley. Mick shifted, keeping both the attacker in front and the men behind in his sight.</p><p>The shape in front straightened and became a man. Mick squinted. The figure wore a harlequin\u2019s motley and a wide-brimmed hat with a feather. Beneath the hat the upper part of his face was concealed by a black half-mask, the nose grotesquely long and curved.</p><p>In one hand he held a sword.</p><p>\u201cThe Ghost o\u2019 St. Giles,\u201d Pat whispered, crossing himself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right honored,\u201d Mick drawled. Pat might be superstitious, but the man before him looked real enough to him. \u201cBut yer barrin\u2019 our path.\u201d</p><p>The ghost cocked his head, eyes glittering behind the mask.</p><p>Mick\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do ye want?\u201d</p><p>At that the ghost smiled and pointed to his eyes. Slowly his forefinger swiveled until it was pointed at Mick. The message was quite clear.</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d Mick lunged for him.</p><p>The ghost made an impossible leap, grabbing a balcony overhanging the alley. He swung himself up, nimble as an acrobat, and continued climbing up the side of the building.</p><p>\u201cJaysus,\u201d Sean breathed. \u201cI\u2019d \u2019eard \u2019e could climb where no mortal man can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Bran snapped. \u201cAnyone with enough training and practice could do that.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked doubtful. \u201cDon\u2019t think I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I.\u201d Pat backed a couple of steps, looking up the building\u2019s side. \u201cCouldn\u2019t jump like that if me life depended on it. Were almost as if \u2019e \u2019ad wings, it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Sean sounded admiring. \u201cRight nimble \u2019e was, if \u2019e weren\u2019t a ghost or phantom or some such. Think \u2019e were givin\u2019 ye the evil eye, Mick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Mick said shortly. He glanced behind him, but their followers seemed to have disappeared without making any move on them, perhaps made cautious by the Ghost. Uneasiness crawled up Mick\u2019s spine. He could handle an attack against himself, but that wasn\u2019t his weak point.</p><p>And the Vicar knew it.</p><p>Mick looked at Bran. \u201cOn the morrow we\u2019re movin\u2019 Mrs. Hollingbrook and the babe.\u201d</p><p>Bran nodded without comment.</p><p>\u201cBest we were back,\u201d Mick said.</p><p>So saying he continued down the alley, though he didn\u2019t sheath his knife again. His thoughts turned to the unexpected confrontation. The ghost wanted him to know that he was keeping a watch on Mick.</p><p>The only question was: why?</p><p>\u201c \u2019IMSELF WON\u2019T LIKE this,\u201d Bert growled. He\u2019d returned from exile just in time to be caught up in Silence\u2019s plans for Lad the dog.</p><p>Silence hitched Mary farther up her hip and tramped determinedly down the overdecorated corridor. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Mr. O\u2019Connor enjoys having a filthy dog running about his house. Besides, you told me he wasn\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpected back any minute,\u201d Bert said with gloomy relish.</p><p>Silence suppressed a shiver of alarm at that information. She was sticking to her guns, but all the same she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted a repeat of this morning quite so soon.</p><p>She cast an apologetic glance at Bert. \u201cWe\u2019ll act swiftly, then.\u201d</p><p>She ignored Bert\u2019s continued grumbles as she followed Harry toward what he\u2019d assured her were the kitchens. Lad trotted along beside her, happily oblivious to his impending soapy fate, while Fionnula brought up the rear.</p><p>Silence cleared her throat. \u201cFionnula said that Mr. O\u2019Connor had gone off on some kind of business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry glanced back at her. \u201c \u2019E\u2019s talkin\u2019 to a merchant ship owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking?\u201d</p><p>Bert grunted. \u201cMore like explainin\u2019 the facts o\u2019 life to \u2019im\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>Harry had stopped short and turned to glare at his compatriot.</p> <p>Bert shrugged, both hands palms up by his side. \u201c \u2019E\u2019s a pirate. If she don\u2019t know that by now she\u2019s either a \u2019alf-wit or daft.\u201d</p><p>Silence cleared her throat to get the men\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018explaining the facts of life,\u2019 Bert?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019E gets a tithe, right?\u201d Bert said patiently. \u201cFrom every merchant ship that docks in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery ship?\u201d Silence raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cUsed to be \u2019e \u2019ad a bit more competition,\u201d Harry said judiciously. \u201cBut a couple o\u2019 years ago Black Jack Wilde took a swim in the Thames\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Bert tched. \u201cMiddle o\u2019 winter it were, too. Didn\u2019t find \u2019im \u2019til spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jimmy Barker went missin\u2019, which meant most o\u2019 \u2019is crew joined us.\u201d Harry pursed his lips as if thinking, then cocked an eyebrow at Bert.</p><p>Who nodded. \u201cThey was about it. After that \u2019Imself became the biggest pirate on the Thames. So, yeah, every ship.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea the extent of Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s empire. Silence pressed her lips together as she turned to continue down the hall to the kitchens.</p><p>Bert hurried after. \u201cSo this owner o\u2019 the ship... er... er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Harry supplied.</p> <p>\u201cRight ye are,\u201d Bert said, \u201cthe owner o\u2019 the Alexander \u2019as been remiss, as it were, in \u2019is tithe, so \u2019Imself \u2019as gone to see \u2019im and explain \u2019is duties to \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>Silence snorted. \u201cYou mean he\u2019s gone to threaten the poor man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBert\u2019s right,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201c \u2019E is a pirate.\u201d</p><p>And with that flat statement they entered the kitchen. It was a big room, lined in light gray stone, an enormous hearth at one end. Two maids, sitting at a table in the middle of the room looked up at their entrance. A huge, stout man at the hearth swung around. He was entirely bald and the color of a well-cooked lobster, his front and lower half swathed in a not very clean apron.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ello, Archie,\u201d Harry said chattily. \u201cThis \u2019ere\u2019s Mrs. \u2019Ollingbrook what \u2019as come down to give Lad a bit o\u2019 a bath.\u201d</p><p>Archie\u2019s brow beetled ominously and the maids suddenly found the tabletop very interesting. \u201cYe know I don\u2019t allow that there beast in me kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned, about to say something, but at that moment Mary Darling joined the conversation. \u201cDown!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, sweetheart.\u201d Silence bounced the baby on her hip, trying to comfort her, but Mary\u2019s face was growing as red as Archie\u2019s.</p> <p>Archie stared at the baby for a split-second, his face entirely blank, before he turned and rummaged in a cupboard.</p><p>\u201cDown! Down! Down!\u201d Mary chanted as Silence hugged her.</p><p>Archie loomed in front of them. \u201cSugar biscuit?\u201d he asked gruffly and held it toward the baby.</p><p>Mary\u2019s transformation was miraculous. She grinned, showing her four perfect teeth, two on the top, two on the bottom, and grabbed for the sweet.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Silence said gratefully to the big man.</p><p>Archie shrugged. \u201c \u2019Spose ye can use the master\u2019s tub for the dog. But ye\u2019ll need to clean up afterward, mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Silence said hurriedly.</p><p>In a moment she\u2019d settled Mary, her biscuit, and a tin cup of milk with Fionnula while Bert and Harry dragged out a big copper bathtub. Silence\u2019s eyes widened at the sight. The orphanage had a small tin tub that she could just fit into, but she\u2019d never seen a bathtub as magnificent as Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s.</p><p>Lad trotted around the room, sniffing at corners and being yelled at once or twice by Archie as the tub was filled. The maids\u2014Moll and Tess\u2014seemed to think bathing a dog to be a great lark. They giggled as they found soap and laid out cloths.</p><p>When everything was ready, Harry called Lad. The dog gamboled over, as happy as a lamb, and for a moment Silence had a twinge of guilt.</p><p>Then Harry tried to put the dog into the tub.</p><p>There was a curse, a bark, and a wild scrambling, and then Harry was down in a puddle on the floor and Lad was across the room, bone dry.</p><p>The maids dissolved into laughter.</p><p>Mary banged her tin cup on the table. \u201cGog!\u201d</p><p>Fionnula had one hand over her mouth, attempting to control her laughter.</p><p>Even Archie\u2019s thick lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am so sorry, Harry,\u201d Silence said breathlessly. She bent to help the guard up. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Bert grunted. \u201cWhat ye get for tryin\u2019 to pretty up a cur.\u201d</p><p>Harry glared at his compatriot. \u201cI\u2019m fine, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Bert snorted.</p><p>Harry stood and yanked on his waistcoat to straighten it. \u201cNow ye jus\u2019 come \u2019ere, Lad me boy.\u201d</p><p>Lad rolled his eyes from a corner of the kitchen. He appeared to be trying to squeeze his body into a crack in the wall, or perhaps simply become invisible, but since he was quite a large dog, the task was impossible.</p><p>Harry advanced on the dog.</p><p>Lad trotted out of his path, his tail tucked firmly between his legs.</p><p>Silence bent down. \u201cHere, Lad,\u201d she called in a high, sweet voice.</p><p>Lad perked his ears and went to her, glancing anxiously over his shoulder at Harry.</p><p>\u201cNow then, Harry,\u201d Silence murmured soothingly as she fondled Lad\u2019s misshapen ears, one of which appeared to be missing a piece, \u201cif you take his back half very firmly and I lift his front...\u201d</p><p>Harry grabbed, Silence lifted, and Lad was deposited into the bath before he quite knew what had happened. Immediately, he made an attempt to get out again, but Silence had had an idea that he\u2019d try something of the sort and was ready.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she said in the same soothing voice\u2014the voice she\u2019d perfected bathing small, reluctant boys at the home. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming out until every speck of dirt has been removed from your hide.\u201d</p><p>Lad seemed to recognize that tone. He sighed heavily, his ears drooping.</p><p>Half an hour later, Silence stood back and blew a lock of hair out of her eyes. Her entire front was damp, her hair was half undone and she felt a trickle of sweat down her spine. Harry had lost his scarf and coat and the front of his waistcoat was dripping, the result of a premature shake on Lad\u2019s part. Mary Darling had fallen asleep in Fionnula\u2019s arms sometime during the proceedings, her half-eaten biscuit still clutched in her hand, and the maids and Archie were enjoying a pot of tea between them at the kitchen table. Apparently a dog bath was the most entertainment they\u2019d seen in ages.</p><p>Silence eyed her charge critically. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Archie said, \u201cis one clean dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly cleaner than \u2019Arry,\u201d Bert muttered.</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d Moll drawled, \u201cye forget the bath \u2019e\u2019s \u2019ad washin\u2019 that dog.\u201d</p><p>Both maids went off into peals of laughter.</p><p>Harry straightened his dripping waistcoat with dignity. \u201cI do believe Lad is done,\u201d he said to Silence.</p><p>Silence nodded. \u201cWell, then, out you come, Lad.\u201d</p><p>The dog didn\u2019t need more urging. Lad scrambled from the tub in a tidal wave of water and then immediately shook, spraying everyone in the room.</p><p>The maids shrieked, Bert cursed, and Archie just grimaced in disgust.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Harry said cheerfully, \u201cnow yer all as clean as me.\u201d</p><p>Silence started to giggle before Lad shook again. The dog was grinning, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, and trying to run around the kitchen\u2014except he kept skidding on the puddles of water, his rear end sliding to the side.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, the floor is rather a mess,\u201d Silence murmured. She crouched, trying to wipe up the lake with some of the cloths.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d came a deep male voice, \u201cis this?\u201d</p><p>Silence froze, her hand still outstretched, clutching a damp, dirty cloth. Oh, dear Lord. Slowly she raised her eyes and found herself face-to-thighs with Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s extremely tight breeches.</p><p>\u201cAh...,\u201d she started, with absolutely no idea of what she was about to say.</p><p>At the same time, Harry cleared his throat. \u201cSee, I jus\u2019 thought the dog\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor interrupted Harry in that same much too calm voice. \u201cTake the babe, Fionnula, and put her to bed. Everyone else, out o\u2019 me kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Silence started to stand.</p><p>\u201cAh, ah,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cNot ye, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, watching as the servants and Harry and Bert trooped out of the room. Lad, apparently not the brightest dog in the world, sat down next to Mickey O\u2019Connor and leaned against his leg.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor looked at the dog, looked at the damp spot growing on his breeches where the dog was leaning, and sighed. \u201cI find me life is not as quiet as it used to be afore ye came to me palace, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d</p><p>Silence lifted her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re a pirate, Mr. O\u2019Connor. I cannot believe your life was ever very quiet.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an ironic look. \u201cAye, amazin\u2019, isn\u2019t it? Yet since yer arrival me servants no longer obey me and I return home to find me kitchen flooded.\u201d He crossed to a cupboard and took down a china teapot, a tin of tea, and a teacup. \u201cAnd me dog smells like a whorehouse.\u201d</p><p>Silence glanced guiltily at Lad. \u201cThe only soap we could find was rose scented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor glanced at the dog. Lad looked back, obliviously adoring, his tongue hanging from his mouth. \u201cPoor, sad beast. He\u2019s lost his bollocks and don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>Silence blinked. She\u2019d braced herself for shouting and anger, but so far Mickey O\u2019Connor hadn\u2019t shown either.</p><p>She watched as he spooned tea leaves into the teapot and crossed to the fireplace to fill the pot with hot water.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye take sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He nodded and placed the teapot and teacup on the table before fetching a little bowl of sugar.</p><p>Silence looked at the lone teacup. \u201cAren\u2019t you having any?\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor snorted. \u201cI\u2019d be drummed from the pirate\u2019s guild if\u2019n I were seen takin\u2019 tea.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched at the thought. \u201cThen why make it for me?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes black and a little tired. For the first time she wondered how his \u201cbusiness\u201d had gone that night. \u201cI thought ye\u2019d like it, Mrs. Hollingbrook. After all, ye must be near starved after two days with only the food Fionnula and the others could smuggle ye.\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip. \u201cI asked her to stop today.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head curiously. \u201cDid ye now?\u201d</p><p>Silence sat and poured herself a cup, adding a spoonful of sugar. She did like tea. When she sipped, the tea was quite good. She glanced up to find him propped against the kitchen cabinets watching her with a brooding air.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you learn to make a good cup of tea when you don\u2019t drink it yourself?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened and he looked down at his boots. For a moment she thought he wouldn\u2019t reply. Then he sighed. \u201cMe mam was fond o\u2019 tea when we could get it. I\u2019d make it for her.\u201d</p><p>His words were terse, but the picture he drew was sentimental. What a lovely boy he must\u2019ve been to be so thoughtful of his mother. Silence frowned. She didn\u2019t like thinking of him like this\u2014as a vulnerable child, a loving son. It was much simpler to only think of him as a pirate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYer tea is gettin\u2019 cold,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She drank some more and his mouth softened.</p><p>\u201cTell me somethin\u2019,\u201d he said, his voice a deep, quiet rumble. \u201cI saw ye once with the Ghost o\u2019 St. Giles almost a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were watching me.\u201d She set her teacup down.</p> <p>Last fall she\u2019d been caught in a riot in St. Giles and only escaped harm when the Ghost of St. Giles had saved her. She\u2019d seen Mickey O\u2019Connor across the street at the time and wondered why he was there.</p><p>He shrugged, unperturbed. \u201cAye, sometimes. Ye had me daughter after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His explanation was rather deflating.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Ghost o\u2019 St. Giles,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He wore a mask the night he saved me from the rioters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the only time ye\u2019ve seen him?\u201d His question was intent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him from afar, but it was certainly the only time I talked to him, although he never spoke to me.\u201d Silence looked at him, confused. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, frowning absently. \u201cNo matter.\u201d</p><p>Lad sighed loudly and slid down to lie on the floor.</p> <p>Mr. O\u2019Connor looked at the dog. \u201cI should put him out in the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we just bathed him.\u201d</p><p>He shot a rather frightening look at her from under his brows. \u201cAye, so ye did. Be a shame, I guess, to let him roll in the mud so soon.\u201d He tilted his chin at her teacup. \u201cAre ye finished?\u201d</p><p>She took a last sip. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded and shoved away from the cupboard. \u201cI\u2019ll escort ye to yer room, then.\u201d</p><p>They walked all the way back to her rooms in silence, Lad padding happily behind.</p><p>When they reached her door, Mickey exchanged nods with Harry, sitting outside, and turned to Silence. \u201cGood night, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Silence said, her hand on the doorknob. \u201cAnd thank you for the tea. It was truly delicious.\u201d</p> <p>One corner of his mouth curved. \u201cMe pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She began to close the door, but he stayed it with one broad hand. \u201cOne more thing. Tomorrow ye and the babe are movin\u2019 rooms.\u201d</p><p>Silence blinked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were followed tonight,\u201d he said, his eyes angry. \u201cI want ye closer to me so I can keep an eye on ye m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>She frowned over that alarming news as he turned and ambled gracefully away. It wasn\u2019t until he was nearly at the end of the hall that she remembered something.</p><p>\u201cWhere will our new rooms be?\u201d she called after him.</p><p>He cast an inscrutable glance over his shoulder. \u201cNext to mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The second night the nephews resumed their guard with renewed determination. They placed thorns beneath their clothes to keep themselves awake, refused to sit, and paced about to stimulate their senses. But despite all their efforts, once again they fell asleep. And in the morning once again they had to confess their failure to the king.</p><p>And this time when Clever John rose he found a yellow feather behind his ear....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>The moon was but a pale sliver in the sky when Mick stepped into the wherry the next night. He wore two pistols stuck into a belt strapped across his middle, as well as a half dozen knives hidden about his person. Tonight they raided a ship whose captain had decided to keep half of Mick\u2019s tithe for himself. Mick signaled the other boat and the wherrymen silently pushed off from the dock. Only the quiet sound of the oars dipping into the water broke the night\u2019s hush.</p><p>Mick hunched down in the stern of the boat, watching as the massive hulk of the Fairweather drew near. She was a fully rigged ship, not more than five years old and a beauty. He\u2019d always had a certain fascination for the tall ships that docked in London harbor. They were like living giants, slumbering on the dirty waters of the Thames.</p><p>The wherry made the side of the ship and the rope ladder already waiting there. The water sloshed against the hull as Mick swarmed up, leading his men. He climbed over the rail and saw the two guards, huddled together.</p><p>\u201cGood evenin,\u2019 gentlemen,\u201d Mick murmured as he straightened. \u201cOnly ye two aboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the elder of the two, a bantam fellow of thirty or so, nodded nervously. \u201cJus\u2019 like ye said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Mick casually tossed a small bag to the men. It clinked as the elder man caught it. \u201cYe\u2019ll have the rest when me and me men depart.\u201d</p><p>Mick waved a hand to his crew.</p><p>Immediately, his men spread out over the ship, swiftly climbing below where the cargo lay.</p><p>Mick sauntered to the poop deck and ducked inside the door there. The captain\u2019s cabin usually lay at the stern of the ship and the Fairweather was no different. Mick grunted with satisfaction when he found a solid oak door that was finer than the rest in the corridor. Of course it was locked, but a few quick shoves with his dagger against the wood near the lock opened the door very nicely. He prowled inside.</p><p>The captain of the Fairweather obviously liked to take his luxuries with him when he sailed. An enameled snuffbox lay on a table next to a brass inkwell and stand. Mick glanced at them and turned to a small chest near the bed. This was locked, as well, but he opened it easily. Inside were a few gold coins, a fine brass sextant, and some maps. Mick rifled through the contents until his hand found a rectangular object wrapped in oilcloth at the bottom of the chest. He drew it out and sat back on his heels to unwrap it.</p><p>The oilcloth fell away in his hands to reveal a slim volume, the leather dark with age, gilt decorating the cover, but no title. Mick turned the book over in his hands before opening it. Within were finely written pages\u2014in a language he could not decipher. He turned a couple of pages and came upon a tiny, exquisite illustration.</p><p>Mick\u2019s eyebrows arched and he smiled.</p><p>He rewrapped the little book carefully and stuck it into an inner pocket in his coat. Then he continued looking about the room.</p><p>Ten minutes later he\u2019d found nothing more interesting than an amazing array of clay pipes. Mick left the captain\u2019s quarters and went up on deck. He\u2019d taught his men to be swift when they went raiding and he wasn\u2019t disappointed now: Bran stood overseeing the removal of several barrels into the waiting boats.</p><p>\u201cAlmost done?\u201d Mick asked as he came up to Bran.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d The boy turned to grin. \u201cWe got nearly all the tobacco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The Fairweather\u2019s captain would pay a steep price for his greed. Mick tossed another small bag to the waiting guards. They looked none too bright, but if they had any sense they\u2019d be gone by the time the captain came on board tomorrow. \u201cThen let\u2019s away.\u201d</p><p>Bran nodded and was over the side and down the ladder in two blinks. Mick followed, feeling the boat dip under his weight as he stepped in. He gestured and the wherrymen shoved away from the Fairweather.</p><p>The puny moon shed little light on the water and they rowed in near darkness, the only sound the dip of the oars into the river. Still, as Mick neared the dock, something made him peer intently into the gloom. All looked the same as when they\u2019d left it only a half hour before\u2014a few barrels squatted together in the shadows, a tumbling-down warehouse looming behind. There was nothing to alarm him, yet he felt the hairs rise on the back of his neck.</p><p>Then something moved behind one of the barrels.</p><p>\u201cAmbush!\u201d Mick roared as he drew one of his pistols.</p><p>His shot coincided with one from the dock and the wherryman in front of him slumped over the oars, blood pouring from a hole in his head. Suddenly the night was lit with the sparks of gunfire. Mick fired his other pistol, then took the dead man by the arm and threw his body out of the boat.</p><p>He shoved one of his own men into position. \u201cRow for shore, hard as ye can!\u201d</p><p>A shout and a splash as one of his pirates went into the Thames. God willing, the man was already dead, for most of Mick\u2019s men couldn\u2019t swim\u2014and drowning was a hard way to go. Mick growled and drew one of his daggers, sticking it between his teeth. Then he threw off his boots and coat and slipped over the side of the wherry like an eel.</p><p>The water was as icy as a dead woman\u2019s kiss and smelled of the sewers that emptied into the river. No matter\u2014he\u2019d swum the Thames before and tasted her foul brew. Mick glided through the water, only his eyes breaking the surface, his face going numb. He made the wharf before the boats and could see now clearly their attackers. One man crouched near the water\u2019s edge, firing from two long guns, another loading for him.</p><p>The gunman was the first to go into the river.</p><p>There was a splash and a gurgle and then the man was lost below the fetid surface. His mate stared as Mick swarmed the dock.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d the gun loader cried. \u201cIt\u2019s Charmin\u2019 Mickey \u2019imself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow de do?\u201d Mick grinned and stuck his knife between the man\u2019s ribs.</p><p>The gun loader\u2019s eyes widened a moment, but Mick hadn\u2019t time to watch. He shoved the man\u2014dead or alive\u2014into the Thames\u2019s cold embrace. When he turned back, his boats were almost at the dock, some of his men still shooting. The attackers fled into the dark.</p><p>All but one.</p><p>He was only a silhouette, standing without fear even in the midst of gunfire, and Mick sensed more than saw who he was.</p><p>\u201cCharlie Grady,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCharming Mickey.\u201d The shadow dipped his head as if in acknowledgment. \u201cHow long will you stay in business if you lose a man or two every time you go out on a raid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck ye,\u201d Mick breathed.</p><p>\u201cThe same to you,\u201d Charlie murmured. \u201cOh, the same to you, Mickey O\u2019Connor.\u201c</p><p>Then the pirates were on the docks and Charlie Grady was gone.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Bran panted by Mick\u2019s side. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see in the dark. Did you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Mick said, his chest expanding and falling as he gulped air. \u201cThat was the Vicar o\u2019 Whitechapel.\u201d</p><p>BY THE TIME Mick and his men made it back to the palace, he was gritting his teeth to keep from chattering.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d he asked Bran as they came in the doors, trying to get a reckoning on the men he\u2019d lost tonight. He\u2019d sent the rest of his crew to store the barrels of tobacco and sugar. \u201cI saw Pat Flynn, but didn\u2019t make out the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo others,\u201d Bran said grimly. \u201cSean Flannigan went over the side and didn\u2019t come back up again, and Mike O\u2019Toole caught one in the face. Was dead at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn me,\u201d Mick said, grimacing. Losing three of his best men in one night was enough to make him want to howl. \u201cPat had family, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Bran nodded as they tramped through the dark halls toward the kitchen at the back of the palace. \u201cPat had a woman and two little girls.\u201d</p><p>Mick shuddered, the cold shaking his bones. He\u2019d taken off his wet shirt at the docks and put on his dry coat and boots, but the chill of the Thames seemed to have seeped to his very core. \u201cMake sure Pat\u2019s woman has enough to live on until she can find another man.\u201d</p><p>Bran looked at him doubtfully. \u201cThat might take years.\u201d</p><p>Mick shot him an evil look. \u201cAnd if it do?\u201d</p><p>Bran shrugged uneasily. \u201cMakes no matter to me, but you\u2019re throwing good money away\u2014Pat\u2019s woman would be happy with ten pounds and a pint of gin.\u201d</p><p>Mick halted in the middle of the hall and swung on Bran. He thrust his face into the younger man\u2019s and growled, \u201cPat Flynn died obeyin\u2019 me orders. He was a good man. They all were. I\u2019ll see them buried proper with black gloves and mourners and all. And if I want to keep his woman and children in enough style that they dine upon beef and sugarplums every night for the next three years, I\u2019ll damn well do so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bran had flushed under Mick\u2019s diatribe. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said without any inflection in his voice at all. \u201cWe\u2019ll do exactly as you wish.\u201d</p><p>Mick narrowed his eyes. If ever he\u2019d have a rebellion on his hands it would come from Bran. The lad was the canniest of all his men, and a natural leader as well\u2014a fact that had made Bran Mick\u2019s second-in-command at such a young age. Soon, Mick would have to give him more to do, guide Bran\u2019s restless, clever mind.</p><p>But not tonight. The Vicar had made his intentions plain and Mick couldn\u2019t afford any show of weakness\u2014not even with Bran. The boy had to be reminded who was in charge.</p><p>\u201cGood. See that it\u2019s done,\u201d Mick said, and turned to continue toward the back of the house.</p> <p>Archie the cook was mopping the floor when they entered the kitchens.</p><p>\u201cStart me some water boilin\u2019.\u201d Mick strode to the fire and began stripping off his wet clothes. \u201cI want a hot bath and a fire roarin\u2019 in me room.\u201d</p><p>He was down to his smallclothes now and Mick took a ladle of water and began sluicing his body and hair to get the worst of the river stink out. He felt tainted, as if he stank not only from the river, but from contact with the Vicar, as well. Mick shuddered, pouring water over his head. He couldn\u2019t let the Vicar destroy another woman. Her brown eyes had been haunted as she\u2019d turned her tear-stained face from his. He shook away the phantom.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let that happen with Silence.</p><p>Mick threw aside the ladle, caught up his coat again, and turned to the hall. God, he was tired and cold.</p> <p>Cold to his very soul.</p><p>SILENCE LISTENED TO the commotion in the next room as she lay in bed that night. She and Mary Darling had been moved early this morning into a room that had a prominent door connecting it to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s own room. She\u2019d half-expected to see him all day\u2014but apparently the pirate had been too busy with his own affairs. Only now, late at night, had Mickey O\u2019Connor returned home.</p><p>Mary Darling was asleep in the corner, her railed cot having been brought with them. The new room was bigger and much finer than the rooms Mickey O\u2019Connor had originally placed them in. The walls were a soft, feminine blue gray that suited her much better than the pink of the room upstairs, and an elegant arrangement of chairs stood before the fireplace.</p><p>Silence sighed and rolled over, fussing with the pillow under her head. Truth be told, she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep because her belly was aching. She\u2019d again refused the food that Fionnula and the guards had tried giving her today. It simply wasn\u2019t right to put others at risk for her own needs.</p><p>Which might be true, but that lofty ideal didn\u2019t help her hunger tonight. Silence pressed her palms to her aching stomach. She was so hungry that she\u2019d even contemplated sneaking down to the kitchen to steal food. Her eldest sister, Verity, who had raised Silence and Temperance after Mama died, would be appalled.</p><p>Actually, Silence was appalled. Here she sat in the near dark cowering from Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>Was she a coward?</p><p>On that thought she rose and was across the room toward the connecting door almost before she could think. The sounds from the other room had stopped a while ago. Mr. O\u2019Connor had either left or he was alone\u2014perhaps enjoying an after-raid snack.</p><p>The thought made her stomach grumble.</p><p>Silence took a deep breath and opened the connecting door.</p><p>And then she had trouble exhaling.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor the pirate king was in the huge bath that they\u2019d used the night before for washing Lad the dog. One arm dangled over the side of the tub, a goblet of amber liquid held carelessly in long elegant fingers. His ebony hair was wet and curling against his neck and shoulders. Those shoulders were broad, covered in smooth, olive skin, and spanned the width of the tub and more. And where before she\u2019d thought that his chest was entirely devoid of hair, now she saw that small whirls circled his brown nipples and a thin line of hair trailed just below his naked navel, disappearing into the water where no doubt it led to other naked things.</p><p>Well, of course he was naked, Silence thought, trying to pull herself together. He was in his bath. Who took a bath fully clothed?</p><p>She had some vague idea of backing out of the room again, but he\u2019d already seen her.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Hollingbrook,\u201d the pirate drawled, taking a sip from his goblet. \u201cI was jus\u2019 sittin\u2019 here wonderin\u2019 if ye\u2019d spent the day powderin\u2019 and curlin\u2019 Lad\u2019s fur and here ye are. To what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d His voice had suddenly assumed an upper crust English accent on the last sentence, making the words even more mocking.</p><p>Silence lifted her chin. She wasn\u2019t going to turn tail and run from a pirate\u2014even if he was naked. She darted a look at Lad\u2014snoring in front of the fire\u2014and decided it was best not to answer Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s mocking inquiry. \u201cI\u2019ve come to demand you tell me what is going on.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her from under heavy eyelids. \u201cHave ye, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d She set hands upon hips. \u201cIt\u2019s positively medieval, locking me up, refusing me food, never bothering to ask what I want or need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed,\u201d he mused, his gaze slowly examining her form in a manner that caused her to go hot all over, \u201cnow that I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 we might not agree upon\u2014what ye need\u2014but do tell me what ye might be wantin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands up. \u201cI want\u2014and need\u2014to eat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019ve said more than once that yer welcome to sup with me.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cYou know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that Fionnula and Harry and half me staff o\u2019 bloody servants have seen fit to go against me by smugglin\u2019 food to ye.\u201d His voice suddenly held a nasty edge.</p><p>She froze, her eyes widening in fear for the others. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t what?\u201d he drawled. There was something dark in him tonight\u2014something she\u2019d not seen before. \u201cI can\u2019t turn them off, can\u2019t toss them into the street, can\u2019t make them disappear? The Thames is an easy place to lose a body. A man can slip beneath those dark, cold waters and sink without a trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shrugged one elegant shoulder, making the water ripple in the tub.</p><p>She took a step closer. \u201cWhat happened on your raid tonight?\u201d</p><p>He turned his face away, taking a sip from his goblet. \u201cWhat a perceptive little thing ye are, Mrs. Hollingbrook. The raid went quite well, actually, thank ye for inquirin\u2019. Got a load o\u2019 tobacco and sugar and the only cost was the lives o\u2019 three o\u2019 me men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand, rings flashing. \u201cNothin\u2019 to concern yerself with, I do assure ye.\u201d</p><p>Surely it wasn\u2019t usual for him to lose three of his men in one night? If it was, he\u2019d be constantly recruiting more pirates. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pirates.\u201d She winced and gestured rather helplessly with one hand, her voice softer. \u201cYour men. Who were they?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Then he took a long swallow from his goblet. \u201cPat and Mike and Sean. Not the brightest o\u2019 me men, sure, especially Pat, but he had a family and he was always quick with a joke, was Pat.\u201d</p><p>She waited, but he didn\u2019t say more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cSorry three pirates are dead? Why, Mrs. Hollingbrook, ye surprise me, ye do.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop to listen to her, talking over her instead. \u201cNow then, tell me: shall I have the honor o\u2019 yer company tomorrow night at me supper table? Shall ye dine upon sweetmeats with me, Silence, mine?\u201d</p><p>His words sounded obscene somehow. She frowned, frustration rising in her. He wasn\u2019t listening; it was as if she couldn\u2019t be heard. \u201cI\u2019m not yours and I never gave you leave to use my Christian name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but do I need leave, now?\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor whispered. \u201cYer in me room\u2014and not for the first time, love.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply. How dare he remind her of that night? Suddenly it was too much: the hunger, the edge of darkness in his voice, and this room\u2014this too familiar room. No one had believed she\u2019d been untouched after that night.</p><p>No one had heard her.</p><p>She looked at the pirate luxuriating in his bath and a great rage swelled up in her, a mixture of hunger, frustration, lost love, and fear for Mary Darling.</p><p>And scorn. Oh, there was plenty of scorn, as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you cost me?\u201d she demanded, her voice low and trembling. \u201cWhen you played your cruel game with me?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, but didn\u2019t say a word. His black eyes reflected no light, fathomless and without expression. Was his heart made of stone that he could play with lives\u2014her life\u2014so carelessly and not feel a thing?</p><p>Silence balled her fists, trembling. \u201cIt was as if I became a cipher after that night. No one I loved believed me. You silenced me. What you did to me cost me everything I valued in life\u2014my family\u2019s respect, my marriage, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was yer marriage so perfect before ye came to me?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, the breath catching in her breast in rage. Of course her marriage had been perfect, hadn\u2019t it?</p><p>Hadn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cWe had true love,\u201d she said, drowning out the tiny voice of doubt in her mind.</p><p>He turned his face from her, which only made her angrier. In four strides she was beside him, kneeling on the rug next to the tub of water. She reached out and took his face in her palms, turning it so he had to look at her, his lean cheeks cool and a little rough beneath her hands.</p><p>\u201cYes, love.\u201d She hissed the word like a curse. \u201cI loved my husband, my William, and he loved me. That is until that night you kept me here. You destroyed what we had as thoughtlessly as a boy pulling the wings from a butterfly.\u201d</p><p>His wickedly sensuous upper lip pulled back in a sneer. \u201cWhat is love?\u201d</p><p>She leaned close to him. \u201cSomething you will never have. Something you\u2019re incapable of feeling. I pity you, Mickey O\u2019Connor, for I may have lost my true love, but at least I had him for a time. You\u2019ll never feel love.\u201d</p><p>His sneer had grown and his voice was low and terrible. \u201cI may not feel love, but I do feel this.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and thrust it beneath the bathwater.</p><p>She struggled so violently that the water splashed over her bodice and the rug, but he was stronger than she. He forced her palm down against his male part, hard and thick, and held it there as he grasped her hair with his other hand. He yanked, pulling her hair, arching her neck, and suddenly his mouth was on hers, cruel and merciless. He ground her lips against her teeth, used his hold on her hair to angle her head for his greater access. She felt the push of his tongue against her lips. For a moment she stopped fighting. She opened her mouth and let him in, hot and searching. She could taste the heady liquor on his tongue, feel the sudden gentling of his mouth as he got what he wanted. His kiss was overwhelmingly masculine. Overwhelmingly dominant.</p><p>Something clenched inside her\u2014something primitive and needy, something that had nothing to do with love.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>And she lurched back. Her hand came out of the water and she hit him as hard as she could across the face. The sound of the blow was loud in the room.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried, her heart pounding, her breasts aching. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t have the right.\u201d</p><p>He watched her retreat, his eyes lazy, and his body unmoving. A trickle of blood seeped slowly from the corner of his mouth. He let her get nearly out of the room before he spoke, \u201cI may not have the right, Silence, me love,\u201d he drawled so soft she nearly didn\u2019t catch the words. \u201cBut I would\u2019ve listened to ye. I would\u2019ve believed ye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Now on the third night when dusk drew near, Clever John thought long and hard about the feathers he\u2019d found on his person and the fact that he and his cousins could not stay awake no matter how they tried. He took a bit of candle wax from the castle and stopped up both his ears. Then he took up his position beneath the cherry tree and waited for nightfall....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Mick woke the next morning to the sound of Lad retching by the fireplace.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ye dare!\u201d Mick growled, lunging up.</p><p>Lad stood frozen on the hearth, tail between his legs, and tiny triangle ears flat to his head. The dog rolled his eyes at Mick.</p><p>Mick narrowed his. \u201cHeave in me room, ye damned dog, and I\u2019ll spit ye and serve ye to the crew tonight for supper.\u201d</p><p>Lad whimpered and lay down.</p><p>Mick sighed and flopped back onto his pillows. A far cry this was from how he\u2019d used to wake in his bedroom. No scented female flesh to warm his bed, only a sick mongrel on the hearth.</p> <p>And the memory of his kiss with Silence Hollingbrook last night. Aye, and he hadn\u2019t acted the gentleman, had he? No, he\u2019d seized and taken and he would not regret his actions in the light of day, for the kiss had been sweet and hot and all that he\u2019d imagined that a kiss with Silence would be.</p><p>Well, not quite all. In his lusty thoughts such a kiss hadn\u2019t ended with her hitting him\u2014nor stomping from the room. No, in his dreams, there\u2019d been much more than that almost chaste meeting of lips. Enough to make his already stiff John Thomas twitch with interest.</p><p>He winced, feeling an ache in his arms from the unexpected swim last night. He needed to deal with the Vicar and soon, but first there was the matter of Silence Hollingbrook and her stomach. Harry had kept him informed and the maddening woman hadn\u2019t eaten all yesterday\u2014despite being smuggled food. Perhaps she thought she was protecting the servants or perhaps she was refusing food in some sort of ridiculous protest against living with him. Or perhaps she was simply not eating to irritate him\u2014and if that were so, well it was certainly working.</p><p>Women were something best bought, he\u2019d found. Pay them, fuck them, and send them away in the morning. That way avoided tears, recriminations, and feminine disappointment. Oh, and small things like being slapped across the face. Mick rubbed his jaw. But Silence wasn\u2019t one of his whores, as Harry had pointed out. Mick couldn\u2019t send her away. And he couldn\u2019t let her starve herself\u2014he wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt her, including herself.</p><p>Which meant that much as it went against his instincts, he would have to take the risk of drawing her closer. Letting her in, just a tad, mind.</p><p>Mick O\u2019Connor never admitted defeat, never backed down, but he might choose to change his plans, should he come head to head with a stubborn widow bent on hurting herself for whatever reason.</p> <p>The course he\u2019d originally taken with her was not working. Time to take a different tack.</p><p>SILENCE WAS DRESSING Mary Darling for the day when the door opened behind her.</p><p>The baby looked up and frowned. \u201cBad!\u201d</p><p>Which was warning enough, Silence supposed.</p><p>She inhaled and turned to face Mickey O\u2019Connor, biting her lip against the memory of that savage kiss last night.</p><p>He had closed the door behind him and was leaning against the wall, his frown nearly identical to Mary Darling\u2019s. \u201cWill she ever find another name to call me, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Silence said with commendable calm. If he wouldn\u2019t mention the kiss, well, then neither would she. \u201cIt might depend on if you ever call Mary something else besides \u2018she.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He grunted and shoved away from the wall. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p> <p>She watched him cross to the hearth and stare broodingly into the fire. Fionnula had gone down to fetch Mary\u2019s breakfast, so they were alone for the moment. \u201cWhat did you come for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiveness?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She blinked, not sure if she\u2019d heard him correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer not what I expected, ye know.\u201d The curl of his lips seemed self-mocking. \u201cI thought ye\u2019d sit in yer room and knit or do needlework. Come when called, go away when bidden. Upset me fine life not at all.\u201d</p><p>Her lips firmed in irritation, but she merely said, \u201cYou obviously haven\u2019t seen either my knitting or my needlework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t. There\u2019s much about ye I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, feeling restless\u2014and hungry. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything since before yesterday. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI think it does in fact.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, nonplussed. Why would he care to know her?</p><p>As if he\u2019d heard her thoughts, he shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t let it bother ye. \u2019Tis me own worry and none o\u2019 yers. I came with two purposes. The first is to give ye this.\u201d</p><p>He strode forward and proffered an oilcloth-wrapped bundle.</p><p>Silence took it gingerly.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Mary stood and grabbed her arm, looking on curiously as Silence unwrapped a fine little book with gilt edges.</p><p>\u201cGentle,\u201d Silence chided as the baby grabbed for the prize. \u201cWe must be careful. See?\u201d</p><p>She opened the book and then gasped herself when she found an exquisite little illustration. Tiny men sailed, crowded on a ship with a square crimson sail on a sea with towering cobalt waves.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like it?\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s voice was gruff.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d She glanced up at him and was surprised to see an expression of uncertainty on his face.</p><p>He shrugged, the expression replaced with his usual insouciance. \u201cI thought ye and the babe might find it entertainin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly and moved to the door. \u201cMe other purpose in comin\u2019 was to ask ye to attend me supper tonight. No\u201d\u2014he cut her off as she was about to reply\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t give me yer answer now. Jus\u2019... think on it will ye? Please?\u201d</p><p>She stared. Had Mickey O\u2019Connor ever begged anyone in his entire life?</p><p>He grinned, quick and rueful. \u201cOh, aye, the pigs\u2019ll be flyin\u2019 today, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Silence looked at Mary\u2014just in time to rescue the beautiful little book from a curious taste.</p><p>Mary was still squawking her indignation when Fionnula came in the room a minute later, laden with a heavy tray.</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said, \u201cHimself has ordered breakfast for ye!\u201d</p><p>And while Silence watched in bemusement Fionnula began setting out a sumptuous breakfast. She\u2019d never have thought that Mickey O\u2019Connor would give in. He was a pirate\u2014a cruel, unyielding pirate\u2014and nothing else.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>ISABEL BECKINHALL, BARONESS Beckinhall, stepped from the carriage that afternoon and immediately saw a half-naked wretch lying in the gutter.</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cAmelia, darling, are you sure this is the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite sure,\u201d Lady Caire said briskly. She exited the carriage with the help of a brawny and impossibly handsome footman, then waved a hand. \u201cDisregard the less attractive sights.\u201d</p><p>Isabel glanced about the awful neighborhood ruefully. \u201cIf I did there would be nothing at all that I might look at. Whyever did you situate the home here?\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed. \u201cThe orphans come mostly from St. Giles, so the area is inescapable. The building however is not. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for the new home to be completed. We hope in another month or so it will be.\u201d</p><p>She sailed ahead to a miserable little door in an equally miserable building.</p><p>Isabel sighed and picked up her skirts to carefully follow. This was her first time attending the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children and she was beginning to think it would be her last. But Amelia had been quite persistent that Isabel join the syndicate. Amelia herself had been, along with Lady Hero Reading, one of the first lady patronesses of the home and she was rather enthusiastic about the endeavor.</p><p>Isabel glanced fondly at her friend. They were not close in age\u2014Amelia would die a thousand deaths before she revealed her years, but since her son was in the latter part of his thirties, she couldn\u2019t very well deny that she was well past her fifth decade. Isabel in contrast was but two and thirty.</p><p>Despite the disparity in their ages, though, they had much in common. Both ladies had married young and subsequently buried their older husbands. It was true that Isabel suspected from small hints here and there that Amelia\u2019s marriage had not been nearly as happy as her own to her dear Edmund, but Edmund and the late Baron Caire did have one thing in common: they\u2019d both been quite ridiculously rich. And while both titles and estates had been inherited after their deaths\u2014in Edmund\u2019s case by a distant, much younger cousin\u2014both men had left their widows very well off.</p><p>Which was why Isabel was about to attend a meeting of the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children today. There didn\u2019t seem to be much in the way of requirements to join the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate, but wealth was definitely encouraged.</p><p>The door to the wretched house was opened abruptly by a stern-looking child of about thirteen. She made a very nice curtsy. \u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Amelia permitted herself a small, approving smile. \u201cGood morning, Mary Whitsun. Isabel, this is Miss Mary Whitsun, the eldest orphan at the home and a great help to both Mr. Makepeace, the manager, and his sister, Mrs. Hollingbrook, the manageress. Mary, this is Lady Beckinhall.\u201d</p><p>Isabel smiled. \u201cMary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you, my lady,\u201d Mary said carefully as she dipped into another curtsy. She darted a glance at Amelia who gave an encouraging nod.</p><p>With this approval, Mary smiled and suddenly her grave little face lit up. She had rich, dark hair and a lovely creamy complexion. Once she\u2019d grown past her adolescent gawkiness, she\u2019d be a beauty if Isabel was any judge.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d Mary said in that same solemn voice.</p><p>They entered a hallway so narrow that the two could walk abreast only with difficulty. Isabel winced at the cracked and falling plaster on the walls. She could understand why a new building was needed.</p><p>Mary led them up two flights of stairs and into a windowless room.</p><p>\u201cThis is usually the children\u2019s classroom,\u201d Amelia said, \u201cbut Mr. Makepeace has graciously let us use it for our meetings once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Isabel murmured, looking around at the cramped little room. Three other ladies were already in attendance, sitting in rather rickety chairs.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Amelia whispered, as if reading her mind, \u201c \u2019tisn\u2019t the most comfortable of places, but we\u2014Lady Hero and I\u2014thought that it best to meet where we could also immediately receive reports from Mr. Makepeace and also inspect the children, the premises, et cetera. Ah, Hero.\u201d</p><p>Amelia broke off to press cheeks with a tall young woman. \u201cHero, this is Lady Beckinhall. You remember Lady Hero, do you not, Isabel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Lady Hero\u2019s cousin, Miss Bathilda Picklewood and I are friends.\u201d Isabel dipped in a curtsy as the other lady did, as well. Lady Hero wore an elegant silver and lavender gown, setting off her gorgeous light red hair. \u201cCongratulations on your recent nuptials, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero\u2019s pale cheeks pinkened. \u201cThank you, Lady Beckinhall. May I introduce you to my sister, Lady Phoebe Batten?\u201d</p><p>The girl was not much more than a child, a plump little creature with a squint. She was obviously terribly near-sighted, poor thing. Still, she smiled cheerfully as she dipped into a curtsy. \u201cI am pleased to meet you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Isabel nodded to the chit with a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd this is my dear husband\u2019s sister, Lady Margaret\u2014\u201d Lady Hero began, gesturing gracefully to a pretty, dark-haired woman, when the door opened again.</p><p>\u201cGoodness! What a dismal place!\u201d A girlish voice exclaimed.</p><p>Isabel turned to see Lady Penelope Chadwicke blow into the room. Lady Penelope hardly ever simply entered a room\u2014she was much too melodramatic for that. With glossy black hair, rosebud lips and pansy-purple eyes, she\u2019d been declared a beauty the moment she\u2019d come out, nearly three years ago. She wore a velvet cloak lined with swan\u2019s down, which she immediately doffed and threw to the much plainer woman following her. Underneath the cloak, her close-fitting jacket was champagne brocade overembroidered in pale rose and gold thread. Her skirts were pulled back to reveal a petticoat embroidered to match the jacket, the entire ensemble probably costing several hundred guineas.</p><p>But then Lady Penelope was the daughter of the Earl of Brightmore, one of the richest men in England and she was rumored to have a dowry worth a king\u2019s ransom.</p> <p>\u201cIs there tea?\u201d Lady Penelope looked about the room as if a tea tray might be hiding in the corner, then pouted prettily. \u201cTea and cakes would be so nice. The carriage ride here was simply devastating. I think my coachman was actually aiming for the holes in the cobblestones. And St. Giles!\u201d</p><p>For a moment Lady Penelope\u2019s gorgeous eyes widened as if struck speechless by the horror of it all. Then she turned with a snap and addressed the lady following her, who was still struggling with the velvet cloak. \u201cArtemis, you must go see about tea. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as weary by all of this as I. We need reviving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Penelope,\u201d Artemis murmured and retreated out the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd cakes!\u201d Lady Penelope called after her. \u201cI do so long for some darling little cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Penelope,\u201d the other woman answered from the hall.</p> <p>Isabel noted rather wryly that Lady Penelope might include her lady\u2019s companion in her \u201cweariness\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop her from sending the woman off on a servant\u2019s errand. Amelia used the time to introduce the other ladies to Lady Penelope.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lady Hero, I\u2019m not at all certain it is wise for the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate to meet in this part of London,\u201d Lady Penelope said, after the introductions were made. She gingerly lowered herself into one of the rickety chairs. \u201cIs it quite safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe as long as we meet in daylight and bring along footmen as guards, we shall be perfectly safe,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do to visit St. Giles after dark, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lady Penelope shivered dramatically. \u201cI hear that there is a masked man dressed as a harlequin who roams these parts, stealing pretty women away to his lair where he ravishes them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ghost of St. Giles is mostly a myth,\u201d came a deep, male voice from the doorway.</p><p>Lady Penelope gave a little shriek and Isabel turned to see a tall young man standing just inside the room. He was entirely in black, save for his white shirt, with no ornamentation of any kind on his clothes. He held a round-brimmed hat in his hand and his unpowdered brown hair was clubbed back very simply. He\u2019d frowned a bit at Lady Penelope\u2019s shriek and the expression made him seem rather dour. As he glanced about the room, Isabel had the distinct impression that this man didn\u2019t approve of any of the ladies.</p> <p>Isabel smiled widely\u2014with just a hint of wicked flirtation. \u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his eyes flicking over her form so swiftly that for a moment she thought she\u2019d imagined the look. She was suddenly conscious of the low, rounded neckline of her dark emerald gown. Then he met her eyes, his face perfectly expressionless. \u201cA man dressed as a theatrical harlequin does roam the streets hereabouts, ma\u2019am, but he is harmless.\u201d</p><p>The information didn\u2019t reassure Lady Penelope. She shrieked again and made to slump in her chair as if in a faint, but then seemed to remember the fragility of the chair and thought better of the idea.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce you all to Mr. Winter Makepeace, the manager of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children,\u201d Lady Hero said hastily. She introduced the ladies in turn and Mr. Makepeace bowed shortly to each. When he came to Isabel, she rather thought his bow was more a nod of the head.</p><p>\u201cMr. Makepeace,\u201d she drawled. Priggish gentlemen always managed to get her back up\u2014and they were so very easy to tease! \u201cHow... interesting to meet you. I vow you look rather young for such great responsibility.\u201d Despite his grave air he couldn\u2019t yet be thirty. Certainly he was younger than she.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve managed the home since my father\u2019s death two years ago,\u201d he replied calmly. \u201cAnd before that I was my father\u2019s right-hand man for many years. I do assure you my years are quite sufficient to run this home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d She bit her lip to keep from smiling. He was so woefully serious! The man had probably never laughed in his life.</p><p>Lady Penelope\u2019s little companion returned at that moment with several girls bearing trays of tea. She was a bit out of breath, for she was carrying a tray of dainty cakes herself, and seemed almost startled as Lady Hero took the time to introduce her to everyone present as Miss Artemis Greaves.</p> <p>Mr. Makepeace\u2019s expression softened\u2014although he still didn\u2019t smile\u2014as he was introduced to Miss Greaves. \u201cMay I take that?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her assent he took the tray of cakes and placed it on the sole table in the room.</p><p>Miss Greaves smiled rather shyly. \u201cThank you, Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Miss Greaves,\u201d he replied, his voice a pleasing rumble.</p><p>So he did know how to comport himself in the presence of a lady\u2014when he chose.</p><p>\u201cWill you give us a report on the home, Mr. Makepeace?\u201d Amelia asked as she poured the tea.</p><p>He nodded and proceeded to give a very dry account of the expenses of the home and how the children were situated. By the end of his little speech even Lady Hero was nodding.</p><p>\u201cEr, thank you, Mr. Makepeace,\u201d she said when there was a little silence indicating he was finished. \u201cHave you any suggestions as to how the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate may benefit the home at the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need money, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said without a hint of humor. \u201cEverything else is extraneous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but couldn\u2019t we have little jackets made for the children? At least the boys?\u201d Lady Penelope cried.</p><p>Mr. Makepeace looked at her. \u201cJackets, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Lady Penelope waved a vague hand. \u201cOh, yes! Scarlet ones\u2014they\u2019d look like little soldiers. Or perhaps lemon? Lemon is such an elegant color, I find.\u201d</p><p>She smiled brilliantly at the home\u2019s manager.</p><p>Mr. Makepeace cleared his throat. \u201cYellow also becomes dirty very easily. In my experience, children, especially boys, tend to run about and make a mess of themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pooh!\u201d Lady Penelope pouted. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep them inside?\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at Lady Penelope. It was hard to credit, but she seemed quite serious.</p><p>Isabel felt a grin tug at her lips. She widened her eyes at the manager. \u201cYes, Mr. Makepeace, tell us why you can\u2019t simply lock the little dears in their rooms?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a quick, dark look that made her catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lady Penelope understands the impossibility of keeping small boys immobile and clean at all times,\u201d Amelia murmured. \u201cIf that is all, Mr. Makepeace, we will not keep you further from your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am. Ladies.\u201d He bowed.</p><p>He was almost at the door when Lady Hero suddenly seemed to remember something. \u201cBut where is Mrs. Hollingbrook? I thought to see her today.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Makepeace didn\u2019t change expression, his body didn\u2019t jerk or stiffen, but somehow Isabel understood that the comment had given him pause.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cMy sister is no longer residing at the home,\u201d he said coolly and left the room before Lady Hero could make further comment.</p><p>Lady Penelope\u2019s high, silly voice broke the silence. \u201cGoodness! Surely he isn\u2019t thinking of running the home all by himself? A woman\u2019s touch is so important with children, I think, especially since Mr. Makepeace is a bachelor gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Several other ladies offered their opinions, but Isabel let the conversation flow about her as she bent her head in thought. Mr. Makepeace\u2019s gaze had met Isabel\u2019s in the second before he turned away, and she\u2019d realized something in that instant: Mr. Makepeace might not show it, but there were strong emotions churning under that cold exterior.</p><p>His eyes had been black with anger.</p><p>SILENCE SQUARED HER shoulders that night outside the dining room door. She\u2019d left Mary Darling happily playing with Moll, the maid from the kitchen, with Bert as guard, and now she was about to join Mickey O\u2019Connor for dinner. After all, he\u2019d asked this time instead of ordered. There was still that small part of her that was convinced she was making a mistake. But then she reminded herself that it had been he who had made the first move, had held out the hand of peace.</p><p>Surely that counted for something?</p><p>She pushed open the door before she wasted another five minutes pacing and dithering. The room within was long and, not surprisingly, gaudily decorated. Watered silks lined the walls in purple, deep blue, and green. Silence snorted under her breath. How appropriate: Charming Mickey had covered the walls of his dining room with the colors of a peacock.</p><p>Down the middle of the room several long tables had been set end-to-end, almost like what she supposed a medieval dining hall might have looked like. Mickey O\u2019Connor himself lounged at the far end of the table in a crimson velvet chair. He hadn\u2019t looked up at her entrance, but she didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he hadn\u2019t noticed her.</p><p>Silence began making her way down the line of tables. This end of the room seemed to be comprised of Mickey\u2019s crew, quite a rough-looking lot. She\u2019d gingerly passed the first couple of seated men when some type of signal was given. Suddenly all the pirates rose rather alarmingly, some so hastily their chairs crashed to the floor.</p><p>Silence blinked. \u201cAh... good evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evenin\u2019, ma\u2019am,\u201d the closest man said gruffly. Belatedly, he snatched the greasy tricorne from his head.</p><p>Each man greeted her in turn as she walked past them, and even though they were all rather murderous looking, Silence smiled shyly at them. She found a seat just past the pirates. It was across from Harry and next to a little man with spectacles who she\u2019d seen before in Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s throne room.</p><p>As she drew out the chair, the little man stood. \u201cNot here, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want you with him,\u201d the little man said nervously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s yer place,\u201d Harry said and nodded his chin toward the head of the table.</p><p>Silence looked at the head of the table and of course Mickey O\u2019Connor was watching her. They were all watching her.</p><p>Silence lifted her chin and made her way up the table, conscious that all eyes were upon her, until she stood beside the empty place at the right hand side of Mickey O\u2019Connor. For an awful moment she thought he would ignore her, but then he uncoiled his long limbs and stood, pulling out her chair for her.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hollingbrook,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m that pleased ye\u2019ve come down.\u201d</p><p>She nodded nervously and accepted the chair. She could feel his heat behind her as his hands took the sides of the chair and moved it forward to properly seat her. The scent of frankincense and lemons floated in the air, sensuous and somehow alarming. She thought she felt the brush of his fingers on her shoulder, but when she looked around he was already back in his seat.</p><p>He made a gesture and Tess and two other maidservants came in laden with trays of food. Incredibly\u2014decadently\u2014rich food. There were platters of thinly sliced pheasant, roasted rabbits, fish in wine, pigeon pie, fresh hothouse fruit, and enormous serving dishes heaped with oysters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mickey O\u2019Connor seemed to sense her faint disapproval as one of the serving maids placed a bowl of oysters before them. He cocked a black eyebrow at her. \u201cI\u2019m proud of me table, Mrs. Hollingbrook. I like good food and me men work better for it.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cThe price of those oysters could feed a St. Giles family for weeks, maybe months.\u201d</p><p>He smiled lazily. \u201cWould ye rather I dined upon bread and water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said in his deep, black velvet voice, \u201cthe oysters are already cooked and they don\u2019t keep at all well. \u2019Twould be a pity to let them go to waste.\u201d He picked up a shell and pulled the pearly, succulent flesh free with his fingers, holding it out temptingly.</p><p>Silence\u2019s stomach growled and she flushed.</p><p>The corner of his mouth curved with roguish charm. \u201cTisn\u2019t a sin to enjoy good food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA special treat once in a while is one thing,\u201d she said severely, \u201cbut you spend your life in constant excess. Does it not become boring after a bit?\u201d</p><p>He smiled wolfishly. \u201cNever.\u201d</p> <p>She reached for the oyster he still held, but he moved his hand back out of her way.</p><p>She looked at him coolly. \u201cI\u2019ll not eat out of your hand.\u201d</p><p>His bold mouth compressed\u2014he didn\u2019t like her refusal, but all he said was, \u201cAs ye wish, me darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He placed the oyster on her plate.</p><p>She bit into the savory oyster and contemplated telling him that she wasn\u2019t his darling, but it seemed a waste of breath. Besides, the oyster really was terribly delicious. She licked her lips and glanced up. Mickey O\u2019Connor was watching her, his black eyes narrowed, a corner of his mouth faintly curled. For a moment she felt caught in his gaze, her heart beating faster.</p><p>Then Tess bustled over with a tray of tiny tarts.</p> <p>More dishes were set in front of Mickey O\u2019Connor and without asking he served her something from each and filled her glass full of what proved to be sweet red wine. Silence ate and for several minutes she was quiet, her entire being concentrating on the food and filling her empty stomach, for although she\u2019d had a lovely breakfast it hadn\u2019t quite sated her after more than a day without food.</p><p>When she looked up again, she met Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s gaze. He was leaning back in his chair, his own food untouched, apparently content just to watch her eat.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s all quite good and I enjoyed it very much, but...\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYour food seems very rich.\u201d The pirates were still busily shoveling in their meal. Harry had got up and left the room, and now he was replaced with Bert. \u201cIt can\u2019t be good for your constitution to eat such rich foods regularly. Aren\u2019t you afraid of gout?\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor grinned and ran his hand down his flat stomach, his rings flashing on every finger. \u201cNever occurred to me, to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I suppose it wouldn\u2019t. You do like to revel in excess, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He raised a mocking eyebrow.</p> <p>She tilted her chin toward his hands. \u201cThose rings, for instance. They\u2019re so gaudy and they must be worth a fortune.\u201d</p><p>He spread his hands before him, fingers wide. \u201cOh, two fortunes at the very least, but I only started wi\u2019 one ring.\u201d</p><p>She peered at them curiously. His extravagant, jeweled rings seemed such a part of Mickey O\u2019Connor that she couldn\u2019t imagine him without them. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He held up his right index finger. A round ruby so dark it was nearly black sat in a worn gold ring. \u201cGot it on a raid with me first crew. In point o\u2019 fact it were me only part of the raid, it were worth so much. I forfeited me portion o\u2019 the gold for this here ring.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take the money instead?\u201d</p><p>He sat back and eyed her and she realized suddenly that his playfulness had vanished. He was quite serious now. \u201cBecause a poor man don\u2019t wear a ring like this. Everyone who saw me wear this could tell: Charmin\u2019 Mickey\u2019s come into his own.\u201d</p><p>Silence stared down at a lone pear remaining on her plate, thinking about his words. How odd. She\u2019d never been rich\u2014certainly not as rich as Mickey O\u2019Connor was now\u2014but she\u2019d never really desired great wealth. Certainly there had been times when she\u2019d looked longingly at a fan or heeled slippers in a shop window, but those were mostly fancies. Her everyday needs had always been quite satisfied. In contrast, Mr. O\u2019Connor, by his own admission, had spent his childhood in poverty. Perhaps that then was his basic reason for flaunting the wealth he had. Once one had longed for something\u2014hungered after it day and night\u2014would that well of want ever truly be filled?</p><p>She shivered at the thought and looked up. \u201cAnd the rest of your rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, picked up here and there. This one\u201d\u2014he waggled his left pinky where a great black baroque pearl sat\u2014\u201cI found in the chest o\u2019 a ship\u2019s captain. He had a bit o\u2019 a reputation, that one. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019d got it piratin\u2019 from the Frenchies.\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor grinned and popped a hothouse grape into his mouth.</p><p>She looked hastily away from the sight of him lounging like a sultan, and saw Fionnula sitting a little way down the table with Bran beside her.</p><p>\u201cShe worships Bran does our Fionnula,\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor said quietly, following her gaze.</p><p>\u201cDoes he worship her, as well?\u201d she asked, sharper than she meant.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor cocked his head, considering the matter. Then he shook it once. \u201cI very much doubt it. Bran worships power and money and little else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so very different than you, I suppose.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure why the information that Fionnula\u2019s sweetheart didn\u2019t love the girl as much as Fionnula did him troubled her, but it did.</p><p>\u201cDid ye look upon yer William like she does Bran?\u201d he asked so quietly she nearly didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Silence drew in her breath. He hadn\u2019t the right to speak William\u2019s name\u2014he should know that. But she lifted her chin and met Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s black eyes. \u201cI suppose I did.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought to provoke him, but he merely leaned his head on his hand, studying her. \u201cHow did ye meet him, this paragon o\u2019 a husband?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory. \u201cHe saved my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out shopping with Temperance, my sister, and I\u2019m afraid I got caught behind\u2014I was staring in a shopwindow.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cAt gloves and lace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a cream cake, if you must know,\u201d she said with dignity.</p><p>He breathed a chuckle and she felt a flush start on her neck. \u201cFather didn\u2019t approve of sweets so we only had them on special occasions\u2014Christmas and the like.\u201d He was still smiling so she hurried on. \u201cAnyway, I was rushing to catch up with my sister. I mustn\u2019t have been watching because all at once there was a great miller\u2019s cart right in front of my nose. If William hadn\u2019t grabbed me about the waist and pulled me back, my shoes would\u2019ve been quite ruined.\u201d Silence sliced off a bite of the pear. \u201cThere was a puddle, you see.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his ruby-red wine. \u201cSounds more like Will saved yer life rather than yer shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cart wasn\u2019t that close.\u201d Silence wrinkled her nose, because the cart had been rather close and the first thing William had done upon setting her on her feet again was to give her a scolding. Not that she was about to tell Mickey O\u2019Connor that.</p><p>\u201cI thanked him,\u201d she continued, \u201cand went off with Temperance and thought never to see him again. But then the next day, he came calling to ask Father for permission to court me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did yer da say?\u201d Mickey O\u2019Connor asked as if he were greatly interested.</p><p>\u201cFather was not at first pleased.\u201d Silence saw a look cross Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s face and hastened to add, \u201cWilliam was a bit older than me, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much older?\u201d</p><p>Silence poked at the half-eaten pear. \u201cFourteen years.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Mickey O\u2019Connor watching her and for the life of her she could not read his black eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not such a great age difference as all that,\u201d she said and heard the defensive note in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cHow old were ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen,\u201d she muttered, then said louder, \u201cHe sailed very soon thereafter, but before he left he brought me a posy of violets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get ye the cream cake ye were moonin\u2019 over in the bakery window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t mooning,\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cAnd, no, whyever would he buy me a cream cake? It\u2019s a gift for a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what ye wanted,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cViolets are much more suitable.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhile he was away at sea he sent me wonderful letters from his travels, with all sorts of descriptions of the foreign places he saw. Then when he came home he would call upon me. It was so lovely,\u201d she said dreamily. \u201cWilliam would take me to fairs and puppet shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d His voice was expressionless.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI married him. I was one and twenty by that time so Father would not have been able to stop me. But I wanted his blessing and he gave it to us. He said that William had shown his devotion for three years and that he was satisfied that he\u2019d make me a proper husband.\u201d</p><p>She paused, but Mickey O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She looked down at her plate. She\u2019d eaten the pear as she talked and she no longer felt hungry. The empty desperation was gone\u2014all that was left was the vague queasiness from having overindulged. Some of the pirates were laughing now as they finished their meal, while Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s little secretary had opened a book beside his plate and was making notes as he ate.</p><p>\u201cWe were happy,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWe lived in Wapping, by the ships. I would go to the docks and watch the tall ships come in, looking for the Finch, even when I knew she wasn\u2019t expected back for months. And when she did dock\u201d\u2014she closed her eyes, remembering\u2014\u201cWilliam would come to see me first thing. I always ran into his arms. We were happy. So happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet when ye needed him most he didn\u2019t believe ye,\u201d she heard him murmur. \u201cHe didn\u2019t listen to ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only needed him to believe me because of what you\u2019d done,\u201d she pointed out, but her voice lacked heat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>She wiped her cheeks. Where last night she\u2019d felt rage, now all she held inside was a deep sadness. \u201cIs that what you think? That because he didn\u2019t believe me, because he didn\u2019t listen to me, he must not have loved me? That our happiness was but a sham?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, but he merely took a drink of his wine, watching her.</p><p>Had her happiness been a sham? At the time she hadn\u2019t thought so. Life with William had been perfect, it seemed. He was away for long periods, true, but when he did come back it was like a honeymoon every time.</p><p>She frowned, troubled by the thought. What would her marriage have been like if William hadn\u2019t been a sea captain? If they\u2019d lived together day in and day out like most married couples?</p><p>Silence heaved a sigh and looked around the table. No one was paying them any mind\u2014although she suspected that was more because of Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s presence than that they hadn\u2019t noticed her tears.</p><p>She turned back to Mr. O\u2019Connor. \u201cWhere are your women?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved slightly. \u201cWhat women?\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand, wondering if she\u2019d drunk too much wine with her meal. \u201cThe women you always have. Your... your whores.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a sip of wine and set down his glass. \u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her brow. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre ye disappointed?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cWhat do you know of how I feel or think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said as he waved a youth over. The boy held a tray of sweets. Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s hand hovered over the selection before he chose something with a candied cherry on top. He turned back to her with the sweet in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s the fascinatin\u2019 thing about ye, Silence, m\u2019love. I know what me men will think afore I tell them we\u2019re raidin\u2019, what me whores will think at the end o\u2019 a night, even what Lad will think about tomorrow\u2014mostly me bed and a nice stew bone. But ye\u2014ye I cannot fathom. I look into yer pretty green-brown-blue eyes, and I haven\u2019t the tiniest idea what yer thinkin\u2019 about. What ye truly feel.\u201d</p><p>Silence stared at him in wonder, then blurted, \u201cWhy should you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d said Mickey O\u2019Connor, holding the sweet to her lips, waiting while she accepted it into her mouth, then smiling almost as if he could taste the melting sugar on her tongue himself, \u201cis a very good question.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>As soon as dark fell in the king\u2019s garden, a bird\u2019s song filled the air. Three notes and the other two nephews were nodding their heads, but Clever John had his ears stopped so he could not fall under the spell of the sweet birdsong. As soon as the king\u2019s nephews were asleep, a wonderful bird alit on the cherry tree. Its feathers were every color of the rainbow. The bird began pecking at the king\u2019s cherries. But up jumped Clever John and seized the bird by its delicate neck.</p> <p>Whereupon the bird turned into a lovely\u2014and quite nude\u2014woman....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Mick watched as Silence ate the confection from his fingers. He felt a strange satisfaction in feeding her himself that wasn\u2019t dulled even when she realized what she\u2019d done and drew away, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>He was enjoying himself, he realized with something like surprise. He\u2019d never chased a woman for more than a day or so\u2014a week at most. They all fell at his feet, some within minutes. He knew, cynically, that his attraction couldn\u2019t all be put down to his pretty face. His power, his money drew them just as much if not more.</p><p>But not Silence.</p><p>Mick smiled to himself and sat back to select a sweetmeat. Silence disliked him, disobeyed him, argued with him, and was all but starting a rebellion amongst his people, and still he indulged her.</p> <p>\u201cI must be getting back to my rooms,\u201d Silence said and stood.</p><p>Mick frowned with displeasure. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOne o\u2019 the maids is watchin\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Mary wakes she\u2019ll want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked again, biting into a sweetmeat. This discussion wasn\u2019t to his fancy, but sparring with her was.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said slowly, looking at him as if he were lack-witted, \u201cshe\u2019s only a baby and she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies,\u201d Mick pronounced, \u201care a great trouble.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, not bothering to reply this time, and started marching to the door.</p><p>Mick sighed. \u201cHave the rest o\u2019 the sweetmeats brought to me rooms,\u201d he told Tris and rose to follow her. Lad, who\u2019d been lying beside his chair, got up as well, padding quietly behind him out into the hallway.</p><p>Silence didn\u2019t seem surprised when he caught up with her in the hall. \u201cYou should come to see Mary more often yourself. She is your daughter after all. Perhaps then she might learn to call you something else besides Bad.\u201d</p><p>She quickened her pace.</p><p>He shrugged, keeping up with her shorter strides easily. \u201cHappens I\u2019ve other things to do, and as I say, babies are a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. You say that as if you\u2019ve made a great discovery.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just to irritate her, and she quickened her step again. They were nearly running through the halls now.</p><p>\u201cWhyever did you bother acknowledging her in the first place, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cSurely it would\u2019ve been easy simply to turn her away. Unscrupulous men do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at him as if she\u2019d scored a hit with that \u201cunscrupulous,\u201d but he\u2019d been called worse in his time.</p><p>Much worse.</p><p>Still, it wouldn\u2019t do to let her think he was going soft on her. Mick stepped in front of her and slammed his hand against the hallway wall, putting the length of his arm in her path.</p><p>She squeaked and bumped into him, soft breasts pushing for just an instant against his muscles. Lad sat down in the hall, looking back and forth alertly between them.</p><p>Silence straightened and glared at Mick.</p><p>He leaned down close\u2014close enough to catch the scent of lavender in her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine, m\u2019love,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand I won\u2019t be lettin\u2019 go o\u2019 anything that belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cMary is not a \u2018thing.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut the principle\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how a father should treat a daughter,\u201d she said, her voice softening.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her\u2014that tone might creep under his skin if he let it.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes widened pleadingly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a father?\u201d</p><p>He refused to let the memories surface. For a moment he was still, making sure they were properly stowed away, and then smiled. \u201cWhy, darlin\u2019 did ye think mine was a virgin birth?\u201d</p><p>She blushed as he knew she would. \u201cNo, of course not, but surely\u2014\u201d</p><p>She might have said more, but he straightened away from her. Her questions were hitting too close to home.</p><p>She blinked and looked around.</p><p>\u201cYe were hurryin\u2019 to see the child, were ye not?\u201d he asked and opened the door to her room.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Mary Darling,\u201d she said as she sailed into the room. She halted suddenly and turned. \u201cBut it should be Mary O\u2019Connor, shouldn\u2019t it? She\u2019s your daughter after all.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and blinked. Mary O\u2019Connor. It was a good name. A proper name.</p><p>He shook his head to dispel the thought. \u201cOff with ye now,\u201d he said to the maid, hovering near the door.</p><p>She bobbed a curtsy and left without a word.</p><p>Lad padded around the room, sniffing at corners, before going to settle by the fireplace.</p><p>Mick turned to look at Silence who was bending over the baby\u2019s cot. \u201cHappen she mightn\u2019t want to be known far and wide as me daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Silence hissed, then glanced at him and whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s just a baby. Whyever wouldn\u2019t she want to be your daughter?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and came to stare broodingly down at the lass. \u201cI\u2019ve many an enemy.\u201d</p><p>The child\u2019s cheeks were flushed deep pink, her black locks plastered with sweat to her forehead. One chubby fist was flung over her head. She was a pretty little thing, there was no doubt.</p><p>Mick frowned. \u201cDoes she often breathe so loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Silence whispered worriedly. She laid the back of her hand against the child\u2019s forehead and something deep inside him twisted.</p><p>Her palms had been rough, but the back of her hand was soft and cool as she laid it on his forehead and smiled wearily into his eyes. \u201cHave ye a fever then, Mickey, me love?\u201d</p><p>Mick felt sweat start on his back. Those memories were buried deep\u2014he\u2019d made damned sure of it, but letting Silence in was resurrecting them. He had the sudden urge to order her from his rooms, from his palace. But he couldn\u2019t do that now. It was far too late. She was already in his palace, in his life. He couldn\u2019t go back\u2014and wouldn\u2019t even if he could. She was so close to him now that it was as if he held her in his palm like a glowing ember\u2014and gave thanks for the pain even as he inhaled the smoke from his burning flesh.</p><p>Mick\u2019s chest expanded. He breathed in Silence\u2019s scent, breathed in both pain and comfort. \u201cIs she ill, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Silence bit her bottom lip. \u201cShe\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Mick nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll send for a doctor.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her eyes wide, the gray swirling with the green and the brown, her hand laid so tenderly on the baby\u2019s head. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stay to hear the rest of her sentence. The baby needed a doctor... and the room was haunted by memories.</p><p>SILENCE\u2019S HANDS TREMBLED as she wrung out a cloth and patted Mary Darling\u2019s little cheeks. The toddler was so hot that Silence could feel the burning of her skin even through the cloth.</p><p>The heat worried Silence, but it was Mary\u2019s awful listlessness that struck terror in her heart. Mary\u2019d had chills and fevers before. She\u2019d once whimpered all night long, tugging on her ear fretfully, until in the morning a clear liquid had drained from the ear and she\u2019d slept calmly. Silence had stayed up many nights rocking and walking Mary Darling when she wasn\u2019t feeling well. And in all those times Mary had been grumpy and sad and fretful, but she\u2019d never been listless.</p><p>\u201cHimself has sent for the doctor,\u201d Fionnula said as she came in with a fresh bowl of water.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just so hot,\u201d Silence murmured as she wrung out the cloth and applied it again. \u201cI\u2019ve taken her out of her frock and stays, but she\u2019s still on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe mam used to say as the fever was to burn away the illness inside,\u201d Fionnula offered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps so, but I\u2019ve seen fever kill, as well,\u201d Silence murmured.</p><p>There had been a little boy, new to the home and rather sickly. Winter had suspected he\u2019d not had enough to eat in his short life. The child had caught a fever and within two days had simply faded away. Silence had wept quietly in bed that night, holding Mary close to her chest. Winter had said with awful pragmatism that some children didn\u2019t live and one just had to face that fact. But even he had worn a drawn expression when he\u2019d said it and he was especially nice to the small boys in the home for weeks afterward.</p><p>Silence shuddered. Mary couldn\u2019t fade away. She couldn\u2019t imagine living if the little girl died.</p><p>There was a murmur of voices in the hall and then the door opened to reveal Mickey O\u2019Connor ushering in a rotund little man.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d the doctor asked in a bass voice that seemed too large for his body.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s burning with fever,\u201d Silence said. She had to fight to keep a quaver out of her voice.</p><p>The doctor placed a hand on the baby\u2019s chest and stilled.</p><p>Silence started to ask something, but the man held up his other hand.</p><p>After another moment he took his hand off Mary\u2019s chest and turned to Silence. \u201cPardon my rudeness, ma\u2019am, but I was feeling for the wee one\u2019s heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Silence grasped her hands together at her waist to still their trembling. \u201cCan you help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can,\u201d the doctor said briskly. \u201cNever you fear.\u201d</p><p>He opened a black case, revealing a half dozen sharp lancets in different sizes. Silence rubbed her palms together nervously. She knew that the doctor meant to cut Mary.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor had been lounging by the fireplace, but he stirred at the sight of the lancets in their fitted pockets. \u201cD\u2019ye have to cut her?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s face was serious. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way, sir, to let the evil drain from her body.\u201d</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s mouth tightened, but he nodded once before turning his face to the fireplace.</p><p>The doctor chose a delicately wicked looking tool and then fished out a little tin dish. He looked at Silence, his face grave. \u201cPerhaps you can hold her upright upon your lap. If you can keep her from moving in any way, it\u2019ll be for the best.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence picked up Mary gently. She\u2019d always hated bloodletting, ever since she was a little girl and had had to be bled three times for some childhood illness. If she could save Mary\u2019s tender skin the sharp scalpel, she\u2019d offer her own arm, but this must be done. She knew that.</p><p>The doctor had been watching her and now he nodded at her approvingly. \u201cCan you hold the cup for me?\u201d he asked Fionnula.</p><p>The maid stepped forward and took the cup.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d the doctor murmured, and with quick efficiency, lifted Mary\u2019s chemise and made a cut high on her thigh.</p> <p>Mary flinched but made no sound.</p><p>Bright red blood flowed from the wound.</p><p>It seemed to take forever before the doctor murmured, \u201cI think that will do it.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a clean cloth to the wound and wound a strip of linen around Mary\u2019s leg, tying it off neatly.</p><p>\u201cNow then,\u201d the doctor said as he wiped and put away his lancet. \u201cA little broth will help enormously, I believe. Take a small piece of chicken and boil it with a sprig of parsley and two of thyme. Strain the broth and add a spoonful of white wine, the finest you can find. Serve this broth to the child thrice daily, making sure she drinks a full teacup if possible.\u201d He glanced at Silence sharply. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, stroking Mary\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGood. Good. I also have this elixir.\u201d He produced a small blue glass bottle. \u201cMy own concoction and I fancy a very effective one. A spoonful in a small cup of water before bedtime. Now\u201d\u2014he picked up his bag and stared severely at Silence and Fionnula\u2014\u201cshould she come out in spots or vomit up bile, you are to call for me at once, yes?\u201d</p><p>Silence nodded again, her lips trembling. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The doctor laid his hand on Mary\u2019s head and turned toward the door without another word. Mickey O\u2019Connor turned and silently followed him, pausing before he exited. \u201cDo ye have all that ye\u2019ll be needing for her?\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip to stop it trembling. \u201cI believe so.\u201d</p><p>His hesitated and for a moment she thought he was about to say something, but in the end he left without a word.</p> <p>\u201cWE\u2019LL STORM HIS cursed palace and take her out by force if need be!\u201d Concord Makepeace declared ferociously the next day. \u201cBad enough that she\u2019s ruined her own reputation, but to sully the good name of the home is too much!\u201d</p><p>Concord\u2019s graying hair was coming down from his queue and he looked rather like an aging Samson.</p><p>A hotheaded, aging Samson who\u2019d not fully thought through the consequences of an attack on an armed pirate stronghold.</p><p>Winter sighed to himself. He\u2019d known the drawbacks to informing his brothers of Silence\u2019s plight, but he couldn\u2019t in all conscious let them remain in the dark.</p><p>Even if Concord\u2019s undirected anger and worry were giving Winter a headache.</p><p>\u201cThe palace is a fortress,\u201d Winter pointed out calmly. \u201cAnd we are only two. If we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d came a voice in the doorway of the home\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>Winter met the green eyes of his brother Asa, his own eyebrow slowly raising. Although he\u2019d sent word to Asa\u2019s rented rooms, he hadn\u2019t expected him to actually show up. Asa hadn\u2019t been heard from in nearly a year. For all Winter had known, his middle brother had sailed overseas.</p> <p>Yet here he was, as brawny as ever. Asa had the shoulders of a bull and a mane of tawny hair like a young lion. The last year had given him a few differences, however. His scarlet coat was intricately embroidered at the cuffs and skirts, and his shirt, while plain, was of fine linen. Winter\u2019s eyes narrowed. Interesting. However his brother made his living, he was apparently doing quite well for himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Concord, never tactful, asked aggressively. \u201cYou don\u2019t respond to letters, you don\u2019t bother to make an appearance at Temperance\u2019s wedding or the christening of my new daughter, or when Silence lost her husband at sea, and yet you think you can simply trot back home?\u201d</p><p>Winter winced and murmured quietly, \u201cWe do need his help, Concord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Concord folded bulging arms across his chest. Like Winter, he dressed plainly in black and brown, his hat round and uncocked. \u201cWe\u2019ve done just fine without him for the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before Silence went to live in a pirate\u2019s house,\u201d Winter pointed out drily.</p><p>Asa, who\u2019d propped one massive shoulder against the door frame, straightened now. \u201cWhat pirate? You said in your letter to me that Silence was in dire danger. You never mentioned a pirate.\u201d</p><p>Concord snorted.</p><p>\u201cMickey O\u2019Connor,\u201d Winter said quietly before Concord could go off on another tirade.</p><p>\u201cCharming Mickey O\u2019Connor?\u201d Asa asked incredulously. \u201cWhat is Silence doing with him? Did he kidnap her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Asa pulled out a kitchen chair and sat, planting his elbows on the table. \u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year a baby was left on Silence\u2019s doorstep,\u201d Winter explained. \u201cSilence named the child Mary Darling and brought her here to the home. This was after Temperance married Lord Caire and was no longer managing the home with me. Silence took her position. She cared for all the children, of course, but she made Mary Darling her special pet.\u201d</p><p>Concord stirred. \u201cThe baby was like her own. When William died, I think the child gave her comfort.\u201d</p><p>Winter nodded. \u201cI returned home from a trip to Oxford several days ago to find Silence gone. When I confronted her at O\u2019Connor\u2019s palace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s house by yourself?\u201d Asa interrupted.</p><p>Winter met his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>For a moment a startled look crossed Asa\u2019s face, and then he slowly nodded. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Winter inclined his head. \u201cShe seemed quite as usual. She was dressed in her own clothes and frankly did not appear to be overly happy that I\u2019d come to her rescue. She said that Mickey O\u2019Connor was Mary Darling\u2019s father\u2014\u201d</p><p>Asa swore and Concord glared at him.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and that O\u2019Connor had brought her and the child to his home to protect them from his enemies. I could not persuade her to leave so I came away again. Now, however, there are questions being asked about where exactly Silence is. If the truth that she\u2019s living with a notorious pirate becomes known...\u201d</p><p>Winter shrugged. He didn\u2019t need to tell his brothers what such information would do to the home\u2019s good standing\u2014and the money it needed from its patrons and donors. One whiff of impropriety and the fickle aristocrats would find some other charity to amuse themselves with.</p><p>\u201cYou should have picked her up and dragged her out bodily,\u201d Concord growled.</p><p>Winter arched an eyebrow. \u201cPast O\u2019Connor and a half dozen of his men?\u201d</p><p>Concord grimaced.</p><p>Asa rolled his eyes. \u201cTrust you to advocate a near-suicidal action based on moral outrage.\u201d</p><p>Concord half rose from his chair, bellowing incoherently. Asa rose as well and for the next several minutes the kitchen was filled with loud masculine rage.</p><p>Winter sighed and closed his eyes, raising one hand to gently rub his temple. He\u2019d had a lifetime to observe the strained relations between his elder brothers. There were times when they could almost make it through a family meal without resorting to shouts, but those occasions were rare and becoming rarer. Concord dealt with the tension by assuming an unyielding line: He was entirely correct and by contrast everything Asa espoused was entirely incorrect. Winter had once overheard Temperance muttering under her breath that their brother should\u2019ve better been christened Discord.</p><p>Asa\u2019s response to this ceaseless state of friction was to disappear. It was a constant worry for their eldest sister, Verity. She feared\u2014and Winter privately concurred\u2014that someday their brother would go away and simply not come back.</p><p>His brothers\u2019 voices died.</p><p>Winter opened his eyes to find both Asa and Concord scowling at him.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cMight we continue this discussion now?\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at the corner of Asa\u2019s wide mouth. \u201cWe might.\u201d He sobered. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why Silence trusted this pirate to speak the truth about his supposed enemies. Has he seduced her, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Concord banged a hard fist on the table. \u201cHow dare you question our sister\u2019s virtue?\u201d</p><p>Asa looked at Concord coldly. \u201cI find that people are capable of many different things. How do you know Silence wouldn\u2019t fall under Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s spell? He\u2019s rumored to be quite pretty.\u201d</p><p>Concord opened his mouth, but Winter beat him to it. \u201cWe know because we have watched Silence in the last year,\u201d he said quietly, but pointedly.</p><p>A ruddy flush lit Asa\u2019s cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cSilence might be as susceptible to sin as any other female,\u201d Winter said, \u201cbut she would never be seduced by O\u2019Connor. You know her history with him. What you may not know is that after William\u2019s cargo was returned, relations between he and Silence were... strained. He perished on his last journey at sea and Silence blamed her confrontation with O\u2019Connor for the sorrow in her marriage before William left.\u201d</p><p>For a moment none of the men spoke. Winter looked at his brothers and wondered if they felt as helpless as he. He\u2019d wanted to break things\u2014to kill O\u2019Connor\u2014when he\u2019d seen Silence after her night with the pirate. He hadn\u2019t of course. Such violence would not have helped their sister.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t stopped him dreaming of blood for weeks afterward, though.</p><p>\u201cSo you see,\u201d Winter said quietly, \u201cSilence must truly think that there is danger for the child. She\u2019d never consent to be in the same building with him otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that presents an additional problem,\u201d Asa said.</p><p>Winter arched an eyebrow in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cBesides the difficulty of getting into the palace and rescuing her,\u201d Asa said, \u201cwe will also need to have a place where we can safely bring both her and the child. A place that neither Mickey nor his enemies can find.\u201d</p><p>Winter nodded slowly. \u201cI believe your assessment is correct. She will never leave willingly unless she knows we can keep the child safe.\u201d</p><p>Concord leaned forward placing his massive forearms on the table. \u201cIn that case it\u2019s obvious who we should bring into this.\u201d</p><p>SILENCE WAS TEARING her heart out over the child.</p><p>Two mornings later Mick stood over Silence\u2019s bed and watched her sleep. There were smudges of exhaustion and fear under her eyes, her brown hair was coming down from a plait, and she clutched the sheet in one fragile fist like a little girl afraid of night terrors.</p><p>She slept as if dead\u2014she\u2019d not moved as he\u2019d entered her room. He brushed a stray lock of hair away from her eyes. Her breath didn\u2019t even hitch.</p><p>Mick sighed and straightened. It was not yet dawn\u2014still dark out. She\u2019d spent the last two nights and the day in between nursing the child. He\u2019d stayed away, but he\u2019d had Fionnula report the happenings in the sickroom three or four times a day.</p><p>The child was growing thinner, her little body lit from within by a fire that would not die. If the fire consumed her\u2014</p><p>Mick clenched his jaw and turned away from the bed. He left without glancing in the direction of the child\u2019s cot, crossing through his own room and out into the hallway.</p><p>Harry looked up as Mick closed the door quietly behind him. Mick nodded at the guard and turned to stride down the hall. If the babe died, Silence\u2019s heart would be torn from her chest as surely as if a wild animal had savaged her. He had no heart himself, but he\u2019d heard they were delicate things and easily broken. Mick growled low under his breath as he made his way to the front of the house. He knew how to protect Silence from knives and fists, from poverty and want, but he had no idea how\u2014or even if\u2014he could protect her from her own soft heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mick passed the half-dozen guards he\u2019d stationed at the front door and went out into the new morning. He glanced up at the grayish-pink sky and then studied his palace. It was a peacock cleverly disguised as a crow. There was no indication of what lay behind the deceptively simple plain wood door. One would never know from looking at it that the door was reinforced from behind with iron.</p><p>There was one other entry to the palace\u2014a door leading to the small courtyard behind\u2014and that was guarded, as well. From the outside, his palace appeared to be a dozen or more narrow row houses, built right next to each other. In reality, it was all one building inside and the doors to the house fa\u00e7ades had been boarded up from inside long ago.</p><p>Mick grunted and turned to walk up the street. He might seem overprotected against attack, but then he had an unrelenting enemy.</p><p>A shadow moved in a narrow alley as he passed it and Mick whirled, a knife held ready in his hand. Lad emerged into the weak light, his ears laid back, his head down in submission.</p> <p>\u201cJaysus,\u201d Mickey breathed in disgust and shoved the knife back in the sheath strapped to his forearm.</p><p>He started down the street again and the dog trotted out happily and fell into step behind him.</p><p>The daylight people of St. Giles were already on the streets. The ones he passed now did honest work\u2014more or less\u2014porters, hawkers, chair men, night soil men, and beggars. They gave him a wide berth, careful not to meet his eyes. They knew him of course. He was their king and they were properly respectful. The river and the boats he lived on were to the east and he\u2019d be nearer his work if he lived in Wapping or some other place in the East End of London. But Mick had been born and grown up in St. Giles. Had run the streets like a feral young wolf cub as a boy, had fucked his first woman here. Killed his first man. This was his home and when he\u2019d made his fortune he\u2019d built his palace in St. Giles.</p><p>And now there was one more thing that held him here.</p><p>He crossed a street and looked up. The spire of the new St. Giles-in-the-Fields loomed ahead. Mildew had destroyed the old church. Rumor had it that the mildew had fed upon the damp from the rotting plague corpses buried beneath the church flagstones. Certainly the air in the old church had held an evil stink. But no more. The modern church was clean and elegant, a far cry from the old building. Mick grunted. The new church had been built by nobles living outside of London City proper. He wondered what the locals\u2014the ones who actually lived by the church\u2014thought of the new building.</p> <p>Mick skirted the church, coming upon the graveyard wall. A little way farther and the gate came into sight. He pushed it open. The graveyard was old, of course, the monuments moss-covered, some leaning as if the underground inhabitants had tried to push their way free from the earth. Mick made his way through the crooked rows, Lad padding silently behind him, and even though St. Giles lay just beyond a small wall, the clatter and hustle without was muffled. The graveyard held its own insulated atmosphere.</p><p>Mick watched carefully as he neared the grave he\u2019d come to see, for he wasn\u2019t alone in the graveyard.</p><p>The Vicar of Whitechapel stood looking down at her headstone and the freshly mounded earth. For a man who had terrorized the East End of London for the better part of a decade he didn\u2019t look that intimidating. He was of average height, wiry rather than heavily muscled, his shoulder-length hair graying, and his features pleasant.</p><p>\u201cShe called your name,\u201d Charlie said as Mick halted on the far side of the new grave. \u201cAs she was dying. Pity you didn\u2019t see fit to visit her on her deathbed.\u201d</p><p>Mick smiled widely, easily, as if the news that she\u2019d called for him wasn\u2019t a white-hot poker thrust through his chest. \u201cBusy, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Charlie turned then, looking at Mickey full on, and revealing the horror that was the left side of his face. His skin had melted or burned off his face. The eye socket was merely a hardened gouge, his nostril destroyed, his lips pulled down into his chin. The ear was a melted rim and the hair on the left side of his head was in tufts as if most of it had been pulled out by the very roots.</p> <p>Mick\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYer gettin\u2019 handsomer by the hour, Charlie.\u201d</p><p>The Vicar\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change\u2014but then many of his facial muscles had been destroyed. His remaining brown eye glittered with mad hatred, though. A wise man would step away from such vicious anger.</p><p>Mick leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ll not let ye drive me from me home, old man.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyelid drooped. \u201cWhat makes you think you have any say-so in the matter, boy?\u201d</p><p>Mick\u2019s smile hardened. \u201cWhat makes ye think I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Charlie shrugged one shoulder\u2014the other had scarring. \u201cMight be because I know you\u2019ve got your babe hid in that palace of yours\u2014along with a woman called Silence Hollingbrook. I find that interesting, I do. Seems to me that it\u2019d be a fair trade: your woman for my own.\u201d</p><p>Mick shrugged himself as if Silence didn\u2019t matter to him, but his heart had begun to beat in triple time. Of course the Vicar had found out about Silence. Of course he\u2019d know that she was different simply because she\u2019d stayed when none of his other women had.</p><p>\u201cI never took yer woman,\u201d Mick said.</p> <p>\u201cAye, but you tried to.\u201d</p><p>Mick raised an eyebrow. Charlie wasn\u2019t making sense, but then he\u2019d long known the man was mad.</p><p>\u201cAnd that babe?\u201d The Vicar tutted. \u201cI hear she\u2019s a sickly thing. Like to die soon. That must weigh upon your heart most sadly.\u201d</p><p>Mick looked at the Vicar. He was such a small man for all the malice he held inside of him. Long ago Mick had wondered why Charlie was made the way he was. What had carved away all sympathy, all respect for other men. What had made him the vicious, violent bastard he was.</p><p>But he\u2019d learned to stop wondering. It made no never mind why the Vicar was the way he was. As well to ask why a viper struck and killed for no reason. It was simply the way of nature.</p><p>\u201cYe know as well as I that I lost whatever heart I once had long ago,\u201d Mick replied without emotion, a simple statement of fact. \u201cIf the babe lives, or if she dies, it makes no difference to me. I\u2019ll still eat sweetmeats on the morrow and taste the sugar on me tongue, still fuck women and feel the pleasure in me bollocks. And, Charlie\u2014mark me well, now\u2014I\u2019ll still kill ye and laugh in yer ugly face as I do it.\u201d</p><p>He walked away then, carefully not looking at the new headstone with the tiny angel carved at the top. Lad glanced up from sniffing a weed and fell into step with Mick as he passed. The temptation to attack now was almost overwhelming. His hands, balled into fists by his side, shook with the urge to strike the older man and put an end to this once and for all.</p><p>But Charlie never went anywhere without a half dozen guards. One lounged behind a tree, another two stood by the wall, and the remaining three were out of sight, but Mick had no doubt that they were nearby. Strange. Only a year ago, he might\u2019ve damned the guards and attacked Charlie anyway. Now, Mick had the knowledge at the back of his mind that if he failed, he\u2019d not be there to protect Silence\u2014Charlie was mad enough to revenge himself on Silence even if Mick were dead. The realization was not a pleasant one\u2014that only he stood between Charlie and Silence.</p><p>He nodded ironically to one of the Vicar\u2019s men stationed at the churchyard gate as he passed by. Six men could overwhelm him, he supposed, if the Vicar chose to attack now, but that wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s way. Charlie preferred the indirect hit, the slow poison that systematically destroyed a person before they were even dead.</p><p>Mick halted in the middle of the street and threw back his head to gaze at the blue sky overhead. It was going to be a rare clear day in London, the sun shining so brightly one could almost believe in a God and all his angels, of a mother\u2019s love and a boy\u2019s innocent dreams. He closed his eyes and saw her brown eyes, sad and defeated and filled with tears as she\u2019d sung to him.</p><p>Take me in your arms, my love</p><p>And blow the candle out.</p><p>A shouted curse made Mick open his eyes and spin to glare at a drover with a heard of sheep.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened and he was stuttering apologies even as Mick turned away. Mick walked the rest of the way home without conscious thought. When he got to his own door Lad trotted up the steps behind him. Mick shot him a look and for a moment the dog froze, one paw still lifted, and rolled his eyes sheepishly at him.</p><p>Mick sighed. \u201cIn with ye, then.\u201d</p><p>Lad\u2019s jaw dropped open in a grin and he happily capered into the palace.</p><p>\u201cHow were ye ever a bull-baitin\u2019 dog?\u201d Mick muttered to the animal as they tromped through the house. \u201cThe bulls must\u2019ve laughed themselves silly when ye were thrown in the pit.\u201d</p><p>Lad panted beside him happily, not a thought in his boneheaded brain.</p><p>They reached the upper floors and Mick strode down the hallway quietly. Bert was dozing outside Silence\u2019s room, but straightened hastily as Mick neared.</p><p>\u201cAre they awake?\u201d Mick asked softly.</p><p>Bert blinked sleepily. \u201cFionnula left jus\u2019 a minute ago to fetch some tea. I \u2019aven\u2019t \u2019eard a peep.\u201d</p><p>Mick nodded and entered his room, shrugging out of his coat and waistcoat. He preferred the freedom of just his shirt in his own home. He crossed to the connecting door and cracked it carefully, peering in. Silence lay on the bed, her form still, save for the slow rise and fall of her chest. He was about to shut the door again when a squeak came from the cot on the far side of the bed.</p><p>Mick was across the room in a second.</p><p>The child lay on her back, her eyes open, yawning sleepily. She saw him and her tiny pink lips trembled, her mouth turning down.</p><p>Mick frowned at her. \u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>His admonishment had the opposite effect from what he intended. Her mouth opened and she let out a fretful wail.</p><p>Mick glanced at the bed. Silence hadn\u2019t moved at the sound. She was exhausted from hours of nursing the brat. Fionnula had left the room and might not be back for some time, and Bert would be very little help.</p><p>Mick scowled at the toddler. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye want?\u201d</p><p>She sobbed and lifted her arms to him.</p><p>He blinked, taken aback. Surely she didn\u2019t want him. But another wail gave him very little choice.</p><p>He lifted the little girl from the cot, bringing her close to his chest as he\u2019d seen Silence do. She was as light as feather down from one of his fine pillows. His chest wasn\u2019t as soft as Silence\u2019s, but the baby didn\u2019t seem to mind. The fretful sounds stopped as she stuck a finger in her mouth and regarded him with wide brown eyes. Her eyelashes were spiked with tears, making them dark and long.</p><p>She\u2019d be a beauty someday, he thought dispassionately, someone would have to guard her against the men who would be drawn to her. They\u2019d swarm around her like bees to honey, wanting to lift her skirts, wanting to dishonor her, little caring of her feelings or who she was as a person. She\u2019d be a piece of flesh to them, not a girl. Not someone\u2019s beloved daughter.</p><p>He scowled again at the thought.</p><p>The child whimpered, her face crumpling, tears pooling at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHush now,\u201d Mick whispered.</p><p>Silence was still asleep. He crossed to his own room and entered, holding the baby. He bent to set her on the bed, but she clung to his fine lawn shirt, rumpling it, and sobbed.</p><p>\u201cHush away, sweetin\u2019,\u201d he whispered. What did she want? He picked up a jeweled snuffbox lying on his dressing table and showed it to her.</p><p>She batted it away irritably and smashed her little head into his chest, still sobbing. He stared down at her, perplexed. She was so loud, so stubborn, and yet he could feel the delicate bones of her little ribs through her chemise. She was so small, so fragile, so easily hurt.</p><p>He walked to the fireplace and showed her in turn the items on the mantelpiece: an alabaster vase, a pink and white shepherdess, and a curved golden dagger that had once belonged to some Ottoman lord. She didn\u2019t seem very interested in his treasures, but she quieted a bit, still rubbing her face against his shirt. She\u2019d ruin it soon if he didn\u2019t take it off. Her mouth opened suddenly in a wide yawn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he found himself singing to her softly, the words coming to him as naturally as breathing.</p><p>\u201cTake me in your arms, my love</p><p>And blow the candle out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>Well, a bird that turned into a woman startled Clever John very much, but he kept his hand about her neck as he examined her. She was young and lithe, her face lovely and unlined, and her hair waved gently about her head in every color of the rainbow.</p><p>He plucked the candle wax from his ears and said, \u201cWhat manner of being are you?\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed merrily. \u201cMy name is Tamara. I am daughter to the dawn and sister to the four winds. Let me go and I shall grant you three wishes.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Silence woke from a dream of a singing angel. He\u2019d been tall and stern\u2014like an angel carved in the door of a gothic church. An otherworldly being of great virtue and little sympathy. But his voice had been low and sweet, warming her from within like hot honey, making her bones liquid with relaxation\u2014even though she\u2019d known that the angel was a dangerous being from another world. That she ought to keep on the alert.</p> <p>For a moment she lay still in the big bed, blinking sleepily, loath to move.</p><p>And then she realized that the angel\u2019s song hadn\u2019t stopped on her waking.</p><p>Silence sat up. The tantalizingly beautiful voice was coming from the half-open door to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s room.</p><p>She rose, drawing a shawl about her shoulders and glanced at Mary Darling\u2019s cot. It was empty, but she felt no alarm. She thought she might recognize that voice. Moving as quietly as she could she crept to the connecting door.</p><p>The sight within made her draw in her breath.</p><p>Mickey O\u2019Connor stood across the room by the fireplace, his back toward her. He was clad only in tight black breeches and jackboots, his upper body nude. His broad back was a smooth olive expanse, the muscles that delineated his shoulders and arms in firm, sensuous bunches. And he was singing, his voice a wonderful, soaring tenor. She\u2019d never heard anything so beautiful in her life. How was it possible that Mickey O\u2019Connor, a man with a soul as black as tar, should have a voice the angels would envy?</p> <p>He half-turned suddenly and she saw that he cradled Mary Darling to his strong chest. The little girl\u2019s pink cheek was laid trustingly against him, her eyes closed in sleep. His hand moved gently in her inky curls, stroking her soothingly.</p><p>Silence must have made some sound at the sight. His eyes flashed to hers, yet he never stopped singing.</p><p>\u201cMy father and my mother</p><p>In yonder room do lay</p><p>They are embracing one another</p><p>And so may you and I</p><p>So take me in your arms, my love</p><p>And blow the candle out.\u201d</p> <p>She felt her face heat at his words, even though they were part of his song. He didn\u2019t mean them for her. They were merely the words to an old ballad.</p><p>She knew that, yet she couldn\u2019t tear her gaze from his. His dark eyes seemed to be telling her something, something apart from the song he sang so beautifully. She lifted a hand to her belly and pressed to still the trembling there.</p><p>His song died on a low, liquid note and he continued to stare at her.</p><p>Silence cleared her throat, fearful her voice would come out a croak. \u201cIs she asleep?\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if he, too, were waking from a dream, and glanced down at Mary Darling. \u201cAye, I\u2019m a-thinkin\u2019 she is\u2014she\u2019s stopped fussin\u2019 at me.\u201d</p><p>Silence felt a huge smile of relief spread over her face. \u201cShe was fussing? Oh, how wonderful!\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look, one eyebrow arching. \u201cYe\u2019ve taught the child to bully me, too, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said hastily, embarrassed. Did he really think she bullied him? What a silly notion! \u201cIt\u2019s just that she\u2019d been so listless. If she\u2019s well enough to fret, then she must be feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He glanced down at the baby\u2019s head, his look nearly tender. \u201cThen I\u2019ll rejoice when she starts bawlin\u2019 again at the top o\u2019 her lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Silence said as she crossed to him and gently took the sleeping baby. Mary mumbled something and snuggled against her bosom. Silence examined her anxiously. Mary\u2019s cheeks were pink, but they weren\u2019t the hectic red of before and her little body no longer felt as if it burned. Oh, thank God.</p><p>Silence looked up grinning. \u201cI know I will. Far better a screaming baby than one that\u2019s too quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, watching them with a somber light in his eyes. \u201cI can well believe ye.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at Mary\u2019s sleeping head, avoiding his eyes. She should leave his room, but she was oddly reluctant to do so. \u201cYou have a beautiful voice.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cDo I now?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, puzzled by his dismissive tone. \u201cYou must know you do.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cAye, I suppose I do at that. I spent enough time when I was a lad singin\u2019 for me supper.\u201d He caught her questioning look. \u201cWhen there was naught in the cupboard, me mam would take me down to the street corner. She\u2019d lay a handkerchief on the ground at our feet and we\u2019d sing for pennies. It might take minutes or hours or all day afore we had enough to buy our supper.\u201d</p><p>Silence swallowed. He talked of begging for food so cavalierly, yet she knew now that the experience must\u2019ve scarred him terribly. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head as if considering. \u201cI don\u2019t rightly know. One o\u2019 me earliest memories is going to the corner on a freezin\u2019 night in winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow awful!\u201d</p><p>He looked at her sardonically. \u201cThere be worse ways to make a penny.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. There were indeed worse ways in St. Giles to make money. So many came to London from the English countryside, from Scotland and Ireland and even from the continent. There were far too many for the jobs available. She sometimes saw the women coming home in the morning after a night of walking the streets. And it wasn\u2019t just women who walked the streets. There were children, too, of both sexes.</p><p>Silence peeked at Mickey O\u2019Connor from under her eyelashes. He was beautiful, his eyes dark and sensuous, his mouth mobile, his hair thick and black. He would\u2019ve been a lovely child\u2014too lovely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Irish,\u201d Silence blurted out and then felt the heat rise in her cheeks. The Irish were numerous in London\u2014and almost universally despised.</p><p>He smiled, dimples creasing the corners of his mouth. \u201cAye, me mam came from Ireland lookin\u2019 for work. She was one o\u2019 ten children to a widowed mother, or so she told me. I never met me Irish kin. She came over alone.\u201d He bent his head as he donned the shirt he\u2019d taken from the back of a nearby chair. \u201c \u2019Tis a far cry from yer own family, I\u2019ll wager.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy father\u2019s family has lived in London for generations. My mother\u2019s people came from Dorset and live there still, though we don\u2019t often see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve a sister and a brother, I know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTwo sisters and three brothers, actually,\u201d she replied, smiling a little. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest of six children. There\u2019s Verity\u2014she brought up Temperance and me when our mother died, then Concord who took over Father\u2019s brewery on his death. Both are married with families of their own now. Asa is my next brother, but I don\u2019t know exactly what he does\u2014he\u2019s something of the black sheep of the family. Temperance used to run the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children before she married Lord Caire, and Winter is the next youngest above me.\u201d</p><p>She stopped suddenly, a little out of breath. He probably thought her a ninny for prattling on about her family. It occurred to her that although her family was not rich, compared to his, she\u2019d been quite well off. Further, in his world\u2014a world of beggars and thieves\u2014he had risen quite far. In his own way, Mickey O\u2019Connor was a successful man.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d a happy childhood.\u201d The comment was a statement of fact, but she had the feeling that the idea was a foreign one for him. Dear Lord, what might his childhood have been like?</p><p>\u201cYes, I was happy,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMy father was strict, but he loved all his children and made sure we each were properly educated. We may not have been rich, yet we never lacked for food or clothing.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, unsurprised. \u201cHe was a good provider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your family?\u201d she asked tentatively. \u201cWhat did your mother do when she came to London?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAfore I was born I\u2019ve heard that she was a spinner for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Silence whispered.</p><p>He looked at her, his face devoid of expression. \u201cAnd then she met a monster.\u201d</p><p>Silence covered Mary\u2019s little head with her hand as if to shield her. How bad would a person have to be for a river pirate to consider him a monster?</p><p>Mickey\u2019s beautiful mouth had twisted into a terrible snarl, his voice ragged and low. \u201cShe fell under his spell, this monster, for he was a silver-tongued man and knew well how to hide his evil. Hide it until she was too entangled in his web to free herself. He took her and made her his, blindin\u2019 her so that she could never look entirely away from his dark eyes, never think without his voice in her head. He had a still and she helped him make gin. When the still wasn\u2019t makin\u2019 money, she\u2019d whore herself for him, spendin\u2019 nights on the streets and turnin\u2019 out her pocket to him when she came home again. Sometimes he sent her out on the streets even when there was money, and she went without protest, so under his spell was she. \u2019Twas his way of keepin\u2019 her firmly beneath his fist. Keepin\u2019 her bewitched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father?\u201d she asked bravely. Had he been born from one of his mother\u2019s nights walking the street?</p><p>He simply looked at her with those beautiful black eyes and did not reply.</p><p>MICK WATCHED THE color drain from Silence\u2019s face. Was she simply repulsed by his poverty-ridden upbringing and the fact that his mother had been a whore? Or had she some little care for him? A tiny bit of sympathy for the devil himself?</p><p>She stood before him clad only in a worn chemise and equally worn shawl, cradling the baby in her arms. He\u2019d grown enormously erect in the last few minutes, simply from staring at her. He\u2019d donned his shirt, but left it untucked from his breeches in feeble disguise. Silence\u2019s chemise hung only to her calves. Her lower legs were smooth and delicately shaped. He could just make out\u2014if he squinted hard\u2014the shadowed outline of her thighs. He fancied he could see a dark triangle as well, but that was probably the product of his over-heated brain. Still, his cock didn\u2019t seem to care between reality and fantasy.</p><p>Did she have no sense of self-preservation? he wondered, suddenly irritable. She knew what he was, his unremorseful cruelty, and yet she stood before him only half-clad and as innocently unaware as a lamb. Except that wasn\u2019t the entire truth. His gaze dropped to the child\u2019s curly black hair. Silence had been worried about the baby. It was her love for the child that made her vulnerable and he had an urge to protect that\u2014both the woman and the maternal love she held.</p><p>That love within her was more precious than all the gold in his throne room.</p><p>\u201cI-I had no idea how awful your childhood was,\u201d she said.</p><p>He blinked and had to think to remember the conversation they\u2019d been engaged in. \u201cNo matter. Me tale is one that\u2019s often told in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be. Your mother should\u2019ve protected you.\u201d He chanced a glance and saw she was nibbling on her bottom lip, her eyes uncertain. He nearly groaned.</p><p>He arched a mocking eyebrow. \u201cThe way of the world, isn\u2019t it? Children are born from sin and learn to look to themselves as soon as they can walk. Why should me childhood be any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we aren\u2019t animals,\u201d she said simply. \u201cYou deserved better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He barked a laugh to cover the bloody pain her words drew from his breast. \u201cPerhaps in yer world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn yours as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA person cares about himself, and only himself,\u201d he said, suddenly weary of this conversation, \u201cin yer world or mine. Me mam was no better or worse than any other and I didn\u2019t deserve more. Yer silly to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He felt the touch of her hand on his arm and looked down in surprise to find her gripping his arm with feminine strength. He raised his gaze and saw that her eyes blazed greeny-brown at him. \u201cI may not be as sophisticated as you. I may not have constant, changing lovers, I may not carelessly disregard the law and common morals, I may not live the romantic life of a river pirate, but I know this, Mickey O\u2019Connor: all children deserve a loving mother. And a mother who truly loved her child would do anything\u2014anything\u2014to protect and save him.\u201d</p> <p>He looked into her fierce face, her delicate cheeks flaming with passion, her lips stained a rose red, and the small child she still held protectively in her arms and felt himself fall, tumbling helplessly, all thought stopped in his head. She took his breath away with her simple avowal: A mother should protect her child. Something came loose in his chest.</p><p>Dear God, he wanted this woman.</p><p>He remembered, as he stared down at her, the cold nights on the streets, the leather strap against his back, and that final, terrible confrontation.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps me mother didn\u2019t truly love me then,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her magnificent eyes suddenly swam with tears. \u201cMaybe not. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you didn\u2019t deserve to be loved.\u201d</p> <p>And he couldn\u2019t help it. She wept\u2014for him.</p><p>He touched his lips to hers and unlike their first kiss, this one was nearly chaste. He couldn\u2019t draw her body near because the baby was still between them. Still, he could savor her softness. He hid his claws and brushed his mouth against hers, as delicately as a butterfly\u2019s wings on a petal. She breathed a sound and he tilted his head, licking softly, tenderly, over her mouth. His cock was straining against the fabric of his breeches, but he made none of his usual decisive moves to take this further. He was strangely content simply to savor her lips. To savor Silence herself.</p><p>When at last he raised his head, her beautiful eyes were dazed.</p><p>He smiled a little, and stroked one finger over her soft cheek. She tilted her face toward his hand, as if without thought. He watched his finger stroke down her elegant neck, over her collarbone and onto the upper slope of her left breast, just revealed by the top of her chemise.</p><p>He swallowed, staring at his swarthy finger against her creamy skin. \u201cYe should go.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyes to hers.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know what she saw there, but whatever it was, it made her turn away without speaking. She fled the room.</p><p>Mickey cursed under his breath, letting his head fall back against the wall. His cock still beat angrily against his clothing. Once he would\u2019ve simply sent for a whore. Now that thought was oddly unsatisfying. He could have a willing woman, a woman who would do anything he might request of her, even the most exotic acts of sex, but instead his flesh wanted just one woman.</p><p>A woman who was as fierce in her maternal love as he had been as a boy in his will to survive.</p><p>Just thinking of her\u2014the flush that had lit her face, her lips rose red from his kiss\u2014made his cock leap eagerly.</p><p>Mickey swore and unbuttoned the placket of his breeches. He\u2019d never been one to deny himself pleasure of any sort. He reached inside his breeches now and drew out his swollen flesh and looked down. Liquid had oozed from the tip of his randy member, making the dark plum head glisten. He spat on his palm and took the thing in his hand.</p><p>Jaysus, what would she do if she knew what he was doing right now? Her stormy eyes would widen in shock, he knew, if she could see him, but mightn\u2019t they also show a bit of interest as well? He chuckled breathlessly at the thought, and imagined her sitting in the chair before his fireplace, watching as he fisted his cock. Her eyelids would droop with desire. She might let her head fall back, revealing the vulnerable heartbeat in her throat.</p><p>He groaned and slid his palm faster over his straining rod.</p><p>Would she let her legs fall open? If she did he\u2019d come closer. He might kneel at her feet, still achingly hard, and slowly lift her tattered chemise. He\u2019d reveal white thighs, the tender crease separating leg and stomach, and that place between where soft, curly hair grew. Would her bush be full or merely a few wisps at the top of her slit?</p> <p>Mickey lifted his lip in a snarl, canting his hips, stroking his other hand over his own belly and thigh, to reach his bollocks drawn up tight in lust.</p><p>He\u2019d take his thumb and run it through that sweet cleft, watch the tender petals part, inhale the scent of her desire. And when he placed his mouth on her and suckled, she\u2019d arch beneath his hand. He\u2019d need to press his palm on her belly to hold her, but still she\u2019d scream\u2014</p><p>His crisis hit him hard and fast, making him groan as he spilled his seed on the floor.</p><p>He rested against the wall, still caressing his aching flesh. If merely thinking about the act with Silence was that explosive, then how would it be to actually lick her? A small smile curved his lips. He\u2019d bet his next haul that her puritan husband had never showed her that particular pleasure. He\u2019d give much to be the first one to lick her sweet pussy.</p><p>If she\u2019d ever let him...</p><p>DEAR LORD.</p><p>Silence carefully, quietly, closed the connecting door to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s room and leaned back against it, her hand to her breast. She could feel her heart beating much too fast under her palm.</p><p>She\u2019d known the moment she\u2019d cracked the connecting door and peered inside that the scene within was not for her eyes. When she had entered her own room, she\u2019d put Mary down and come back to say something to him\u2014what she could no longer remember. The sight within had driven all thought from her mind. Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s head had been arched back, his strong neck corded with strain, his black breeches unbuttoned and his hand had been working his manhood.</p><p>He\u2019d been simply... mesmerizing.</p><p>She should\u2019ve closed the door at once. Should have never dared to peek at what had obviously been a very private moment. But somehow she couldn\u2019t make herself close the door. It wasn\u2019t just curiosity. It had been something more. She\u2019d talked to Mickey O\u2019Connor. Not as supplicant to pirate, but as one human being to another. That simple act\u2014talking\u2014had changed everything. She no longer thought of him as just a pirate. He was a man now, a living, breathing man. A man who could be hurt.</p><p>A man she could be attracted to.</p><p>And once that line had been crossed, she could never go back. He was real to her now, and while the pirate evoked fear and dread and even revulsion, the man\u2014the real man beneath\u2014was infinitely alluring.</p><p>So she\u2019d stayed at the crack in the door, watching breathlessly as Mickey O\u2019Connor did something very earthly indeed. She\u2019d remembered his kiss as she watched. It hadn\u2019t been like their first kiss. That had been wild and erotic and tinged with anger. No, the kiss he\u2019d just given her was sweetly gentle\u2014so gentle she\u2019d found herself falling helplessly. He had been the one to pull back, he had been the one to tell her she must leave.</p><p>Silence tiptoed to her bed and lay down, still breathing fast. What had he been thinking as he stroked the shaft of his penis? Had he thought of her? She was hot just wondering, but surely it was not coincidence that he\u2019d done that just after they\u2019d kissed. The thought of bringing such a strong man, such a viral man to the point of using his own flesh\u2014because of her.... well, it was arousing.</p><p>She gazed at the canopy over the bed, remembering. His penis had looked very big in his hand and it\u2019d gleamed in the firelight as if wet. She\u2019d been married for two years, but William had been a properly modest man. She\u2019d only glimpsed him nude once or twice. Sometimes, late at night, lying beside him as he slept, she thought about what he must look like, but she\u2019d quickly shoved the speculations from her mind as immodest.</p><p>This must be the sin of Onan. She\u2019d spent long hours as a young girl wondering what exactly Onan had done to spill his seed upon the ground. Later, when she\u2019d been older, she\u2019d heard whispers of this act that men performed. She\u2019d even once broached the subject with William, in a single, stuttering question. He\u2019d made it quite plain then that her curiosity over the matter was not proper.</p><p>But what Mickey O\u2019Connor had done did not seem particularly sinful. It had actually been rather wonderful. He\u2019d gripped himself with casual certainty. Obviously he\u2019d performed this act before. She clenched internally at the thought. Did he not have enough women to satisfy him? Or was the act particularly pleasurable for him?</p><p>Dear God. She ached, wanting something that she knew was a sin.</p><p>Wanting a man who was sin itself.</p><p>\u201cTHE OWNER OF the Alexander has paid his tithe,\u201d Bran said later that day.</p><p>\u201cHas he?\u201d Mick replied disinterestedly.</p><p>He\u2019d not seen Silence since he\u2019d sent her away this morning, but their kiss haunted him. Even after taking care of his lust, his flesh still demanded her. He smiled wryly to himself. A kiss. A simple kiss and he was panting after Silence.</p><p>\u201cMick?\u201d</p><p>And forgetting where he was it seemed. Mick glanced at his lieutenant. \u201cYe\u2019ll have to repeat yerself, Bran, me lad, I\u2019m afraid me head is in the clouds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour head has been in the clouds since you brought Mrs. Hollingbrook here,\u201d Bran said in a voice that cracked at the end of his sentence.</p><p>Mick had been sitting in his desk chair, his long legs carelessly flung over the arm. Now he slowly straightened and let his booted feet hit the floor heavily. \u201cHave ye somethin\u2019 ye wish to say to me?\u201d</p><p>The boy held his gaze\u2014a feat that many older and brawnier men had failed to do. Mick noticed that Bran\u2019s jaw was darkened with his beard. A year or so ago, one could hardly make out the fuzz on Bran\u2019s cheeks. His shoulders seemed heavier, too\u2014and was he an inch taller? Perhaps it was past time Mick stopped thinking of Bran as a boy.</p><p>\u201cYou always told me that a man must make his decisions with his head, not his cock,\u201d Bran said. \u201cYou said that a man entangled by a wench couldn\u2019t think straight. That he lays himself open to misstep and misstep leads to ruin.\u201d</p><p>Mick tilted his head, studying Bran thoughtfully. \u201cWhy, Bran, me lad, I had no idea ye\u2019d taken me words so to heart.\u201d</p><p>Bran merely stared at him, looking a little sullen. \u201cShe\u2019s distracted you.\u201d</p><p>Mick felt a prick of irritation. \u201cAnd what o\u2019 yer fair Fionnula, now? Hasn\u2019t she caught yer cock and yer attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Mick laughed. \u201cCome, Bran, ye needn\u2019t lie to me. Our pretty Fionnula loves ye true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might,\u201d Bran said coldly, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I love her.\u201d</p><p>Mick narrowed his eyes. \u201cThen ye\u2019d give her up, were I to order ye to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I told ye to bring her to me bed?\u201d Mick asked softly. \u201cWould ye bring the lass and sweetly hand her over to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a thrice,\u201d Bran said stubbornly. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>Mick felt his mouth curve. \u201cOh, not at the moment, no, but I am that glad to hear ye\u2019d whore out yer sweetheart should I want her. Such loyalty is more than a man should expect.\u201d</p><p>Finally Bran showed unease. A mottled red flush rose on his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s what you asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d Mick asked gently. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Bran stared at Mick, some kind of emotion working behind his features.</p><p>Mick watched him thoughtfully. They were all on edge after the deaths of Sean, Mike, and Pat, but something more seemed to be bothering Bran. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mick came to a decision. \u201cI want ye leadin\u2019 the next raid.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cYou\u2019ve never let anyone lead but yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and perhaps it\u2019s time I did,\u201d Mick said. \u201cYe aren\u2019t tryin\u2019 to back out now, are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019d be happy to lead in your stead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mick said. \u201cYe\u2019ll need to make a plan and report back to me on it, hear?\u201d</p><p>A grin split Bran\u2019s face. Suddenly he looked more like the oversmart scamp Mick had taken on so long ago. \u201cAye, Mick!\u201d</p><p>He was out the door in an instant.</p><p>Mick chuckled to himself. He should\u2019ve given Bran the responsibility months ago. Well, at least he\u2019d done so now.</p><p>The door opened again and Harry\u2019s ugly mug appeared. \u201cMr. Pepper would like a word.\u201d</p> <p>Mick nodded. \u201cSend him in, then.\u201d</p><p>Harry made to leave, but Mick called, \u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the lass?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s broad face relaxed into a grin. \u201cMrs. \u2019Ollingbrook sent down for more vittles this afternoon\u2014the babe is eatin\u2019 like a starvin\u2019 wolf cub.\u201d</p><p>Mick sat back, feeling like grinning himself. \u201cShe\u2019s better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Harry said. \u201cShe\u2019s been chasin\u2019 Lad \u2019round the room and even Bert \u2019as smiled at \u2019er play.\u201d</p><p>Mick\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cBert smiled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Harry considered. \u201c \u2019Is mouth twitched anyway. Might\u2019ve been gas, but I like to think \u2019twere a smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Mick grunted. If Bert was moved by the baby she was quite the charmer. He felt an odd sensation in his chest, something that might\u2019ve been pride.</p><p>The rest of the day went by slowly as he examined the books with Pepper and discussed the special \u201cinsurance\u201d investments that Pepper had made on his behalf.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Mick was walking to his dining room, feeling anticipation, that he realized Silence most likely wouldn\u2019t be there tonight. While the baby had been sick, he\u2019d ordered food brought for both her and the child to their rooms. The toddler might be feeling better now, but Silence would probably still stay with her to make sure of her health.</p><p>He walked to his seat, barely acknowledging his men. What was it about the woman that his supper should be bleak without her? Every other woman he\u2019d only valued for what lay between her legs. He wanted that from Silence as well\u2014make no mistake\u2014but he also had the strangest urge to simply talk with the woman. To flirt and provoke and watch her brown-green-blue eyes spark in outrage, soften with interest, warm with heat.</p><p>Mick sat and stared down at a plate of roast goose without interest, irritated by his own apathy. He\u2019d eaten countless meals without the wench and been perfectly happy\u2014joyous, even\u2014why then should\u2014</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like roast goose?\u201d</p><p>He felt the grin stretch his lips before he even looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s me favorite.\u201d</p><p>She looked adorably confused\u2014and a little shy. Perhaps she was remembering the kiss they\u2019d shared that morning. The thought gave him a tender pang near his heart.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cThen why were you staring at your plate as if you wished the goose was alive again so you might slaughter it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, leaning back in his chair and propping his chin in one hand to watch her. She\u2019d slept some since he\u2019d last seen her, despite the baby\u2019s return to activity. Her cheeks were a light, healthy pink, and her eyes bright and alert. The sight gladdened him, though he frowned a little at her dress. She wore her usual black with but a white cap and white collar. He\u2019d once seen her in brown, but that had been a year ago.</p><p>What would she look like in sparkling blue or deepest red? His gaze dropped to her breasts, barricaded behind worsted wool. She was slim, but still nicely rounded. He\u2019d wager her breasts would look a treat framed by a low-cut emerald bodice, her fair skin shimmering in the candlelight. He\u2019d give\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave some boiled turnips,\u201d she said, passing him a bowl.</p><p>Mick frowned. \u201cTurnips? At me table? I\u2019ll have a word with Archie, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d she said blithely as she served him the misshapen vegetables. \u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arched. \u201cWhat do ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said as she accepted a dish of boiled beef from Moll, \u201cthat I discussed with Archie the food you serve at your table and I\u2019ve made a few healthful additions. I think you\u2019ll find that your digestion improves considerably.\u201d</p><p>He watched in bemusement as she added a heaping mound of steaming carrots to his plate. She was serving him as if she had every right. As if she were the mistress of his table and his home. Strange that. He supported an entire household of people\u2014pirates, servants, and until recently a bevy of doxies\u2014but no one had ever attempted to care for him. The thought spread warm pleasure through his chest\u2014even if the things she was serving did not.</p><p>\u201cVegetables and good English beef, simply prepared, are quite beneficial for the constitution,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mick grunted. He\u2019d never been particularly fond of boiled anything.</p><p>\u201cTry some,\u201d she said, her cheeks pink, her eyes bright and encouraging.</p><p>He looked down the table and saw that his crew were staring, appalled, at huge platters mounded with boiled roots and beef.</p><p>Mick narrowed his eyes. \u201cEvery man eats vegetables tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>The pirates hurriedly began to spoon up carrots and turnips.</p><p>Mick forked up a turnip and bit into it, chewing bland mush.</p><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Silence asked.</p><p>\u201cRight tasty,\u201d he lied, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cYou seem distracted tonight,\u201d she said as she frowned at a platter of artichokes.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d If he squinted a bit, he could imagine the shadowy curves he\u2019d glimpsed beneath the chemise this morning. Tantalizing, elusive, damned unclear. Mick sighed and looked up to find Silence staring at him, her cheeks flagged red.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve et yer food. Can ye not taste mine?\u201d He pushed the platter of artichokes closer to her, wanting her to eat the food he provided for her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She examined the platter with a small frown. \u201cAre you planning another thieving raid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPirate\u2019s raid.\u201d He propped an elbow on the table. There was a dish of boiled beef by his side, but he had the feeling it wouldn\u2019t taste that different from the turnips. \u201cWhy? D\u2019ye hope I\u2019ll meet me bloody death at the end o\u2019 a sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, no!\u201d She stared at him, appalled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that fate on anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven me?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She blushed as she hurriedly helped herself to an artichoke, avoiding his eyes. \u201cEspecially not you.\u201d</p><p>Something in his chest squeezed.</p><p>\u201cSuch a saint,\u201d he murmured low. He didn\u2019t want to share this banter with anyone else at the table. \u201cI can almost see yer halo, a-glowin\u2019 in these curls at yer temples.\u201d</p><p>He reached out a hand to brush the curls in question. They were little wisps, escaping from the prim knot at her neck, innocently seductive against the delicate skin of her temple.</p><p>She caught his hand before he could touch her face.</p><p>\u201cMick,\u201d she whispered, and he felt a sudden thrill: it was the first time she\u2019d used his given name. Her gaze darted down the rest of the table. His men were too smart to be openly looking, but he had no doubt that they were quite aware of what was happening at the head of the table. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She abruptly dropped his hand.</p><p>\u201cYe wound me, love,\u201d he said lightly, and wondered if it were true. Heaven help him if it were.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you know what a halo is.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh, I do assure ye the Devil knows his opposite.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together. \u201cIs that who you see yourself as? The Devil himself?\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows. \u201cD\u2019ye doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t used to.\u201d She poked at her artichoke thoughtfully. \u201cBut now I\u2019m no longer sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, be sure.\u201d He tapped the table with a fingertip for emphasis. \u201cI am the Devil himself, born and bred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? I wonder...\u201d She looked at him thoughtfully for a moment and then down at her untouched artichoke. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe artichoke?\u201d His lips quirked.</p><p>\u201cIs that what it\u2019s called?\u201d She stared disapprovingly down at the vegetable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the like. It looks like a giant flower bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, \u2019tis\u2014or so I\u2019m told.\u201d He gently took the fork from her fingers and picked up her knife, beginning to pry apart the dark green leaves. \u201cThey\u2019re grown far away in Italy. A sea captain gave me a crate o\u2019 the things some years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGave?\u201d She raised her eyebrows suspiciously.</p><p>He shrugged and flashed her a sly smile. \u201cGave, took, does it matter, love? To be sure the captain hadn\u2019t much choice, but the result was the same: a case o\u2019 artichokes ended up in me care and I\u2019ve had a fondness for them ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She peered down suspiciously as he parted the leaves to reveal the choke. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look very tasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cPay heed: the artichoke is a shy vegetable. She covers herself in spine-tipped leaves that must be carefully peeled away, and underneath shields her treasure with a barricade o\u2019 soft needles. They must be tenderly, but firmly, scraped aside. Ye must be bold, for if yer not, she\u2019ll never reveal her soft heart.\u201d</p><p>He finished cutting away the thistles and placed the small, tender heart on the center of her plate.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s it? But it\u2019s so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, and d\u2019ye judge a thing solely upon size alone?\u201d</p><p>She made a choking sound.</p><p>He paused, the knife and fork still in the air. \u201cNow what is it yer thinkin\u2019 about in that prim little mind?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head mutely and pointed at the artichoke heart. \u201cGo on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He took bit of soft butter and spread it over the little heart. \u201cWell, I was thinkin\u2019 that sometimes the smaller the treasure, the sweeter the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He cut the heart in half and held it out to her on the tip of the fork and found he was holding his breath. Would she let him feed her? Let him care for her?</p><p>She stared suspiciously for a long moment before accepting the morsel into her mouth. His heart leaped in triumph. He watched as the taste in her mouth was reflected in her bright eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo delicate, so buttery,\u201d he crooned to this fascinating woman. \u201cGreen and rich and smooth, but with a tiny bitter taste on top as if to keep yer interest.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and licked her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s rather good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed breathlessly. Have care, part of his brain whispered. This way only leads to pain. But his cock was pressing hard against the placket of his breeches and he wanted to take her hand and draw her away to his rooms and keep her there until she learned to scream in pleasure.</p><p>Until she screamed his name and no other.</p><p>\u201cYes, rather good,\u201d he imitated her tones gently. \u201cWell worth the trouble o\u2019 the thorns and the prickles to reach that sweet, meltin\u2019 center, I think.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Now, it\u2019s well known that an offer of three wishes must be carefully considered, lest the wrong thing be wished for. Clever John thought on the matter for some time, while he held Tamara\u2019s soft neck in his broad hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, he looked at her and asked, \u201cMust I make my three wishes all at once?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, as quick as a sprite. \u201cNot at all. You have merely to call my name and I will come to grant a wish.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and slowly unwrapped his hand from about her neck. \u201cI wish for a kingdom ten times the size of my uncle\u2019s.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p> <p>Silence savored the exotic taste of the artichoke as she listened to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s deep, velvet voice talk about creamy centers.</p><p>She swallowed and looked down at the artichoke petals piled neatly on the side of her plate. Her center certainly felt like it was melting, growing soft and wet just from the rasp of Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s voice. Why should a man already devilishly handsome also have a voice that could charm birds from the sky? It simply wasn\u2019t fair. And, goodness! Surely he didn\u2019t mean what his words conjured in her too heated mind? Silence took a hasty sip of red wine, casting about desperately for something\u2014anything\u2014to say.</p><p>\u201cDid your mother name you Mickey?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He blinked as if he were startled by the change of subject matter.</p><p>\u201cI... I mean, well...\u201d She inhaled, gathering her thoughts into a semblance of order. \u201cIt\u2019s from Michael, isn\u2019t it? Did she christen you Mickey or Michael?\u201d</p> <p>His mouth twitched as if he knew she was desperately trying to break the tension between them. \u201cWell, now, I doubt very much that holy water ever touched me infant head, but me mam did name me Michael, sure enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely name, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, now?\u201d he asked skeptically.</p><p>She nodded, tearing apart a piece of bread. \u201cSaint Michael is one of the archangels. He bears a sword and leads the army of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA militant fellow, then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIn the Book of Revelations he battles the Devil and all his minions and they are thrown out from Heaven.\u201d</p> <p>Mickey\u2019s lips pursed, his dark eyes sardonic. \u201cNot so very like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d Silence frowned. \u201cAfter all, Saint Michael must be very hard, very fierce. He\u2019s a warrior who metes out God\u2019s justice. He did defeat the Devil, after all. In some ways he must be not unlike the Devil.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>Silence glanced up, horrified. \u201cIs that blasphemy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYe ask the Devil to point out blasphemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, you aren\u2019t the Devil at all,\u201d Silence muttered distractedly. \u201cIn fact, you may just be a very frightening angel.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed at her earnest statement, drawing surreptitious glances from his pirates.</p><p>He grinned at her when he\u2019d calmed. \u201cDon\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not the one to judge blasphemy.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, cocking his head to study her. \u201cBesides, ye know that given the chance I would\u2019ve fought on the other side o\u2019 yer Saint Michael.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you have?\u201d she asked, serious despite his laughter. A week ago she wouldn\u2019t have questioned his assertion that he was the devil. Now she wasn\u2019t so certain. \u201cYour mother must not have thought you so terrible. After all, she named you after a saint, not a devil.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>It was her turn to eye him. \u201cUnless she was naming you after someone else? A relative, maybe? Perhaps your father?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one to me knowledge.\u201d He looked away from her as if bored with the conversation, yet his fingers gripped the table tightly. \u201cShe mightn\u2019t have had a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she named you with the hope that you would be a fierce protector like Saint Michael.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. It was a small movement, hardly noticeable, but Silence felt as if she\u2019d hit him. She reached out a hand to him before she could stop herself, laying it on his sleeve.</p><p>He stared down at her hand as if mesmerized by the sight.</p><p>\u201cIf that was why she named me,\u201d he said low, \u201cthen she was sorely disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she whispered, whether in apology or question, she did not know.</p><p>His Christian name was somehow terribly intimate upon her lips. It suited him much better than Mick or Mickey. An angel, both terrible and violent, but also with the possibility of redemption. Saint Michael.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and it was as if he\u2019d pierced her with his gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He closed his eyes, shuttering that dreadful look. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew her hand, but she wouldn\u2019t back down. There was something important here. Something she very much needed to find out.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d They might as well be alone. The rest of the dining room fell away and with it all the other people around them.</p><p>\u201cYe know why,\u201d he murmured, his eyes still closed. His black eyelashes lay on his cheeks like soot on snow.</p><p>If they\u2019d been alone she might\u2019ve taken him into her arms.</p><p>\u201cI know why,\u201d she said softly, \u201cbut I have no intention of calling you anything else.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled low, a dry, broken sound now in contrast to his earlier laughter. \u201cO\u2019 course ye won\u2019t. Sweet Silence. I may be named for an archangel, but yer the one who shines with a clear, pure light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ye?\u201d He finally opened his eyes and they were haunted. \u201cDidn\u2019t ye lay down yer virtue for the husband ye loved? Haven\u2019t ye agreed to live with the devil himself for a child ye found upon yer doorstep? Ye, Silence Hollingbrook, are more awe inspirin\u2019 than any angel.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where to look. It had never occurred to her that he might think her anything out of the ordinary. Her lips parted soundlessly and she stared into his eyes as if she would drown.</p><p>His gaze grew warm and the corner of his mouth quirked. \u201cD\u2019ye mean to eat that bread?\u201d</p><p>Silence looked down and saw that she\u2019d long ago crumbled the piece of bread to bits on her plate. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mickey\u2014Michael\u2014snapped his fingers and the small boy hurried over with a tray of sliced meats. Michael took the tray from him. \u201cBring me the bread, as well.\u201d</p><p>The boy skipped away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat all that,\u201d Silence protested even as Michael piled savory lamb onto her plate. The platter of boiled beef seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve been eatin\u2019 like a mouse while the child was ill,\u201d he said, still transferring tidbits to her plate.</p><p>She sampled a bite of the lamb. It was so tender it nearly melted in her mouth. She ate it a bit guiltily. Somehow Michael\u2019s lamb was much better than her own English boiled beef\u2014even if it couldn\u2019t possibly be as beneficial for one\u2019s health.</p><p>Laughter from down the table made her look up. Bran had his head thrown back and was laughing. Fionnula was gazing at him and her entire face glowed with a look of love so intimate that Silence glanced away, embarrassed. She found Michael watching her.</p><p>Silence swallowed and reached for her wineglass, avoiding his eyes. They seemed to see too much behind her face. \u201cFionnula certainly adores Bran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wears her affection upon her sleeve,\u201d he said, his voice strangely flat.</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cBran is very young to be so much in your esteem, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugged. \u201cMaybe, but the lad has been with me for more\u2019n six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She glanced again at Bran and Fionnula. He didn\u2019t seem much older than twenty. \u201cHow did you come to know him?\u201d</p><p>Michael sat back, a sugared grape in his fingers. \u201cOur Bran was runnin\u2019 the streets wild. He and his crew\u2014a ragtag troop o\u2019 lads, most younger than himself. They made their way by pickin\u2019 pockets, thievin\u2019 from chandler shops and hawkers, and general mischief. One night he\u2019d decided to hunt bigger game.\u201d</p><p>Michael stopped to take a drink of wine. He carefully set his glass back on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Silence asked impatiently.</p><p>His mobile lips curved. \u201cOur Bran decided to take a ship already marked by m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>Silence inhaled. She didn\u2019t know much about the details of how Michael made his living\u2014didn\u2019t want to know, truth be told\u2014but she knew he must be a ruthless competitor. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came upon the ship jus\u2019 after Bran and his boys had swarmed it. They were fightin\u2019 the guards when we came over the gunwales. Me and me men made quick work o\u2019 the guards, and then I found this lad, only half me height, mind, tryin\u2019 to shove a dagger in me gut.\u201d</p><p>Silence swallowed and glanced at Bran under her lashes. Any man, let alone a boy, was either very courageous or very foolhardy to challenge Mickey O\u2019Connor.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Michael toyed with his nearly empty wineglass, a smile playing about his wide mouth. \u201cTook the dagger away from him, that\u2019s what. And when he lunged at me with his bare hands I grabbed him by the scruff o\u2019 the neck and shook him. I might\u2019ve simply tossed him into the Thames, but...\u201d</p><p>He trailed off, a thoughtful look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d Silence supplied. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and finished the last gulp of wine. \u201cTruth be told, he reminded me a bit o\u2019 m\u2019self, once upon a time. A ragged boy, alone and fightin\u2019 for everythin\u2019, even his next meal.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked at her hands. He\u2019d said he\u2019d had a mother\u2014and perhaps even a father. Why had he been alone, then? Her stomach cramped thinking of him, a pretty boy, fighting for something to eat.</p><p>It was as if he heard her thoughts. \u201cAh, never pity me, Silence, m\u2019love.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw his black eyes, his sardonic mouth, and the haunted memories in his face.</p><p>He nodded, toasting her with his empty wineglass. \u201cWhatever trials and tribulations I may\u2019ve had, they were deserved. Most well deserved, mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMICKEY O\u2019CONNOR\u2019S THE one behind our problems with gettin\u2019 grain,\u201d Freddy said.</p><p>Charlie looked up slowly from his supper. \u201cIs he now?\u201d</p><p>The information wasn\u2019t surprising. For the last week his grain suppliers had either been strangely reluctant to sell or had already been all sold out of their grain supplies.</p><p>Charlie grunted. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find me new suppliers then.\u201d</p><p>Freddy looked unhappy at the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat else have you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re soldiers in St. Giles,\u201d Freddy said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Charlie said as he forked up a bite of beef. It dripped gravy as he brought it to his mouth. \u201cSoldiers are everywhere in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis said these have been sent to clean St. Giles o\u2019 thieves and murderers and other crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they?\u201d Charlie sat back and glanced at his man. Freddy as usual was avoiding looking at his face\u2014his gaze was focused mostly on Charlie\u2019s full plate of food. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Who sent them?\u201d</p><p>Freddy frowned, digging furrows into his brow, which did not help his appearance any. \u201cNo one knows. They\u2019ve been ridin\u2019 about in pairs, catchin\u2019 up anyone seen loiterin\u2019 about. \u2019Course the smarter ones went to ground as soon as the soldiers rode in. They get mostly the old women who sell gin and the like.\u201d</p><p>Charlie grunted. \u201cStill, if they\u2019re after gin sellers they\u2019re bound to run into my business.\u201d He tapped his knife on the edge of his pewter plate, thinking. \u201cBe best if we can point them in another direction. A direction we choose.\u201d</p><p>Freddy nodded slowly. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>A sudden thought appeared, fully formed in Charlie\u2019s brain. He took it and examined it, peering at it from all sides. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then he nodded. \u201cAt Charming Mickey\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMO\u2019,\u201d MARY DARLING cried the next morning.</p><p>Silence obediently bounced the baby on her knees, chanting a song about a horsey. It was so good to see Mary pink-cheeked and well again! But it was also exhausting entertaining the baby in only one small room.</p><p>\u201cMo\u2019!\u201d Mary urged as soon as Silence paused in the bouncing game. \u201cMo\u2019! Mo\u2019! Mo\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, I think the horsey is quite tired out,\u201d Silence said as she put Mary down.</p><p>Mary fretted and then began making her way along the stuffed chair Silence sat on. She was heading to the fireplace, knowing full well that she was forbidden the alluring delights of the fire.</p><p>Silence pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes and cast about for a distraction. \u201cHere, Mary. What do you think of this?\u201d She opened her sewing kit on the floor.</p><p>The baby quickly dropped to her hands and knees and crawled over.</p><p>\u201cYer lettin\u2019 her play with yer needles?\u201d Fionnula asked doubtfully from the door.</p> <p>Silence looked up gratefully. \u201cOh, thank goodness, you brought tea. I was running out of things to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d the maid said as she set down the tea tray.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was better than the fireplace,\u201d Silence muttered, extracting Mary\u2019s busy fingers from a small skein of mending thread.</p><p>The thread was hopelessly tangled. Silence stared at it as Fionnula set the baby down and gave her some toast and a small cup of milk.</p><p>\u201cMary\u2019s just so bored here,\u201d Silence murmured. She was bored as well, she realized. Silence had spent the last several months running a busy orphanage, work that kept her occupied from sunup to well past sundown. She simply wasn\u2019t used anymore to sitting and doing nothing.</p><p>On that thought she looked at Fionnula hopefully. \u201cIs Mr. O\u2019Connor at home today, do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSaw him goin\u2019 into his room just now.\u201d Fionnula nodded at the connecting door.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Silence rose and crossed to the connecting door and knocked.</p><p>The door was opened almost at once.</p><p>Michael leaned a shoulder against the doorjamb, a wicked smile playing about his sensuous lips. He was so very big this close\u2014every time it surprised her and made her breathless. \u201cWell, now, and when did ye decide to start knockin\u2019 at me door?\u201d</p><p>Silence fought to keep her face from flaming as she remembered the last time she\u2019d peeked through Michael\u2019s door.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019re bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Michael glanced down.</p><p>Silence followed his gaze and saw that Mary had crawled over to investigate. The baby grabbed a handful of her skirt and stood up. She kept one hand on Silence\u2019s skirt and popped two fingers from the other into her mouth as she stared solemnly at Michael.</p> <p>\u201cShe looks a rare treat,\u201d Michael said softly, watching the toddler.</p><p>Silence smiled down at Mary. \u201cShe does indeed.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and her heart squeezed at the gentle look on Michael\u2019s face.</p><p>As if she understood she was the subject of conversation, Mary lifted her arms\u2014to Michael. \u201cUp!\u201d</p><p>Michael arched an eyebrow. \u201cMouthy little thing, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>But he bent and lifted the toddler.</p><p>Mary Darling looked so small in his arms. The pirate cradled her body against his chest, her face on a level with his.</p><p>Mary stared into his eyes and then took her fingers out of her mouth and poked him in the chin.</p><p>Silence caught her breath, but Michael merely laughed. \u201cBored, sweetin\u2019? We\u2019ll have to do somethin\u2019 about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He turned and started back into his room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Silence asked as she hurried to catch up.</p><p>\u201cAlways demandin\u2019 answers, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Michael murmured to the baby.</p><p>Mary looked back over his shoulder. \u201cMamoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, yer mamoo,\u201d Michael drawled as he opened the door to the corridor. \u201cA lovely lady, I must admit, but a worrier, too, wouldn\u2019t ye agree?\u201d</p><p>Mary had her fingers back in her mouth, listening to this blather very seriously, but she took out her fingers to point to Harry and Bert, standing guard in the corridor. \u201c \u2019Ert!\u201d</p><p>For some reason Mary had taken a liking to the cantankerous man.</p><p>\u201cAye, Harry and \u2018\u2019Ert\u2019 shall come with us, as well,\u201d Michael said to her, nodding to the two men.</p><p>The guards looked at each other and then fell into step behind Silence.</p><p>She lifted her skirts to lengthen her stride\u2014Michael\u2019s long legs were eating up the corridor.</p><p>\u201cNow, I always find a bit o\u2019 fresh air quite invigoratin\u2019,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cMind, we can\u2019t have ye out in the open\u2014too many bad men about, see? But we do have a bit o\u2019 fresh air at the back of the house.\u201d</p><p>He came to a stairs and clattered down them, the trailing parade following. The stairs opened up into the kitchen and Archie the cook turned in surprise at their entrance.</p><p>But Mary Darling wasn\u2019t paying attention to the cook. \u201cGoggie!\u201d she exclaimed, holding both hands out urgently to Lad, who\u2019d been dozing by the fire.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Michael replied amicably, as if he and Mary were having a conversation. \u201cLet\u2019s bring the mutt with us, as well. He\u2019s almost presentable now that he stinks o\u2019 roses.\u201d</p><p>The whole procession\u2014Lad included\u2014tromped into a small courtyard.</p><p>Silence looked around. The courtyard was paved excepting for a lone patch of dry earth in the middle. On all four sides it was bordered by tall brick buildings. Opposite the door to the kitchen was an ancient arched tunnel through the lower part of one of the buildings.</p><p>\u201cWhere does that lead?\u201d Silence asked.</p><p>Michael glanced at the tunnel. \u201cIt lets out on an alley. No need to worry. There\u2019s a gate on the other and two guards in the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Silence nodded, watching as Michael placed Mary down next to a wooden bench set against a wall. \u201cHave you always had to live like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mary was already making her way determinedly toward Lad.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Silence waved a hand about the courtyard. \u201cWith guards and high walls and constant vigilance?\u201d</p><p>He straightened and looked at her. Bert and Harry had followed Mary like lumbering nursemaids, attempting to keep her from poking Lad in the eye. She and Michael were, for a moment, by themselves in a corner of the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Michael turned his face up. It was near noon and the sun was straight overhead, shining down into the little courtyard. But in an hour or so, the tall walls on either side would shield the sunshine. Only in the middle of the day was the courtyard lit thus.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He shrugged restlessly. \u201cThe more power a man has, the more enemies he takes on, as well, I\u2019ve found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She frowned down at the cobblestones beneath her feet. \u201cHave you ever thought that it may not be worth it? Your stealing?\u201d</p><p>He cast an ironic glance her way. \u201cAnd will ye be reformin\u2019 me now, me darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips at his mockery, but lifted her chin to look him in the eye. \u201cYou have piles of riches\u2014I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man may never have too many riches.\u201d His mouth firmed irritably.</p><p>\u201cOf course he may,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have enough to feed and clothe and house yourself and your men, what more do you need?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cEasy for one who\u2019s never been without to say.\u201d</p><p>She paused at that. It was true that she\u2019d never gone hungry. But Mickey O\u2019Connor had riches stacked in his palace! \u201cSurely you no longer need to steal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could become a fat farmer, d\u2019ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even picture him as a country squire, fat or otherwise. \u201cBut there must be some other work you could take up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cWould ye make me a shipbuilder?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was a ridiculous idea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She planted her hands on her hips in exasperation. \u201cBut the life you lead is dangerous. Surely you realize this. It\u2019s only a matter of time before one of your enemies finds you\u2014or you\u2019re brought before a magistrate for thievery. Why not leave this life while you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me, darlin\u2019?\u201d His words were flippant, but his look wasn\u2019t. For a moment Silence thought she saw vulnerability deep in those black eyes. Then he looked away. \u201cAh, best not to worry for me, m\u2019love. I\u2019m a pirate and a pirate has but one end in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she whispered, feeling dread.</p><p>A corner of his mouth kicked up. \u201cWhy, the end o\u2019 a rope, what else?\u201d</p><p>Silence shivered, though the sun\u2019s rays were warm in the courtyard. She imagined him swinging from a hangman\u2019s rope, his strong, lean body jerking in the throes of death. Something inside her couldn\u2019t bear the thought. Michael O\u2019Connor had once been her enemy. No one had ever hurt her as deeply as he had. What he\u2019d done to her\u2014to William and their marriage\u2014could never be forgiven.</p><p>But that was before. Before she\u2019d come to know him, before he\u2019d come to know her, for that matter. She knew that he might be a very dangerous pirate at the present, but once upon a time he\u2019d been only a boy, small and vulnerable and with no one to take care of him.</p><p>The fact was that some part of her would wither away should Michael O\u2019Connor leave this world.</p><p>Silence wrapped her arms about herself. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then? You\u2019ll simply wait to be caught and hung?\u201d</p><p>Michael cocked his head. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no waitin\u2019 about it, love. I\u2019m livin\u2019 a full and happy life, in case ye haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d She watched as Harry threw a wooden ball he\u2019d produced from somewhere on his person. Both Mary Darling and Lad started after the ball. \u201cYou have your men and your riches, but you have no family, do you? Is that all that you want out of life?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>She turned to find him watching her intently.</p><p>Silence lifted her chin. \u201cWell, do you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis well enough for many a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems very lonely to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cWhat about yerself, Silence, m\u2019love? Ye talk about me family but what family d\u2019ye have o\u2019 yer own?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in astonishment. \u201cWhat do you mean? I have quite a large family. My sisters, my brothers, and my nephews and nieces.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. \u201cYe\u2019ve brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews. But ye don\u2019t have a husband or children.\u201d</p><p>Silence tilted her chin. \u201cI have Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she enough?\u201d He leaned over her until she could feel the heat from his body. \u201cSomeday she\u2019ll grow up. She\u2019ll find a man o\u2019 her own and live apart from ye. Ye\u2019ll be alone. Is that what ye want?\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes and she looked away. \u201cI had a man\u2014a dear, good husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now ye do not.\u201d There was no trace of compassion in his voice. \u201cWill ye mourn him forever? Wear this dingy black until ye die yerself?\u201d</p><p>He reached out and flicked the starched white collar of her gown.</p><p>She hunched a shoulder against him. He was too close, asking questions that made her too uncomfortable. \u201cI loved William. You cannot understand it, I think, but he was my true love. The love of my life. I don\u2019t hope to ever find another love such as he in this lifetime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d said the words so many times, the syllables were worn into her soul. She didn\u2019t even have to think what they meant anymore. But were they still true? She shook her head in confusion. She didn\u2019t want to be having this conversation with anyone, let alone Michael.</p><p>But his deep voice was relentless. \u201cAnd without this true love ye\u2019ll let yerself wither away, is that it, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t expect you to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t,\u201d he cut in. \u201cYe ask how I can live a life that I know will end with the hangman\u2019s noose. Well, at least I am alive. Ye might as well have climbed inside yer husband\u2019s coffin and let yerself be buried with his corpse.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand flashed out before she\u2019d thought about it, the smack against his cheek loud in the little courtyard.</p><p>Silence had her eyes locked with Michael\u2019s, her chest rising and falling swiftly, but she was aware that Bert and Harry had looked up. Even Mary and Lad had paused in their play.</p><p>Without taking his gaze from hers, Michael reached out and grasped her hand. He raised her hand to his lips and softly kissed the center of her palm.</p><p>He looked at her, her hand still at his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t take to yer grave afore yer time, Silence, m\u2019love.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating so fast that she was breathless. She could feel each exhale he made on her palm.</p> <p>\u201cHe has no grave,\u201d she whispered inanely. \u201cHe died at sea and his body lies there beneath the waves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Then the tears overflowed her eyes, there in the sunlight in the little courtyard. Silence squeaked, embarrassed and helpless, and felt him pull her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, sweetin\u2019,\u201d he murmured into her hair.</p><p>\u201cHe loved me, he truly did,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI know he did,\u201d Michael said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, glaring angrily. \u201cYou don\u2019t even believe in love. Why are you agreeing with me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014he leaned down and licked at the tears on her cheeks, his lips brushing softly against her sensitive skin as he spoke, \u201cye\u2019ve bewitched and bespelled me, my sweet Silence, didn\u2019t ye know? I\u2019ll agree that the sky is pink, that the moon is made o\u2019 marzipan and sugared raisins, and that mermaids swim the muddy waters o\u2019 the Thames, if ye\u2019ll only stop weepin\u2019. Me chest breaks apart and gapes wide open when I see tears in yer pretty eyes. Me lungs, me liver, and me heart cannot stand to be thus exposed.\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing. She simply inhaled and stopped, looking at him in wonder. His lips were quirked in a mocking smile, but his eyes\u2014his fathomless black eyes\u2014seemed to hold a great pain as if his strong chest really had been split open.</p><p>HER EYES STILL swam with tears, blue-green and woebegone. Why the sight should pain him so Mick didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d seen men gutted and killed, watched starving women prostitute themselves, seen beggar children lay down in the gutter and die. He\u2019d fought with tooth and nail to reach the place where he was now\u2014where he didn\u2019t worry over food or a roof over his head. He\u2019d killed men and never thought about their faces again.</p><p>Yet the sight of Silence in tears nearly unmanned him.</p> <p>He glanced away from her face uneasily. That way lies pain. \u201cCome. I\u2019ve somethin\u2019 to show ye.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and led her toward the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cBut Mary\u2014\u201d she protested.</p><p>He tilted his chin to where the toddler giggled as she pulled at Lad\u2019s ears. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine with Bert and Harry to watch over her. We\u2019ll be only a moment.\u201d</p><p>She trailed after him, casting worried looks at the baby until they were inside. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me throne room.\u201d He led her through back passages and stairs until they reached the echoing hall that he received visitors in.</p><p>Bob, guarding the door, looked curious as Mick approached with Silence, but the guard merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cSee that we\u2019re not disturbed.\u201d Mick drew open the heavy wooden doors.</p><p>Inside he strode quickly to a chest he\u2019d had set beside his throne. He threw open the lid and drew out a shimmering blue silk gown.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Silence asked as if she\u2019d never seen such a dress.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a dress. For ye.\u201d</p><p>She backed a step, looking mulish. \u201cI can\u2019t wear that.\u201d</p><p>Ah, now he had to be careful. He held up the dress, letting the light play on the gorgeous fabric. \u201cYe told me ye were bored. Wouldn\u2019t ye like to get away from me palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cif ye wish to go out wi\u2019 me, ye must wear this. The dress yer wearin\u2019 now won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, eyeing the iridescent blue silk.</p><p>\u201cIt was given to me,\u201d he lied, \u201cby a sea captain wantin\u2019 me to do him a favor. I haven\u2019t a use for it m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>He held the dress against his chest, drawing a reluctant smile from her. In fact, like a besotted lover, he\u2019d spent half a day searching for a ready-made gown especially for her. That information, however, was unlikely to make her want to take the gown. He knew instinctively that accepting such a costly gift\u2014such an elegant gift\u2014from him would outrage her puritanical morals.</p><p>\u201cOr would ye rather be spendin\u2019 another evenin\u2019 by the fire in yer rooms?\u201d he asked casually. His fingers trailed over the shining skirts.</p><p>Her eyes darted to his face. He could see she was wavering. \u201cWhere do you intend to take me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit and her lips parted as if to protest.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s respectable,\u201d he hastily added. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He held his breath, waiting to hear her answer. Wanting her to accept.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t anything else to wear with such a fine gown.\u201d She blushed at even the oblique mention of underclothes.</p><p>He fought down a grin, trying to look innocent instead. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 ye\u2019ll find the items ye need in the bottom o\u2019 that there trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was already striding to the throne room doors. She\u2019d decided when she asked about things to wear with the dress. If he hesitated, she\u2019d have time to rethink her decision.</p><p>Mick pulled open the doors and spoke to Bob. \u201cSend two lads here to take a chest to Mrs. Hollingbrook\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded. \u201cRight ye are.\u201d He scurried off down the corridor.</p><p>Mick turned back to Silence. She was still standing by the chest, but she was looking about the room as well. \u201cWhy keep so many of your souvenirs in one room? Aren\u2019t you afraid of thieves?\u201d</p><p>Mick smiled. \u201cYe think I\u2019d be robbed in me own home?\u201d</p><p>Pink tinted her cheeks. \u201cNo, of course not. But your men might be tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay them well, I do,\u201d Mick said simply. \u201cBetter, mind, than they could get anywhere else in London. And if they\u2019re still tempted, well... believe it or not, m\u2019love, but I\u2019ve somethin\u2019 o\u2019 a reputation amongst violent men.\u201d</p><p>She shivered and turned away, peering at a marble cherub. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, watching her. His violence upset her, he knew, but since he couldn\u2019t change who he was, he dismissed it from his mind.</p><p>\u201cAs to why I pile me goods in this one room\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201cye yerself told me it makes a certain impression.\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cIs that the only reason for all your treasure? To impress others?\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a moment, and then decided he could tell her. \u201cYe know o\u2019 me life as a lad. About beggin\u2019 for me supper.\u201d</p><p>She nodded hesitantly.</p><p>He grimaced and looked around the room at his booty. \u201cWell, when I made me first haul I swore then and there that I wouldn\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cBut... that was long ago. You\u2019ve become a powerful man since then\u2014a rich man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan a man ever be rich enough?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cPowerful enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had gone wide, her sweet lips parted, and her face was filled with compassion\u2014for him.</p><p>That look went straight through him. He took a step nearer, his muscles tensing, his hand lifting, reaching for her.</p><p>Just then two of his men clattered into the throne room.</p><p>Mick bit back a curse and pointed to the trunk. \u201cBring it to her rooms.\u201d He glanced back at Silence, still unmoving by the cherub. \u201cSeven o\u2019 the clock tonight, mind now. Be ready for me.\u201d</p><p>And he turned and strode from the room, wondering if he was going to survive courting a chaste widow.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cAs you wish!\u201d Tamara cried.</p><p>At once they were transported to the top of a mountain. Before them were spread rich fields and a huge, sparkling lake.</p><p>Clever John\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAll this is mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my King Clever John!\u201d Tamara danced a few delighted steps, her bright hair waving in the mountain wind. \u201cWhat else do you wish?\u201d</p><p>But Clever John\u2019s gaze was on the wealth before him. \u201cI shall call you when next I need you.\u201d</p><p>Tamara nodded and quick as a wink turned into the rainbow bird and flew away, leaving only one bright red feather to float to the ground in her wake....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>\u201cMr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>Winter tamped down a surge of impatience and turned at the feminine tone of command. His morning had been busy enough before Lady Hero had decided to make an unscheduled appearance at the home\u2014and bring Lady Beckinhall with her.</p><p>He\u2019d thought the ladies well occupied with Nell, discussing the new venture of teaching the children how to spin, but apparently he was wrong. Lady Hero stood on the upper landing just outside the meeting room of the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children. She smiled brightly and he immediately was suspicious. The lady was the least annoying of the aristocratic members of the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate, but he was beginning to realize that underneath her always pleasantly elegant exterior, she was a bit Machiavellian.</p><p>He bowed shortly. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a particular favor I wonder if I might ask of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sighed, mentally girding his loins, for he had the feeling he wasn\u2019t going to like this favor. \u201cOf course, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, satisfied. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Lady Beckinhall, the newest lady attending our meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Beckinhall would be a wonderful addition to the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s not quite certain if she would like to join us.\u201d</p><p>Winter looked at her blankly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Her smile became firmer. \u201cYes. And I thought, if you gave her a special tour of the home, she might realize what very good work you do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d For the life of Winter, his brain, usually quite a quick organ, was unable to come up with a suitable excuse which would get him out of wasting his time with a silly society matron for forty-five minutes or longer.</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d Perhaps Lady Hero had gone deaf, for she beamed as if he\u2019d acquiesced enthusiastically. \u201cLady Beckinhall is waiting in the meeting room for you.\u201d</p><p>And in another minute Winter found himself bowing to Lady Beckinhall.</p><p>He straightened and thought he caught a gleam of amusement in her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow kind of you to volunteer to show me the home,\u201d Lady Beckinhall said. \u201cI vow the prospect of inspecting children\u2019s beds fills me with wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it indeed, ma\u2019am?\u201d Winter replied woodenly. He turned on his heel and strode to the stairs, starting up them. His worry for Silence\u2014both her person and the harm she might do the home\u2014was ever constant and now he must pander to this woman.</p><p>There was a pattering and a breathless voice behind him. \u201cMy! Will this be the five-minute tour?\u201d</p><p>Winter stopped and turned.</p> <p>Lady Beckinhall stood, panting a bit, three stairs below him. From his higher vantage point he had an intimate view down her bodice. Her plump breasts were mounded softly, the cleft between them shadowy, mysterious, and far too alluring.</p><p>He looked away. \u201cPardon, my lady. I did not mean to make you run after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course you didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He glanced at her swiftly. The lady\u2019s blue eyes were watching him mockingly.</p><p>Winter sighed silently and mounted the stairs at a slower pace. The next floor held a short, cramped hall with three doors. He opened the first and stood back to let Lady Beckinhall enter.</p> <p>She swept in and glanced around. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children\u2019s beds you were so eager to inspect,\u201d he said without inflection. \u201cThis is the boys\u2019 dormitory. As you can see it is in need of repairs.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder and then around the room. The ceiling was low, stains from previous leaks in the roof prominent. Two rows of narrow cots lined each wall. \u201cBut you\u2019ll soon be moving into a new home, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat is our hope. I believe, however, that there is still a need for funds to pay for furnishings for the new building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her murmur was noncommittal.</p><p>They needed her money. Winter inhaled. \u201cWould you like to see the girls\u2019 room?\u201d</p> <p>Lady Beckinhall raised elegant eyebrows mockingly. \u201cWould I?\u201d</p><p>Tamping down an urge to reply bluntly, he led her out of the room and into the next, which was nearly identical.</p><p>She paced to the far end of the room, peering at one of the cots lining the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s very Spartan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lady Beckinhall delicately touched the threadbare blanket on one of the beds with her fingertips. \u201cWell, the coverlets leave much to be desired, but at least the beds are roomy enough for the children here.\u201d</p><p>Winter cleared his throat. \u201cThis dormitory houses some seventeen children. The children sleep two or three to a bed.\u201d</p><p>She swiveled in an abrupt movement, her rich burgundy skirts sweeping the bare boards of the floor. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looked her in the eye, this aristocrat who\u2019d never known want, and said gently, \u201cBecause it\u2019s warmer at night.\u201d</p> <p>He could see the logical question form in her mind and then her swift glance at the tiny fireplace. The coal scuttle was nearly empty beside it.</p><p>She looked back at him, and to her credit, she didn\u2019t try flippancy. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, my lady?\u201d Perhaps it was his impatience coming to a head. Perhaps it was his very real worry for Silence, but suddenly he was tired of sophisticated sparring. Of wasting his meager time on beautiful, frivolous women.</p><p>When he spoke again his voice was hard. \u201cThey crowd into the beds at night and huddle close, but the hearths aren\u2019t big enough to keep the entire room warm, not with the thin walls. One of the maids must rouse herself in the middle of the night to stoke the fire again. The children who have been living with us awhile are well fed. They are fine, even if the night is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIf they have come new, often\u2014usually, in fact\u2014they\u2019re thin and weak from starvation,\u201d Winter said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t the plumpness of a healthy child. The plumpness that keeps a child warm at night. Most do well after several months of being fed good, wholesome food. But for some it is too late. Those do not wake in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her face pale. \u201cI thought you were supposed to tell me how sweet the children are. To woo my money with gentle words and flattery.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou seem like a woman who has had more than enough flattery in her life.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once and swept past him.</p><p>He stared after her, startled. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen all that I need to, Mr. Makepeace,\u201d she said. \u201cGood day.\u201d</p><p>Winter shook his head, disgusted with himself. Every day Silence lived at that pirate\u2019s home, the orphanage was in imminent peril of losing what funding it got from these aristocrats. All the more need, then, to placate women like Lady Beckinhall. The home needed money and if the only way to get it was by toadying up to wealthy widows, well then, he ought to toady and be happy.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d just driven away a potential patroness.</p><p>Fool.</p><p>LATER THAT NIGHT Silence nervously touched the ruching that decorated the neckline of her new dress. It really was lovely\u2014the loveliest dress she\u2019d ever worn. Before William\u2019s death she had worn colors, but she had usually dressed in brown or gray. Sedate colors, practical colors for a woman who, when she needed to go somewhere, did so by her own feet. London was a grimy city.</p><p>Certainly she\u2019d never worn bright indigo blue. She turned a bit before the full-length mirror that had been brought into her rooms. The silk seemed to shimmer and change, sometimes more purple, sometimes more blue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simply grand, ma\u2019am,\u201d Fionnula sighed from where she sat on a footstool near the mirror.</p><p>The maid had helped her to dress and had pulled back her hair into a knot with a few locks carefully curled at her temples and nape.</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Silence asked shyly. She touched again the ruched ribbon at her neckline. The bodice was round and deeply cut, highlighting her breasts pushed into mounds by the embroidered stays she wore under the dress.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Fionnula said firmly. \u201cYer even more grand than the ladies that Himself used to have in his rooms.\u201d</p><p>Silence stilled, and wet her lips before asking with feigned indifference. \u201cUsed to?\u201d</p><p>Alas, she\u2019d never be a good actress.</p><p>Fionnula gave her a speaking glance. \u201cHaven\u2019t ye noticed? He hasn\u2019t had a strumpet in his rooms since the day after ye arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was the only reply Silence could think to make, but her heart leaped willy-nilly with joy.</p><p>Fionnula rolled her eyes. \u201cHe used to have at least one woman a night, sometimes more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Silence squeaked. \u201cThan one? At a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Fionnula assured her. \u201cSometimes two or three at once.\u201d</p><p>Silence simply gaped, her mind stopped on the thought of Michael entertaining two or three women in his bed at once. Had he... serviced them all? In a single night? How...?</p><p>But Fionnula had grown quite chatty. \u201cI never understand it myself. I mean, if it was backwards, as it were, and a woman could have any number of men she wished... Well, I\u2019d never have more than one, I think. Why, can ye imagine two men snorin\u2019 in yer bed? Or three? And what about the covers? When Bran lets me spend the night\u2014which don\u2019t happen often, let me tell ye\u2014he\u2019s always pullin\u2019 the covers off my shoulders in the middle of the night. I wake up, my shoulders numb with cold. No.\u201d Fionnula shook her head. \u201cNo, ye couldn\u2019t pay me to take more\u2019n one man to me bed.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula turned at the end of this speech\u2014the longest she\u2019d ever made in Silence\u2019s presence\u2014and looked at her expectantly.</p><p>Silence blinked and unfortunately an image of Michael, entirely nude, lounging in the middle of his huge bed came into her mind. In the image he was erect, his long penis lying hard and straight against his flat belly. It was ruddy and wide at the tip where\u2014</p><p>Oh, dear.</p><p>She cleared her throat and said rather huskily. \u201cNo, one would be quite enough.\u201d</p><p>Fionnula nodded as if her argument was confirmed. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t understand men at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Mary Darling cried as if agreeing with Fionnula. She\u2019d slept most of the afternoon as Silence and the maid had worked on the dress, taking in the waist a bit. The baby toddled over and held out her arms to be picked up.</p><p>Silence stooped and carefully lifted the baby. \u201cWill you be good and obey Fionnula while I\u2019m out?\u201d she whispered into the dark curls.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d Mary said, wriggling, so Silence kissed her hastily and put her on the floor, just as a knock came at her door. It was the corridor door, so it mayn\u2019t be Michael, but still she checked her reflection in the looking glass.</p><p>Fionnula opened the outer door.</p><p>Michael stood there in a fine deep blue coat over a white waistcoat embroidered in silver thread. Diamonds winked on the buckles of his shoes. His gaze went straight to her and something in his black eyes seemed to heat when he saw her.</p><p>She instinctively covered her d\u00e9colletage with her hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took three steps and was before her. Gently, he grasped her hands in his own and spread them wide, exposing her bosom framed by the low neckline of the dress. His gaze dropped to her breasts and heat flooded her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever hide yerself from me eyes,\u201d he murmured low so that only she could hear.</p><p>Her gaze darted to Fionnula by the door. \u201cPlease!\u201d she whispered in embarrassment.</p><p>His smile was not quite kind. \u201cYe may cover yerself only when we\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught at the sensual promise in his eyes. Did he mean to make their friendship more intimate? And if so, would she let him?</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the confusion in her face, but he didn\u2019t comment. He\u2019d thrown a cloak over a chair as he entered the room and now he picked it up and drew it about her shoulders. It was velvet, rich and warm and lined with rose silk. He pulled the edges together under her throat and tenderly tied the cloak closed.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said when he was done. \u201cA shield to hide yer modesty behind. And to hide yer identity...\u201d</p><p>He held out a velvet half mask.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She\u2019d been worrying all afternoon about appearing in public with him, though she wasn\u2019t sure how to bring up the subject. It was not for her reputation that she worried\u2014that was already ruined\u2014but for the orphanage. Now she looked at him gratefully. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an ironic glance and moved behind her. Gently he lowered the mask over her face and tied it behind her head. She could feel his male heat at her back and the whisper of his breath on her nape. Something warm and soft brushed her ear.</p><p>Her breathing went shallow.</p><p>Then he was beside her again, holding out his arm. His voice was husky when he said, \u201cCome now or we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>She made her good-byes to Fionnula and Mary Darling and then he was taking her hand and pulling her into the hall.</p><p>\u201cLate to what?\u201d Silence asked breathlessly.</p><p>But he only glanced over his shoulder at her and grinned, white teeth flashing, and so handsome her heart seemed to leap into her throat.</p><p>He led her to the front door this time, nodding at the two guards standing there. Outside a carriage waited.</p><p>\u201cIs this yours?\u201d Silence asked, eyeing the polished lanterns hanging by the coachman.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Michael said as he handed her in. He leaped in beside her and knocked on the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t have much use for it, so I keep me carriage and horses at a stable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the coachman?\u201d</p><p>She saw the flash of his teeth again as he grinned at her in the dim carriage. \u201cOne o\u2019 me crew. He had a job as a stable lad in another life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence fingered the soft velvet lying over her lap, the realization suddenly hitting her that they rode in a small enclosed space together. She tried to keep her breathing even, but the feel of his broad shoulders leaning against her, the sight of his long legs stretched clear across the carriage floor, seemed to make breathing rather difficult.</p><p>\u201cThis is only my fourth carriage ride,\u201d she said nervously into the heavy quiet that had fallen.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded. \u201cPapa could not afford to keep one, but I once rode in a carriage belonging to a friend of his, Sir Stanley Gilpin, who helped to found the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children. That was when he took us to a fair in Greenwich once. And when Temperance was married, her husband, Lord Caire very kindly provided a carriage for the family to ride in to the church and later the wedding breakfast.\u201d Silence stopped suddenly having run out of breath.</p> <p>She darted a look at Michael.</p><p>His face was shadowed in the dark, but he seemed to be paying close attention to her babbling. \u201cAnd the fourth time?\u201d</p><p>She remembered and had to look down at her hands in her lap. \u201cThe fourth time was on the morning after I spent the night in your bedroom. Temperance rented a hack to come search for me. She found me at the end of the street after I\u2019d walked it with my hair undone and...\u201d She trailed away, unable to say the words.</p><p>But he was quite able to supply them. \u201cAnd yer dress unlaced to show yer chemise and the tops o\u2019 yer pretty titties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked at him. The old anger and pain was in her chest, but it was dimmer now, allowing her to think. \u201cWhy did you make me do that? Walk up the street like a whore coming home from a night of sin? Did you want to destroy my marriage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head sharply. \u201cHad I thought enough to want to destroy yer marriage then me actions might be forgivable.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could see his face. It had never occurred to her that he might think what he\u2019d done that day unforgivable\u2014that he might care enough to want forgiveness. The idea was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he replied and the simple cruelty of his statement sent a jagged shard of pain through her breast. \u201cIt was me whim, that and only that. I was bred and birthed in St. Giles. I clawed me way up to become king o\u2019 hell and now me every wish is granted, love.\u201d He shrugged, his expression filled with self-mockery. \u201cIf I should have a mind to crush a virtuous woman merely for me own entertainment, then I do it.\u201d</p><p>His honest depravity took her breath away, but her eyes narrowed in suspicion. Once she might\u2019ve taken his words as simple fact. Now she knew him better. He might think himself a devil, but he was far more complicated than that.</p><p>Far more good.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have no control over your desires?\u201d she prodded skeptically.</p><p>\u201cSure and I have control.\u201d He closed his eyes as if disgusted. \u201cDon\u2019t harbor false illusions about me, Silence, m\u2019love. I chose not to control me desires when I met ye\u2014even if that meant making an innocent walk, disheveled, up a street in St. Giles to fall into her sister\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I fell into Temperance\u2019s arms?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t escort me to your door\u2014that was Harry\u2019s job.\u201d</p><p>He went still. \u201cI watched ye with a spyin\u2019 glass from me windows. I saw yer courage\u2014and I saw ye collapse into her waitin\u2019 arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy should you watch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I share in yer pain?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, looking away from him, staring blindly out the darkened windows. \u201cYou say you chose not to control your basest urges that night, yet you did not harm me physically. You could\u2019ve taken me to your bed and destroyed me, yet you did not.\u201d She turned and stared at him seriously. \u201cYou cannot tell me that you don\u2019t feel true remorse for the pain you caused me.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled for a moment and then he laughed, short and hard. \u201cAh, Silence, m\u2019love, don\u2019t mistake me for a gentleman. I am a pirate, a thief, and a killer, and nothin\u2019 but.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you would do it again, if you had the chance?\u201d Silence demanded. \u201cMake that terrible bargain with me? Send me into the street, disheveled and ashamed?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was so slight that had she not been paying careful attention, she might\u2019ve missed it. But she didn\u2019t miss it. It was real.</p><p>He looked haunted\u2014confused as if the very earth had shifted under his feet. \u201cD\u2019ye hope to change the stripes on a snake, darlin\u2019? Rub as hard as ye might, they\u2019ll not come off and yer like to be bitten for yer pains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He turned to face her though she could not make out his expression in the dark. \u201cAnd yer sure o\u2019 that now?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a wavering breath. \u201cYou can choose not to do such horrible things in the future, can you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cNo matter what you were in the past, what you are now, you can choose to change, choose to indulge only your better desires, not your basest ones.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and she wished that she could see his eyes clearly. Would a devil lurk there\u2014or a militant archangel?</p><p>She opened her mouth, but the carriage shuddered to a halt at that moment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Michael drawled.</p><p>He pushed open the carriage door, revealing blazing torches in the night, and jumped down before setting the step and offering his hand to her for assistance.</p><p>Silence took her skirts in one hand and carefully stepped down. She wasn\u2019t used to such an abundance of skirts and she rather feared she\u2019d drag her hems in something awful.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Michael said and set her hand upon his arm.</p><p>She finally looked up and saw a lovely classical building. Lanterns lined the steps leading to the doors and streams of ladies and gentlemen were entering the building. At the edges of the crowd were hawkers calling their wares: oranges, walnuts, flowers, and sweetmeats. Michael led her up the steps and into the doors.</p><p>Silence looked up at the vaulted ceiling, lined with sparkling chandeliers. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said and mounted a curving stair.</p><p>The upper level held a corridor with doors along one side. Michael opened one and ushered her inside.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Silence exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought me to the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Michael said from behind her. \u201cThis here is an opera house.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked about excitedly. She\u2019d never been to either the theater or the opera as Father had rather frowned upon such things as frivolous.</p><p>They were in a luxurious box with several plush chairs and a table. Velvet curtains lined the box and could be drawn to give the occupants privacy. But beyond the railing the stage blazed with lights. Below a crowd milled in the pit.</p><p>\u201cLet me take yer cloak,\u201d Michael said, lifting it from her shoulders.</p><p>Silence hardly noticed. She was busy peering into the pit and across the theater to the boxes on the other side.</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d Michael warned. He placed his hands on either side of her waist. \u201cLean too far over and ye\u2019ll tumble out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Silence said, blushing. She must look a rustic country lass in her excitement. She sat on a chair with careful dignity, but then couldn\u2019t help putting a hand on the rail as she hissed, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the king?\u201d</p><p>Michael had taken a seat beside her and he casually turned his head to look where she indicated. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the king\u2019s son, the Prince o\u2019 Wales. He does bear a fair resemblance to his da, though \u2019tis said the king hates his son most strongly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king hates his own son?\u201d Silence felt incredibly na\u00efve. How did Michael know this and she did not?</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe king and the prince are never seen together.\u201d</p><p>Silence tried not to stare at the florid man with the protuberant eyes. \u201cOh! And what about the lady beside him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife, I think,\u201d Michael murmured. \u201c \u2019Tis rumored that he\u2019s devoted to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Silence examined the princess. She wore a very elegant silver and white gown, but she was little more than a girl.</p><p>She craned to see who was in the boxes on their side of the opera house. \u201cDo you come here often?\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugged. \u201cOnce or more a month.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked at him then. She\u2019d not thought when she asked the question that he would answer in the affirmative. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his face in profile to hers. He didn\u2019t lean forward eagerly as she had done, but his attention was most definitely on the crowd, the stage, and the atmosphere of the opera house itself. \u201cAye, and is it that startlin\u2019 a savage such as m\u2019self can find pleasure in music? Or is it the elegance o\u2019 the music I like that surprises ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am surprised,\u201d she admitted. She was fascinated by the beauty of his profile, the severity of the straight lines of his forehead and nose, the sensual curves of his lips, and the arrogance of his chin.</p><p>He turned and caught her watching him and the smile left his lips. His eyes grew intent, his eyelids drooping, his eyebrows looking quite satanic and a little frightening.</p><p>She found him so tempting that she pressed her hand to her chest without conscious thought.</p><p>He followed the movement.</p><p>A corner of his mouth kicked up as he stared at her exposed bosom. He reached out and trailed his finger lightly across the upper slopes of her breasts. \u201cYe have no idea how long I\u2019ve waited to see these.\u201d</p><p>She caught his hand in her trembling fingers, uncertain if she was thrilled or mortified.</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to pull away. \u201cIf I knelt right now at yer feet no one would see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She glanced at the low wall in front of her. It hid her from the waist down to anyone looking at the box. An image of him kneeling at her feet popped into her head and she suddenly stopped breathing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kneel there and lift yer skirts,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYe\u2019d have to be very still, mind. Very quiet. And no matter what I did ye couldn\u2019t let it show on yer face.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, mesmerized by his deep, slightly rasping voice as he told her his wicked thoughts. She blinked, unable to resist asking, \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d</p><p>A corner of his mouth curled and his black eyes were intent. His hand left her lax fingers and trailed over her bosom, down her stomach, to her lap. \u201cDo, love? Why, I\u2019d fold yer skirts up, careful like, a little at a time, until I could see yer sweet cunny, hidin\u2019 there between yer thighs.\u201d</p><p>He pressed with his palm on the place that he described and it seemed to burn right through the layers of cloth.</p><p>She bit her lip, unable to look away from him.</p><p>His nostrils flared as if he could scent her arousal. \u201cI\u2019d part yer sweet thighs and touch ye there, where yer pink and wet. I\u2019d slide me finger through yer softness, up until I touched that little spot at the top.\u201d He tilted his head, watching her. \u201cD\u2019ye know the spot I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She swallowed, feeling the heat rising over her throat. She knew, of course.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have ye touched yerself here?\u201d He spread his fingers wide as if claiming possession of her femininity. \u201cTell me, Silence me love. Have ye touched yerself and thought o\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>She drew in her breath\u2014to deny or confirm, she didn\u2019t know which\u2014but a squeak came from the orchestra.</p><p>Michael lifted her hand to his mouth and kissed the palm, his lips warm and intimate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence stared at him, her heart fluttering in her chest.</p><p>He smiled into her eyes, placed her hand gently back on her lap, and turned his gaze to the stage. \u201cHush. It begins.\u201d</p><p>MICK SMILED TO himself as he turned to watch the stage. He could hear Silence\u2019s quickened breathing, still saw in his mind\u2019s eye the pink tingeing her lovely chest. He was rock hard from their play and were she a doxie he might\u2019ve pulled the curtains and taken her there.</p><p>But she was a lady true and he had no intention of making her flee. No, he\u2019d take this slow, seduce with voice and imagination, and when he finally took her to his bed, well then, the victory would be all the more sweet for the anticipation. He sat back and swiftly made his breeches more comfortable as the music swelled.</p> <p>The musico stepped out on the stage to calls of approval from the audience. The opera singer was Italian, well known, and had quite a following in London. He was unnaturally tall and a bit fat and he stood woodenly on the stage, his body ungraceful. But when he opened his mouth... what delight!</p><p>Mick closed his eyes as the mezzo-soprano voice flew, high and precise, confident even when the notes were rapid and complex. Mick had come to the opera a little more than a year ago on a whim and had been instantly enthralled. That a man could produce such a wonderful sound almost made him believe in a God.</p><p>Almost, but not quite.</p><p>Mick opened his eyes and turned to watch Silence. She was leaning against the rail, her expression utterly rapt. Her lips were slightly parted, her eyes wide, and a curl of her hair drifted against her fair cheek. It occurred to him that he was very content thus, watching Silence and listening to the opera. Was this what happiness was? Strange thought. He\u2019d never considered happiness before. That kind of prosaic life was not for him, he knew. But here, now... he had a glimmering glimpse of what happiness might be.</p><p>At the intermission he left her and fought through the crowds to a certain hawker he\u2019d seen outside the opera before.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Silence asked when he returned with laden hands.</p><p>\u201cCream cakes and wine,\u201d he drawled, and felt the warmth light his chest at her delighted gasp.</p><p>He watched her eat the pretty cakes he\u2019d found for her and drink the sweet wine and the satisfaction was so pure that it gave him pause. Was this all an illusion? Could he trust her as he\u2019d trusted once before, long ago?</p><p>That time had ended in tragedy. Would this?</p><p>She glanced up at that moment, licking the cream from her sweet lips, and frowned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He sat back, looking away. He\u2019d break in half and die if she treated him as the other had. \u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He felt her gaze for minutes that seemed to drag like an hour, but then, thank God, the orchestra began.</p><p>Mick hardly paid mind to the second half of the opera. It was time. Tonight he would take her to bed and end his restlessness. Once she was his, he\u2019d no longer have this womanish worry that she\u2019d betray him.</p><p>The decision made, he waited out the rest of the opera impatiently. Silence was hiding a yawn behind her hand by the end, so Mick gave her his arm and led her into the night air.</p><p>The carriage was around the corner and he was conscious as their footsteps echoed off the buildings on either side that this would be a grand spot for an ambush. He breathed a sigh of relief when they made the carriage and he grimaced ruefully to himself as he followed her inside. He was becoming a silly old woman it seemed.</p><p>He settled beside Silence, very aware of her smaller size and of the delicacy of her profile. Tonight he\u2019d have her in his bed. Tonight he\u2019d discover all that smooth, soft skin, and the woman beneath.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said sleepily. \u201cThat was the most delightful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe liked it then, m\u2019love?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled in the dark. He\u2019d had years of practice with seduction, but this was different somehow. Final and just. After tonight he\u2019d have no need to seduce any other. \u201cWhat did ye like the most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I liked the lady singer and the dancer\u2014imagine dancing without stays!\u201d She stifled a yawn. \u201cSo scandalous, and yet she was terribly graceful as well, like watching swan\u2019s down float on the wind.\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cIt must be nice to see the opera or the theater whenever you might wish.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head toward her. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll take ye again.\u201d</p><p>He waited like a lovesick schoolboy for her reply and it took several moments for him to realize that she\u2019d fallen asleep. He smiled in the dark. Best she get her rest now. Still, he could not help the impulse to carefully put his arm around her and gently tilt her head so that it lay more comfortably on his shoulder.</p><p>She murmured something and snuggled into his chest.</p><p>They rode thus through the night, she fast asleep trustingly against him, he with the smell of her hair in his nostrils. He was erect and throbbing in anticipation, but oddly he was content to sit thus with her.</p><p>More than content, if truth be told.</p><p>The ride must end at last, though, and the carriage shuddered to a halt before his palace.</p><p>She stirred and looked up, her eyes suddenly wide. \u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry. I must have been a terrible weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, m\u2019love,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head toward hers, drawn by her plump, parted lips, but the carriage door opened.</p><p>Immediately she moved away from him and he sighed. \u201cCome inside and I\u2019ll give ye a taste o\u2019 some fine Spanish wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said as he handed her down.</p><p>\u201cNaught but a sip, I promise ye,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>He was so wrapped up in their gentle flirtation that it took him a moment to notice what he should\u2019ve seen at once.</p><p>There were no guards outside the palace.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Well, being a king was quite lovely, and for many years Clever John was happy with the arrangement. But as time went on, it became a bit... monotonous. Every morning Clever John ate his breakfast off plates of gold. He strolled his royal garden\u2014ten times the size of his uncle\u2019s\u2014and then went riding about his kingdom. By afternoon he\u2019d usually exhausted all there was for a king to do and was forced to take a nap.</p><p>So it was with more interest than trepidation that he heard the news that his neighbor had invaded his kingdom....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Silence was sleepy from the carriage ride, but Michael\u2019s sudden stillness brought her to full alertness. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the carriage,\u201d he ordered quietly and drew a long, wicked-looking dagger from his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d she whispered. She couldn\u2019t see anything to alarm him. The street was quiet, the moon high and full overhead. Their carriage had stopped directly in front of the palace\u2019s nondescript door. It looked the same as usual except\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe guards are gone,\u201d Michael murmured. \u201cMe palace is under attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Silence said. \u201cMary Darling\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned swiftly, his eyes burning with intense emotion. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t even think it. I\u2019ll get her and bring her to ye alive and safe. Wait here in the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She was suddenly filled with fear\u2014not only for herself and Mary, but for Michael. He thought himself invincible, but he was only a man after all, made of flesh and blood and as mortal as any other.</p><p>She bit her lip, knowing that she couldn\u2019t distract him from his task, and started for the carriage.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait,\u201d he took her arm, halting her. \u201cMight be this\u2019s a diversion to separate ye from me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows drew together. Why would Michael\u2019s enemies care particularly about her?</p><p>\u201cFollow me close like,\u201d Michael said, gripping her tighter for emphasis, \u201cbut not so close that ye interfere with me right arm. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely, gathering her skirts in trembling hands.</p><p>He looked over her head at the coachman. \u201cStay behind her and guard her with yer life, ye hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Mick,\u201d the man replied.</p><p>Then Michael opened the door to the palace.</p><p>It was dark inside, the candles that should\u2019ve been waiting already lit, had been snuffed. The coachman retrieved one of the lanterns from the carriage and held it up high behind Silence.</p><p>The gaudy golden walls jumped out in the flickering light, the multicolored marble floor sparkling. The entry hall seemed deserted\u2014that is until Silence noticed a smear of blood on the rainbow marble. Michael advanced swiftly and bent over the two bodies lying in the shadows behind an ornamental urn.</p><p>He straightened almost at once. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Silence clapped a hand over her mouth to still a cry of fear. What would the intruders do to Mary Darling?</p><p>Michael was already moving swiftly and quietly through the hall and she hurried to catch up, trying to keep the heels of her delicate embroidered slippers from tapping on the marble. Instead of taking the main, grand staircase, Michael drifted past it and pushed on a panel half-hidden in the shadows. The panel opened to reveal a narrow staircase. Swiftly he mounted the twisting steps and Silence found herself panting as she ran after him.</p><p>A minute later he abruptly halted before a small landing and another door.</p><p>\u201cRemember to stay close,\u201d he whispered to her and kissed her hard on the mouth.</p><p>Before she could reply he\u2019d opened the door.</p><p>The intruders were standing immediately on the other side.</p><p>Michael lunged soundlessly and the first man fell. Two other men turned, cudgels raised, and Michael made a flurry of swift jabs and darts. Someone grunted and Silence was pushed aside as the coachman came up the stairwell behind her. She saw now that they were in a hallway around the corner from the room she and Mary Darling shared. There were a few candles lit, but the hall was mostly a mass of violent, heaving male bodies. Silence gasped as the coachman was pushed back against her. He grunted and kicked the assailant away.</p><p>\u201cSteady on, ma\u2019am,\u201d he growled, but she wasn\u2019t reassured.</p><p>She\u2019d lost sight of Michael and because of the melee she couldn\u2019t move closer to her rooms and Mary. A wild-eyed giant ran at the coachman, a cutlass raised over his head. The coachman somehow deflected the larger man\u2019s attack. But the coachman stumbled back onto Silence. For a moment she couldn\u2019t breathe beneath the man\u2019s weight.</p><p>Suddenly Bert appeared, his face ghastly white beneath a wash of scarlet blood. With a foul curse he bashed the giant over the head and pulled the gasping coachman off Silence.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d Bert asked and for a moment Silence was simply stunned by the honest worry in the guard\u2019s ugly face.</p><p>Then there was a shout from behind Bert and Michael reappeared. His fine velvet coat was ripped at both shoulder seams and a line of blood trailed from the inky black of his hairline.</p><p>\u201cWe make for the babe\u2019s room!\u201d he roared and seized Silence\u2019s hand, plunging into the mass of twisting bodies.</p><p>She gasped and fought to keep by his back as he hacked and kicked his way bodily through. For the first time she realized what sort of man it took to become a successful pirate. He was ruthless as he fought, a wolf made entirely of sinew and ferocity. He never hesitated, never seemed to rethink a thrust or hit, he simply fought with single-minded savagery. It was rather awe-inspiring, his primitive violence, like a lightning storm. And like a natural force, he was graceful, too, his body moving with sure and simple brutality.</p><p>Within a minute they were in sight of her room. The door burst open and a huge man ran out.</p><p>Michael bellowed.</p><p>The man took one frightened look at them and turned and ran.</p><p>Michael started after him, but Silence dug in her heels, halting him.</p><p>He turned on her, his face savage.</p><p>\u201cMary!\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He blinked as if coming out of a dream state and nodded.</p><p>The other intruders, though greater in number, had fallen away from Michael\u2019s attack. Now they were retreating with Bert and the coachman in pursuit.</p><p>Michael ignored the stragglers. He turned and tried the door to her rooms and when it didn\u2019t open, backed a step and kicked it in.</p><p>The room was lit only by one candle. In the middle, Harry crouched over a body. Silence could hear Mary Darling crying, though, and she pushed past Michael.</p> <p>\u201cSilence!\u201d he called behind her, but she was intent on the baby. She couldn\u2019t see her. Where was Mary? A low whimper came from somewhere near her feet. Silence looked down and saw nothing.</p><p>Almost instinctively, she dropped to her knees and peered under the bed. Two pairs of eyes stared back at her. Lad gave a low growl, but Mary held out her arms. Sobbing.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby!\u201d Silence cried.</p><p>Lad stopped growling as he recognized her voice. Silence reached under the bed and caught Mary Darling by the shoulders as the dog crawled out.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Silence murmured once she had the baby in her arms. Mary was sweaty and grimy from the dust under the bed, but she was entirely whole, entirely alive. Silence felt tears of relief flood her eyes as she buried her face in the baby\u2019s curls.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a good dog you are, Lad,\u201d she murmured wetly to the mongrel as he wagged his tail. \u201cWhat a good guard dog.\u201d</p><p>She rose and turned, smiling, only to freeze in confusion.</p><p>Michael still stood by the door, staring down at Harry and the figure on the floor. Now she saw that it was a woman\u2014and her heart began to beat faster. \u201cWho\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer and then gasped and turned Mary\u2019s face away. The body on the floor had no face. Or rather what had been a face was now a mass of blood and melted tissue. Silence squeezed her eyes shut. She knew who it was even before she felt Michael\u2019s arms close around her and Mary.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fionnula, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said into her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>MICK FELT THE tremor that went through Silence\u2019s body. He closed his eyes a moment and simply held her. The baby was bawling in his ear and he didn\u2019t give a damn. She was alive. They both were alive and unhurt. They weren\u2019t lying on the floor like Fionnula, her face a horrific mess. He grit his teeth at the thought and knew suddenly: this was fear. This terrible, cold hand clenching at his inner organs. This wild urge to scream at the awful thoughts running through his head.</p> <p>What if\u2014?</p><p>What if he\u2019d delayed ten minutes longer at the opera? What if they\u2019d thought to post an ambush by the front door? What if he\u2019d been cut down as he\u2019d entered? What if, at this very moment, Silence was in his hands?</p><p>Mick wanted to laugh. Doubts, worries, and fear of his mortality\u2014those were all problems that other men had to deal with. He\u2019d never bothered with them himself. Why should he? If he died, well, then he died. He\u2019d led a good life\u2014a fighting life. He\u2019d leave no regrets behind.</p><p>But that was before. Now he had Silence to protect and worry over\u2014and Jaysus a baby, as well. If he fell who would take his place to guard them? Who was as ruthless as he?</p><p>He looked up and his eyes met Harry\u2019s.</p><p>Harry nodded soberly at Bert, standing in the doorway panting. \u201cBert says the Vicar\u2019s men \u2019ave been run out o\u2019 the \u2019ouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that man d-do to her?\u201d Silence asked, her face was still turned into his chest.</p> <p>\u201cVitriol,\u201d he said starkly. He didn\u2019t have to look at Fionnula\u2019s corpse again to see the effects.</p><p>He remembered the results of a vitriol attack well enough.</p><p>The caustic liquid was used in the production of gin and was in common enough supply in St. Giles. Vitriol burned any surface it touched except glass, and that included flesh and bone.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Silence murmured. \u201cI\u2019d heard what vitriol could do, but this... it killed her?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cIt was quick,\u201d he lied.</p><p>In fact Fionnula had probably suffocated as the terrible liquid ate into her nose and the tissues of her mouth and throat. Her death would\u2019ve been agonizing.</p><p>\u201cPoor, poor Fionnula,\u201d Silence said. The baby had quieted into an exhausted slump against her shoulder. \u201cDo you think Mary saw it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, she didn\u2019t. Fionnula must\u2019ve saved the babe,\u201d Harry said somberly. He gently spread a handkerchief over the girl\u2019s ruined face. \u201cThe baby was already under the bed wi\u2019 Lad when I got \u2019ere.\u201d He nodded to the connecting door to Michael\u2019s room. \u201cI came through there. Saw the Vicar\u2019s man standing over \u2019er, jus\u2019 lookin\u2019. Then \u2019e turned tail and ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why weren\u2019t ye here afore the Vicar\u2019s men to stop them from enterin\u2019?\u201d Mick asked coldly.</p><p>Harry flushed. \u201cThere were a fire in the kitchen. We went down to \u2019elp put it out afore it spread to the rest o\u2019 the \u2019ouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA diversion,\u201d Mick grunted.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Bert said. \u201cA diversion right enough, Mick.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cThe \u2019ole \u2019ouse was roused to carry the buckets. Weren\u2019t until we \u2019eard a scream from above that we realized we was under attack. By that time they\u2019d made the upper floors and \u2019twas \u2019ell to fight our way through.\u201d He averted his eyes from Fionnula\u2019s pathetic body as if he couldn\u2019t stand the sight. \u201cShe were already dead by the time we made it \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the fire start?\u201d Mick asked.</p><p>But at that moment Bran shoved past Bert in the doorway. Bran\u2019s face was blackened, his hair straggling about his shoulders. He saw the still form on the floor and froze.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned. \u201cAw, Bran\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bran batted aside the hand that Harry would\u2019ve set on his arm. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>He sank to his knees beside Fionnula and carefully lifted the handkerchief from her face. For a long moment he simply stared at the horror and then he abruptly jerked aside and vomited.</p><p>\u201cShe were a brave lass,\u201d Bert said thickly, his eyes reddening. \u201cMust\u2019ve jus\u2019 \u2019ad time to shove the babe under the bed afore they were in the rooms.\u201d</p><p>Bran had his hands over his face and was simply rocking as if too stunned to move away from his position beside Fionnula. His reaction was stronger than Mick would\u2019ve expected\u2014he\u2019d never thought the boy as in love with Fionnula as she\u2019d been with him. Perhaps it was the shock of her terrible death.</p><p>Or perhaps Mick simply didn\u2019t understand love.</p><p>Mick felt Silence shudder within his arms as she stifled a sob.</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cA brave lass indeed. We\u2019ll give her a proper burial, Bran, never ye fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Bran looked up, his face white and clear of tears. His eyes seemed to burn in the parchment of his face. \u201cThe Vicar had her killed because of your damned war, because of your damned pride! You whoreson! You should\u2019ve killed him years ago, simply taken over his business and been done with him. But you\u2019re too high in the instep for gin.\u201d He spat, the glob of phlegm hitting the floor with a loud splat. \u201cDamn you, her death is on your soul.\u201d</p><p>Mick watched Bran throughout this tirade, not bothering to defend himself, though he did put his body between the grief-stricken boy and Silence. He glanced at Harry and nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome on now.\u201d Harry reached down and took Bran\u2019s arm. \u201cTimes like these\u2019s good for gettin\u2019 roarin\u2019 drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Bran tried to wrench his arm from Harry\u2019s grasp, but his heart didn\u2019t seem to be in it anymore. The big man drew him up easily and hustled him to the door.</p><p>Mick glanced at Bert. \u201cSee that the room\u2019s cleaned and Fionnula\u2019s taken to the cellars until we can bury her.\u201d</p><p>Bert nodded, his hangdog face heavy with sorrow.</p><p>Mick turned and left the room with Mary and Silence. He wanted them away from the scent of death and tragedy.</p><p>His own room hadn\u2019t been touched. For a moment Mick narrowed his eyes, considering. The palace was a large and deliberately labyrinthine building. Finding a specific room was hard for those not initiated into its secrets. Yet the Vicar\u2019s men had found Silence\u2019s room very rapidly and without error, it seemed. How\u2014?</p><p>\u201cWhy did they kill her with vitriol?\u201d Silence whispered.</p><p>Mick looked down, his thoughts scattered. \u201cBecause o\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Her face was turned up toward his, pale and weary. She\u2019d been fond of Fionnula. She\u2019d be in mourning, too, along with Bran.</p><p>Her brows drew together in dazed puzzlement. \u201cBecause of you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. This was not the time or place, but he was all out of deceits and whiles. \u201cA long time ago I attacked a man with vitriol. Threw it in his face.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled. Well, and why wouldn\u2019t she? It was a horrific act, the action of an animal. Naturally she\u2019d be appalled.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He felt his own eyebrows arch in faint surprise. To question why an animal would act in an animalistic manner seemed absurd, but he humored her anyway.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to kill him and the vitriol was at hand.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and blinked it seemed with an effort. \u201cI\u2019m very tired,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cbut I know there must be more to the story than that...\u201d She trailed off and shook her head as if too weary to go on. \u201cI can\u2019t ask the right questions tonight, but tell me this: Why should your attack so long ago lead to Fionnula\u2019s death tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201cthe man I scarred with vitriol was Charlie Grady, the Vicar o\u2019 Whitechapel.\u201d</p><p>SILENCE STARED UP at Michael O\u2019Connor, pirate, thief, admitted murderer. He\u2019d confessed to a ghastly crime, one that led naturally to deserved retribution.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>And yet she refused to believe the worst of him\u2014even if he believed it of himself. She knew him better now. All she saw at this moment, late at night in a dark room, was the sorrow in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael,\u201d she said, and laid her palm against his cheek.</p><p>His black eyes flared wide in surprise and she almost laughed. Was compassion such a strange thing to him? Impulsively she stood on tiptoe and kissed him.</p><p>The heat of his mouth was a shock. She held the baby between their bodies and she\u2019d meant only a quick, careless kiss, but somehow nothing was careless with this man.</p><p>He opened his mouth and took control of the kiss, bending over her, surrounding her and Mary in a circle of protection. He tasted of the wine they\u2019d drunk at the opera\u2014so long ago it seemed now\u2014and the memory made her want to weep.</p><p>She broke away, intending to lay Mary down, to seek his arms with nothing between them, to find out what it was like to kiss him as a woman kisses a man.</p><p>But an arm wrapped around Michael\u2019s throat and yanked him backward.</p><p>Silence opened her mouth to scream and a hand was clamped over her face.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Winter whispered close to her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. We\u2019re here to take you away from him.\u201d</p><p>She stood still, her eyes wide over her brother\u2019s hand. No! They couldn\u2019t separate her from Michael now. She watched as Asa took the long knife from Michael\u2019s sleeve. Michael stood unnaturally calm.</p><p>He met her panicked gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t let it worry ye, love. They\u2019ll not hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Winter made the strangest sound\u2014almost a growl.</p><p>Behind them, an aristocratic voice drawled from the bedroom door, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be too confident of that, O\u2019Connor. Not if you\u2019ve harmed my sister-in-law.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head within Winter\u2019s grasp and saw Temperance\u2019s new husband, Lord Caire. He was an intimidating man even under the best of circumstances\u2014Lord Caire\u2019s hair was stark white, long and clubbed back, and he nearly always wore black in dramatic contrast. Tonight, though, his face was as grim as Silence had ever seen it, and her chest tightened in sudden fear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled Winter\u2019s hand, unresisting, from her lips. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t harm him. He hasn\u2019t offered me any disservice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no?\u201d Asa asked darkly. \u201cThen what do you call the embrace we witnessed when we entered?\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Concord scowled at Michael.</p><p>Silence could feel her face warming, but she tilted her chin up. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilence\u2014\u201d Concord began in a heated tone.</p><p>Lord Caire coughed into his hand, interrupting him. \u201cBut you see my dear, it is, actually, our business\u2014your well-being, both physically and spiritually. We\u2019ve come to take you and Mary Darling away.\u201d</p><p>Only a few days ago she would\u2019ve welcomed their interference. Now things were entirely different. She was different. She simply couldn\u2019t betray Michael. He\u2019d been attacked and his palace invaded. He needed her.</p><p>Michael saw the torment on her face. \u201cGo with them, love. \u2019Tis for the best. Me palace isn\u2019t safe anymore. I cannot protect ye by m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the admission. He was backing down, conceding the field\u2014for her. What must it have cost his pride to admit that he couldn\u2019t protect her in his own house? Tears suddenly pricked at her eyes, but she blinked them away fiercely. She wanted to keep his face in her sight as long as she could.</p> <p>Lord Caire turned and gave Michael a considering look. Michael met his eyes and some male communication seemed to pass between them.</p><p>Her brother-in-law nodded. \u201cThank you, O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>Michael returned the nod, but oddly it was Winter he spoke to. \u201cYe\u2019ll need to guard her and the babe night and day. The Vicar o\u2019 Whitechapel is me enemy and he\u2019ll think either o\u2019 them a fine prize.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked up at Winter. It was obvious that he had no love for Michael, but he gave one jerky nod. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Michael was suddenly in front of her, having apparently moved so swiftly he\u2019d taken Asa unawares. He took her face in his palms. \u201cRemember me.\u201d And then his mouth was on hers, hard and hot and open, his tongue thrusting into her mouth despite her brothers\u2019 presence.</p><p>There was a growl and he was torn from her. Silence was hustled into the hall. She held Mary Darling close as Asa, Winter, Concord, and Lord Caire formed a phalanx about them and escorted her from Michael\u2019s grand palace. They met no resistance, whether because Michael\u2019s men were busy elsewhere or because he\u2019d called them off, she didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Abruptly a door opened and she was once again out in the chill night air. She glanced over her shoulder at the palace\u2019s shabby outlines, and then she was helped gently but urgently into a waiting carriage.</p><p>The door slammed, a man called something, and the carriage jerked forward.</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d Temperance said, and Silence made out the dear face of her sister in the seat opposite.</p><p>For the second time in her life Silence burst into tears as her sister bore her away from Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s fortress.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Clever John put on his armor and went to the top of his mountain and called, \u201cTamara!\u201d</p><p>At once the rainbow bird swooped down from the clouds and circled his head before alighting and turning into the girl Tamara.</p><p>She clapped happily at the sight of Clever John. \u201cHow have you been, my friend?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you like your kingdom? Have you swum the sparkling lake?\u201d</p> <p>But Clever John merely frowned to the west where his neighbor was even now marching toward his castle. \u201cI wish for an invincible army.\u201d</p><p>Tamara threw up her arms. \u201cAs you wish!\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>\u201cI have a traitor,\u201d Mick said quietly just after midnight. He watched Harry to see how the other man would react to the news. He was almost certain that the traitor was not Harry, but then until the events of tonight he would\u2019ve said that none of his men would betray him.</p><p>That was patently not true.</p><p>And what was more, he\u2019d had to let Silence\u2019s brothers bear her away because the palace wasn\u2019t safe for her or the babe now. Conceding to anyone was not something Mick was used to doing. If any man had told him a month ago that he\u2019d let four men walk out of the palace with something\u2014someone\u2014he considered his, Mick would\u2019ve laughed in his face. But that was before Silence and the babe had come to be important to him. More important than even his self-esteem and his reputation. If that made him a weaker man, well, then so be it.</p><p>Harry\u2019s ugly face creased as he frowned. He looked troubled at the announcement of a traitor, but tellingly, not surprised.</p><p>\u201cYe figure \u2019twas a traitor let in the Vicar\u2019s men?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>Mick nodded and leaned back in his chair. They were in his planning room\u2014the safest place in the palace for a discussion such as this. The room lay against one of the outer walls, with thick interior walls on either side. The passage outside was the only entry point and Mick\u2019s desk lay across the room and out of earshot of anyone listening at the door.</p><p>He\u2019d always been a suspicious man, just, it seemed, not suspicious enough.</p><p>\u201cDid ye find out how the kitchen fire started?\u201d Mick asked.</p><p>The big man scratched his head while regarding the ceiling critically. \u201c \u2019Twere a bit \u2019ard to figure out, truth be told. \u2019Ole place is a mess and Archie in a right fit about it. \u2019E said \u2019e\u2019d gone to fetch some turnips and other victuals from the cellar and when \u2019e returned the kitchens were boiling with black smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chimney wasn\u2019t stopped?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head decisively. \u201cNaw. \u2019Tis drawin\u2019 well now. But me and Bert we found a pile o\u2019 greasy rags\u2014or what were left o\u2019 them\u2014by the back door. They might\u2019ve been lit and left to smolder while the traitor took to \u2019is \u2019eels.\u201d</p><p>Mick nodded. \u201cWho gave the alarm for the fire?\u201d</p><p>Harry screwed up his face, thinking for a moment. \u201cBran. Or maybe Archie.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEveryone were shoutin\u2019 at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when did you realize we were under attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe \u2019eard a scream\u2014must\u2019ve been Fionnula. They came at us as we tried to get back to the baby\u2019s rooms.\u201d Harry shook his head. \u201cThe \u2019all were full o\u2019 them, must\u2019ve been near two dozen or more armed men. We was fightin\u2019 them when ye came from the other way and we finally got to the rooms.\u201d He shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cThey must\u2019ve got to Fionnula almost at once. That vitriol doesn\u2019t kill fast like but she was already still when I found \u2019er.\u201d</p><p>Mick nodded. \u201cThe guards at the front door were hit from behind\u2014attacked from inside the palace.\u201d</p><p>Harry scowled. \u201c \u2019E\u2019s a right bastard \u2019ooever \u2019e is. Lettin\u2019 men in to kill a babe and a \u2019armless lass. If it weren\u2019t for Fionnula\u2019s quick thinkin\u2019 Mary might be dead as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not dead,\u201d Mick murmured absently. \u201cThe Vicar wanted her alive. She\u2019d be a good hostage against me\u2014she\u2019s me daughter. And the fact that he knows that, means the traitor has been tellin\u2019 him secrets for a bit. The Vicar knew about Mary, knew where she slept in me palace, and knew that I was away tonight. Come to think o\u2019 it, a traitor might be how the Vicar found out that she was hid at the orphanage in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Mick steepled his hands before him and stared at the rings sparkling on his fingers while he thought it out. The traitor\u2019s identity was obvious. He felt a small twinge of what might have been grief, but Mick ruthlessly shoved the useless emotion aside. The man had put both Silence and Mary Darling in danger. The only decision to be made was what to do about it. He could expose the traitor, have him killed as a warning to his other men. Or he could let the traitor think he was undiscovered and use the man against the Vicar.</p><p>Mick looked up at Harry, still standing patiently in front of the ornate desk. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to strike fast and hard, mind. I want ye and Bert to see to the repairs to the kitchen. See to it that Fionnula is buried proper with a pretty carved headstone. This news o\u2019 a traitor stays with ye and me\u2014I don\u2019t want it leavin\u2019 this room, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Harry said slowly. \u201cBut where will ye be, Mick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 after me lasses\u2014Mrs. Hollingbrook and Mary Darlin\u2019.\u201d Mick grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to double-bluff the bastard. Whisper it about that I think the Vicar will be expectin\u2019 an attack so I\u2019m delayin\u2019 me hand. Me leavin\u2019 London will add truth to the lie. But once I\u2019m gone and he\u2019s restin\u2019 easy I want ye and Bert to attack the Vicar\u2019s gin stills. They blow easily, gin stills, nice and high. The Vicar will be thinkin\u2019 I\u2019d attack his person, not his stills. We\u2019ll strike him where he earns his gold and cripple him.\u201d</p><p>Mick stood and began gathering papers on his desk. He still had to have a hasty meeting with Pepper if he were to leave London in the morning. The investments Pepper had made for him were now more important than ever.</p><p>Harry was silent and after a bit Mick glanced up at the man, half-expecting a protest.</p><p>Instead Harry merely looked sad. \u201c \u2019Twould be kinder to let \u2019er be.\u201d</p><p>Mick didn\u2019t pretend misunderstanding. \u201cAye, and if I could leave me Silence alone, none o\u2019 this would\u2019ve happened in the first place.\u201d He stood a moment, tasting the bitter irony on his tongue. Then he looked at Harry. \u201cCan ye do all that while I fetch her from whatever country wilderness her family has hidden her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Harry said grimly. \u201cWe\u2019ll blow that old bastard sky \u2019igh, never ye fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFOUR MEN KILLED and you didn\u2019t even get the baby,\u201d Charlie said softly. He looked at the carved marble headstone as he spoke, but he addressed the man at his side.</p><p>Freddy was standing close enough to hear Charlie\u2019s murmured words, but far enough away that he could swiftly duck any sudden blows. No fool, he.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019d \u2019idden the babe,\u201d Freddy said.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve found her.\u201d Charlie stroked the cold marble. Grace had been a good woman\u2014a loyal woman. \u201cThat babe means a lot to me, Freddy. I think I made that clear, did I not?\u201d</p><p>Freddy shifted uneasily. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman? The one you were supposed to kill with the vitriol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe were out wi\u2019 Charmin\u2019 Mickey. Went somewheres in a fancy carriage, all rigged out in silks.\u201d</p><p>Charlie glanced up slowly. \u201cDid she indeed?\u201d</p><p>Freddy looked alarmed at his tone. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that is of interest,\u201d Charlie mused. \u201cHe\u2019s never taken one of his doxies out before, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sits at \u2019is right \u2019and at \u2019is dinner table, too, so our spy says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh. Then I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t kill her outright after all.\u201d Charlie drew a deep breath and tilted his head back, feeling the dawning rays of the sun on the right side of his face. He felt nothing at all on the left side, of course. He traced the ragged ridges and furrows, the unnaturally smooth valleys, with his fingertips. Not since that day sixteen years ago when a small, beautiful boy with hatred in his black eyes had thrown vitriolic acid in his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited years for this day,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cFor what, Vicar?\u201d</p><p>Charlie lowered his chin and smiled into Freddy\u2019s horrified eyes. \u201cFor the day that Mickey O\u2019Connor chose a woman of his own.\u201d</p><p>THE DAY WAS well established when Silence woke from restless, dream-filled sleep. She lifted her head and immediately winced at the crick in her neck. Outside the carriage window the rays of the sun shone on gray fields rolling away to the horizon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make Oxford tonight,\u201d Temperance said from across the carriage.</p><p>She held Mary Darling in her lap. Mary was cradling a brand-new doll, but she cast it aside when she saw Silence was awake and stretched out her arms mutely.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Silence murmured as she took the babe. She\u2019d not traveled much outside London in her life, but she knew they\u2019d gone a great distance in the night. A great distance away from Michael.</p><p>\u201cWe changed horses in Chepping Wycombe,\u201d Temperance said, \u201cbut you did not wake. Caire tells me that we\u2019ll stop again in a bit for luncheon. There\u2019s a lovely inn in the next town with a cozy back room where we can sup in private. We stopped there on our way to Caire\u2019s estate in Shropshire after the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed then? Shropshire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we thought it the safest place\u2014away from London where we can guard you and Mary properly.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her name Mary made an impatient wiggle. The baby climbed from Silence\u2019s arms and sat beside her, though that certainly wouldn\u2019t last long. Mary hated sitting still, except when looking through the little illustrated book Michael had given Silence. She loved the little men in their funny boats and the strange monsters that rose from the tiny cobalt sea...</p><p>Silence remembered with a pang that the book was back at the palace. She\u2019d probably never see it again.</p><p>She sighed heavily and showed the baby her dolly. \u201cWhere is Lord Caire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s riding outside,\u201d Temperance replied. \u201cHe thought we might like the time alone together.\u201d</p><p>Silence flushed, looking away from her sister\u2019s too-perceptive sherry-brown eyes. Temperance always had been maddeningly helpful and levelheaded. \u201cI should thank you, I know.\u201d</p><p>Temperance pursed her lips thoughtfully, \u201cBut you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I will.\u201d Silence took a deep breath, trying to organize her muddled thoughts. \u201cThank you, truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance simply looked at her, eyebrows slightly raised.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Silence burst out. \u201cHe\u2019s a pirate and... and a terrible, nasty person who hurt me badly before and I was in his clutches\u2014\u201d</p><p>Temperance cleared her throat delicately. \u201cI heard you were rather enjoying his clutches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter tattled, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Silence asked darkly.</p><p>A corner of Temperance\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cIt was Asa, actually. He sounded a bit like an elderly maiden with shocked sensibilities.\u201d</p><p>Silence crossed her arms under her bosom and slumped rather mulishly in Caire\u2019s rich carriage seat. \u201cI suppose he and Concord are riding outside, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Temperance shook her head. \u201cConcord had to get back to the brewery. Asa rode with us as far as Chepping Wycombe last night, but then he muttered something about business that couldn\u2019t wait and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Silence didn\u2019t know whether to be hurt that her rescue apparently didn\u2019t rate very high on Asa\u2019s to-do list or relieved that she wouldn\u2019t have to face him again over luncheon. \u201cWinter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had to stay at the home, naturally,\u201d Temperance said gently. \u201cThey are rather short of help at the moment.\u201d</p><p>And that was her fault, as well. Silence bit her lip, looking out the window as the gray scenery passed. The sun had risen fully, but it was rather defeated by the late winter landscape. The day looked cold and unwelcoming.</p><p>She\u2019d made a muddle of this, she knew. She\u2019d gone to Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s house initially intending to merely endure to the best of her ability\u2014and she\u2019d ended by calling him \u201cMichael\u201d and kissing him enthusiastically in his bedroom.</p><p>Well, but that was the thing, wasn\u2019t it? He was no longer Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, infamous pirate, to her. She found him charming, yes, it was true, but charming in a much more intimate, personal way. She\u2019d never been tempted by the pirate.</p><p>She was deeply tempted by the man.</p><p>\u201cThat dress is quite lovely,\u201d Temperance observed in a carefully even tone.</p><p>Silence swallowed a lump in her throat. Her indigo dress was lovely\u2014and she\u2019d probably never have occasion to wear it again. He\u2019d promised to take her to the opera once more and now he never would.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seduced you, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Temperance asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNot in the way you mean,\u201d Silence answered without looking away from the dismal view. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to his bed. But, yes, I suppose I am seduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Silence shook her head slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s different than what everyone thinks him. Well, different and yet the same. He\u2019s so... so much more. More charming, stronger, more clever. I don\u2019t know if he has any sense of shame, but I do know he feels\u2014and feels deeply. And... and that fascinates me\u2014the difference between his public face and his private face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that sounds like he cares at all for you,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d Silence stared at her lap. \u201cI think he does care something for me, actually. You haven\u2019t seen the way he\u2019s taken care of me, after all. But I\u2019m not sure that really matters in the end\u2014whether he cares for me or not. It has no bearing on my feelings toward him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Temperance said, her voice hard now. \u201cBut you must see that it has a great deal to do with how I feel about Mr. O\u2019Connor. I don\u2019t want to see you hurt again. And I\u2019m not the only one who feels thusly. I\u2019ve never seen Concord so beside himself.\u201d</p><p>Silence winced. \u201cWas he very angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was mostly worry, but of course he showed it as anger\u2014he is a man after all. It took Winter half the night to convince Concord to go home to his family. Otherwise your Mr. O\u2019Connor might be sporting a blackened eye this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsa was quite upset, I think, though one can never quite tell with him, and Winter... Silence, Winter has been terribly grim. He loves you, you know, in his own quiet way, and I think he\u2019s spent the time you were away worrying constantly.\u201d</p><p>Silence closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never meant to make Winter worry. But Michael said we were in danger. And last night proved his concern quite real.\u201d Her lips trembled again at the memory of Fionnula\u2019s poor, ruined face. \u201cThe Vicar\u2019s men killed the girl who\u2019d been looking after Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Temperance said sincerely. \u201cCaire and Asa have been watching Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s house for the last two days, waiting for a chance to come and get you out. When they saw the smoke and the commotion, they sent for Winter and went inside.\u201d</p><p>Silence nodded. \u201cThe guards were killed at the front doors. Otherwise they would never have made it past the front hall.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while, Silence thinking of Fionnula and worrying about Michael, still in danger from his enemies. Mary played for a bit, then let her dolly fall to the floor and knelt on the seat to look out the window.</p><p>Finally Silence sighed and glanced over at her sister. Temperance seemed younger somehow, she realized. She wasn\u2019t more than eight-and-twenty of course, but for many years Temperance had been so grave, so mature and... and stodgy. \u201cMarriage suits you.\u201d</p><p>She had the satisfaction of watching her elder sister blush. \u201cOh! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Silence smiled a little. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it? Being loved. Loving in return.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire might be an intimidating man, but when he looked at Temperance something seemed to go still behind his eyes and he became entirely focused on her. Silence shivered. Had William loved her with such all-consuming devotion? She realized, a little sadly, that no, he hadn\u2019t. She might\u2019ve built a life around him\u2014and the dream of him\u2014but he had always been quite autonomous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simply wonderful,\u201d Temperance said, interrupting her gloomy thoughts. \u201cSometimes I find myself just looking at him and smiling. He\u2019ll catch me and give me the most puzzled look and I can\u2019t help laughing in his face and then he...\u201d She shook her head and stopped. \u201cWell, marriage is wonderful. I never knew it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t love Benjamin as you do Lord Caire,\u201d Silence murmured. Temperance had been married very briefly when she was only a girl.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Temperance said quietly. \u201cI never knew I could be this close to another person. It was such a surprise to me. But it\u2019s not a surprise for you. You had this same thing with William.\u201d</p><p>Temperance\u2019s voice was gentle, but Silence still braced herself for the arrow of pain at the mention of William\u2019s name. Strangely though, the hit wasn\u2019t as bad as she expected. Oh, the pain of William\u2019s loss was still there, of course. Perhaps it always would be. But it was dulled now and a little distant.</p><p>The pain that was close and immediate was the loss of Michael.</p><p>Silence sat stunned at the thought. She\u2019d become intimate with him, it was true, but she never believed that Michael might mean something permanent to her. The notion was disquieting. After this morning she wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d see him again.</p><p>\u201cSilence?\u201d Temperance asked tentatively.</p><p>Silence sighed and shook her head. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve created a mess!\u201d</p><p>Her sister smiled. \u201cIt can\u2019t be as bad as all that.\u201d</p><p>Silence gave her a speaking glance. \u201cI think I may be falling in love with a pirate.\u201d</p><p>Temperance blinked. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh.\u201d Silence leaned her head back against the squabs. \u201cHe\u2019s entirely the wrong man for me. Not like William who was calm and kind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd good,\u201d Temperance put in drily.</p><p>Silence glanced at her helplessly. \u201cWhat am I to do? I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ll see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t want to hear this,\u201d Temperance said gently.</p><p>Silence scrunched her nose and turned back to the gloomy view. Still, she couldn\u2019t ignore Temperance\u2019s words:</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>An army appeared at the base of the mountain, mounted men in armor and warriors on foot, carrying shields and swords. Quickly, Clever John ran down the mountain and led his army into battle to defend the kingdom. The shouts of men and the screams of horses were heard for miles around. When the shadows began to grow long, Clever John looked up and saw that his enemy was defeated. Only then did he notice the blue feather stuck in the links of the armor covering his right arm....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Naturally, Lord Caire would have an overwhelmingly elegant country residence. Silence listlessly perused the great library in Lord Caire\u2019s country manor, hoping for something\u2014anything\u2014to distract her from thoughts of Michael. The late afternoon sun shone in the glass doors, illuminating the great bookshelves that lined three walls of the room.</p><p>She\u2019d heard no word from Michael in the week since she\u2019d hastily left his palace.</p><p>She really ought to be more grateful. Huntington Manor was huge and rambling with lovely food and servants to take care of her every need. Actually she hadn\u2019t quite gotten used to the servants. The butler was a terribly daunting elderly man and Silence found herself flushing furiously every time she had to speak to him. Oddly, Temperance seemed right at home as the new Lady Caire. One would think she\u2019d always been a baron\u2019s wife from the ease with which she consulted with the cook about meals and the housekeeper about decorations and such.</p><p>Silence shook her head and trailed her fingers over the spines of the books lined up like soldiers. The library, like everything else in Caire\u2019s country estate, was magnificently appointed. Histories, poetry, philosophy, and even a few works of fiction could be found here. She should be happy to have the chance to simply sit and read. She had no chores here, no tasks or worries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGah!\u201d Mary said, patting the glass on the French doors. They looked out over a terrace bordered by a mown lawn. Mary was carefully walking down the glass doors, admiring the view and the crows on the lawn.</p><p>Silence turned back to the bookshelf and pulled out a book at random. It was a treatise on Latin history\u2014or so she thought. Her Latin was rather poor. She wrinkled her nose and replaced the book.</p><p>A week and no word from Michael. Well, it was silly to expect otherwise, wasn\u2019t it? He\u2019d sent her away with Caire and her brothers and even though he\u2019d done so to protect her, perhaps he\u2019d been secretly relieved to see her go. Without her around he could have tarts in his palace once again\u2014two at a time in his bed, if he wished!\u2014and go back to his wastrel pirate ways.</p><p>Silence kicked the lower shelf.</p> <p>\u201cGoggie!\u201d Mary Darling said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie,\u201d Silence said, \u201cthose are crows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoggie!\u201d</p><p>A thump came from the windows.</p><p>Silence turned, alarmed that Mary might\u2019ve fallen, but the toddler was still standing against the windows. And on the other side was a very familiar dog wagging his tail like mad.</p> <p>\u201cLad?\u201d Silence whispered. She swiftly crossed to the glass doors and looked out. Dusk was gathering, but she thought she saw something flash in the trees beyond the lawn. \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>There were guards, of course. The first thing Lord Caire had done on reaching his country residence was hire several strong men from the village to patrol the grounds. Silence craned her neck and saw two men just disappearing around the far corner of the house. She knew from watching them that they wouldn\u2019t be back around to this side again for another ten minutes or more.</p><p>That is, if they didn\u2019t reverse their course.</p><p>Hastily she found a pencil and flipped through the Latin book until she found a blank page. Silence wrote a short note to Temperance and left the book on a table, opened to the note. Then she scooped Mary up in her arms and went out the French doors. Lad immediately began jumping around them like a maddened hare, but fortunately he seemed to know enough not to bark.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she hissed at the dog, feeling like a fool.</p><p>Lad pricked his ears forward and then turned to look at the trees.</p> <p>Well, that was clear enough.</p><p>Silence darted across the lawn, arriving at the tree line breathless and with her heart beating in a staccato rhythm. She peered into the dark copse, but didn\u2019t see anyone. Disappointment seeped into her chest. Perhaps she\u2019d been mistaken at the flash. Perhaps Lad had somehow followed them from London. Perhaps\u2014</p><p>A hand clamped over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Michael murmured.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He lifted his hand and then just watched her. He was different\u2014his clothing dark and plainer than any she\u2019d ever seen on him. His coat was brown, his hat a simple black tricorne. And he\u2019d covered his extravagant hair with an anonymous white wig, making his face appear leaner, his cheekbones sharper. His black eyebrows winging up so starkly against the white of the wig made him look more Satanic, more stern than ever.</p><p>\u201cWill ye come with me?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she answered without hesitation. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p> <p>WINTER SIGHED SILENTLY as he watched another elegantly dressed lady pick her way down the narrow alley leading to the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children. Lady Penelope wore an elaborately worked yellow silk gown with an embroidered jacket, and a velvet cloak thrown over her shoulders. The lady held her skirts high as she carefully stepped along, the jewels on her slippers winking in the sunlight. Behind her, Miss Greaves trailed, much less richly dressed and holding a silly little white dog in her arms. Winter eyed the winking jewels on the slippers sourly. The cost of those slippers could probably keep the home in coal and candles for an entire year.</p><p>At least he no longer had to worry about Silence, now that Caire and Temperance had her safely hidden at Caire\u2019s. Still that didn\u2019t quite make another day wasted with silly society ladies bearable.</p><p>\u201cOh, they do look splendid, don\u2019t they?\u201d Nell Jones commented beside him.</p><p>Winter coughed. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children are so looking forward to singing for the ladies,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve become quite good at singing the same words at almost the same time.\u201d</p><p>Winter arched an eyebrow. The last time he\u2019d passed the classroom while the children were practicing, the sound had not been exactly melodious.</p><p>\u201cAnd Joseph Tinbox has memorized the psalm he is to recite,\u201d Nell went on. \u201cIf only we have enough biscuits for all the ladies! That last batch didn\u2019t turn out quite right.\u201d</p><p>Winter, having spent years dining upon the products of inexperienced cooks\u2014the girls of the home did most of the cooking\u2014knew better than to ask what exactly had happened to the last batch of biscuits. \u201cI\u2019m sure the biscuits will do very well.\u201d</p><p>Nell flashed him one of her quick smiles. \u201cWell, I just hope so. I wouldn\u2019t want to let you down, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t, Nell. That I\u2019m quite certain of,\u201d Winter said as he stepped forward to welcome Lady Penelope Chadwicke and her outrageously expensive slippers.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, Mr. Makepeace!\u201d Lady Penelope exclaimed. She wrinkled her nose as she let her skirts drop. \u201cI do think you should do something to make the street cleaner. Perhaps you could see about having it repaved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe home is only temporarily housed on this street, Penelope, dear,\u201d Miss Greaves murmured. \u201cPerhaps we should save large projects like repaving the street for the permanent residence.\u201d</p><p>Winter shot Miss Greaves a grateful look. The lady smiled shyly back at him and he noticed that her eyes were a rather lovely dark gray.</p><p>\u201cOh, I suppose that\u2019s the practical thing to do,\u201d Lady Penelope said with a pout. \u201cBut I do think practical things are so boring, don\u2019t you, Mr. Makepeace?\u201d</p><p>Winter opened his mouth, a little bemused by this frivolity, but was saved from having to reply by the sound of hooves clattering on cobblestones.</p><p>A trio of mounted soldiers pulled their horses to a halt before the home. The lead soldier, riding a huge black horse nodded formally.</p><p>\u201cSir, ladies. Have I the honor of addressing Mr. Winter Makepeace?\u201d</p><p>Winter felt everything within him still. He looked up into the man\u2019s face. The officer wore the standard white wig like his men. Beneath, his pale blue eyes were sharp and intelligent. His face was long, with deep lines incised on either side of his mouth, giving the impression of a man who had been so hardened by life that he no longer made concessions for those less capable than himself.</p><p>\u201cI am Winter Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>The officer nodded. \u201cPermit me then to introduce myself. I am Captain Jonathan Trevillion of the 4th Dragoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Winter said quietly. The ladies still stood by him, looking curiously up at the soldiers, but he made no move to introduce them to Captain Trevillion.</p><p>The other man noticed the omission with a tightening of his thin lips. \u201cMy men and I have orders to arrest any criminals we discover in St. Giles, with particular attention paid to the murderer called the Ghost of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderer?\u201d Nell exclaimed. \u201cBut the Ghost has never been proved to murder anyone!\u201d</p><p>Captain Trevillion turned his gimlet eyes on the maidservant. \u201cHe can defend himself in a court of law.\u201d</p><p>Winter snorted under his breath. The Ghost might \u201cdefend\u201d his innocence, but only if he could afford to pay the magistrate. The courts were notoriously corrupt in London.</p><p>\u201cI expect your cooperation in this endeavor, Mr. Makepeace,\u201d Captain Trevillion said coolly. \u201cI shall be requesting the same from the other merchants and men of business in St. Giles, but as an educated man, I hope in particular to have your cooperation. Do I have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Winter said. He laid a restraining hand on Nell. The maidservant seemed about to make another protest. \u201cWe will do whatever we can to help the king\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The captain nodded. \u201cWhatever rumors you may hear will be of great help in hunting the Ghost of St. Giles and other miscreants. Indeed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a brave man,\u201d came a husky feminine voice, \u201cto declare he will hunt the Ghost of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>Winter stiffened even before he turned to see Lady Beckinhall. He\u2019d been so intent on the confrontation with Captain Trevillion that he\u2019d not been aware of her approach. The thought shocked him almost as much as the wash of quite inappropriate gladness that shot through him at the sight of her.</p><p>Lady Beckinhall wore a flaming red gown today, covered in silver embroidery. He felt a muscle in his cheek twitch. Her gown was at least as grand as Lady Penelope\u2019s, perhaps more so, and it set off her rich mahogany hair exquisitely. Yet it wasn\u2019t the expensiveness of her attire that perturbed him.</p><p>No. Disconcertingly, it was the woman herself.</p><p>Lady Beckinhall smiled quite blindingly and held out one slim hand to the man on the horse. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met, Captain.\u201d</p><p>The soldier took her gloved hand and bowed over it. \u201cCaptain Trevillion at your service, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Lady Beckinhall drawled. \u201cHow charming.\u201d</p><p>A faint red stain tinged the captain\u2019s craggy cheekbones, poor bastard. \u201cIf you say so, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do.\u201d Lady Beckinhall glanced around at the people gathered before the home\u2019s door. \u201cTo chase down a bloodthirsty murderer? Quite charming indeed.\u201d</p><p>Lady Penelope gave a shriek at the word \u201cbloodthirsty.\u201d \u201cOh, my goodness! You told us the Ghost was harmless, Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>Captain Trevillion\u2019s stern eyes swung to Winter. \u201cYou have had some dealings with the Ghost of St. Giles, Mr. Makepeace?\u201d</p><p>Winter shrugged. \u201cSome. As I say, he never seemed particularly dangerous to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been accused of several bloody murders,\u201d Captain Trevillion said.</p><p>Lady Penelope shrieked again.</p><p>Winter winced.</p><p>\u201cBut have no fear, darling,\u201d Lady Beckinhall drawled, \u201cCaptain Trevillion is here to protect us, are you not, Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a good thing since we seem to have no other gentlemen as stalwart as the captain.\u201d Lady Beckinhall widened her eyes at Winter.</p><p>Winter felt his jaw tighten at the ridiculous insult to his manhood, but he did his best not to let her see it. Instead he looked up at the captain. \u201cIf that is all, sir, I will bid you good day and see my guests inside the house.\u201d</p><p>Captain Trevillion bowed again. \u201cGood day to you, sir. Ladies.\u201d</p><p>He wheeled the big black and set it to a trot, his men following behind. In another moment they were around a corner and gone from sight.</p><p>\u201cMy nerves are quite overset,\u201d Lady Penelope declared. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Sugar\u2019s are as well\u201d\u2014she waved vaguely at the little white dog, which appeared to be asleep in her companion\u2019s arms\u2014\u201cI do hope that even a bachelor establishment such as yours has some tea and refreshments available, Mr. Makepeace?\u201d</p><p>A bachelor establishment? What odd phrasing. Winter pasted a polite smile on his face and bowed to the silly woman. \u201cOf course, Lady Penelope.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and watched her and Miss Greaves step inside. Lady Beckinhall was behind them and he cleared his throat as she drew abreast of him.</p><p>\u201cI thought not to see you here again, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you not?\u201d Her eyebrows arched over mischievous eyes. \u201cBut then I\u2019ve decided that the home needs my help, even if you don\u2019t think so, Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>And she swept inside, leaving him to follow her, his eyes narrowed in contemplation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ALMOST A WEEK later Silence frowned over her knitting. It was always hard to make the heel of a stocking, but this one seemed particularly misshapen. Michael\u2019s carriage gave a bump and began slowing. She glanced out the window and saw that they were turning into a narrow, tree-lined country lane. Lad the dog raised his head at the change in speed. He lay on the floor of the carriage, taking up far too much room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we stopping?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a London inn.\u201d</p><p>The last week had been a blur of tedious travel over bumpy roads, interrupted now and again by stops at little inns where the food could vary quite drastically from good to inedible. Each night she\u2019d fallen into a strange bed, exhausted, with Mary Darling snuggled close to her side. She\u2019d woken in the mornings to find Michael already up from whatever bed he\u2019d spent the night in and usually bringing her a pot of tea. He\u2019d been kind and attentive and rather distant, now that she thought of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Greenwich,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe\u2019re home.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him, sitting across the carriage with the baby on his lap, and as always the sight of him made her heart beat faster. \u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>He smiled crookedly, but didn\u2019t answer. He wore the same clothes he\u2019d had on when he\u2019d first come for her at Lord Caire\u2019s residence: worn and simple. She was almost used to this more sedate Michael. This Michael who might have been a traveling merchant or prosperous farmer.</p><p>What an odd thought. Silence peered out the window to try and find out what \u201chome\u201d was to Michael. The tree-lined lane opened up to a small circular drive in front of a mansion made of warm red brick. Ivy covered one corner, its branches still bare, and a half dozen chimneys rambled over the gabled roofs. Tender green shoots had begun to poke through the soil around the foundation of the house.</p><p>Silence looked at Michael in surprise. The mansion was quite lovely, it did indeed look like someone\u2019s \u201chome\u201d\u2014but certainly not a pirate\u2019s.</p><p>He gave her a wry glance as if he knew her thoughts. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted Mary Darling in his arms, practiced now after a week of keeping her entertained in a cramped carriage. He descended the steps and held out a hand to help Silence step down. Lad bounded down from the carriage last, ran to water a tree, and then began running in wide circles.</p><p>Silence shook out her skirts and looked up. A short, stout butler had appeared on the front steps to the house, flanked by two young maids and an older woman.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Bittner,\u201d Michael called as they approached the steps.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Rivers,\u201d the butler replied. His round red face beamed under a snowy white wig. \u201cI trust you had a pleasant journey, sir?\u201d</p><p>Silence blinked and glanced at Michael, but instead of correcting the elderly man, he merely nodded. \u201cPleasant enough. Have you made the arrangements I asked for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed, sir,\u201d Bittner replied. \u201cMrs. Bittner made sure to procure the very best nursemaids from the village. This is Rose and her younger sister Annie.\u201d</p> <p>The girls curtsied shyly. The elder one was probably in her early twenties, while the younger was still a teenager. Both were fresh-faced and pretty with striking blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cRose has worked five years in the Johnson family nursery,\u201d Mrs. Bittner cut in eagerly. She was a couple of inches taller than her husband, but just as rosy.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Michael said.</p><p>Mrs. Bittner nodded vigorously. \u201cThe Johnsons have seven children, would you believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she should be quite capable of handling one small child,\u201d Michael said. He glanced down at Mary who hid her face shyly in the lapels of his coat. He looked up again and drew Silence closer. \u201cThis is my friend Mrs. Hollingbrook. I trust you all will extend every courtesy to her while she is a guest in my home.\u201d</p><p>Silence felt a blush creep up her cheeks. Only one kind of woman resided unaccompanied at a bachelor\u2019s house. But she saw no trace of disapproval on the servants\u2019 faces. Indeed, they were quite respectful as they curtsied and bowed.</p><p>\u201cNaturally so, Mr. Rivers,\u201d Mrs. Bittner said. \u201cShall I show Mrs. Hollingbrook to her rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Michael said.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bittner led her inside. The entry hall was neatly appointed, with wood floors and paneling gleaming with beeswax. Windows to either side of the front door as well as above it let in the late afternoon light, making the space warm and welcoming. A heavy wood staircase to one side of the hall led to the upper floors.</p><p>\u201cThis way, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mrs. Bittner said as she mounted the stairs.</p><p>Silence followed after her, glancing about curiously. Oil paintings decorated the stairs, but they weren\u2019t in what Silence thought of as Michael\u2019s usual style. There were a few landscapes, but the majority depicted sailing ships of all things.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Mrs. Bittner called.</p><p>Silence had paused by a huge painting of a ship in harbor. \u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>She hurried after and found the housekeeper standing in the doorway of a bright little room. Silence entered, looking around. It was a beautiful room, done in several shades of blue. In fact, it rather reminded her of her rooms at Michael\u2019s palace. She turned to look at the walls and saw the connecting door almost immediately.</p><p>No need to ask whose rooms lay beyond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the girls bring up some hot water,\u201d Mrs. Bittner was saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll have supper at seven. That\u2019ll give you several hours to refresh yourself and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Silence replied. She hesitated, then blurted out. \u201cHow long have you known Mr. Rivers?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bittner had been drawing the curtains. She paused and looked over her shoulder. \u201cBless you, dearie, it\u2019s been five or more years since Mr. Rivers hired me and Bittner to look after Windward House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindward House?\u201d Silence asked, utterly charmed. \u201cIs that what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bittner smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling. \u201cAs long as anyone in the area can remember. We thought Mr. Rivers might want to change the name to Rivers House, but he said Windward House suited him fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s lived here ever since?\u201d Silence asked, just to see what the housekeeper would say.</p><p>\u201cWell, when he has a chance he does,\u201d Mrs. Bittner replied. \u201cHis business takes him away most of the time, poor gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is Mr. Rivers\u2019s business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know, ma\u2019am?\u201d Mrs. Bittner\u2019s brows crinkled. \u201cHe\u2019s a shipbuilder, is our Mr. Rivers. Makes the finest ships to sail out of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Silence said because she couldn\u2019t think of what else to reply. A shipbuilder? How fanciful! And yet dressed the way he\u2019d been for the last week, with his hair hidden sedately under the ubiquitous men\u2019s white wig, Michael might indeed be a prosperous shipbuilder.</p><p>\u201cWill that be all, ma\u2019am?\u201d Mrs. Bittner asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Silence smiled absently.</p><p>The door closed behind the housekeeper and Silence went to part the curtain and peer out the windows.</p><p>What other secrets had Michael hidden so well from her?</p><p>Silence only had time to notice that her room had a lovely view of a garden in back before the water arrived. It was pleasingly warm and Silence washed her hands and face before lying down on the soft bed.</p><p>But within minutes she was up again. She was simply too curious to lie abed when she could be exploring Michael\u2019s secret house.</p><p>Outside her door was a hallway. She knew whose room was beside her own, and after opening a few doors she saw that the rest of the rooms in the hall were empty bedrooms.</p><p>Well, that was rather boring.</p><p>The stairs led both up and down. Up would almost certainly hold the nursery. She mounted the stairs and found the upper floor lined with windows facing south, the late afternoon sunlight pouring in. At the end of the bright hallway was a door.</p><p>She opened it and peeked inside.</p><p>Mary Darling sat in the middle of a large, beautiful nursery. The room was situated on a corner of the house and had windows on two sides with new bars to keep Mary safely in. There was a small bed and tiny dresser, and though there were only a few playthings, Mary\u2019s new dolly had already been installed on top of the pillows on the bed. Anne was showing Mary a little wooden wagon with flocked horses to draw it, but on her entrance Mary looked up.</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d The baby got to her feet and toddled to Silence.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you, Miss Mary?\u201d Silence smiled. The baby was freshly washed and wearing a new rose-colored dress that contrasted nicely with her glossy black hair. Silence looked at the nurse who had sprung to her feet. \u201cDo you mind if I take Mary for a walk, Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Silence picked up Mary and bore her away. \u201cShall we see what we can find downstairs?\u201d</p><p>She descended the stairs, holding Mary. Below, they startled a little maid, dusting the pictures in the hall. They paused for a moment to examine the portrait of a funny spaniel dog before continuing. Further along the hall was an open door on the right. Silence tiptoed in and guessed from the masculine furnishings and the huge desk that this must be Michael\u2019s study. She spent a few minutes peering at the sketches of ships and sails on the walls, and then Mary Darling indicated that she was bored.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Silence murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s see what else we can discover.\u201d</p><p>Across from the study was a closed door. Silence gently pushed it open, expecting a little sitting room perhaps.</p><p>The room took up the entire south side of the house and was lined with French doors that let in the sun\u2019s rays. A vast carpet covered the floor in muted shades of cream, apricot, and grass green, and scattered here and there were comfortable groupings of plush chairs and polished tables. The walls were lined with honey-colored wood, and everywhere there were books. Big books, small books, books on tables, books laying open as if abandoned by a recent reader. Some were old with crumbling spines, some looked so new they might never have been read, and all were illustrated.</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d Mary said, and Silence absently set her on the floor.</p><p>This room was so elegant, and at the same time so comfortable. It was as if Michael had taken his library at the palace and made it something a person might actually want to spend time in.</p><p>Days in.</p><p>Silence looked around in wonder. By the window was a simple wooden stand with an enormous book opened on it. Silence went to it and looked down. An azure butterfly lay on the page, trembling and delicate, and almost alive. Carefully she turned the page and found an exotic black and white striped butterfly.</p><p>This was his butterfly book, she realized. The first book he\u2019d kept. The one that had taught him that there was beauty in the world. She\u2019d found Michael\u2019s treasure, the heart he\u2019d kept hidden.</p><p>She looked up and saw that at the top of the walls, where it met the ceiling, the wood had been carved. Butterflies cleverly flew all around the room.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like it?\u201d</p><p>She spun and was unsurprised to see Michael standing in the doorway, Lad by his side. \u201cI do. It\u2019s... wonderful.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and nodded at the windows where Mary stood. \u201cMary wants to see the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a garden?\u201d Somehow the information made her want to smile, as well.</p><p>\u201cThere is in summer. It\u2019s not much more than bare earth at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, can we see?\u201d</p><p>In answer he crossed the room and opened one of the French doors. Outside a paved terrace separated the house from a garden. Low evergreen hedges demarcated earthen beds, most of them barren.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Silence crouched over the nearest bed. Someone had planted crocuses and they had spread on their own, like a living carpet, spilling into the lawn. Their delicate purple petals fluttered in the spring breeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBye!\u201d Mary said. She crouched in mimic next to Silence and pointed one stubby finger at a small, azure butterfly, sitting on a crocus.</p><p>The butterfly startled at Mary\u2019s gesture and floated up, drifting on the breeze, its wings sparkling blue and bright in the late afternoon sunshine.</p><p>Silence watched it, enthralled, and then her eyes met Michael\u2019s.</p><p>A corner of his mouth cocked up. \u201cWelcome home, m\u2019love.\u201d</p> <p>MICK GAVE A last tug to his neck cloth and scowled at himself in the small mirror over the dresser. His rooms at Windward House weren\u2019t nearly as ostentatious as those in his palace, but he had kept one thing the same: his bed here was just as big as the one in his palace. He glanced around his rooms. It had taken him years to outfit this hidey-hole, this refuge where no one knew him as Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, and at first he\u2019d felt foreign in this house. After all, he wore different clothes, used a different accent. He was a different man here. But somehow over the years, that different man had become merely another facet of him. Now he felt nearly as comfortable wearing Michael Rivers\u2019s staid clothes as he did Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s flamboyant costume.</p><p>So if revealing his other identity to Silence wasn\u2019t the reason for his present nerves, what was? He\u2019d supped every meal with Silence over the last week. There was no reason then for this missish skittishness.</p><p>He cursed and thrust himself away from the mirror. No reason, and yet here he was delaying by playing with a plain neck cloth\u2014he who usually wore silks and velvet!</p><p>Mick strode out of his room and down the hall. Bittner had already announced supper and Cook did hate it when he was late. But that was not what made his pace quicken. It was the thought of seeing Silence again. Mick snorted. Oh, he had it bad! Like a lad with peach down on his cheeks with his very first tart.</p><p>Except that if Silence were a tart, he\u2019d be much more sure of what to do with her. No, he\u2019d had to go and fall for a respectable lady. A lady with swirling hazel eyes that hid secrets he wanted to spend the rest of his life exploring.</p> <p>Mick paused outside the dining room to catch his breath. And now he\u2019d brought her to his secret hidey-hole that only Harry, of all his men, knew about. He was exposing himself, he knew. Ah, well, and he couldn\u2019t even regret doing it. She and the babe needed to be hidden while Harry did Mick\u2019s bidding in London and this was the safest place.</p><p>With that thought he opened the door to the dining room.</p><p>Silence was already inside, sitting primly on the right hand side of the head of the table. She wore a simple blue and white print gown\u2014one that he\u2019d had sent up to her, for she\u2019d fled her brother-in-law\u2019s house with only the clothes upon her back. It gave him a satisfied feeling to see her in clothes that he\u2019d provided for her and he smiled as he prowled down the length of the room toward her.</p><p>She met his gaze steadily though her cheeks stained pink. \u201cI was beginning to wonder if you\u2019d join me, Mr. Rivers.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. Had he imagined her emphasis on his assumed name? \u201cAnd leave a lovely lady like yourself alone? I think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p> <p>He sat and looked at her. \u201cHow is Mary Darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast asleep after playing and having a bath,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nursery is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose and Annie are obviously practiced nursemaids, and what is even better, they seem to like Mary, and she them.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cIt would take a hard heart to turn away from my Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved the corners of her lips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem too enamored of her when you first met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a forceful personality, as do I. We just took a bit to get to know one another.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously. \u201cI think your Irish has mysteriously disappeared from your speech, Mr. Rivers.\u201d</p> <p>No, he\u2019d not imagined the emphasis. He shot her a warning look as Mrs. Bittner entered with a steaming dish.</p><p>The housekeeper bustled around the table serving roasted chicken, boiled vegetables, jellies, and fruit. A little maid trailed behind her, acting as acolyte to the service.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d Mrs. Bittner exclaimed when the table was laden. \u201cWill you be wanting anything else, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, no,\u201d Mick murmured.</p><p>The housekeeper nodded in satisfaction and left with the maid.</p><p>\u201cWill you have some chicken?\u201d Mick asked as he reached for the dish.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she answered quite politely. \u201cAre you in disguise here?\u201d</p><p>He ought to have known she wouldn\u2019t let it drop.</p><p>He gave her a wing and some breast meat. \u201cNot exactly, but I find it... useful to have a place where I\u2019m not known as the pirate Mickey O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d served himself and then tasted the chicken. \u201cThen you\u2019re a simple English gentleman when you\u2019re at Windward House.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you really build ships?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I come to be a shipbuilder, do you mean?\u201d He cut into his chicken. \u201cSeveral years ago I hired Pepper to manage my money. He advised me that it would be wise to invest some of it in a business that wasn\u2019t linked to my pirating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why shipbuilding?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou could\u2019ve chosen anything, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d He ate a bite of chicken and chewed as he thought. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired the ships that dock in London. I used to sit and watch them for hours at a time when I was a lad. Shipbuilding seemed a natural business to invest in. Too, there was an established shipbuilder\u2014his business has been in his family for three generations\u2014who was in need of financial backing. That was where I came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the investment has worked well for you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI make nearly as much from the shipbuilding business as I do from pirating.\u201d</p><p>She frowned a bit, drank a little of her wine, and set the glass carefully down.</p><p>He tensed with foreboding. He expected her to bring up again the topic of him retiring from pirating, but she spoke about something entirely different instead.</p><p>\u201cThat night when the palace was attacked,\u201d she said, \u201cyou told me that you had thrown vitriol in the Vicar of Whitechapel\u2019s face, but you did not tell me why.\u201d She looked up at him, her hazel eyes dark in the candlelight. \u201cCan you tell me now?\u201d</p><p>He froze as her question caught him off guard. He\u2019d been expecting the question all this long week, yet she\u2019d chosen to ask it when he\u2019d at last come home. For that at least he supposed he should be grateful.</p><p>He took a sip of the wine because his mouth had grown dry. It was a French wine and of an excellent vintage, but it tasted like vinegar in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was a boy,\u201d he began and then stopped. How could he tell her? This was the most wretched part of his life\u2014the most wretched part of him. How could he expose her to it?</p><p>She waited, sitting quietly, her back straight, her eyes clear and innocent, and he could only stare at her, the words clogged in his throat.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d she whispered at last. \u201cMichael, can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>And her voice was like a drought of sweet water relieving his thirst, quenching his pain.</p><p>\u201cI was a boy,\u201d he said again, holding her gaze, for it seemed the only way he could speak this terrible evil. \u201cAnd me mam and I lived with him, Charlie Grady, the Vicar of Whitechapel, though back then he was only Charlie Grady. He made gin in St. Giles and he sent me mam out to walk the streets at night.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but her eyes seemed filled with sorrow. Sorrow for him, that innocent boy, long dead now.</p><p>\u201cSometimes she\u2019d bring her customers back with her, but mostly she sold her wares out on the streets, and she never said naught to me about those nights, but once in a while I\u2019d hear her crying...\u201d His voice trailed away and he watched his hand as he fingered his glass.</p><p>He hated to think about that time. Mostly he was able to push the memories to the back of his mind. Try to forget them, though he never could. Truth be told he didn\u2019t want to think about it now. But she wanted to know, so for her he\u2019d dredge up this foulness.</p><p>He took a drink to rinse the taste of evil from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe would sing to me in the evenings afore she went out, and her voice was sweet and low. She did her best to shield me from him, for he had terrible rages and then he\u2019d beat me. He never liked me much.\u201d He shrugged. That part of his story was common enough in St. Giles. \u201cBut when I were thirteen or thereabouts she got sick. It was winter and grain was running low. He couldn\u2019t pay for it, the price had ridden so high, and without the grain he couldn\u2019t make gin. And she\u2014she was too sick to go out at night.\u201d</p><p>He paused and the room was very quiet. From without, distantly, they could hear someone laughing in the kitchen.</p><p>He looked up at her because he wasn\u2019t a coward and he wouldn\u2019t have her pity him for one. \u201cI was a fair lad, pretty as a girl, and there are those who like such things, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her face had gone marble white, but she held his gaze and nodded her understanding once. No coward either, was his Silence.</p><p>\u201cHe said he had a taker for me and that I was to do as the man said or he\u2019d beat me until I couldn\u2019t move. Well.\u201d Mick inhaled, still holding those beautiful hazel eyes. \u201cI was an innocent, had never touched a girl in me life, but I knew the kind of thing that would be expected of me. And I knew it wouldn\u2019t be the once. After I\u2019d done it, Charlie would want me to do it again and again until I was naught but a boy whore, despised by all. I wasn\u2019t going to be that thing. We were in his distillery and he had the vitriol in a basin to use for the gin. I knew what it could do, had watched it burn through wood. I took that basin and dashed it in Charlie Grady\u2019s face and then I turned and ran as fast as I could.\u201d</p><p>Silence gave a kind of shuddering gasp and spoke. \u201cYou had no choice. What he wanted you to do was abominable.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe. But me mam never forgave me for it. She spoke but once to me after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she cried, the outrage in her voice a balm to his soul. \u201cWhy would she take his side against yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said low, \u201cCharlie Grady is me father.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Now Clever John\u2019s kingdom was safe from attack. With an invincible army the people grew used to peace and prosperity. And if Clever John found his days a little dull, he amused himself by climbing to the top of his mountain and surveying all he owned and controlled. But an army has many mouths to feed, and one day Clever John found his kingdom\u2019s coffers bare.</p><p>It was with a light step that he went to his garden and called, \u201cTamara!\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Michael\u2019s greatest enemy was his father.</p><p>Silence lay in bed late that night, sleepless and thinking of the things that Michael had told her over dinner. At the time, when he\u2019d revealed what his father had done to him\u2014had done to the mother Michael so obviously loved\u2014she\u2019d been too stunned, too sickened to ask anything more. They\u2019d finished the dinner in near quiet. Now, as she lay staring sightlessly up at the dark canopy of her bed, questions and thoughts teemed in her mind. How could a mother let anyone, even a child\u2019s father, do such horrible things to a boy? And once the child had defended himself, how could she take the part of the adult who cared so little for his soul?</p><p>She shivered in the dark. So much about Michael was explained by his terrible history. She\u2019d wondered how a man could become so cynical, so devoid of common pity, and now she had her answer. Pity had been seared out of him by his monster of a father. Charlie Grady might bear scars on the outside of his body, but they were nothing to the scars that lay within Michael\u2019s soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet now she realized there were questions she should\u2019ve asked of him\u2014what had he done all alone at the age of thirteen? What had become of his mother?</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t get any sleep tonight wondering and thinking. Silence turned her head and looked at the door that connected her room to Michael\u2019s. A faint light shone under it.</p><p>Impulsively, she got up and tiptoed to the door. She pushed it open as quietly as possible. If he were already asleep...</p><p>Michael was sitting bare-chested in a huge honey-colored wood bed. He had some papers scattered about the coverlet and a candelabra on the table next to the bed to give him light.</p> <p>He looked up as she entered.</p><p>For a moment he stared at her, frozen.</p><p>Then he set the paper he was holding down. \u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>She bunched her chemise skirts in one hand nervously. \u201cI have two questions to ask you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t invited her in, but she came forward anyway and perched in a chair near the bed. \u201cWhat happened to you after you ran away from your father?\u201d</p><p>He began to gather his papers together. \u201cI did what any young boy does who finds himself alone in London. I worked.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>He squared the edges of his papers and laid them on the table by his bed before looking back at her. \u201cI ran away from St. Giles. I knew Charlie had survived the vitriol and while he lived he was a danger to me. So I begged for a bit and stole, as well, but it\u2019s perilous for a lad by himself. There\u2019s gangs o\u2019 pickpockets and thieves who don\u2019t like others poachin\u2019 on their territory\u2014not to mention the danger o\u2019 bein\u2019 caught. After a bit I made me way to the river and hired on to a wherryman, helpin\u2019 him row and load and unload goods. That was durin\u2019 the daytime. At night the wherryman and me stole what we could from the cargo ships.\u201d</p><p>He was matter-of-fact as he relayed this dangerous life. Sitting as he was now\u2014large and fully grown, a man aware not only of his strength, but of his ability to command other men\u2014he looked like he could handle anything and anyone.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t have been like this back then. Back when he was only a boy of thirteen. She knew about young boys\u2014she\u2019d spent the last year taking care of them. They were tough and reckless and yet at the same time so very sweet and vulnerable. Their cheeks were soft and their eyes apologized even as they fought to assert their independence with too smart mouths.</p> <p>At that age Michael\u2019s broad chest would have been narrow and thin, his arms long and skinny. He would\u2019ve had the same brown eyes, but they probably would\u2019ve dominated a thinner, more youthful face. She could almost see that phantom boy, lost and alone, determined to make his way by himself, because there was no one to help him.</p><p>Her heart nearly broke.</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cWhere did you live?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOn the river. At night I\u2019d sleep wherever I could find a place to lay me head. There\u2019re houses where ye can rent a bed for a night or part o\u2019 a night, but they can be dangerous for a young boy, too. Often I slept on the boat if the weather was fair.\u201d</p><p>She watched him. He sat like a king in that great bed, his olive skin shining as if burnished in the candlelight. The coverlet was bunched carelessly at his hips and for the first time she wondered if he wore anything beneath the sheet.</p><p>Hastily she raised her eyes. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then one night me master and me were set upon by a bigger crew o\u2019 river thieves. We were beaten and the haul we\u2019d taken that night stolen from us. And I knew then, as I crawled into a corner to lick me wounds, that I couldn\u2019t survive as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He held out his hands in front of him, palms up, weighing his long ago choice. \u201cI could be a wolf or a rabbit, it was that simple. I chose to be a wolf. The next night I went to the crew who\u2019d attacked us and offered me services. They beat me again, jus\u2019 to show me that I was at the bottom o\u2019 their pack, but I began to raid with them.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze and closed both hands into fists. \u201cAnd when I was stronger, when I was no longer at the bottom and had learned to use a knife, I challenged the leader o\u2019 the gang and beat him so badly he never walked straight again. I was fifteen and the leader o\u2019 that river crew then.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his fists to the coverlet and looked at them. \u201cIn another couple o\u2019 years I was the most feared river pirate on the Thames. I moved me crew to St. Giles and met up with Charlie again. He\u2019d recovered from the burns to his face, but he wasn\u2019t nearly at his peak. I could\u2019ve killed him then, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Silence whispered.</p><p>He looked up at her, but she knew it wasn\u2019t her he was seeing. His dark eyes were haunted. \u201cShe... she begged me. I hadn\u2019t seen her for seven years and she got on her knees to beg for his worthless life.\u201d</p><p>Silence drew in her breath. What must he have felt to see his mother on her knees begging for the life of the man who had abused her\u2014had abused Michael?</p><p>\u201cI let him go, more fool I, because of her, and he went and made his home in Whitechapel, schemin\u2019, plannin\u2019, buildin\u2019 his power until he became the Vicar o\u2019 Whitechapel.\u201d Michael shook his head as if disgusted. \u201cI should\u2019ve squashed him like a bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother would never have forgiven you,\u201d Silence said and she wanted to weep for him.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cShe never forgave me anyway. I never saw her again alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He snorted bitterly. \u201cMany a time. He wouldn\u2019t let me near her and I knew \u2019twould only bring her trouble if\u2019n I saw her in secret. She loved that bastard until the end.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d loved Charlie more than her own son. Michael didn\u2019t say the words, but Silence knew he thought them.</p><p>She looked down at her hands and found that she\u2019d squeezed her chemise into hopeless wrinkles in her fists. Carefully she opened her hands and smoothed the fabric.</p><p>\u201cWhen did she die, your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up. \u201cThat recently?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s why I had to bring Mary and you to the palace. Once me mam was gone, there was nothin\u2019 to hold him back from makin\u2019 me pay. I knew he\u2019d try and draw his blood price from anyone close to me, particularly a woman. He\u2019s always liked hurtin\u2019 lasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother held Charlie Grady back from attacking you?\u201d</p><p>He looked away and nodded.</p><p>She held out her hands urgently. \u201cThen she did care for you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her, his eyes raw.</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve,\u201d Silence whispered. \u201cEven if she never saw you, she still loved you enough to keep your father from hurting you again.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and she could see that he was having trouble believing her. It would be hard, after a lifetime of seeing only one truth, to open oneself to another.</p><p>His deep voice interrupted her thoughts. \u201cYou said you had two questions.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw that he was watching her intently, his black eyes hooded. She felt her face heat. Had he known what she was thinking?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She clasped her hands together in her lap, trying to look calm. This was important. How he answered might change everything. \u201cWhy did you tell me all this?\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if the question wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d been expecting. One corner of his wide sensuous mouth curved up ever so slightly. \u201cOh, love, I think ye know the answer to that one well enough.\u201d</p><p>Did he mean what she thought he meant? That he wanted her to know about him? Wanted to let her into his life? Her breath caught on the possibility. On the hope that he wanted from her what she wanted from him.</p><p>And while she thought, he got up from the bed and answered the question she\u2019d asked only in her mind.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t wearing anything at all.</p><p>He was tall and broad and everything that was male, from the mounded muscles of his shoulders to the faint black hairs on his feet. And he was proudly erect.</p><p>\u201cNow, I have a question for ye,\u201d he drawled, low and thrillingly dangerous. \u201cWill ye be comin\u2019 to me bed tonight, Silence Hollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>Silence lifted her chin, refusing to back away as Michael prowled closer, large, naked, and dauntingly male. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head as if unsure that he\u2019d heard right. \u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. He was an arms-length away from her now and she could feel his heat. Could feel the responding excitement within herself. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>With one stride he was next to her, overwhelming in his nudity. \u201cBe sure, Silence, mine. Once I take ye to me bed, I won\u2019t be stoppin\u2019 if ye have any sudden maidenly qualms. Right now I\u2019ll let ye walk through that door and away. In a minute more, I\u2019ll not.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and did what she\u2019d been wanting to do for weeks\u2014she laid her palm against his naked chest. His skin was smooth and so hot she felt as if he\u2019d branded her hand. She\u2019d carry the mark of his flesh forever. \u201cI may have qualms, but they aren\u2019t maidenly, I assure you. I want this.\u201d</p><p>The sound that came from his lips was very close to a growl as he moved swiftly and decisively. Silence found herself suddenly lifted in strong arms as Michael bore her to his big bed.</p><p>He laid her down on the soft mattress and placed a knee on the bed. Then he stilled, the muscles on his shoulders bunched and ready. He seemed to restrain himself with effort. \u201cAm I frightenin\u2019 ye?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly, her heart contracting at the fierce worry in his eyes. \u201cOnly in the best of ways.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and she saw that his big body was trembling. He gripped the coverlet in both fists. \u201cYe must tell me if anythin\u2019 I do frightens ye. I don\u2019t want to hurt ye. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed her fingertips against his lips and he froze. His black eyes snapped open and he watched her, wild and dangerous.</p><p>But not to her.</p><p>Never to her. She didn\u2019t know how she knew this, but somehow, deep in her bones, she knew now that Michael O\u2019Connor would never hurt her physically. He might hurt her emotionally, but even that wouldn\u2019t be on purpose. One couldn\u2019t blame the animal for the instincts he was born with.</p><p>The thought was a little sad, so she banished it and focused on the man beneath her fingers instead.</p><p>His lips were soft. She rubbed them lightly and they parted to lick at her fingertips. She smiled and let her hands drift over his jaw, rough with a day\u2019s growth of beard. He was very still, watching her with waiting eyes. She stroked down his neck, feeling the cords of his tendons, and over to her favorite part: his smooth chest. She flattened her hand there and pressed. The muscles of his chest were hard and strong and gave very little. Curious, she scooted closer on her back, putting herself almost under him, so that she could touch him with both hands. Why he stayed so motionless and simply let her explore, she did not know, but she was grateful. She\u2019d always been indecently interested in what lay beneath a man\u2019s clothes. William had been a very modest man, so her curiosity had not been assuaged.</p><p>Here, now, though, Michael seemed willing to let her explore as much as she wanted. And she was determined at last to discover all she could about this man\u2014in both body and mind.</p><p>She smoothed her hands up to his shoulders, shaping the sloping muscles that led to his neck. Women didn\u2019t have such muscles and she found it fascinating. She trailed her hands down his upper arms\u2014and then laughed in delight when he flexed them beneath her palms, the bulges of his muscles moving under her hands.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change, but somehow his eyes laughed, too, a great predator, indulgent.</p><p>She peeked up at him from underneath her eyelashes as her hands touched his wrists. How far would he let her explore? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trailed her fingers over his ribcage. A swirl of black hair circled his navel and she traced it, amazed that men should have such hair where women did not. She glanced up and saw his eyes were nearly feral now, watching her with half-lowered lids. His look made her breath quicken.</p><p>Hastily she lowered her gaze again. Below his navel the hair narrowed to a line that led to the inky curls around his penis. She followed the line with her fingertips, her mouth going dry at her daring. The fine curls wrapped themselves around her fingers as if drawing her in. He rose strong and hard in the space between her hands, but she didn\u2019t touch him yet. Instead she fingered the lean lines of his hips, returning again and again to the center of his manhood, drawing out the anticipation. His breathing had roughened as she played and she thought she heard a low growl.</p><p>Only then did she bring her hands together and cradle the prize she found there. She smiled as she held Michael O\u2019Connor\u2019s cock. Oh, it had been so very long and holding a man\u2019s cock was a wonderful thing. He was soft like a fine kid glove, but if she gave a little squeeze, the flesh beneath was hard as a rock. Her fingers didn\u2019t quite wrap around him as she circled him and something feminine inside her quaked. This part of him would be inside her body soon, large and foreign and male.</p><p>She inhaled and delicately traced the head of his penis. His foreskin was pulled back, the glistening, swollen head entirely free. At the very tip was a drop of clear liquid and she caught it on her fingertip, bringing it to her mouth to see what a man tasted like.</p><p>At her gesture Michael cursed and caught her hand, falling suddenly atop her.</p><p>She stared up at him wondering what bedchamber faux pas she\u2019d committed.</p><p>He groaned at her look. \u201cI\u2019ll let ye pet and play all ye want\u2014after. Now I need\u201d\u2014he pushed her chemise to her waist, parted her thighs, and settled between them\u2014\u201cto be inside ye.\u201d</p><p>There was a flag of red in his cheeks and his mouth had turned dangerous. She could feel his hard cock prodding insistently against her thigh.</p><p>He reached between them and touched her, probing and parting her folds. Her eyes widened, watching him as he watched her and touched her where no one else had put a hand save she herself. Her face was hot, she wanted to look away, and she knew she was already embarrassingly, naively moist. Was this what sophisticates did in the bedchamber? She had certainly never done this in her marriage. Did his other women take this type of touch in stride, perhaps with a knowing smile?</p><p>The thought of his other women made her mouth tremble and he misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cHave I hurt ye?\u201d he asked, his voice like gravel.</p><p>He took his hand away and turned with her so that all at once she found herself laying on top of him, her face only inches from his.</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cYe must tell me if I\u2019m too rough, if I hurt ye. Damn it! I had no intention o\u2019 causin\u2019 ye pain, m\u2019love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d She pressed her palm to his mouth to stop the fast, angry voice. \u201cYou did not hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did ye frown?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She lowered her gaze. How could she be having this conversation? She with her chemise rucked up, her wet sex against his hairy thigh and his erection still pressed to her belly? This was a mad dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to this sort of lovemaking,\u201d she said in a rush before she could think better of the words.</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. Then she felt his hand on her chin as he tilted up her head to meet her eyes. His mouth was still hard and dangerous, his face drawn into even more severe lines if that were possible, but his words were quiet if not soft. \u201cForgive me for a thoughtless lout. Truth be told, I\u2019m not exactly used to this kind o\u2019 bedsport, either.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together. He\u2019d had many lovers. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He placed his own far bigger palm over her mouth. \u201cLet me...\u201d</p><p>He gripped her bottom with one hand and drew her legs up on either side of his hips, spreading them wide. In this position his cock was pressed intimately against her folds.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her exclamation was muffled behind his hand, but since her mouth was open anyway, she stuck the tip of her tongue out and tasted him.</p><p>He hissed. \u201cBrat.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but she thought that might be a compliment.</p><p>He took his hand away and caught her hips in both hands, arching beneath her. The movement drove his cock over her, rubbing the peak of her sex.</p><p>The sensation was exquisite and before she could control herself she\u2019d made a needy, moaning sound.</p><p>He grinned, though his face was strained. \u201cThat\u2019s it, love. Use me to make yerself feel good.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. Surely he didn\u2019t mean\u2014?</p><p>But he moved again and she lost all thought. He was driving her wild, driving her into some kind of madness. He helped her to sit up and brace her hands on his chest and she found herself moving against him in a sensual haze. His big penis was against her folds, slick with her wetness, and he moved deliberately, knowingly, making her excitement spiral higher. Surely this wasn\u2019t right. It must be some sort of sin for it to feel this good, but at the moment she simply didn\u2019t care. She bit her lip and ground against him as he held her bottom in his hot hands, and\u2014</p><p>And suddenly she was there, racing past the point, flying with dizzying speed. She gasped, her head falling forward, her body convulsing once, twice, three times in quick succession with impossible pleasure.</p><p>She opened her eyes, dazed, and saw him watching her with the most satisfied male look she\u2019d ever seen. But his mouth was drawn as well and she realized that his swollen cock was still ragingly hard between her folds.</p><p>Sweat was beaded on his upper lip. \u201cMy turn.\u201d He lifted her and grunted. \u201cPut me there.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she reached between them. He was hot and wet with her moisture and he was also so very large. She took one look at his face and knew she must at least try though. She moved him, brushing the head of his penis through her sex.</p><p>They both gasped.</p><p>She found the right spot and guided him before letting go.</p><p>He groaned, loud and male, his eyes turned to feral slits.</p><p>She swallowed and tilted her hips, feeling the head of his cock breech her. There was no pain, but she felt a stretching at her opening.</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cJaysus,\u201d he breathed. His head was arched back, his neck taut with strain.</p><p>She bore down, swiveling her hips a little.</p><p>He closed his eyes, his mouth open, his nostrils flared.</p><p>She pulled back just a fraction and he flinched and flexed his hands on her bottom. She hastily came back down again, watching him as another inch of his length entered her. He looked almost like he was in pain and she felt a sudden power\u2014only she could ease this ache he felt.</p><p>She leaned down and brushed her lips gently over his jaw, pushing back with her bottom, taking more of him within her body.</p><p>He whispered something under his breath and she sat back, bearing down, gasping, taking the entire length of his cock. She felt stuffed full, her tissues stretched wide over the base of him. He was still, panting, groaning every now and then, his hands twitching convulsively on her buttocks.</p><p>Carefully, slowly, she rose on her knees, his cock pulling as it slid from her warmth.</p><p>She lowered herself, inching him back inside and he swallowed, his strong throat working. He was such a beautiful man\u2014and he was all hers.</p><p>Perhaps she was doing it wrong. Perhaps he really was in pain. She leaned down and brushed a soft, nearly chaste kiss over his lips.</p><p>It was as if she\u2019d put spur to him. His tongue was in her mouth, his hips arching off the bed and his hands holding her down as he drove his length into her again and again. His passion was intense, nearly overwhelming and she hung on, determined to ride him out. Determined to bring him as much pleasure as he\u2019d brought her.</p><p>Suddenly he pulled from her kiss, his teeth gritted, his head arched back, and he shouted. At the same time she felt the scald of his semen rushing into her.</p><p>Silence watched in wonder. She\u2019d never before seen this moment. It was as if he was possessed by a demon or perhaps an angel\u2014some otherworldly being come to give both unbearable pain and exquisite pleasure. Maybe one and the same.</p><p>Gently she brushed kisses over his damp face, luxuriating in the intimacy of the moment as he recovered.</p><p>Finally his hand rose and he stroked her back with fingers as light as a butterfly. His touch seemed so tender, so loving almost, that it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>Michael looked at her.</p><p>She blinked. She was still astride him, his penis inside her, though she could feel it retreating. What did sophisticates do now?</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he growled, and pulled her down on top of him.</p><p>\u201cI-I should go to my own bed,\u201d she protested feebly. \u201cI\u2019m too heavy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was all he said in reply. He wrapped one arm across her bottom and flung the other over his head.</p><p>She laid her head on his chest. It was amazingly comfortable to lie on a man. He was warm and she could hear his heartbeat, strong and steady.</p><p>For a while she listened as his breathing grew deeper and his heartbeat slower. She\u2019d always enjoyed sharing a bed with William, but what they\u2019d done there had never produced the kind of excitement that Michael had given her. Making love with him was wonderful and wild and very, very pleasurable. Everything and more than she\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>Which was why it seemed so strange when she began to cry a half hour later.</p><p>Her brown eyes swam with tears, overflowing, splashing down, scalding his hands, his face, drowning him in salty sorrow. Mam wept as Charlie stood over her, berating her, beating her with words and fists, and Mick was too small and weak to stop him.</p><p>But then Charlie faded and she lifted her head. Mick saw that it was Silence who wept and he could do nothing to comfort her, to console her terrible, unrelenting grief. For he had been the bringer of evil and death, the wellspring of her salt tears. He\u2019d grasped with greedy hands and in so doing had crushed the very thing he\u2019d sought to hold.</p><p>But hold her, he would. She was his, weeping or not, grief-stricken or not. And if he could not comfort her perhaps her hot tears would scald away the poison in his suppurating soul...</p><p>Mick woke from the nightmare, his body slick with sweat, and for a moment thought he still dreamed.</p><p>He could hear Silence weeping.</p><p>Weeping after he\u2019d made love to her.</p><p>If he\u2019d had a heart it would\u2019ve contracted in pain then. But since he had no such organ, he reached for her. She was in his bed, finally, and he could not regret it. If he was incapable of love or comfort, so be it. But he could at least hold his woman and feel her tears on his face.</p><p>Share in her pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, me darlin\u2019?\u201d he asked, his voice rasping with sleep\u2014or perhaps some new emotion.</p><p>She stiffened as he touched her, hunching her shoulder, but he gave no clemency. He was a pirate, after all, and what he took he held and she was his now\u2014whether she knew it yet or not.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cSweet Silence, tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her body relaxed all at once, as if she conceded defeat. \u201cI lied. All this time, I lied.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea what she meant, but he made soothing noises at the back of his throat and kissed her neck. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean?\u201d</p><p>When she shook her head again and didn\u2019t answer, he gently turned her face so he could see her.</p><p>The sight sent a bolt of iron through his middle. It was just like in his dreams, her hazel eyes bright with crystal tears, her cheeks wet and reddened. \u201cDearest one.\u201d</p><p>She hiccupped and said, \u201cI said William and I had true love. That our marriage was perfect, but oh, Michael, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and laid his cheek against hers. Of course her marriage hadn\u2019t been perfect. Her husband, from the sound of it, had been a stuffy sod. But he was also a dead stuffy sod. He knew well enough that mourning had nothing to do with how kind or unkind the person had been while alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just... just wanted to have a perfect marriage, I think,\u201d she whispered, and he could feel the tremble in her voice as she said it. \u201cHe was away so much and I was always waiting for him... it was like we never truly settled into everyday married life. And when something difficult came up...\u201d She sighed forlornly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do. How to talk to one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured into her hair.</p><p>\u201cAnd doing this...,\u201d her voice squeaked, \u201cthis between you and me... I guess it just made me realize that William and I were truly over. Our marriage, our life. I can\u2019t even lie to myself that it was perfect anymore.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her back, waiting.</p> <p>She lifted her head, her beautiful eyes still shining. \u201cYou must think me so foolish.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her tenderly, for she made something in his chest squeeze. \u201cNay, love. I jus\u2019 think ye\u2019ve a soft heart, and I cannot be displeased with that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though her lips trembled.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through her fine brown hair. So lovely it was. \u201cAnd I\u2019m that sorry the memories give ye pain, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not sorry for what we did here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m that glad to hear it,\u201d he murmured, running his mouth over the corner of her lips.</p><p>She gasped and then opened her mouth shyly, and he never hesitated. He kissed her deep, thrusting his tongue into her warmth, tasting the dregs of her sorrow.</p><p>He didn\u2019t particularly like the memories of another man in her thoughts, but he figured he knew of a way to drive them from her mind. Turning her, Mick pulled her close until her plump arse rested against his loins. His rod was already stiff and hard. He wrapped his upper arm over her shoulders and scooped one luscious breast into the palm of his hand.</p><p>He\u2019d not had time to properly appreciate her lovely titties earlier\u2014his lust had been near out of control once she\u2019d shown her willingness. In the daylight he\u2019d strip her naked and examine his new prize, but here in the dark he merely held her. He weighed her softness\u2014her plump breast fit his palm perfectly. Her breath caught and her nipple was pointed and eager. He thumbed it, flicking it gently through the lawn of her chemise, feeling her body quiver against his.</p><p>He played leisurely, lazily with her nipples for a few minutes and then his hand stole lower. Her chemise was tangled high about her thighs, which served his purpose well. He laid his palm over her cleft. This was his now, a private garden of delight open only to him. Her breath hitched again as he delved his fingers into her honeyed slit. She wept here, as well, and the discovery was gratifying. This at least he could do for her. He found that tender bud at the apex of her cunny and delicately slipped a fingertip around it, not quite touching the little peak, teasing instead. Around and around his finger slid, until she sighed restlessly and moaned his name\u2014Michael\u2014the only one who called him so.</p><p>But he allowed it, for she was a fair prize, this soft-hearted woman. And if she were his woman, well then, he supposed in a way he must be her man.</p> <p>\u201cHush, darlin\u2019.\u201d He tongued the back of her neck tasting salt and womanly allure.</p><p>She bumped her hips demandingly into his and he chuckled low. At last he touched her where she wanted his fingertips. He pressed firmly, rubbing and circling until a high wail came from her throat. The sound was a balm to his blasted soul.</p><p>She would\u2019ve jerked away then, but he was having none of it. He anchored her hip and tethered her in the most basic way possible. He lifted her upper leg, draping it over his own hips, and thrust into her warm, welcoming wetness.</p><p>Then he went back to playing. He bit at her shoulder as he stroked her pretty cunny, his own body still. He had what he wanted: her pinned to him, unable to escape. He slid his fingers through her sweet folds until he touched the base of his own flesh where it met hers. His cock was buried within her body as his hand played upon her delicate flesh. She moaned low and he licked where he\u2019d bitten her shoulder, then moved to catch her earlobe. She tried to rub against him, but he was stronger and he easily held her still.</p><p>Fingering. Softly tapping.</p><p>She was swollen now, his hand drenched with her readiness. He could feel her flexing about his rod and the sensation was an exquisite torture. He treasured her, treasured her tears, treasured her love for others. Her heart might even be big enough to fill that empty space in his own chest. Perhaps she could be his heart as well.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she whispered, a siren unaware of her song.</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichael, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn yer head to me, love.\u201d</p><p>She did and he devoured her mouth, licking salt tears from her lips, thrusting his tongue deep within, a pirate demanding tithe.</p><p>She arched and he could no longer hold himself back. He flexed his hips and drove deep within her, holding her cunny in the palm of his hand. He speared within her clenching valley, plundering all that was sweet in her. She opened her mouth wide in a silent scream and his release caught him, hard and fast as he kissed her openmouthed. He tore his mouth from hers and shouted his triumph. She was his, now and forevermore, until the end of time, until the seas ran dry and man no longer roamed the earth, amen.</p><p>His and only his.</p><p>She slumped against him, the scent of their passion musky in the night air.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he murmured to her, and held her against himself, his cock still buried deep.</p><p>She was caught and he had no intention of ever letting her go.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The rainbow bird swooped low from the sky and flew in happy cartwheels around Clever John\u2019s head before alighting and turning into Tamara.</p><p>She threw back her rainbow head and laughed merrily. \u201cClever John, you have gray in your hair and your strong back has begun to bend! Has it been so many years, my friend?\u201d</p><p>But Clever John was looking toward his castle with worry. \u201cI wish for a chest of gold and jewels that is always full.\u201d</p><p>Tamara smiled a little sadly and raised her arms to the sky. \u201cAs you wish!\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Silence woke to the feel of a man\u2019s body around her. It was such a nice luxury that she sighed in pleasure. His broad shoulders cradled hers, warming her all the way through. The soles of her feet were against his calves and she flexed her toes, feeling the rough hair on his legs.</p><p>Only then, with that small movement, did she realize that he still lay within her. Silence froze, her eyes wide in shock. She\u2019d slept linked with Michael. Even now she could feel the twitch of his penis within her depths. The sensation was utterly decadent.</p><p>Utterly wonderful.</p><p>In one night she\u2019d shared more with Michael than she\u2019d ever had with William. It was more than the fact that Michael was a slow, thorough lover. He\u2019d listened to her weep without male embarrassment. Had stroked her and comforted her. The thought gave her hope. If he was able to listen to her tears and disappointment, then surely if they argued, if they disagreed, he\u2019d talk about it with her\u2014not turn aside as William had. And if Michael was able to talk to her...</p><p>Well. Then they might have a future together.</p><p>Always assuming, of course, that he wanted a future with her. Silence frowned at the thought. He\u2019d not mentioned marriage, or indeed even making her his mistress. Did he have any plans for her? Or was he\u2014</p><p>Michael\u2019s breathing had been sonorous, but she realized suddenly that it had lightened. She stilled, suddenly cautious. What must he think of her tears last night? Surely he wasn\u2019t used to such things? Her overabundance of emotion was gauche, she knew, but it was something she could do little to change. She\u2019d lived so long with the fantasy of a perfect love with William, that putting it aside was a hard thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asked, his voice blurred with sleep.</p><p>\u201cFor weeping,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know it must have irritated you, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t irritated,\u201d he said, his breath whispering against the back of her neck. \u201cNever apologize for what we two do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must not want a weepy woman in your bed.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and stirred, withdrawing from her. She only had a moment to be disappointed and then he flipped her to her back and rose over her, powerful and male. He casually parted her legs with his knees and thrust into her again, hot and hard.</p><p>She gasped at the swift invasion, the lovely feeling, and then his face was next to hers, his big palms cradling her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want,\u201d he drawled, \u201cis ye. Nothin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>She opened her lips to ask what exactly he meant by that, but his mouth covered hers, and all thought fled her mind.</p><p>He kissed her leisurely then rose, bracing his upper half on his arms and thrust into her. This position was an old one, a familiar one, though not with him. Somehow with Michael she felt much more vulnerable. More intimate. He watched her face as he inserted and withdrew himself, completely in control, arrogant in his dominant manhood.</p><p>\u201cYer mine now,\u201d he whispered, his eyelids at half-mast. \u201cD\u2019ye understand, Silence, m\u2019love?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t, not entirely. She wanted to ask him to tell her more, to explain exactly what he meant by \u201cmine\u201d and if he envisioned it lasting for a week or the rest of their lives. She wanted details and explanations, but he was moving on her\u2014moving in her\u2014in the most wondrous way and she simply couldn\u2019t form the words.</p><p>So instead she stretched her arms above her head, reveling in the heavy thrust of his hips. Her breasts jiggled with the movement and his gaze lowered to stare at her bosom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to see these forever,\u201d he murmured, and hooking his fingers into the neckline of her chemise, tore the garment from her.</p><p>She gasped, his casual violence somehow terribly erotic.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He lowered his head and tongued her quivering nipple, his hips still moving rhythmically.</p><p>She felt a restless rising, a desperate yearning for something that might not be entirely physical. This lovemaking was wonderful, but it was not love. Was it enough? If he couldn\u2019t ever find it in himself to love her, would she be content?</p><p>She pushed aside the thought and dug her fingers into his hair, sliding so silkily over his shoulders. Her touch seemed to spur him on. Suddenly he was pounding into her, his thrusts fast and sure. She wanted to raise his head, to look him in the eye and see if there might be something driving him on beside lust.</p><p>But her own ecstasy caught her and threw her high. She closed her eyes, gasping, feeling as if she were the recipient of some kind of pagan offering. She spread her legs wide, her toes pointed, and accepted everything he had to give her.</p><p>He groaned against her breast, his big body suddenly stiffening as the spasm took him. She dropped her hands to his shoulders and felt the ripple as his muscles tightened.</p><p>When she opened her eyes the very air seemed golden, crisp with promise.</p><p>For a moment he lay heavy upon her.</p><p>Then he rolled aside and propped himself on his elbow. Michael\u2019s beard blued his jaw and his eyes were still lazy from their lovemaking as he watched her with tenderness. Was that love in his eyes? Or something close enough? But she felt too shy to ask him. She felt shy looking at him. He was so wantonly seductive it made her self-conscious. Surely her hair was mussed from sleeping, her face puffy from crying the night before. She drew the coverlet over her breasts.</p><p>A corner of his mouth curled at her action, making him even more sensuously handsome. \u201cBittner usually readies a bath for me in the mornin\u2019\u2014he knows me routine. Would ye like me to have one brought to yer rooms for ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, please,\u201d she said shyly. A bath was a rare luxury, especially this early in the morning.</p><p>His half smile turned to a grin at her enthusiastic reply. He leaned down and kissed her\u2014hard and thoroughly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A knock came at the outer door.</p><p>Silence squeaked, embarrassed. \u201cThe servants\u2014\u201d</p><p>Michael shook his head, rising from the bed. \u201cThe servants know better than to disturb me\u2014unless it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the door and cracked it without bothering to dress.</p> <p>Silence couldn\u2019t see who was outside the door, but she could hear his voice.</p><p>\u201cA word, Mick,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>And somehow Silence knew their imperfect idyll was shattered.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E BOLTED LAST night near midnight,\u201d Harry said as he matched his stride to Mick\u2019s. The two men were headed in the direction of the small stable behind the house. \u201cWe followed \u2019im like ye instructed, but we \u2019ad no notion o\u2019 where \u2019e was bound until we fetched up \u2019ere this mornin\u2019. Didn\u2019t think ye\u2019d want \u2019im showin\u2019 up all unannounced, so I put a \u2019and on \u2019im and came for ye.\u201d</p><p>Mick could feel his muscles tensing, his stride lengthening as he neared the one who had betrayed him. \u201cYe did well.\u201d</p> <p>They went out through the kitchens, ignoring the startled squeak of a single scullery maid bent over a mountain of dishes. Outside the day was gray as if the skies reflected this grim business. The stable was across a cobblestone yard and their boots rang on the stones. Inside the stable one of the carriage horses whickered in greeting. Bran was standing in an empty stall with Bert watching him narrow-eyed.</p><p>Mick looked at his former lieutenant. Bran no longer could be mistaken for a boy. Several days\u2019 growth of beard shadowed his jaw. His face had new lines about his mouth and his eyes looked sunken. Bran glanced at him and then away again as if too ashamed to meet Mick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait for me outside,\u201d Mick said to Bert and Harry without taking his eyes from Bran\u2019s face.</p><p>The two men left.</p><p>Mick took one giant stride forward and hit Bran in the jaw, putting all the force of his shoulder\u2014and his pain\u2014into the blow.</p><p>Bran staggered, struck the back of the stall and abruptly sat.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mick rasped.</p><p>Bran had his hand to his face. A blow like that could break a man\u2019s jaw, make it impossible to properly eat or talk ever again.</p><p>Mick didn\u2019t care. \u201cI brought ye up from the streets, boy. Took ye into me own home, fed ye me food, put clothes on yer back. And this is how ye repay me? By betrayin\u2019 me to me enemy? By lettin\u2019 his men into me house to kill an innocent lass?\u201d</p><p>Bran licked at the blood seeping from a split on his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he\u2019d kill Fionnula.\u201d His voice cracked on her name.</p><p>Mick shook his head. \u201cWhat did ye think he\u2019d do?\u201d</p><p>Bran shrugged, glancing about the stall vaguely. \u201cTake you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe wanted me crew.\u201d</p><p>Bran looked at him finally and Mick was surprised to see defiance still in his eyes. \u201cYou told me, over and over again, about how you\u2019d made your way. About how you\u2019d taken down the leader of that pirate crew when you were merely a boy. What did you expect from me but that I would do the same?\u201d</p> <p>Mick squatted on his haunches, feeling weary to his soul. \u201cI expected loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoyalty?\u201d Bran shook his head and then winced at the movement. \u201cYou told me never to trust anyone. That any man who does so is a fool. You taught me that no one would champion me but me. That I must look out for myself and only myself. I could recite your lessons in my sleep. Not once did you mention loyalty, but now you expect it from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye!\u201d Mick remembered those offhand remarks, the lessons given casually as they\u2019d raided ships and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their men and of their enemies. But he\u2019d considered Bran one of his own\u2014his lieutenant, damn it. His friend. How could Bran have taken his words and turned them against him? \u201cI expected loyalty from ye and every man under me command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder your command, exactly,\u201d Bran said. \u201cI had no way of bettering myself. I wanted to be like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe were like me,\u201d Mick roared. \u201cI took ye into me confidence, made ye a man. What the fuck were ye thinkin\u2019, Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of freedom!\u201d Bran shouted. \u201cYou kept us under your thumb, made us live in your house, eat at your table. You dealt out the spoils as you saw fit and consulted no one else. You never listened to my suggestions or plans. I was nothing but a lackey to you when what I wanted to be was your equal.\u201d</p><p>Mick stared. He\u2019d spent years never knowing where his next meal would come from. He\u2019d made the palace into a fortress, not only to guard his wealth, but to guard his men. And now Bran threw back his generosity in his face?</p><p>Mick turned his head away in disgust and stood. \u201cTry and put the blame for yer betrayal on me, but it won\u2019t work. Fionnula is dead because o\u2019 ye and ye alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Bran squeezed shut his eyes, moaning so low Mick had to lean close to hear the words. \u201cOh, God, don\u2019t you think I know that? Her pretty face was burned off. I keep seeing her in my dreams. I can\u2019t sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>Mick grunted. \u201cHow did ye find me house?\u201d</p><p>Bran shook his head. \u201cI snuck a look in Pepper\u2019s book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have ye told the Vicar where I am?\u201d Mick asked, low and deadly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy come here?\u201d</p><p>Bran opened his eyes, the tears stark upon his face. \u201cI thought to warn you about the Vicar. He wants Mrs. Hollingbrook. He talks of nothing else now.\u201d</p><p>Mick laughed though he felt no mirth. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ye think I know that well enough? Why did ye really come, Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mick,\u201d Bran whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what he was like. If you\u2019d told me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mick sighed. \u201cIf I\u2019d told ye he was mad ye wouldn\u2019t have betrayed me to me own father?\u201d</p><p>Bran stared, the color leeching from his face. \u201cYour father? The Vicar is your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Mick inclined his head, his mouth twisting bitterly. \u201cCome full circle, hasn\u2019t it? Betrayed by me father, and betrayed to me father. The old man\u2019s probably right pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMick\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mick threw out a hand, stopping the other man\u2019s words. \u201cGet out o\u2019 me sight afore I kill ye.\u201d</p><p>Bran rose wearily. \u201cWill you forgive me, Mick?\u201d</p><p>His words cut a cord within Mick, letting loose the grief within. Mick drew his dagger and before Bran could move he had the knife at his throat.</p><p>Bran froze as a drop of blood welled under the dagger.</p><p>Mick looked into the face of the boy he\u2019d held dear as a friend. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive ye, Bran, no. Ye banished that hope the moment ye put Silence and Mary Darlin\u2019 in danger. They might\u2019ve died because o\u2019 yer stupidity. For that, for puttin\u2019 them at risk, I should slit yer throat here and now and throw yer rotten corpse in the river.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he stood, the knife against Bran\u2019s neck, staring into the other man\u2019s light blue eyes. They\u2019d once laughed together, drunk brandy, and planned raids. Bran had been as close to him as a brother... or a son.</p><p>It could\u2019ve been Silence with that ruined face.</p><p>Abruptly Mick swung away, putting the length of the stall between him and Bran as he strode to the stall door.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d he roared.</p><p>The guard appeared a second later. He glanced in the stall and blinked, looking confused to see Bran still alive.</p><p>Well, and hadn\u2019t Mick killed for far less than Bran had done to him? \u201cTake him.\u201d Mick jerked his head back at Bran.</p><p>\u201cTake \u2019im?\u201d Harry asked cautiously.</p><p>Mick winced. He wouldn\u2019t put the burden of Bran\u2019s death on Harry, either. No, Bran was his own responsibility and he\u2019d see him out of England himself. He sighed and stretched his neck. \u201cTake him to the cellar and lock him in well. I\u2019ll be bringin\u2019 him back to London and a ship bound for a distant shore tonight.\u201d</p><p>The relief was plain to see on Harry\u2019s face, but it was fleeting. When the big man turned to Bran his expression was as cold as Mick had ever seen it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then.\u201d Harry took a firm hold of Bran\u2019s arm and marched him from the barn.</p><p>Bran cast one helpless look over his shoulder, but Mick ignored it. He\u2019d made up his mind.</p><p>Mick waited, listening to the retreating footsteps, then stayed many minutes longer, trying to get his anger under control. He didn\u2019t want her to see him this way. She wouldn\u2019t understand. She came from a foreign land where people could forgive one another, where it wasn\u2019t weakness to let live the boy you\u2019d taught to be a man.</p><p>Mick threw back his head and stared blindly at the dusty rafters of the stable. He couldn\u2019t change who he was. He\u2019d been bred from the loins of a demon in human form and there was only so much humanity in him.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was soft and sweet in the stable\u2019s still air. For a moment he wanted to hide. To not let the disease of his soul touch her. He felt filthy with sin.</p><p>But she was ever relentless was his Silence. She poked her head around the stall door. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>He straightened from the wall. \u201cAye, here I am.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated by the doorway as if aware of the blackness in his soul. Perhaps the truly good had a sort of inner compass that swiveled around when in the presence of evil.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Harry come to say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNothing ye need worry about.\u201d</p><p>He started for the stall door, but she didn\u2019t move aside. Instead she hugged her arms across her chest and looked at him with those damned beautiful eyes. \u201cWhat if I want to worry about it? What if I want to share your troubles?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her nonplussed and couldn\u2019t help thinking that he\u2019d never had this sort of problem with any of the whores he\u2019d taken to bed. He wanted to brush past her and leave her and her damned questions, but he had a feeling in his gut that to do so would somehow be an act not easily mended.</p><p>Mick sighed. \u201cHarry brought Bran to see me.\u201d</p><p>She stood immoveable and simply raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cDamn ye,\u201d he hissed, taking her by her slim shoulders. \u201cWhy can\u2019t ye leave it alone? \u2019Tis a man\u2019s business and none o\u2019 yer own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is,\u201d she replied, bravely tilting her face to look him in the eye, stubborn thing. \u201cI\u2019ve given you my body and more. I think in return you can give me some small confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt that what this is? A test?\u201d He felt the anger rise in him again, seeking a victim even if she might be innocent of any outrage against him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI need to know that I\u2019m more to you than a woman in your bed, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe know full well yer more than that,\u201d he growled in outrage. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d she whispered, powerful in her softness. \u201cHonesty. Friendship. And perhaps love.\u201d</p><p>The words sent icy fear through his belly. He could storm a ship, could knife a man, could lead a gang of near-feral pirates, but the things she asked of him were impossible for him to do. He was the son of Charlie Grady, a man who\u2019d never felt compassion, let alone love in his entire life. What softness Mick had had in him had been burned away sixteen years ago as surely as Charlie Grady\u2019s face had melted. He\u2019d had to armor himself in layers of granite to survive, to fight to where he was now in the world. And she? She wanted him to simply strip his armor away\u2014let it fall and stand naked and vulnerable in the sunlight.</p><p>Her gaze was clear and direct and too terrible for words as she waited for something from him\u2014something he wasn\u2019t sure he had in him.</p><p>\u201cDamn ye,\u201d he hissed again, and brought his mouth down on hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been bedding women since the age of fourteen. He knew well their sweet parts, their soft sighs. This he could do. She would have to learn to be content with it. He knew no other way to keep her.</p><p>MICHAEL\u2019S KISS WAS overpowering. Silence struggled to remember that he\u2019d not answered her questions. But her body had become attuned to his mastery overnight it seemed. She found herself curving toward him, opening her mouth, running her hands through his lovely hair. Already she was quickening, anticipating whatever he might want to do to her.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t told her what Bran had come for. He\u2019d refused to share that information and more importantly some small part of his everyday life. If she was to be more to him than merely a body in his bed, he must learn to open himself, he must\u2014</p><p>Michael began gathering her skirts in great handfuls and her thoughts scattered.</p> <p>She tore her mouth away. \u201cOh!

She leaned there and watched, dazed, as he dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d</p><p>He ignored her urgent hiss. \u201cHold yer skirts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear Lord.\u201d She obediently took the material in her hands even as she craned her neck to watch for intruders. What if Harry came back? Or Bran? Did Michael keep a groom?</p><p>He laid both hands on her now, stroking up over her calves, smoothing over her knees, and delicately tracing her thighs.</p><p>She shivered. What did he intend to do? She could feel heat gathering at the apex of her thighs and if he reached up there\u2014</p><p>She squeaked as he bent to kiss the inside of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cRaise yer skirts higher, love,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She groaned under her breath. If she pulled up her skirts any farther, her most intimate parts would be exposed. It was one thing to frolic nude in the dark, quite another to do so in the light of day.</p> <p>But his voice was like liquid sin, dark and dangerously seductive. She did his bidding, her fingers trembling with want, and felt the cool air caress the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cHold it there, love, and spread yer thighs jus\u2019 a wee bit wider.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and did as he bid.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me girl.\u201d He whispered against her skin, his hot breath making her shiver.</p><p>His mouth trailed up beside her mound, licking and kissing, but very leisurely, as if he had all the time in the world. She tilted back her head, impatient, nervous, on edge from suspense. He drew closer to her center and tongued the crease next to her thigh.</p><p>Silence bit her lip, trying to make no noise\u2014surely they would be discovered if she did.</p><p>She felt him run his thumbs through her maidenhair and down to the plump outer lips of her sex. He thumbed them apart, exposing her wet inner folds.</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d she whispered, as loud as she dared.</p> <p>But he ignored her. He blew on her wet curls and she shivered\u2014more from the sensation than the chill. Then he leaned forward and touched his hot tongue to her center.</p><p>She jumped at the contact, nearly hitting her head against the boards of the stall. Oh, dear Lord! \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled low and restrained her quivering body with his hands, then he drew his tongue through her folds, slow and thorough, the most intimate contact she\u2019d ever experienced. His tongue was wet and hot and felt indescribable.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to care that they were in an open stable, that she was jerking in reaction from each touch, that what he did to her must be some kind of wicked indecency. Michael O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t care at all. He just kept licking and tonguing her until she thought she might go mad with the intensity of the feelings he was provoking in her. Each swipe of his tongue burned exquisitely on her nerve endings. Each deep kiss drove her ever nearer to an edge. She was shaking, panting, damp with her own need, and he simply would not stop.</p><p>She found herself spreading her knees wider, tilting her hips to give him better access. She might very well expire from this torture, but she would die in bliss. Her head was back against the old stable wall, and she watched the rafters overhead blindly, thinking that she\u2019d never be able to enter a stable again without blushing.</p><p>And then he took her little knot of flesh between his lips and suckled it as deeply as he had her nipples this morning. Dear God, she could not hold back. She tumbled over the precipice, sweetly unaware, joyously free. Her back arched, her legs tightened, and she had to stuff a hand in her mouth to keep from screaming.</p><p>She was still trembling when he stood and took her into his arms. She rested there grateful and limp, for she wasn\u2019t sure she could stand on her own feet after her ravishment. But when she made to let her skirts fall he placed his palm possessively on her mound.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like that, darlin\u2019?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cYou know I did.\u201d Her tongue felt thick and her words were slow. \u201cBut you did it to distract me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and looked her in the face, his own wary. \u201cYe never give up, do ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me, Michael?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking away and curled his fingers into her cleft, sensitive now from her peak, and gently stroked.</p><p>She moaned, clutching at his coat.</p><p>His breathing had quickened as he felt her dampness. \u201cYer so wet, so hot and swollen.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a finger across her bud and her hips jerked. \u201cMichael\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had meant this only for ye. I had meant to try and play the gentleman, but it seems I cannot.\u201d His hand moved away from her and began working at the fall of his breeches. \u201cI mus\u2019 have ye.\u201d</p><p>She watched him from half-closed eyes. She should protest, should tell him they must go inside and talk about why he\u2019d looked so desolate after meeting Bran, but she found she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She simply couldn\u2019t deny him when he needed her.</p><p>He drew himself out and her gaze dropped. He was fully erect, the veins standing out around the stem of his penis, the head ruddy and round.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, and took one of her legs and wrapped it around his waist.</p><p>This brought his hips close to hers and she felt him rubbing against her\u2014just a bit too high.</p><p>She moaned in frustration.</p><p>\u201cHush, darlin\u2019,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll make it all better, I promise. Jus\u2019...\u201d He caught her other leg and she found herself braced against the wall, both of her legs wrapped about his waist now.</p><p>He had his hands on her bottom and was holding her full weight. She felt quite safe, but more importantly, his penis was now at the right height.</p><p>\u201cPut me where ye need me, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She reached between them and grasped him, conscious of his muttered curse as she did so. She couldn\u2019t help a quick stroke up and down. He was so hard, so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cSilence...,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait any longer. She put him at her entrance, biting her lip at his heavy heat. It felt so good\u2014so right. For a moment she stilled. Would she ever be able to recover from this height if he walked away from her someday? She felt as if she were giving a part of herself. Something that could never be taken back again.</p><p>He twisted and shoved and began to breach her and she looked up as he did.</p><p>Michael\u2014her Michael\u2014was watching her, his nostrils flared, his lips drawn back from his teeth.</p><p>She held his fierce gaze as she reached up and traced his cheek. \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>He expelled his breath in a gust as he pulled out of her nearly all the way and then slammed back in. His pace was fast, nearly frantic and she held onto his shoulders and fought to keep from wailing.</p><p>Oh, God, he was so powerful! She watched him. A bead of sweat dripped down the side of his face, his lips curled back with his exertion. She wanted to kiss him, to embrace him and tell him he was everything to her, but all she could do was hold on and try not to fall apart when the explosion came.</p><p>For it was fierce\u2014as fierce as he. A burning, ripping tide of pleasure nearly as violent as it was wonderful. She felt as if her world was tossed up in the air and came down completely re-pieced. This was earth-shattering.</p><p>This was love.</p><p>She gasped at the realization and watched as it took him, as well. His head arched back and he shouted as he came, his body jerking against hers. He was magnificent, he awed her, but she felt a pang of melancholy. What did this act mean to him\u2014if it meant anything at all?</p><p>He laid his head against her shoulder, gasping as he caught his breath, and at first she didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Then the words rang too clear. \u201cHe betrayed me, m\u2019love. Bran betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>A great chest appeared before Clever John, as long as a horse and nearly as tall. When he lifted the lid he found gold coins, long strands of pearls as big as his thumb, and sparkling gems of every description. For a moment he merely stared in wonder. Then, belatedly, he remembered Tamara. He raised his head to thank her, but the girl was gone. Clever John stood alone in his garden with all the riches in the world. Only a single orange feather floated gracefully on the wind....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>\u201cWe took out four o\u2019 the Vicar\u2019s stills in Whitechapel,\u201d Harry said to Mick late that afternoon. \u201cAnd we toppled one o\u2019 \u2019is wagons fair full o\u2019 gin barrels.\u201d</p><p>Bert, lounging against the wall, grunted. \u201cThat were a pretty sight to see. Gin spillin\u2019 everywhere and poor sods runnin\u2019 to lap it up out o\u2019 the channel in the middle o\u2019 the street afore the soldiers came to drive them away.\u201d</p><p>Mick winced. He\u2019d never had any sympathy for those who made and sold gin, but the thought of gin drinkers actually trying to drink spilled gin out of a foul channel was grotesque. \u201cWhat soldiers?\u201d</p><p>Harry scratched his head. \u201cThere\u2019ve been soldiers patrollin\u2019 St. Giles, like, in the last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Mick frowned. Soldiers didn\u2019t just turn up out of the blue. Someone ordered them. Someone sent them. \u201cWho commands them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Trevillion,\u201d Bert said.</p><p>\u201cAnd who gives him his orders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we \u2019aven\u2019t found out,\u201d Harry admitted. \u201cNo one seems to know. But Trevillion\u2019s a right prick. Strict about arrestin\u2019 any gin sellers \u2019e finds, though they be mostly old bawds.\u201d</p><p>Mick snorted. \u201cThe Vicar must not like that.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled. \u201cNaw, \u2019e don\u2019t, and that\u2019s a fact. \u2019Is men \u2019ave been arrested, as well.\u201d</p><p>Mick leaned back in his chair, considering. The Vicar might be feeling harried by this Trevillion, but he\u2019d dealt with soldiers before\u2014most often by bribing them. They wouldn\u2019t stop him for long.</p><p>He let the chair legs thump down. \u201cYe\u2019ve done well, lads. But I\u2019ve one more job for ye and it\u2019s an important one.\u201d Mick looked both men in the eye. \u201cI need ye to guard Mrs. Hollingbrook and Mary\u2014with yer lives.\u201d</p><p>Harry and Bert exchanged cautious glances.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut where will ye be, Mick?\u201d</p><p>Mick set his jaw and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to London to put Bran on a ship to the farthest corner o\u2019 the globe. And then I\u2019m goin\u2019 to kill the Vicar.\u201d</p><p>Bert\u2019s hairy eyebrows drew together. \u201cCan\u2019t ye send someone else to do the deed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is somethin\u2019 that must be done properly,\u201d Mick said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>Harry licked his lips nervously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran said that the Vicar won\u2019t stop until he kills Mrs. Hollingbrook or me Mary Darlin\u2019, and I believe him.\u201d</p><p>Bert hawked as if to spit and then glanced about the orderly study and thought better of it. \u201c \u2019E was a fuckin\u2019 traitor was Bran. Can ye trust anythin\u2019 \u2019e says now? Per\u2019aps it\u2019s some type o\u2019 trap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mick studied the papers on his desk without seeing them. Bran had been pale and sweaty\u2014sick with remorse, if Mick was any judge. \u201cHe betrayed us all, aye, but in this, I believe, he spoke the truth. He has no love for the Vicar now, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019. Fionnula died by the man\u2019s order, mind.\u201d</p><p>Both Harry and Bert looked troubled at that reminder.</p><p>But it was Harry who spoke for both of them. \u201cYe can count on us, Mick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mick said quietly, \u201cbecause I\u2019m trustin\u2019 me most precious possessions to ye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight ye are, then,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re upstairs,\u201d Mick said, \u201cin the nursery. I don\u2019t want ye to let them out o\u2019 yer sight once I\u2019ve gone, d\u2019ye understand? I\u2019ll leave tonight after supper.\u201d</p><p>The big man nodded and stumped out, followed by Bert.</p><p>Mick sighed and studied the papers in front of him. With Bran gone and both Harry and Bert occupied guarding his lasses, getting into the Vicar\u2019s house was going to be a delicate matter. He leaned back in his chair to think.</p><p>By the time Mick left the study it was evening and he had a plan that should prove effective. But he was still mulling over the problem of a lack of men he could truly trust when he entered the dining room.</p> <p>Silence was already seated and for a moment all thoughts of his raid disappeared. He remembered her insistence that he tell her about Bran, her worried concern when she heard that he\u2019d been betrayed. She soothed his soul, this woman.</p><p>She wore a light green dress he\u2019d had made for her, and the sight brought him a deep satisfaction. The dress was more modest than he would\u2019ve liked\u2014she\u2019d wrapped a lace fichu over her shoulders and tucked it into the low neckline\u2014but he\u2019d provided it for her and she\u2019d worn it. His eyes narrowed, studying the pretty picture she made sitting at his table. He\u2019d have to order more gowns. Several morning dresses and at least one more elegant gown she could wear to the opera.</p><p>She smiled suddenly, the sight bringing a rush of warmth to his heart. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Should I be nervous?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair and sat across from her. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 on the gowns I\u2019ll have made for ye.\u201d</p><p>The smile remained on her face, but her eyes somehow looked sad. \u201cAre you? Then you think I\u2019ll be living with you for some time?\u201d</p><p>He froze in the act of lifting his wineglass. \u201cD\u2019ye have any doubt?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed the matter and I don\u2019t know your mind. You are an extremely hard man to read, Mr. Rivers.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of wine while he considered her words. She hadn\u2019t said she was against living with him, simply that she hadn\u2019t known his mind.</p><p>\u201cI do wish ye to stay,\u201d he said slowly, setting his glass down. \u201cI can give ye many fine gowns\u2014rooms full, if it\u2019s yer wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite generous of you,\u201d she said in a gentle voice.</p><p>He looked at her sharply. There seemed to be some subtext of this conversation that he was missing. \u201cYe can live here wi\u2019 little Mary Darlin\u2019 and do as ye wish with yer days. I\u2019ll buy ye a carriage and there\u2019s the garden to tend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. Pushing. She was always pushing him. From this afternoon\u2019s argument over Bran to this now. He\u2019d already let her in, already offered her his house and himself. \u201cWhat more do ye want? It\u2019s more than yer husband provided for ye, ye must admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cbut William married me.\u201d</p> <p>His head reared back as if she\u2019d struck him in the face. He started to say something more, but Mrs. Bittner and the maids entered at that moment with their dinner.</p><p>He waited until the servants left, thinking hard on his reply.</p><p>When the door at last shut, he said, \u201cI do not wish to quarrel wi\u2019 ye on the memory o\u2019 yer husband. I know he meant much to ye.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf ye wish for somethin\u2019 more from me,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cbooks or clothin\u2019 or even a lady\u2019s maid, ye have but to ask. I\u2019ll fulfill yer every wish to the best o\u2019 me ability.\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking the sadness in her eyes now. \u201cYes, I know that, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll be the mistress o\u2019 Windward House. I\u2019ll place it in yer hands to do wi\u2019 as ye like.\u201d He felt a rising panic, a desperation that he\u2019d never encountered before. \u201cI\u2019ll come to see ye as often as I\u2019m able, perhaps three or four days o\u2019 the week.\u201d</p><p>She set her fork down very carefully. \u201cYou do not intend to live here permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe know that\u2019s impossible.\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cMe business is in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the business of pirating.\u201d</p><p>He stared, confused and angry. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will continue to rob people for your living,\u201d she said. Her face was so still it might\u2019ve been made from carved marble, but her sweet hazel eyes seemed to burn.</p><p>Burn like his mam\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t give her what she needed. Couldn\u2019t prove himself worthy.</p><p>He lifted his head proudly. He\u2019d not simper and whine for something she wouldn\u2019t give. \u201cAye, I\u2019m a pirate. I\u2019ve never hidden the fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve never hidden your sins, have you, Michael?\u201d Her lips were thinned, her face strained. \u201cI had hoped, though, that now with Mary Darling and myself in your life, you might consider retiring. For us. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I changed enough for ye?\u201d He laughed, short and hard. \u201cWhere d\u2019ye think the money comes from to pay for this house, the food we eat, the clothes upon yer back? From piratin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need your money, Michael.\u201d She shrugged and looked around his fine dining room. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice, but it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe riches might not be necessary for ye, but \u2019tis for me,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in the gutter, mind, and I won\u2019t go back there, not even for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no threat that you\u2019ll go back to the gutter,\u201d she said and finally her voice rose. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your throne room. You could live like a king off the treasures in there. You could live off your shipbuilding business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he was already shaking his head, the specter of his starving childhood flapping tattered wings before his eyes. Even with his shipbuilding business there was not enough money. There was never enough money. \u201cNo, ye don\u2019t understand. Ye can\u2019t understand. The money\u2014me piratin\u2019\u2014is all that I am. \u2019Tis me power. I can\u2019t simply give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Your pirating is based on robbing people like my husband!\u201d she shouted, rising from the table. \u201cHave you any idea the suffering you inflict on innocents?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMost are far from innocent, no matter your pretty illusions.\u201d</p><p>She braced her arms on the table, leaning over it toward him. \u201cWilliam was innocent, I was innocent. William would\u2019ve gone to prison had I not come to you. Don\u2019t pretend that what you do is without victims, for I know otherwise. You hurt us, Michael, hurt us badly. I cannot live with a man who chooses to inflict harm on others for his business.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, so passionate, so angry. He wanted to bend her over the table and settle this argument in the most basic way a man can with a woman.</p><p>Instead he inhaled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head as if to steady her emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye want me to do?\u201d he asked, controlling his voice with difficulty.</p><p>Her head rose and she looked him in the eye, his brave Silence. \u201cBecome the man I know you can be. Be a father to Mary. Be a husband to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll cut me bollocks off, will ye?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cMake me half a man, bent to your will? Have me sippin\u2019 tea with me pinky in the air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you ever drink tea, pinky or not. I want you to do something far simpler. Far easier. Just stop. Please, please stop pirating, Michael. For me. We could live here together. Be married and have a family. Don\u2019t you see? Everything is within our grasp. All you have to do is choose. Choose me.\u201d</p><p>His chest grew cold. It might seem easy to her, but his money\u2014his pirating\u2014was the only thing he had to guard himself against want. Against starvation. Pirating had saved him when he was abandoned, fed him when he\u2019d had no food, given him a life and a future when his had been destroyed. His mother might abandon him, Bran might betray him, even Silence might someday leave him, but at least he still had pirating. At least he had the money.</p><p>His money was his strength. Not even for this woman would he make himself weak.</p><p>He looked into her lovely, determined face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze a moment more and he thought he saw despair in her eyes.</p><p>Then she turned and left the room.</p><p>THE TEARS HAD dried on Silence\u2019s cheeks by the time Michael came to her room that night. She watched from the bed as he laid an assortment of knives and a pistol on her dresser and began to arm himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stilled as if he hadn\u2019t known she was awake. \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 Bran back to London and then I\u2019ve some business to be attendin\u2019 to. It won\u2019t take long. Harry and Bert\u2019ll guard ye and Mary here until I return.\u201d</p><p>It was just before midnight. If he left now and rode to London, he would be about his \u201cbusiness\u201d for most of what remained of the night. He probably wouldn\u2019t return until well past daybreak tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat business?\u201d</p><p>He paused for a fraction of a second\u2014if she hadn\u2019t been watching him she\u2019d wouldn\u2019t have seen it\u2014then he shook his head once and Silence realized he wasn\u2019t going to tell her.</p><p>Her heart shrank.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave without sayin\u2019 me farewells.\u201d He strode to the bed with a small knife in his hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve somethin\u2019 for ye.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and then at the knife, blinking sleepily. Did he expect her to become a pirate, too?</p><p>\u201cYe need to know how to defend yerself\u2014defend Mary Darlin\u2019, too.\u201d His voice was gentle. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll show ye.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say that Harry and Bert would have to be dead if it came down to her defending Mary Darling herself, but then he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Silence got out of the bed and stood before him in her chemise.</p><p>\u201cYe want to jab, quick and sharp like,\u201d he instructed. \u201cDon\u2019t swipe, for yer knife is easily tangled that way.\u201d</p><p>He demonstrated a lightning fast blow.</p><p>Silence looked at him dubiously. \u201cI\u2019m not that quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe will be with practice,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll bring back padded jackets and ye can learn how to use the knife on me.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou want me to stab you with a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cYe need to know how to kill a man.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, folding her arms. She felt cold. \u201cEven if you show me how, I won\u2019t ever do that.\u201d</p><p>He set his lips. \u201cThen maim him. Thrust for the eyes, the throat, and the belly. That\u2019ll back off even the most insane o\u2019 men.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Was the Vicar insane? She supposed he must be to pursue Michael so blindly. To send someone to kill a woman with vitriol. If it meant protecting Mary Darling from such a beast, she would learn how to wield a knife.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Michael said, offering her the knife. \u201cFeel the weight. That\u2019s Spanish, that is, made by a fine swordsmith.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t ask where he\u2019d gotten the deadly little knife. She took the dagger and saw that it was rather pretty. The blade had been engraved with flowers of all things. The hilt was curved and fitted her palm perfectly. She weighed it. The dagger was heavy for its size.</p><p>Michael stood in back of her and wrapped his right arm around her to hold her hand and show her how to thrust the dagger. With his left he held her by the waist and prompted her movements. After several minutes Silence was panting, but Michael was not even breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cYe can keep it in a pocket under yer skirts or in yer garter,\u201d he said.</p><p>Silence wrinkled her nose. \u201cWon\u2019t it rub?\u201d</p> <p>His eyelids drooped. \u201cIt\u2019d better not. I wouldn\u2019t want yer tender skin chafed for the world.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms, the dagger falling to the floor, and looked up at him. His black eyes were weary and she could see worry for her in his face. The blue-black stubble of his beard shadowed his jaw and his wide, sensuous lips were slightly parted. She reached up to stroke through his hair, feeling the locks curling around her fingers in welcome. He hadn\u2019t told her what his business was in London, but she knew by his refusal to answer her question that it was something to do with his pirating\u2014something dangerous. What if he were wounded\u2014or worse, killed tonight? She might never see him again.</p><p>The thought sent an awful tremor through her belly. A world without Michael in it would be utterly dismal. Even if she lived apart from him, she wanted\u2014always\u2014to know that he was somewhere.</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and brushed her lips over his warm mouth, tasting the wine they\u2019d drunk at dinner.</p><p>She heard him mutter a curse, then he was sweeping her into his arms and carrying her to the bed, placing her gently there.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he whispered as he leaned over her, supported on one arm. \u201cWhy must ye be the one that haunts me dreams? I\u2019ve seen ye weepin\u2019 night after bloody night since the day I sent ye from me palace with yer dress half undone. If I had it to do over again, I\u2019d cut me own right hand off rather than hurt ye so. Will ye never be able to forgive me, Silence love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have,\u201d she replied, cradling his cheek in her hand. \u201cLong, long ago.\u201d</p><p>And it was true. She understood now the man he\u2019d been that day\u2014and the man he was today. The two men were the same\u2014her Michael, cruel and gentle, autocratic and kind. If she loved him for his best parts, then she must in some way love him for his worst as well.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019.\u201d He skimmed his warm lips over her cheekbone, down to her jaw.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she whispered, longing, hoping. \u201cCan you not\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He turned his head, laying his cheek against hers. \u201cLet us not argue.\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed past the thickness in her throat. They\u2019d already been over this at dinner and come to an impasse: he refused to give up his pirating. There was no more to say on the matter\u2014he was right: discussing it now would only lead to an argument and she didn\u2019t want that just before he went into danger.</p><p>So she smiled\u2014or tried to at least, with lips that trembled\u2014and stroked her fingers through his beautiful hair. \u201cWill you lie with me, Michael O\u2019Connor?\u201d</p><p>He rose to look at her and she thought she saw something close to love in his black eyes. \u201cIf I were at death\u2019s door I\u2019d stand and come to you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d love this man for the rest of her life. Silence sat up and drew her chemise over her head, baring herself entirely to him. Then she lay down and opened her arms. \u201cCome to me then.\u201d</p><p>He needed no further urging. He took her mouth like the marauding pirate he was. She opened gladly, accepting him, catching his tongue and sucking it. He growled and laid himself flat on her, pinning her to the bed. The feel of his coat and breeches against her bare skin was exotic. She wriggled a little, enjoying the friction on her thighs and belly, trying to push the coming sorrow from her mind. She couldn\u2019t change him, after all, only Michael himself could do that. If he refused to act, then she must accept that fact.</p><p>Accept and try to recover from the grief.</p><p>But he was moving lower now, going from one nipple to the other, licking and gently biting. She grasped the sheets in her hands, gasping at his fierce lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cSpread yer legs for me now, sweetin\u2019,\u201d he rasped as he sat back on his knees to unfasten his fall.</p> <p>She complied, widening her thighs, watching him prepare himself for her.</p><p>He palmed his thick erection. \u201cWill ye be wantin\u2019 this now, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she whispered. She wanted to engrave the sight of him thus, about to make love to her, in her mind.</p><p>He nodded and taking her by the hips pulled her toward him. He settled her bottom in his lap and pushed the tip of his cock down to rub at her entrance.</p><p>She whimpered from the pleasure, the anticipation of what was coming next: joining her body with Michael\u2019s. Submitting to him.</p><p>Slowly, slowly he inserted himself in her. The angle was extreme, but because of it, his penis seemed to slide against something sensitive inside her. She felt herself already beginning to break apart\u2014and he wasn\u2019t even all the way in.</p><p>\u201cIs it sweet, m\u2019darlin\u2019?\u201d he asked, panting.</p><p>She only sighed an answer\u2014the act of speaking seemed too difficult.</p><p>Suddenly he was over her, his weight pressing her into the mattress, his cock sinking to the hilt in her. He was over her, in her, powerful and male. \u201cAnswer, m\u2019love. Is it what ye want?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she knew well what he really asked. She raised her eyelids languidly as he stroked out and then into her again, his penis rubbing against sensitive flesh, his body dominating hers. \u201cYes, it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d he asked, face flushed, mouth grim. \u201cDoes this meet wi\u2019 yer pleasure?\u201d</p><p>He twisted his hips, grinding his pelvis against her, his hips widening her legs until she was completely open, completely vulnerable.</p><p>She swallowed, awash in a sea of pleasure, close to tears. \u201cYou know it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, good,\u201d he breathed as his great chest rose and fell faster. \u201cFor I cannot imagine a thing more sweet than me cock in yer cunny. This is everythin\u2019 good and right in the world. This is what ye and I were made for.\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears, for he was telling her that he cared for her\u2014as much as he was able.</p><p>\u201cIs it enough?\u201d he rasped, his strokes growing swifter, his cock grinding against her clitoris.</p><p>She closed her eyes, drowning in his lovemaking, pushing everything else aside.</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it enough?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes with an enormous effort and smiled up at him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened at her words and he roared, still pistoning in and out of her. The feel of his loss of control, the rush of emotion made her come as well, sudden and hard. A warm bubble expanded inside her, reaching her belly, her chest, her limbs and her fingers, until she shook with love and fulfillment.</p><p>Until she thought she might die of ecstasy and sorrow.</p><p>He collapsed on her, panting, and the rough abrasion of his coat on her tender nipples sent an aftershock to her center.</p><p>\u201cThank ye,\u201d he said, stroking her hair. \u201cThank ye.\u201d</p><p>But she turned her head away, afraid he would see the grief gathering in her eyes.</p><p>In a moment more he got up from her and set himself to rights as she lay there, her damp body cooling in the night air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back by luncheon tomorrow, m\u2019love,\u201d he murmured and bent to kiss her mouth.</p><p>She summoned a smile, the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done in her life, but she didn\u2019t want him to remember her sad with grief.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAre ye all right?\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows, saying lightly, \u201cYour lovemaking can be quite devastating.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and she stared at him greedily, trying to memorize the sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear yer scent on me body tonight,\u201d he said wickedly. \u201cAnd every time I smell it I\u2019ll know yer waitin\u2019 here for me.\u201d</p><p>He turned then and left the room, his stride brisk.</p><p>Silence lay there, feeling the seep of his semen from her body, and counted to one hundred.</p><p>Then she got up and washed quickly. She dressed in the plain brown gown she\u2019d had on when he\u2019d come for her at Caire House\u2014so long ago it seemed now. There was very little to gather\u2014the Spanish dagger and some things of Mary\u2019s. She hesitated over the little book with the courageous sailors, but in the end she took that, as well. He\u2019d meant it for Mary, after all.</p><p>She made one quick trip to Michael\u2019s room and then opened the door to the corridor\u2014and found Harry dozing in a chair. She\u2019d only taken one step when his eyelids rose.</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 for a midnight stroll, are ye?\u201d he asked amiably, but she wasn\u2019t fooled. Harry was eyeing the small bag she carried her things in.</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m going home, Harry.\u201d</p><p>THE DAWN WAS just breaking when Mick rode up the lane to Windward House, weary in both mind and body. He\u2019d found a ship for Bran easily enough\u2014bound for the West Indies, a long voyage. The boy had said never a word to him all the long way to London. He\u2019d seemed beaten in both mind and body and Mick hadn\u2019t the heart to try and talk to him.</p><p>Putting Bran on that ship had been the last thing that had gone simply. Through bribery, guile, and sheer ruthlessness Mick had been able to enter the Vicar\u2019s house\u2014only to find Charlie Grady gone. Either the man had been warned or his damned luck had held out. Mick had been forced to slink away and hope for another opportunity to strike. So it was with a sense of welcome relief that he caught sight of the house.</p><p>He pulled his nag to a halt and sat just looking at it a moment. The early sun made the brick glow pinkish-orange. The green shoots around the foundation had lengthened and grown yellow buds. Soon the daffodils would bloom. Mick smiled tiredly. How he looked forward to showing Mary Darling the pretty flowers when they bloomed. He and the baby would pick a posy for Silence and present it to her and then the three of them would sit down to luncheon or tea or some other meal and he would listen as Silence chided him about his food being too rich while he tempted her with some exotic dainty.</p><p>God, it was good to be home.</p><p>Mick rode around the back and impatiently threw the reins to a sleepy groom. He went in through the kitchens, waving to Bittner and Mrs. Bittner, enjoying their morning tea. Lad, who\u2019d been dozing by the hearth, stood and wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d Bittner called as Mick strode past, but Mick didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He took the stairs two at a time and then paused at the top. Where was Harry? Damn it, if Harry or Bert were sleeping, he\u2019d dock them their portion of the next haul.</p><p>Mick burst into Silence\u2019s bedroom in a rush, only to pull up short when he saw that the bed was empty. He went through the connecting door to find that his room was empty as well. Only a pair of stockings were laid neatly on his pillow.</p><p>Mick stood a moment, staring at the stockings, an awful foreboding crawling up his spine. Slowly he picked them up. They were of different sizes, the heel of one completely wrong. He recognized them as the stockings Silence had knit in the carriage all the way from her sister\u2019s house. They hadn\u2019t been done when they\u2019d arrived at Windward House, but now they obviously were, folded neatly as if they were a present.</p><p>For a moment Mick held the ugly stockings in his hand, his mind blank. With an effort he made his legs move, climbed up the stairs to the next floor, and checked the nursery.</p><p>A maid slept in the bed next to Mary\u2019s empty cot.</p><p>Mick shook her awake roughly. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>The girl rubbed her eyes. \u201cThey went away in the night wi\u2019 Mr. Harry and Mr. Bert, sir.\u201d</p><p>But Mick was already turning away, dazed, disbelieving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d left him. Silence had left him and taken Mary Darling with her.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Well now Clever John had everything he\u2019d ever wished for: a large and prosperous kingdom, an invincible army to defend his lands, and a treasure chest that never could be emptied. He was awash in wealth and good fortune. Kings and princes sent their daughters, seeking a match with the powerful King Clever John. But no matter how lovely the princess, Clever John merely turned his head aside, his gaze searching the skies for the glimpse of a rainbow wing....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p> <p>Caire House in London was even more opulent than Lord Caire\u2019s country estate. A week later Silence sat in one of the \u201clesser\u201d sitting rooms in the fashionable town house, almost too afraid to move. All around her were elegant furnishings, fragile bric-a-brac, and plush carpets and drapes. Actually, she thought with a pang, the richness of the rooms reminded her a bit of Michael\u2019s palace.</p><p>Except everything was terribly tasteful here.</p><p>She watched as Mary Darling played with a stack of wooden bricks that the housekeeper had found for her. The sight should\u2019ve brought Silence joy: a happy, healthy baby innocently playing. But nothing seemed to bring her joy anymore. Silence sighed, propping her chin in her hand. What was the matter with her? She\u2019d lived well enough, contentedly enough, before Michael. Could she not do so again?</p><p>A maid entered the sitting room. \u201cWould you like some tea, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Silence pasted on a smile. \u201cTea would be lovely. And could you make a pot for Mr. Harry and Mr. Bert, too, please?\u201d</p> <p>The little maid blushed and rolled her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ve already had two pots of tea this morning. Cook is spoiling them something awful.\u201d</p><p>One corner of Silence\u2019s mouth curled up at the thought of Harry and Bert wheedling treats from the female servants in the kitchen. Both Harry and Bert guarded her now, as well as a half dozen of Michael\u2019s crew. The men had simply appeared the morning after Silence had knocked on the door of Temperance\u2019s London home. She was lucky, since neither Caire nor Temperance were in residence, that the housekeeper knew her by sight.</p><p>Silence twitched at a thread on her old brown dress. Apparently Michael had moved quickly to safeguard her and Mary Darling when he found them gone. Silence was grateful, if a little guilty, to have the guards. She could just see one of Michael\u2019s pirates lounging outside the sitting room as the door swung closed behind the maid.</p><p>Harry had given Silence strict orders to stay inside Caire House until Michael dealt with the Vicar. Such a restriction might\u2019ve made her restless in the past, but no longer. She couldn\u2019t seem to find the enthusiasm to do much of anything.</p><p>There was a commotion from the front hallway and Mary Darling looked up.</p><p>Temperance swept into the sitting room a moment later. \u201cGoodness! Where did all these brutish men come from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re guards.\u201d Silence wrinkled her nose apologetically. \u201cMichael insisted on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should hope so!\u201d Temperance crossed to Silence and gave her a hug before pulling back and looking in her face. \u201cHow are you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip to keep it from trembling. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sorry to have taken over your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>The maid returned with a tray of tea and Temperance waved for her to put it on a low table in front of the settee.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Perkins,\u201d Temperance said as she sat on the settee beside Silence. She waited for the maid to leave before turning to her sister. \u201cI take it that you\u2019re not safe yet.\u201d</p><p>Silence grimaced. \u201cNo. Not while the Vicar is still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me to the subject of how you left Caire\u2019s country estate,\u201d Temperance said.</p> <p>Silence winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe spent hours searching for you and Mary Darling,\u201d Temperance said in a much too calm voice as she poured the tea. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until one of the maids confessed that she\u2019d glanced out a window and saw you walking away with a \u2018tall, handsome as sin man,\u2019 that we realized what had happened. I was all for traveling at once to London, but Caire persuaded me to wait a bit.\u201d Temperance gave her a jaundiced look. \u201cI think he rather feared what I might do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant to make you worry so,\u201d Silence said in a rush. \u201cI did leave you a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a very helpful one,\u201d Temperance said darkly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that he asked me to come with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you did.\u201d Temperance sighed and sat back with her dish of tea. \u201cWithout a thought for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Silence said in a small voice.</p><p>Temperance took a sip. \u201cHe\u2019s bad, you know that, and yet you went off with him without a backward glance.\u201d</p><p>Silence took her cup of tea and held it near her face without drinking. She inhaled the fragrant steam. \u201cI\u2019ve left him.\u201d</p><p>Temperance set down her cup. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Silence only nodded.</p><p>Temperance eyed her. \u201cWell... I suppose that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Silence closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Temperance asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave him exactly?\u201d</p><p>Silence shook her head, staring at her steaming cup of tea, trying to put into words the decision that had seemed so cut and dried a week ago. \u201cHe won\u2019t quit his pirating, even though he has enough money, from what I can see, to live happily the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked him to quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Temperance picked up her teacup again, murmuring over its rim, \u201cthat by itself would be enough for me to leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it?\u201d Silence traced the edge of her teacup, considering. \u201cI think it would\u2019ve been enough for me as well\u2014before I went to live with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow...\u201d Silence leaned forward, looking at her sister intently, trying to convey what was in her heart. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer just a pirate to me. He\u2019s Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, notorious river pirate, but he\u2019s also Michael, a man who loves butterflies. Who told me about the worst parts of his childhood. Who took me to the opera and sat as if entranced by the music. Who sings to his daughter. Don\u2019t you see? I might be fascinated by Charming Mickey, but I could never love him. Michael I can\u2014I do\u2014love.\u201d</p><p>Temperance gave her a level look. \u201cEven though he\u2019s a pirate?\u201d</p><p>Silence met her gaze, lifting her chin. \u201cYes. I hate how he makes his money, but I love Michael.\u201d</p><p>Temperance sighed. \u201cThen why did you leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever truly see me as an equal, a partner, someone to trust and love for all time. Someone who is a person in her own right. Someone worthy of making a commitment\u2014changing\u2014for.\u201d Silence\u2019s lips trembled. \u201cI wanted him to choose a life with me instead of a life of pirating\u2014and he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Silence gasped, trying to smile and failing. \u201cI love him, Temperance, and I\u2019ve been trying to see how I can stop, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way.\u201d</p><p>Her elder sister sighed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t really think that love is something that one can control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like the love I thought I had with William,\u201d Silence said, closing her eyes. \u201cThat was sweet and light\u2014a girl\u2019s fantasy of love. This... this is violent and emotional, and sometimes I think I don\u2019t even like him. How can that be?\u201d She looked at her sister. \u201cHow can I love him and dislike him at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Temperance said. \u201cBut sometimes I feel the same way about Caire. Sometimes he says or does things that drive me to distraction. Yet I know always that I love him and that he loves me.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cDoes O\u2019Connor love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d Silence paused to pat at her eyes with a handkerchief. \u201cI think he does, though he\u2019s never said so. You don\u2019t truly know him. He can be very gentle with Mary Darling and me. He showed me how to eat an artichoke, and he has a big ugly dog that adores him and follows him everywhere, and... and...\u201d</p><p>Well, she certainly couldn\u2019t tell her sister about Michael\u2019s lovemaking! Silence blushed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHe has been kind to Mary Darling?\u201d Temperance asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes! So loving and kind, you would not credit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you have left Mary with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of it,\u201d Silence said quietly. \u201cHe is a good father. But he refuses to give up his pirating. What sort of life would that be for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Temperance said, \u201cthat settles it, doesn\u2019t it? You did the right thing in taking her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Silence asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Temperance smiled tenderly. \u201cI know it feels like the end of the world now, but you\u2019ll get over him, I know you will. And when you do, we\u2019ll find a good man for you. One who loves you and can take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Voices came from outside the hallway. Michael\u2019s guard was saying something loud and angry.</p><p>Temperance sighed and stood. \u201cI suppose your guardians are shooing away one of my afternoon visitors. I\u2019d better go see who it is.\u201d</p><p>Silence nodded absently. Her sister\u2019s earlier words were kind, but they were useless. For while her head knew she had done the right thing in leaving Michael, her heart was not so sure. Her heart didn\u2019t want a good man at all.</p><p>Her heart wanted a pirate.</p><p>MICK LOUNGED ON his throne, a near-empty bottle of brandy beside him, and watched as silver and gold coins fell from his fingers. There were shillings and guineas, but also coins from shores far distant from England. Coins with eagles stamped on them, coins with the heads of princes and kings, coins with symbols he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>When he was a lad he\u2019d found it fascinating that there were so many kinds of money in the world. Sailors often brought back souvenir coins from the countries they\u2019d made port in, and Mick would find the coins as he hurriedly searched the ships he raided. He\u2019d take them and later examine the coins, turning them over in his fingers, looking at the strange marks, the stylized profiles. And then he would place the coins in a carved ivory box he\u2019d stolen from a ship\u2019s captain.</p><p>The ivory box was open on Mick\u2019s knee as he stirred the coins within. It might be a king\u2019s ransom that he had in the box. He didn\u2019t know since he\u2019d never bothered counting the coins. He held a particularly large one up, as big across as the length of his thumb. Mary Darling would like it, he thought. She\u2019d grab for it and all the other coins in his box like a greedy magpie.</p><p>But Mary Darling wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>With a sudden movement, he swatted the ivory box off his knee. Coins flew, sliding across the marble floor and the box itself hit the tiles with a crack, breaking in half. Lad, who had been sleeping beside the throne, jumped up, his tail between his legs and ran to hide behind a statue of a Roman matron.</p><p>Pepper cleared his throat at the door behind the throne.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out, Pepper,\u201d Mick said without heat. All he felt was a vast, terrible weariness.</p><p>He\u2019d left Windward House a week ago. He couldn\u2019t stand the place without Silence in it. Every room reminded him of her. He kept turning, thinking he\u2019d seen her out of the corner of his eye. He\u2019d been going mad, so he\u2019d come here to his palace and commenced drinking. But no matter how drunk he got, he still dreamed of her tear-stained face every night. She\u2019d left him, but she continued to haunt him, damn her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would retreat, sir, as I did the other times you ordered me from this room,\u201d Pepper said precisely, \u201cbut I feel I should tell you that your men are worried.\u201d</p><p>Mick laid his head in his hand. \u201cWhat the fuck do they have to be worried about?\u201d</p><p>Pepper cleared his throat again. \u201cThey wish to know when you\u2019ll go raiding again and if you\u2019ll be returning to the dining room for supper in the near future.\u201d</p><p>Mick felt a headache start in his right temple, dull and throbbing. \u201cTell them it\u2019s none o\u2019 their damned business when I want to raid and where I take me supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d Pepper said. He sounded nervous. Mick couldn\u2019t remember Pepper ever sounding nervous. \u201cThen might we discuss your various investments? The price of gold has tripled in the last five months.

Bugger the silver plate, damn the jewels, the furs and silks, the china, the books, the spices and tea, and the furniture!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but...,\u201d Pepper stuttered.</p> <p>\u201cFuck all me money!\u201d Mick bellowed. \u201cIt don\u2019t bloody matter anymore!\u201d</p><p>He kicked a barrel, tipping it over and sending cloves spilling across the floor. Lad whimpered from behind the Roman matron.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Pepper began.</p><p>The door to the throne room opened and Bob thrust his head around it, looking wary. \u201cLetter.\u201d</p><p>He ducked back, holding the paper out from behind the door.</p><p>Pepper hurried over and took it, breaking the seal. Something fluttered to the floor.</p> <p>Mick casually knocked over a China vase, watching with bitter satisfaction as it shattered to pieces in the cloves.</p><p>\u201cSir, you need to look at this.\u201d Pepper was suddenly by his side, trembling, but proffering the missive bravely.</p><p>Mick took it and glanced down.</p><p>I have them. Meet me where your mother lies.</p><p>He was still staring down when Pepper shoved something into his hand. Mick looked at it and froze. It was a tiny lock of hair, as inky black as his own.</p><p>The guards he\u2019d sent, Harry and Bert, all of them, they\u2019d all failed.</p><p>\u201cSaddle a horse for me,\u201d Mick whispered. His chest had constricted with dread.</p><p>Pepper ran from the room.</p> <p>Mick strode to his bedroom, splashed water on his face and neck and made sure he carried his knives on him. He took up a pistol, loaded it, and wrapped a wide belt about his waist to stick it in. Then he ran down the stairs. He couldn\u2019t let fear rule him. They were alive and well.</p><p>And if they weren\u2019t, he\u2019d rain bloody retribution down on the Vicar.</p><p>The horse was out front and he took the reins without word to the boy waiting there.</p><p>Pepper stood anxiously by. \u201cWon\u2019t you take some of the men with you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mick said and wheeled the horse around. \u201cThis\u2019s between me and the fuckin\u2019 Vicar.\u201d</p><p>He urged the horse into a canter, weaving in and out of the late afternoon bustle. He made it to St. Giles-in-the-Fields church in under five minutes, dismounted, and tied the nag to the fence.</p><p>Inside, the churchyard was quiet. He turned a corner of the graveyard path and saw the Vicar standing by Mam\u2019s grave. No one else was in sight. Which didn\u2019t mean his usual guards weren\u2019t about.</p><p>Mick was on him in another two strides. He grabbed the older man\u2019s neck cloth. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>The Vicar stared up at him with his ruined face and laughed. \u201cOh, Mickey boy, how should I know?\u201d</p><p>Mick took the lock of hair from his pocket and thrust it into the Vicar\u2019s face. \u201cWhose is this then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s,\u201d Charlie Grady said softly. \u201cShe gave me a lock of her hair when we were courting and naturally I kept it all these years. Your mother had that same black curly hair as you and the little lassie.\u201d He winked. \u201cYou ought to\u2019ve introduced me to my granddaughter, Mickey. Now I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to be doing it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see ye in hell first,\u201d Mick breathed, shoving the other man away.</p><p>Gravel crunched beneath a booted foot behind him.</p><p>Mickey whirled, but the Vicar had succeeded in distracting him just long enough. He was a fraction too slow. A split second too late. The knife was knocked from his hand and his arms were seized. Suddenly there were soldiers everywhere in the graveyard.</p><p>Charlie tutted. \u201cOh, I have no doubt we\u2019re both destined for hell, son, but I fancy you\u2019ll see it afore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck ye,\u201d Mick spat.</p><p>An officer in a white wig limped up to Mick. \u201cMickey O\u2019Connor I arrest you on the charge of piracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cARRESTED!\u201d SILENCE LAID down the knife she\u2019d been using to butter a piece of bread for Mary Darling\u2019s tea. They were in the lesser sitting room of Caire\u2019s town house, the sun shining brightly on the silver tea set in front of Silence. She stared dazedly at Bert and Harry, both men solemn and standing shoulder-to-shoulder in solidarity as they brought her the horrible news. \u201cBut how? Michael\u2019s been an outlaw for most of his life. How was he captured?\u201d</p><p>Harry looked uneasily at Bert and then squared his shoulders. \u201c \u2019Twere a trap, ma\u2019am, laid by the Vicar \u2019imself. Word is, the Vicar said \u2019e \u2019ad ye and the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d Michael had rushed to save them and in doing so had walked into a trap. She swallowed and stared at the bread on a pretty china plate. The sight made her stomach roil.</p><p>\u201cYou must leave as soon as possible,\u201d Temperance said from the doorway. She was out of breath as if she\u2019d run from wherever in the town house that she\u2019d heard the news. \u201cIf the Vicar has Mickey O\u2019Connor, he\u2019ll come after you next. I\u2019ve ordered the carriage made ready. We can have you out of London before dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Silence stood. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving London.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked uneasy. \u201cThe Vicar\u2019ll still be lookin\u2019 for ye and the babe, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that,\u201d Silence said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take all possible precautions, but I\u2019ll not leave while Michael is in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut dearest,\u201d Temperance protested, her sherry-brown eyes wide and distressed.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t ask it of me.\u201d Silence looked at her sister and drew a quavering breath. \u201cYou know full well what the likely outcome of a trial will be.\u201d</p><p>Temperance closed her eyes, but didn\u2019t reply. She didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>The punishment for piracy was hanging.</p><p>\u201cTO THE COMPLETION of the brand-new Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children!\u201d Lady Hero raised her small glass of sherry high.</p><p>\u201cHere! Here!\u201d Around the cramped meeting room the members of the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children obediently raised their wineglasses in toast.</p><p>Isabel Beckinhall smiled and sipped her wine. Who\u2019d have thought over a month ago when she\u2019d attended her first meeting that the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate would turn out to be so much fun?</p><p>She selected a scone from the tray Mary Whitsun was carefully holding and looked at Lady Hero. \u201cWhen are the children due to move into the new home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week, we hope,\u201d Lady Hero said, still flushing prettily from the triumph of her toast. \u201cLady Caire and I examined the new home just yesterday, before she left town, but I think Mr. Makepeace will have to do a final inspection as well with one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go, my lady?\u201d Lady Penelope asked, her pretty face creased into a confused frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow with Lord Griffin,\u201d Lady Hero said. The color which had begun to recede from her face rushed back. \u201cHe\u2019s to show me the ruins at his country estates to the north.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret, who was Lord Griffin\u2019s sister and thus Lady Hero\u2019s sister-in-law, snorted delicately. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing he\u2019ll show you at his estate, I\u2019ll wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegs!\u201d Lady Hero\u2019s shocked gasp was rather ruined by a giggle. \u201cHow much of that sherry have you drunk?\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret squinted at her glass. \u201cThis\u2019s only my second glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wine is very good,\u201d Miss Greaves broke in tactfully. \u201cSimply perfect to toast our success with.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero shot her a grateful look.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Isabel murmured as she took another scone\u2014really it was the orphan girls\u2019 best pastry. \u201cThe sherry is delicious, but it\u2019s a pity you were forced to smuggle it past Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly smuggle it,\u201d Lady Hero said with dignity.</p><p>\u201cBut you did have it packaged in a box with no markings,\u201d Lady Margaret pointed out.</p><p>Lady Hero wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Mr. Makepeace is so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDour,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>\u201cStern,\u201d Lady Phoebe piped up from where she sat next to her sister.</p><p>\u201cReligious.\u201d Lady Penelope shuddered.</p><p>\u201cAnd rather lacking in a sense of humor,\u201d Isabel added to round the whole thing off. She bit into her tender scone.</p><p>\u201cBut he is quite handsome nevertheless,\u201d Miss Greaves said judiciously.</p><p>Lady Penelope tossed her head. \u201cHandsome if you like severe, unyielding gentlemen.\u201d The faint curl of her lip indicated that she, at least, did not. \u201cI do think that the home is sadly lacking in a female influence now that Mrs. Hollingbrook has abandoned her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a female influence!\u201d Lady Margaret said somewhat indignantly.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not here all the time,\u201d Lady Penelope pointed out. \u201c \u2019Tisn\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the female servants?\u201d Lady Isabel asked, amused. She herself did not subscribe to the idea that Mr. Makepeace needed female help\u2014or any help, for that matter\u2014to run the home, but she was fascinated by Lady Penelope\u2019s prejudiced and somewhat convoluted thought process.</p><p>\u201cServants,\u201d Lady Penelope sniffed and that seemed to be her entire argument.</p><p>Isabel hid a smile and popped the last bite of her scone into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIn any case,\u201d Lady Hero said hastily, \u201cwe need someone to meet Mr. Makepeace at the new home the day after tomorrow. Someone tactful, charming, and able to deal with Mr. Makepeace\u2019s er... sternness.\u201d Her eyes met Isabel\u2019s and Lady Hero smiled sweetly\u2014and rather craftily. \u201cYou\u2019d be quite perfect, Lady Beckinhall.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The years went by and Clever John grew old. His once black hair turned snowy white, his broad shoulders stooped, and his strong hand shook. And in all those years he never again saw Tamara. Finally the day came when he knew his time on earth was drawing to a close. He sat on his grand golden throne in his wonderful castle, with his treasure chest beside him overflowing with jewels but he had eyes for none of that. Instead he examined five brightly colored feathers upon his lap....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>Mick O\u2019Connor lay on a bed of straw in Newgate Prison\u2019s castle\u2014the strongest cell in the prison\u2014and contemplated his life.</p><p>The life that very well might end on the morn tomorrow.</p><p>After a month of prison he had an escape plan, of course, for he was a man who\u2019d spent a lifetime planning. The castle was near break-proof, and a dozen of Captain Trevillion\u2019s dragoons had been assigned to guard him. They were immune to bribes, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t see visitors. Pepper had made several calls, helping Mick to set his affairs in order, and it\u2019d been child\u2019s play to smuggle out an escape plan to the rest of his men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mick had calculated that the best time to make an escape was just before the execution cart reached the gallows tomorrow morning. There would be crowds of people, families out for a holiday, hawkers selling meat pies and fruit, and of course scores of soldiers. But the soldiers would be hampered by the crowds. If his men made a commotion just as the cart neared Tyburn gallows, they would draw the attention of both the soldiers and the crowds. During the confusion a second group of his men might be able to rescue him.</p><p>It was a long shot escape plan, but it was his only chance. He\u2019d gambled before on his life and won. Why not now, as well?</p><p>On the whole Mick had few, if any, regrets. He didn\u2019t regret pirating, he didn\u2019t regret the men he\u2019d killed in his life, and he sure as bloody hell didn\u2019t regret throwing vitriol into Charlie\u2019s face and saving himself from a buggering at the age of thirteen.</p><p>There was one thing he did wish he could change, though. He regretted that he hadn\u2019t found the proper words to make Silence stay with him. He should\u2019ve lied, should\u2019ve told her he\u2019d give up the pirating, give up the palace, give up anything she damned well wanted if she\u2019d only stay with him. Hell, maybe he should\u2019ve really given up the pirating for her. He wanted only to sit at a table with her and feed her exotic foods that made her beautiful hazel eyes widen with wonder. And later he\u2019d make her eyes widen in other ways. He\u2019d caress her creamy skin and tell her\u2014</p> <p>Tell her what?</p><p>Jaysus. He\u2019d tell her that he loved her. That she was the only woman save his poor mam that he\u2019d truly loved.</p><p>Mick squeezed his eyes shut, ignoring the laughter, the moaning, and the cries that were Newgate Prison. If he had it to do over again he would\u2019ve chained her to his bed and made sweet love to Silence until she admitted that she couldn\u2019t live without him.</p><p>Because God knew that he couldn\u2019t live without her.</p><p>He\u2019d stay with her always, perhaps even marry her, if she insisted. He chuckled to himself to think of Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor domesticated. And if they someday had a babe\u2014</p> <p>His eyes suddenly snapped open on that thought.</p><p>He\u2019d never considered\u2014because he\u2019d always thought she\u2019d stay, damn it\u2014that she might be with his child.</p><p>Jaysus! Mick jumped to his feet, pacing the length of his leg irons, barely six feet. If Silence were with child, she\u2019d be frantic. He didn\u2019t give a damn or not if his child were born a bastard, but she would be deeply ashamed. She\u2019d be an outcast. Her family loved her, but they were very strict. Would they toss her into the street? Where would she find the funds to care for both Mary Darling and a new babe? Dear God.</p><p>\u201cThinkin\u2019 on that noose?\u201d the gaoler, a dirty little man who was puffed with pride that he was guarding the notorious Mickey O\u2019Connor asked. Of course the real guarding was done by the dragoons, but that didn\u2019t bother the gaoler. His ugly face appeared at the barred window on the cell door, fingering his own neck. \u201cThe last one we \u2019ung \u2019ad \u2019is neck stretched near a foot.\u201d</p><p>Mick ignored the man, going to sit on the clean straw pallet he\u2019d purchased at an exorbitant sum, his head in his hands. After a bit he no longer heard the gaoler\u2019s voice, so the man must\u2019ve grown weary of taunting a prisoner who wouldn\u2019t respond.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter to Mick. All that mattered was Silence and what he might\u2019ve done to her.</p> <p>Mick closed his eyes again and did something he hadn\u2019t done since he was thirteen.</p><p>He prayed.</p><p>THE STREETS WERE still dark, the dawn only an hour away when Silence made her way to Newgate prison.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019s barmy,\u201d Bert growled. \u201cSneakin\u2019 about the streets in the dark. \u2019Imself will \u2019ave our \u2019eads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think even \u2019Imself can \u2019ave us punished, where \u2019e\u2019s now,\u201d Harry said soberly.</p><p>\u201cI need to see him, Bert,\u201d Silence said. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I love him. I can\u2019t just let him go to his\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut herself off with a choked sob. No, not now. There would be time afterward to weep and wail. Now she had to be strong for Michael. She hadn\u2019t seen him in over month. Winter and Temperance hadn\u2019t wanted her to visit him in Newgate Prison during the trial. Only with his death sentence had they relented, admitting that it might be best for her to see him one last time.</p><p>Harry patted her shoulder awkwardly. \u201cWe do understand, ma\u2019am. Like a fairy story it is, yer love for \u2019Imself. And we\u2019ll make sure ye see \u2019im afore...\u201d</p> <p>Harry broke off and gulped.</p><p>The two guards might be stoic about it, but Silence had seen their faces on the day the news of Michael\u2019s sentence had been announced. Harry\u2019s big ugly face had sagged into permanent lines of sorrow, while Bert had surreptitiously swiped at his eyes when he thought no one was looking.</p><p>The men kept close to her as they neared the prison. Silence held the lantern so they might have their hands free should anything untoward happen.</p><p>Silence shivered and pulled her cloak more firmly about herself as Newgate Prison loomed suddenly in the dark, hulking and ominous. The ancient gate spanned the road, but next to it was the slightly newer prison. A guard with a light was dozing by the big double doors. He woke and glared at them as they approached.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re \u2019ere to see Mickey O\u2019Connor,\u201d Harry said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s to see the pirate,\u201d the guard snapped.</p><p>Harry tossed a coin at the man, which the guard caught easily.</p><p>The guard looked at the coin and sneered. \u201cA shillin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Bert bristled. \u201cA shillin\u2019s quite fair!\u201d</p><p>The guard started to say something more, but Harry sighed and gave him another coin.</p><p>This time the guard smiled. \u201cYe\u2019ll be gettin\u2019 closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ighway robbery is what this is!\u201d Bert exploded, advancing on the guard.</p><p>\u201cAll right! All right!\u201d the guard said, backing a step. \u201cI\u2019ll let ye see \u2019im, but I\u2019m makin\u2019 a special deal jus\u2019 for ye.\u201d</p><p>Bert muttered something rather offensive about \u201cdeals\u201d and the guard\u2019s parentage, but fortunately the guard didn\u2019t seem to hear. He opened the big door, leading them inside a gloomy corridor. It was still dark and so the inmates of this place were mostly asleep. But here and there could be heard the sounds of humanity: sighs, mumbles, snores, and coughs.</p><p>The guard led them through a courtyard with sleeping forms and up a series of steps. On the upper level were barred cells to one side of the corridor and a locked door at the end. The guard opened it to reveal a small anteroom and a dozen or more armed soldiers, standing or dozing in chairs.</p><p>The guard went to the cell door at the back of the room and scraped his huge key ring across the window bars, making them clang. He unlocked the door, stepped inside, peering, and shouted, \u201cOi! O\u2019Connor! Ye got\u2014\u201d</p><p>An arm shot out from the dark cell and caught the guard by the throat. Michael stepped forward, still holding the guard, and looked at Silence.</p><p>His inky hair was down about his shoulders. He was in his shirtsleeves, despite the chill of the prison, the fine lace at neck and sleeves incongruent with the surroundings. Thick chains rattled when he moved for he had leg irons on both feet. But his cell was surprisingly clean and furnished with not only a pallet, but a chair and table with quills, ink, and papers on it as well. A small brazier glowed near the pallet. Michael looked, on the whole, as arrogant and strong as the first time she\u2019d seen him sitting on his throne. Not even prison, it seemed, could daunt Michael O\u2019Connor.</p><p>Something inside Silence rejoiced at his brutal power.</p><p>His black eyes glittered in the lantern light. \u201cBert, take this vermin and fetch the prison chaplain.\u201d</p><p>He let go of the guard who fell back several steps, gasping. The soldiers had risen at the interruption and one approached. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then, Mickey?\u201d</p><p>Michael shook his head. \u201cNothin\u2019 that need bother ye, George. Seems I\u2019ve visitors.\u201d</p><p>George the soldier frowned heavily. \u201cThe captain won\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here to care, is he?\u201d Michael asked him, but his eyes were on Silence. Absently he twisted off the moonstone ring from his finger and tossed it to the guard.</p><p>He was looking at her as if trying to memorize her every feature.</p><p>She bit the inside of her cheek to keep from sobbing at the thought. She must be strong.</p><p>\u201cI prayed ye\u2019d come,\u201d Michael said low to her.</p><p>The soldier, apparently satisfied that Michael wasn\u2019t trying to escape, pocketed the ring, and stepped back along with Harry.</p><p>Silence came closer. \u201cIs there any way to get you out of here?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI could have Harry and Bert bring the rest of your men.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head a faint smile on his lips. \u201cNo one escapes from this part o\u2019 Newgate Prison, darlin\u2019. Besides, they fear me so much that they\u2019ve brought in dragoons to guard me. A rescue try would only lead to me men dyin\u2019 without me gettin\u2019 free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord.\u201d Silence stared at him, not knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bit o\u2019 time to think in here, love, and I wonder if ye might do me a very great favor,\u201d Michael said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou know I will.\u201d Silence searched his dear face.</p><p>His wide mouth quirked. \u201cThere ye go, agreein\u2019 to things without knowin\u2019 what they might be.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and touched his shoulder with a trembling hand. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you, Michael, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept stay with me?\u201d He tried to step toward her, but the leg irons brought him up short.</p><p>She shook her head, a tear slipping past her lashes. All her arguments and fears meant nothing now. \u201cThat... that was different. If you had only\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laid a warm finger against her lips. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m sorry I spoke o\u2019 it. I didn\u2019t mean to aggrieve ye.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, mutely, her eyes swimming with tears despite her best efforts.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered and pulled her into his warm arms. He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry, I made a mess o\u2019 things at Windward House. I should\u2019ve known ye and the babe were all I need\u2014all I\u2019ll ever need. The money, the piratin\u2019 they were jus\u2019 shields I was holdin\u2019 on to, fearful-like. \u2019Twasn\u2019t me best decision, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d She closed her eyes, willing the tears back, for his honest admission made her love him even more. If only this wasn\u2019t their last moment together. If only they had weeks and years to discover everything about each other...</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve somethin\u2019 important to say to ye now,\u201d Michael rumbled softly. \u201cWhat I meant to say when ye came in was that the very great favor I\u2019d like o\u2019 ye is for ye to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and stared at him in shock. \u201cIs that why you sent for the prison chaplain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He smiled, dimples slashing into his olive cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019ll do most anythin\u2019 if the money\u2019s right. Not what I\u2019d like for ye, love, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Will ye marry me, Silence Hollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>It was silly but her heart leaped at his words, even here. She didn\u2019t even hesitate to think. \u201cYes, oh, yes, I\u2019ll marry you, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and kissed her fast and hard just as Bert came back with the guard. An elderly man with a shock of white hair and a bleary expression from having been woken up accompanied them.</p><p>The chaplain turned out to have a lovely, resonant voice. Silence stood in a dazed and delighted fog and in a few minutes found herself married to Michael.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Michael said, taking his ruby and gold ring off his little finger and putting it on her thumb. \u201cThat\u2019s to remember me by.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared down at the worn gold and the rich beauty of the dark red ruby. It was his first ring, she remembered, touched by his gesture. The ring was a little big, so she wrapped a piece of thread about it to hold it on her thumb. She had to blink hard then because it all seemed like both a dream and a nightmare. They were married\u2014and he\u2019d be hung by the neck in only a few hours.</p><p>Michael beckoned George over and had a whispered consultation with him at the end of which he gave the rest of his rings to the soldier.</p><p>\u201cOnly for an hour, mind,\u201d George said.</p><p>Michael held out his hand to Silence. \u201cSpend a little time with me, Mrs. O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p> <p>She went into his arms gladly, and the cell door was locked behind her.</p><p>She sighed, laying her head on his warm chest, listening to the strong beat of his heart. He stroked his hand through her hair, his touch gentle, but she felt the tremble in his fingers. Suddenly it was too much, the sentence, the marriage, all the years after tomorrow without him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d She closed her eyes, despair overwhelming her. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know if I can live if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His voice was firm, commanding. He took her face between his big palms and looked into her eyes. His black eyes were fierce even in the dim light. \u201cAye, ye can live. For me, for Mary Darlin\u2019, for yerself. Promise me that, love. Promise me, ye\u2019ll live, and ye\u2019ll thrive, no matter what comes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. She couldn\u2019t be weak when he needed her strong. \u201cYes. Yes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s me girl.\u201d He brushed his lips over her forehead, breathing the words. \u201cThat\u2019s me love.\u201d</p><p>The tears overflowed, coursing down her cheeks. \u201cI love you, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He laid his cheek against hers. \u201cI\u2019ve written out a will for Pepper, me man o\u2019 business.\u201d</p><p>She tried to protest, but he pulled back to look her in the eye. His face was grave. \u201cHush, now, love, ye must listen to me words. I\u2019ve left instructions for Pepper to manage yer money for ye. I think it best ye and Mary go to live at Windward House. It\u2019s quiet there and secret. Me servants and Harry and Bert can take care of ye. I\u2019m hopin\u2019 that the Vicar might see it in himself to be satisfied once I\u2019ve gone, but we can\u2019t take that chance. I\u2019ve made arrangements for me men to guard ye until Charlie Grady is dead. And that, too, I\u2019ve arranged for.\u201d</p><p>Silence stared at him, stunned. He\u2019d planned it all, made sure she and Mary Darling would be well taken care of after his death. He hadn\u2019t said he loved her, but his actions spoke much louder than any words could.</p><p>\u201cSilence?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo me plans meet with yer approval?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gulped. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cI want ye to be happy, me love. Ye and Mary Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She choked then, unable to speak. What words were beautiful enough, sublime enough to convey all her heart wanted to express in this moment? They simply didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>His eyes were sad as he watched her as if he knew somehow what she was thinking. \u201cCome lie with me, m\u2019love.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him close.</p><p>But when Michael began to tug her toward the back of the cell and a pallet, she clutched at his shirt. \u201cWhat if they look? The soldiers?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI paid them well not to peek. Bert and Harry will make sure o\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>Silence glanced over her shoulder and saw that all the men outside had moved away from the barred window in the door. The only light in the cell came from the little window, leaving the back wall\u2014and a pallet against it\u2014in near darkness.</p> <p>She looked back at Michael, peering in the gloom.</p><p>His voice was deep as he squeezed her hand. \u201cCome and be me wife.\u201d</p><p>He was her husband now.</p><p>Despite the sorrow of this place, despite what would happen all too soon, that small fact lit a spark of joy within Silence. She was married to Michael O\u2019Connor.</p><p>She was married to the man she loved.</p><p>And since time was short, she lifted up on tiptoes and drew his face down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cI love your voice and your Irish burr. I love the way you look at me just before you say something outrageous. I love the way you hold Mary Darling so tenderly. And I love that you wanted to make me your wife. I love you, Michael O\u2019Connor, I love you.\u201d</p><p>The words made him tighten his hands on her waist and pull her closer. \u201cSilence, me love. When I knew ye\u2019d left me it felt as if a chunk o\u2019 me heart had been torn from me body. Only yer presence here can stop the bleedin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened over hers and he took control of the kiss, biting at her lips, impatient and savage. She was aware that a dozen men stood only yards away, but she shoved the thought from her mind. She wouldn\u2019t let modesty keep her from showing her husband how much she loved him.</p><p>How much she would always love him.</p><p>So she took her mouth from his and skimmed it over his strong neck, tasting the salt of his skin. His hands rose to her shoulders, but he made no move to stop her. She tongued the V of his chest, revealed by his shirt, and as she did so she slid her hands to the front of his breeches where his erection was trapped. Feeling, learning in the dark she began unbuttoning his fall.</p><p>\u201cSilence?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she admonished as he had once done to her. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t say a thing.\u201d</p><p>And then she dropped to her knees.</p><p>She heard the harsh intake of his breath. He stood very still as she finished unbuttoning him and pulled his breeches and smallclothes open. She leaned forward, blind in the darkness, but she could scent his male musk. Her hands found his cock, stiff and ready, and so beautiful that she wished she could see it. She didn\u2019t have time for modesty or shyness. For slow learning. This would be the last time\u2014</p><p>But no, she would not think about that. Instead, she explored the man before her. She slid the fingers of her left hand down his shaft, memorizing each veined ridge until she reached the spot where his penis met his body. His sack was drawn up tight under his cock and she fondled it gently, feeling the stones within.</p><p>He made a muffled sound above her and she thought that perhaps he liked to be touched there. Or perhaps it was what she did with her right hand. She was squeezing gently on his thick shaft. In any case, she certainly wasn\u2019t done. If this were to be their\u2014</p><p>No, don\u2019t think about it.</p><p>She swayed forward and licked the head of his cock.</p><p>Michael went absolutely still.</p><p>His hands dropped to her hair and for a moment rested there as if stunned. Then she opened her mouth and took him inside. When she began sucking gently, his hands clenched. He tugged her hair as if to pull her away from himself. But since he was only tugging carefully, she stayed just where she was. She drew back and licked around the head of his cock. Without sight her other senses were heightened. She could taste him\u2014man and musk\u2014and beneath her tongue his skin felt warm and soft and pliable.</p><p>She kissed him and then thought to scrape her teeth gently over the tip of his penis. It jumped and he hissed softly. She smiled and took him into her mouth again. There was something terribly enticing about having such a strong man at her mercy. She was in a position of servitude, but she didn\u2019t feel servile. She felt very feminine, very sensuous as she stroked around the flange of his cock with her tongue. His hands had stopped pulling on her hair. Instead he gripped her as if unsure whether to push her away\u2014or pull her closer.</p><p>She let go of his cock head to lick leisurely along the underside of his shaft and something seemed to snap in him. He bent and picked her up by the waist. He pivoted, his chains scraping and clinking, and placed her flat on the pallet, following her down to lie on top of her. She gasped and then felt cool air on her thighs. His hands were under her skirts, caressing her thighs, trailing up until he touched her wet center. He stroked her there once and then his hand was replaced with his cock.</p><p>Someone coughed and she was suddenly aware that only a door separated them from a roomful of soldiers. He swirled the head of his cock in her moisture even as she had the thought.</p><p>She bit her lip and he began to push his way into her. It had only been a matter of a month, but she seemed to have forgotten how large he was. She held her breath as he shoved again. The sensation was so lovely, so perfect, that she was afraid she\u2019d make some betraying sound.</p><p>He paused, half in her, and adjusted her position, burrowing his arms under her legs, prying them wider.</p><p>He withdrew a tiny bit and then very deliberately pushed again with constant, relentless pressure. He breached the muscles at the entrance to her sheath and, suddenly, he was all the way inside. She felt his breath against her cheek. Felt as his chest expanded as he inhaled. She wanted this moment to stop so she could live it forever. Here, now, there was only the two of them, occupying a wonderful island apart from the rest of the world.</p><p>Then he was withdrawing, slowly, steadily. Without a sound.</p><p>She gripped his shoulders and his mouth came down on hers. His tongue swept in and he kissed her so gently she wanted to cry. How would she live without him? Without ever again feeling this intense closeness to another human being?</p><p>She\u2019d found paradise only to lose it.</p><p>Well, then she\u2019d enjoy it while she could. She wrapped her arms around him, wishing they could both be nude, but glad of what contact they had. She tasted salt tears, seeping into both their mouths, and wondered if they were hers or his. Had she brought the great Michael O\u2019Connor to tears? She bit down gently on his tongue, suckling it, holding it within herself. Perhaps if she held him hard enough he would stay with her forever.</p><p>Perhaps with this act they created eternity.</p><p>She could feel his shoulders bunch as he controlled himself, each thrust exquisitely slow and even. It was as if she\u2019d been primed just for him. Only for him. Each inch of his hard flesh burrowing into hers, each drag against her folds as he withdrew oh, so slowly, built a fire within her, burning, burning, ever hotter.</p><p>But more, he was forging a bond between them, an unbreakable iron chain that would link them together forever. This was their true marriage ceremony, more solemn, more holy than the words said over them by an old man.</p><p>She held him and breathed with him and waited for the flames to climb higher, to burn white hot. And when he reached between them and thumbed her little nub they did. They flared together. She arched into him as her core melted. The flames seemed to sear her with ecstasy, bonding them together as if they were fired within a crucible. He thrust hard, burying himself and at the same time he covered her mouth and inhaled her moan and his own.</p><p>And as her crisis took her, she saw a rainbow form from the ashes of their combined heat. A rainbow so fragile, so fine that she thought it must be real. That their lovemaking had shattered the prisons of mortal men and that they were free.</p><p>Together and free.</p><p>But all things must end eventually and so, too, did the rainbow. Silence opened her eyes, her husband still atop her, his beloved weight heavy and comforting in the dim cell.</p><p>The dawn was coming soon.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Clever John called for his cook and made a special order, and then he waited for the cherry pie to be brought to him in his throne room. His voice had grown weak with age, so he was only able to croak her name. \u201cTamara.\u201d</p><p>At once a beautiful rainbow bird flew through the window and alighted at his feet, turning into Tamara. She was as young and as lovely as she had been all those years ago when he\u2019d first seen her, but she didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>Instead her eyes were grave when she asked, \u201cWhy have you called me?\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>They came for him at dawn, just as promised, a new set of soldiers to replace the dragoons that had guarded him all night.</p><p>Mick kept his eyes on Silence even as the soldiers opened his cell door and tied his wrists in front of him. He\u2019d dressed in his best with Silence\u2019s loving help\u2014blue velvet coat and breeches, gold brocade waistcoat, and lace-trimmed shirt. He wore the stockings that Silence had knit for him\u2014crooked and sagging in places\u2014and they were the most important things on him. His fingers were barren of rings\u2014he\u2019d given them all away to spend an hour with Silence, but he\u2019d not regret that in this life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or the next.</p><p>The soldiers hustled him from the cell and along long, dank corridors until he emerged, squinting, into the morning sun.</p><p>Silence stepped from Newgate Prison behind him, trailed by Harry and Bert.</p><p>\u201cGo now,\u201d he said gently to her and nodded at Harry. Both Bert and Harry were forlorn, but from Harry\u2019s look he knew what Mick wanted.</p> <p>A public hanging was a nasty thing and she didn\u2019t need to see him kicking his heels in the air. With any luck it\u2019d not come to that. His men should rescue him in time\u2014but he wasn\u2019t about to tell Silence that. There was still the chance that his plan would fail, and he didn\u2019t want to get Silence\u2019s hopes up for naught.</p><p>She looked at him, her eyes red, but dry, and said nothing. The expression on her lovely face was enough. Not many men were so fortunate as to have the love of a woman like Silence.</p><p>He expected to see her again in another couple of hours, but if the escape attempt failed, he\u2019d die content.</p><p>Mick nodded to her as they led him toward the cart, already laden with his coffin and a chaplain. \u201cBe well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d a terrible voice said.</p> <p>The Vicar and a half dozen of his men emerged from the prison behind Silence and her two guards.</p><p>Harry began to look, but was knocked to the ground before he could fully turn. Bert backed away as two pistols aimed at his heart. In the wink of an eye Charlie had Silence, holding her by the throat as if she were a dog. She scrabbled at the fingers holding her, her eyes desperate as they met Mick\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIs this your lady fair, Mickey?\u201d the Vicar asked, his mangled face tilted grotesquely.</p><p>No. No.</p><p>Harry was on the ground, his head bleeding, but struggling to sit, so he was still conscious at least. Bert had skipped out of the way of the Vicar\u2019s henchmen, but he couldn\u2019t get near Silence with their pistols trained on him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothin\u2019 to ye,\u201d Mick said, trying to control his voice. Not now. Not now when he was trussed like a goose and helpless. \u201cLet her go, Charlie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I might,\u201d the Vicar replied. \u201cAfter I\u2019ve taught her how to properly serve me. After all, your mother\u2019s dead, Mick. I need a replacement. And I\u2019ve waited patiently since your arrest so that you might fully enjoy this moment.\u201d</p><p>Bile roiled in his stomach. Mick met Silence\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They were wide and frightened, but calmer now. \u201cI love you, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them to glare at the Vicar. \u201cAnythin\u2019. Just name yer price.\u201d</p><p>Silence threw her weight suddenly against the Vicar\u2019s grip. He stumbled under her force, but righted himself too soon, yanking her back into his terrible embrace.</p><p>Charlie smiled, a horrible lop-sided parody of a smile. \u201cI already have my price, boy. Your death and your woman. I might get my granddaughter, as well, but she\u2019ll just be a sweet bon bon. This\u201d\u2014he shook Silence by the neck\u2014\u201cthis is the meat on my table.\u201d</p><p>Mick bellowed, lunging at Charlie, but he was knocked to his knees by the soldiers surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cWill ye allow the kidnappin\u2019 o\u2019 a lady?\u201d Mick demanded of the soldiers. They\u2019d been simply standing there as if blind and deaf to the outrage being played out in front of them.</p> <p>Charlie laughed. \u201cThey will if properly paid. This lot isn\u2019t like Trevillion\u2019s dragoons\u2014they like gold in their hands, and never mind who gives it. Now, remember this as they tighten the noose around your neck, son: I\u2019ll be fucking your woman even as you\u2019re breathing your last.\u201d</p><p>And with that the Vicar motioned to his men and simply walked away. Silence gave Mick one last horrified glance, still struggling in the Vicar\u2019s grasp, and then the Vicar jerked her around.</p><p>The soldiers were manhandling Mick into the cart now. The chaplain studiously looked the other way. They\u2019d all been bribed by Charlie, there\u2019d be no help here. His men planned to rescue him at Tyburn, but if they did, no one would help Silence.</p><p>His life meant her death.</p><p>His death meant her life.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he shouted at Bert and Harry. \u201cGo tell Winter Makepeace what has happened. Tell him to take me men and get her back. Tell the crew to belay any other order. D\u2019ye understand? Nothin\u2019 stops them from rescuin\u2019 Silence!\u201d</p><p>The cart started and Mick craned his neck to see Bert helping Harry up and both men taking to their heels, Harry lagging badly. Bert had been with Mick for over five years, and had in that time served him well. But Bran had served Mick well, too\u2014until the day the boy had betrayed him. Mick was going to his death. He had no way of repaying Bert for his loyalty. What if Bert decided simply to run away? Mick would only know if his men showed up at Tyburn as originally planned.</p><p>And Silence would pay the price.</p><p>Dear God, let him hang.</p><p>The cart ride was a trip through hell. The cart rocked into Oxford Street and they were already waiting. People lined the streets, calling to him, some in sympathy, some in derision. They were three and four deep, packed as full as the street would allow. Mick stood, head held high, feet braced wide apart so he wouldn\u2019t stagger as the cart began its journey through London to Tyburn. A young girl threw a wreath of flowers into the cart at his feet and Mick stared down blindly at them. He was notorious in London, and there were those among the poor who thought him something of a hero.</p><p>A hero, he who had done naught but steal all his life.</p><p>Others heckled and threw rotting fruit and worse. He hardly noticed. Where was Silence now? God! Was the Vicar raping her, extinguishing that sweet, hopeful light in her eyes? He wanted to kill at the thought. To wreak bloody mayhem. But he was tethered like a wild animal in a cart.</p><p>They stopped at a tavern on the outskirts of London so that he might buy a last drink. And Mick did, praying as he drank that he wouldn\u2019t be rescued. Let his death be price enough for Silence. He knew what the Vicar did to women in his power. He\u2019d watched his mother weep for what the Vicar had made her do.</p><p>Let Silence live. Let her be happy.</p><p>Finally, finally, the tall Tyburn gallows came into sight, the distinctive triangle top foreboding against the gray sky. Wooden platforms had been built to one side with viewing seats, but the majority of the crowd milled about on foot. Mick saw a woman with a tray of pies on her head, steadily making her way through the mass of people. She was shadowed by a pickpocket who took advantage of her customers while they paid for the pies. A pack of boys with several dogs ran alongside the cart, shouting. Farther on, a juggler entertained a small circle, handily tossing a man\u2019s hat, an orange, a knife, and a posy of flowers into the air. He was quite good, but a group of drunken apprentices to the side were calling insults anyway.</p><p>Mick was grimly amused to see that his rescue plan would\u2019ve most likely worked. The cart had to stop again and again as the crowd pressed around it, struggling to catch a glimpse of him. Hands reached inside, pulling at his coat, his breeches. A piece of fabric from his clothes would make a nice souvenir of the day\u2014one that could later be sold to ghoulish collectors. There were soldiers to be sure, dozens on horseback, but the milling people separated the soldiers from the cart.</p><p>The cart drove right up to the gallows with no sign of his men and Mick at last breathed a sigh of relief. Perhaps they had gotten Bert\u2019s message. Perhaps even now they and Makepeace were rescuing Silence.</p><p>Dear God, he prayed so.</p><p>Mick descended the cart and was led up the gallows steps as the chaplain murmured prayers. The crowd was loud, a yammering, shouting, mass of mindless idiots.</p><p>Mick nodded to the hangman, a tall, bent figure, and handed him a guinea. The hood was put over Mick\u2019s head and his legs tied together. He felt the heavy noose drape over his shoulders and then tighten. He breathed in and out, calm and steady, his breath hot under the hood.</p><p>A lever was pulled and he dropped into nothingness.</p><p>His mouth opened wide, gasping for the air that could not enter his throat.</p><p>He spun, jerking involuntarily as stars lit in the darkness behind the hood. He was dying, his body painfully fighting the inevitable. His ears rushed with incomprehensible noise and he suddenly saw Silence\u2019s face, beautiful and as clear as day.</p><p>And then he hit the ground.</p><p>He lay there, stunned, taking deep, grateful breaths as someone loosened the noose around his neck. He didn\u2019t know if he were dead or alive until the hood was pulled from his head and he saw the Ghost of St. Giles.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are ye doin\u2019 here?\u201d Mick choked out, his throat raw.</p><p>\u201cShe needs you alive, pirate,\u201d the Ghost said in a familiar voice. He knelt to cut the ropes around Mick\u2019s legs. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking I\u2019m doing this for you. I\u2019ve sent your men ahead. Now go save Silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant bastard,\u201d Mick muttered, but the crowd was swarming and the Ghost whirled to fight off two apprentices bent on being heroes.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d shouted the Ghost.</p><p>And Mick did, simply by rolling into the crowd. His hands were still tied and he worked the little penknife he\u2019d concealed up his sleeve loose as people stumbled over him. He was kicked twice in the legs before he could cut the cords. Then he threw off the noose and looked up. A stunned walnut hawker was staring back at him and Mick reached up and pulled the man to the ground, scattering nuts everywhere. He simply shucked his velvet coat and tore the man\u2019s plain brown coat from his back. Mick had on the tattered coat in a thrice, took the man\u2019s battered tricorne for good measure, rubbed dirt on his face and white shirt, and stood.</p><p>The spectators were all looking to where the Ghost was in a mismatched fight with four soldiers.</p><p>A woman noticed him and began to open her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOi!\u201d Mick shouted. \u201cThe pirate\u2019s gettin\u2019 away over there!\u201d He pointed in the opposite direction from the Ghost.</p><p>There was a surge as the news spread through the crowd. Mick saw the Ghost fall and then get up again. Some of the crowd were still intent on him, angry for having their entertainment snatched from them. But the Ghost of St. Giles had proven himself a capable fighter more than once. As Mick watched, the Ghost dodged away, slipping back into the milling masses.</p><p>Mick drew the collar of his coat up around his cheeks and made for a mounted soldier on the edge of the crowd.</p><p>The soldier\u2019s horse was already agitated from the noise and movement of the crowd. All Mick had to do was give the soldier a good push and he tumbled from the nag.</p><p>Mick swung up in his place as the horse reared. People screamed and struggled to get away from the horse\u2019s flailing hooves. Mick kicked the nag and they were off at a cantor.</p><p>Charlie Grady lived in Whitechapel. Mick rode as fast as possible in that direction. He passed soldiers riding toward Tyburn and what was no doubt a riot now, but they didn\u2019t even look in his direction.</p><p>Mick rode hard and as he did all he saw was Silence\u2019s face. A bell began to toll. It had been at least three hours since the Vicar had taken her.</p><p>Jaysus, was she alive?</p><p>SILENCE SAT AS still as if she were in the presence of a viper. Except the man in front of her was much more dangerous than any snake.</p><p>She must survive.</p><p>Even if Michael no longer lived, even if this human snake attacked her, she must find a way to learn to live. Mary Darling depended on her and it seemed that Mr. Grady was quite obsessed with Mary.</p><p>Or rather he was obsessed with anyone who had any connection to Michael.</p><p>They were in an untidy bedroom that still bore the faint sour smell of the sickroom. From that and the feminine accessories on the dressing table she surmised that this must have been Michael\u2019s mother\u2019s room.</p><p>The room she\u2019d died in.</p><p>Silence shivered and then froze as Charlie Grady swung his hideous face toward her at the movement. He sat in a chair across from her, his left hand constantly rolling two grimy dice. The left side of his head was almost entirely bald, only a few long strands of gray hair grew here and there. His ear was gone as was most of the left side of his nose. The skin that remained was burned a dark, leathery brown and rippled quite disgustingly. Had she seen him in the street, she would\u2019ve turned aside in sympathy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Here, she was frozen in fear.</p><p>Both of their chairs sat in front of a small, unlit hearth. They\u2019d been here, sitting like this for nearly three hours as much as she was able to judge\u2014there was no clock in the room. And that entire time Mr. Grady had been speaking in a low monotone. Any person entering would think he spoke to her, but in reality she might have been another chair. Charlie Grady wasn\u2019t really talking to her.</p><p>He was addressing his absent son.</p><p>\u201cThought you could turn her against me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said, only one half of his mouth truly moving. \u201cBut I soon showed you the error of that! She was ever loyal to me, was my Grace. Loyal though you tried to take her away. Ha! Didn\u2019t work, did it my lad? Now I have your woman and soon I\u2019ll have your little lass. Won\u2019t be able to laugh then, will you, Mickey O\u2019Connor? Not when I\u2019ve fucked your woman and turned her out into the streets.\u201d</p> <p>It was rather strange to sit here and listen to years of hatred pour from this man\u2019s mouth. She might find it in herself to pity him\u2014were it not for the fact that he quite often in his monologue made reference to what he intended to do to her. Outside the door was a room where half a dozen of Charlie Grady\u2019s men lounged. He\u2019d informed her with chilling indifference that if she tried to escape he\u2019d give her to them to be abused.</p><p>A bell began to toll.</p><p>Mr. Grady cocked his head, listening. \u201cRight, then, he\u2019s hanging now. Shall we see how lucky you are?\u201d</p><p>Silence felt a thrill of horror at his words. Was he finally addressing her? She watched in morbid fascination as he threw his grimy dice upon the hearth. They rolled and turned up a three and a four.</p><p>\u201cTch,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNot lucky at all, are we?\u201d</p> <p>And he stood and began loosening his breeches.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Clever John watched Tamara stick her finger in the pie. \u201cI thought of all the possible mistakes I could make in phrasing my wishes, and still I made the most fundamental one of all: I asked for the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>Tamara ate a cherry thoughtfully and nodded. \u201cYes, but I cannot help you\u2014you\u2019ve used up all your wishes.\u201d</p><p>Clever John closed his eyes wearily. \u201cThen might I ask for one of your feathers, sweet Tamara? A purple one? I shall go to the next world with a rainbow of feathers in my hand.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p> <p>Mick rode around the corner leading to Charlie Grady\u2019s street and into chaos. His pirates were attacking the house. Men were screaming and moaning, some lying on the ground dying, others fighting hand to hand with the Vicar\u2019s men pouring from the house.</p><p>Mick leaped from the horse before the animal had come to a full stop.</p><p>\u201cThrow me a knife!\u201d he yelled hoarsely at one of his men and then caught the dagger that came flying through the air.</p><p>They\u2019d arrested him.</p><p>They\u2019d kidnapped his woman.</p><p>And they\u2019d fucking hanged him.</p><p>Mick O\u2019Connor was in no mood for any who stood between him and Silence. He flung himself on the first man, grabbing his shoulder and burying the dagger high in the man\u2019s gut. His opponent\u2019s eyes widened and then Mick yanked out the bloody dagger and kicked the body aside.</p><p>The next man swung a club at him but Mick ducked and kicked him hard in the knee. The man howled as his knee broke and he went down.</p> <p>The third man took one look at Mick and simply fled.</p><p>Fine with him.</p><p>\u201cInto the house!\u201d Mick bellowed.</p><p>He charged the door, ramming his way through, and encountered men in a small entryway. Someone was fool enough to shoot a pistol. Smoke billowed and Mick felt a stinging burn on his face. He grabbed the pistol from the shooter and used it to club him over the head.</p><p>\u201cSearch every room!\u201d Mick ordered his men.</p><p>He mounted the stairs three at a time, his heart pounding in his chest. If she weren\u2019t here, if this were a ruse, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. Mick had no other idea of where the Vicar would\u2019ve taken Silence.</p><p>At the top of the stairs was a room with a round table and several chairs. One lone guard was still left and he rushed Mick from above. Mick shifted to the side, pushing the man as he did so, tumbling him head over heels down the stairs.</p><p>Mick continued up and saw that two doors were off the outer room. He shoved open the first and saw it was a bedroom, plain and neat and entirely empty. The second door was locked and he kicked it open, the door ricocheting off the wall with a crack.</p><p>Inside he saw Silence.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>She sat, weeping, on the rug next to the hearth. Her hair straggling down the side of her neck, the bodice of her dress was ripped to the waist, and the sweet swells of her breasts were revealed over her stays.</p><p>There was a reddened mark across her tender breast.</p><p>Dear God, he\u2019d come too late.</p><p>WHEN MICHAEL FIRST came through the door Silence thought she\u2019d gone mad. The horrible events of the last hours must have weakened her mind, mocking her with visions of her husband.</p><p>Then he opened his mouth and spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His voice was a thready rasp, but she didn\u2019t mind. She was up off the wretched hearthrug in a thrice, rushing into his arms, uncaring of her state or the dirt and powder burns on his face. She wrapped her arms around him and simply held on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, his lips tracing her cheek so softly. \u201cPlease forgive me, Silence. I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 sorry.\u201d</p><p>She murmured and tried to capture his lips with hers, but he pulled back and she saw with wonder that there were tears in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him for ye, never fear. Jus\u2019... Jus\u2019 don\u2019t give up on us. I\u2019ll take care o\u2019 ye while ye heal. And ye will heal, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, bemused. \u201cWhatever are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vicar\u201d\u2014he grit his teeth and exhaled hard\u2014\u201c hurt ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She took his hand and led him around the bed, pointing without looking. She\u2019d taken one look afterward and it had been quite enough.</p><p>She swallowed and whispered, \u201cHe tried to... to... well, you know, and I waited until he thought I was quite cowed and then I took the dagger you gave me from my stocking and I killed him.\u201d</p><p>She gestured again to the Vicar\u2019s body, lying prone on the floor by the bed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t aim for his eyes or his belly like you told me to. I just stabbed him in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe...\u201d Michael looked, bemused, between her and the body. \u201cStabbed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim. Yes.\u201d She wrapped her arms about herself. Charlie Grady was his father after all. Perhaps Michael was in shock or grief. Perhaps\u2014</p><p>Michael threw back his head and roared with laughter. \u201cYe killed the Vicar o\u2019 Whitechapel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes,\u201d she replied, nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cThe most dangerous, the most insane bastard in all o\u2019 London, and ye, ye, Silence, killed him with one blow.\u201d Michael wiped away tears of laughter.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hard and fast and for a moment all she did was revel in the feel of his still-smiling lips on hers.</p><p>Then he led her away from the body. \u201cGod, how I admire ye. Yer so calm and sweet and such a ferocious little thing all at the same time. But why were ye weepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Michael.\u201d She laid the palm of her hand on his cheek. \u201cI was weeping for you. I thought you hanged and dead. How did you escape from the gallows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ghost o\u2019 St. Giles.\u201d He gave her a thoughtful look. \u201cHe came and cut the rope as I was swingin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She shut her eyes, suddenly feeling ill at how close a thing it must\u2019ve been.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye, me darlin\u2019? What happened here all this time since he took ye from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought me here and talked and talked for hours, it seemed. And then.\u201d She gulped. \u201cHe came for me. But the Vicar never got very far with what he intended. I was not raped.\u201d A sudden, rather awful thought assailed her. \u201cYou do believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A wide grin spread across his handsome face. \u201cDarlin\u2019, I don\u2019t believe in God, but I believe in ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael, that\u2019s blasphemy,\u201d she chided, even as she couldn\u2019t keep the corners of her own mouth from turning up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, very serious now, \u201cthat\u2019s love. I hear ye, I believe ye, and I love ye, me darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him mutely, too afraid to ask.</p><p>But he nodded as he drew her into his arms. \u201cI love ye, Silence O\u2019Connor, with all me black heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your heart is all that black.\u201d She smiled though tears sparkled in her eyes again. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and pressed her mouth to his, simply glad to feel his warmth, his breath. But then a thought occurred to her. She pulled back to look him in the face urgently. \u201cBut the soldiers will be looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He took off the ragged coat he wore and wrapped it about her, concealing her ripped bodice, then he took her hand and pulled her toward the door. Outside in the anteroom they found Bert just coming up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThe Vicar\u2019s men \u2019ave all been thrashed,\u201d Bert panted, \u201cbut one o\u2019 our crew says there\u2019s soldiers comin\u2019 this way.\u201d</p><p>Mick nodded. \u201cThe Vicar\u2019s corpse is in the bedroom. Have a couple o\u2019 me men get it. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll borrow this.\u201d He took Bert\u2019s gray wig, leaving Bert\u2019s bald head naked.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been condemned to death,\u201d Silence cried. \u201cWon\u2019t we have to flee the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we might,\u201d he said with a sly smile. He plopped Bert\u2019s wig on his head. \u201cWere it not for Mr. Rivers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said as he led her out the door and down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCharming Mickey O\u2019Connor is goin\u2019 to meet a tragic death. It\u2019ll have to be at the palace, I fear, more\u2019s the shame, but it won\u2019t be believed otherwise. I\u2019ll have Harry and Bert take the Vicar\u2019s body there and set it alight. Set the whole palace alight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll find a burned body afterward and think it\u2019s yours?\u201d Silence shivered at the gruesome thought. \u201cBut where will we go?\u201d</p><p>He stopped just inside the door and caught both her hands. \u201cI\u2019m to be a respectable, Englishman shipbuilder now, Mr. Michael Rivers. And you, my love will be Mrs. Rivers. We\u2019ll send for Mary Darling and live in Windward House in Greenwich.\u201d</p><p>His accent changed as he told her the news, becoming once again the thoroughly English Mr. Rivers.</p><p>Silence gazed up at him, and whispered. \u201cSo you\u2019ll give up your pirating? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cSomeone I love\u2014and respect\u2014told me that I could be a better man than a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d He was giving her everything she\u2019d asked for.</p><p>He was giving her a family.</p><p>They were out on the street now and Silence saw with relief that Harry was among Michael\u2019s men. He had a great bandage about his head, but he seemed well enough. He\u2019d be able to wheedle any number of sweets out of female servants looking like a wounded hero.</p><p>Silence hurriedly put her hair back up as best she could with her remaining pins, while Michael shrugged on one of his men\u2019s coat.</p><p>Bert led over a horse. Michael mounted first and Bert handed her up to sit before him. Then Bert stepped back and saluted.</p><p>Michael nodded to him and nudged the horse into a trot.</p><p>Silence looked around nervously. She could hear shouts and hoof beats in the distance. She felt at her hair. It was up off her neck, but Lord only knew what it looked like. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSteady on,\u201d Michael whispered into her hair. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re simply Mr. and Mrs. Rivers, returning home after a jaunt into London. I\u2019m just a shipbuilder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you miss your palace?\u201d she murmured anxiously. \u201cYour gold walls and marble floors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not miss a whit of it. Gold nor silks nor fancy books and statues. I can live without them all. What I cannot live without is one Silence Rivers. I love you, my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, my husband. I look forward to being just plain Mrs. Rivers, I do.\u201d She leaned back and whispered in his ear, \u201cBut perhaps you can still be Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor the notorious pirate\u2014in our bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>He winked at her as he bent to catch her lips. \u201cOh, to be sure, m\u2019love, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>There was a patter of bare feet and when Clever John opened his eyes again Tamara knelt by his side. \u201cWhy do you want my purple feather?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhat possible use could a man who has everything he\u2019s ever wished for have for a simple feather?\u201d</p><p>He reached out a hand that shook with palsy and touched her smooth cheek. \u201cThe rainbow feathers remind me of you and everything I should\u2019ve asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve wished for you and only you, sweet Tamara, for I have loved you all these years and without you my wonderful riches are but bones and dust to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is true,\u201d Clever John replied sadly. \u201cI am a foolish old man who has lost everything he might\u2019ve had in this life.\u201d</p><p>But as his last words died away there was a great rushing as a powerful wind blew. Everything\u2014the kingdom, the invincible army, and the treasure chest\u2014disappeared, and Clever John found himself once again in his uncle\u2019s garden. His limbs were young and strong, his hair black once again, and Tamara stood before him, her rainbow hair shining in the dawning sun.</p><p>Clever John threw back his head and shouted with laughter. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked as he caught up Tamara by the waist and swung her joyfully around. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><p>Tamara grinned down at Clever John. \u201cYour wishes may have been used up, but mine certainly aren\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>Together they went to wake the king and tell him that the cherry thief was discovered and Clever John the new heir to the kingdom. And was Clever John sad that the kingdom by the sea was smaller and not nearly as rich as the magical one he\u2019d wished for? Oh, no, he was the happiest man alive, for he ruled his tiny kingdom by the sea with Tamara by his side.</p><p>And that, Gentle Reader, made all the difference in the world....</p><p>\u2014from Clever John</p><p>The harlequin leaned against a brick wall, panting. He thought he might be nearly to St. Giles, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. They\u2019d run him through the streets like a bull to slaughter.</p><p>Blood was seeping from a wound on his thigh, soaking into his tunic and leggings, growing cold and making him shiver in the late spring air. He looked up, trying to judge the time, but since the sun was hiding sullenly behind gray clouds, it was impossible.</p><p>It had taken him almost an hour to lose the rabid crowd. They\u2019d been promised a hanging. They\u2019d dressed in their Sunday best and gone out cheerfully to Tyburn for a festive spectacle and at the very last minute they\u2019d been denied their entertainment.</p><p>Natural, then, that their ire had turned to him, the source of their disappointment.</p><p>The harlequin straightened away from the wall, testing his feet. The street swirled and dipped sickeningly and he abruptly emptied his stomach into the channel. Must\u2019ve gotten knocked on the head. Strange how blurry everything seemed.</p> <p>Somewhere in his mind a tiny alarm bell began sounding.</p><p>He tried walking but found he had to grip the wall to stay upright. A further few feet and even that support failed. Blackness was crowding in on his vision and he fell to his knees. He heard the clip-clop of hoof beats nearby, and slowly, agonizingly turned his head. A carriage was turning the corner.</p><p>His sword dropped from his fist, clattering to the cobblestones. And then his cheek was on the cold, filthy stones. His eyes were slits as he watched the carriage draw nearer.</p><p>His last thought before the darkness took him was how surprised they would be when they discovered who he was.</p><p>Then Winter Makepeace, the Ghost of St. Giles, fell headlong into the enveloping black. </p> </body></html>"]
